Due to ongoing delays in securing the necessary funds, AMTE Power – an Oxfordshire-based developer and manufacturer of lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery cells – went into administration in December. However, FRP Advisory ran an accelerated mergers and acquisitions process and said last week that it had completed the sale of the company’s business and assets to LionVolt.
The sale enables the battery production facility to be repurposed for producing LionVolt’s 3D technology and includes the transfer of 20 jobs based in Thurso. AMTE Power's remaining 15 employees in Milton, England, have been made redundant.
“The acquisition by LionVolt presented the best opportunity to secure jobs and fulfil our statutory duties to creditors,” said Richard Bloomfield, director of FRP Advisory and the joint administrator of AMTE Power Plc. “The transaction follows an exhaustive sales process and search for new investment. Critically, it preserves a large number of jobs and provides a continuation of battery cell manufacturing in Scotland.”
For LionVolt, the acquisition of the battery production site brings “new complementary capabilities to the company for its next phase of growth.”
Sandeep Unnikrishnan, the CTO of LionVolt, described the transaction as a “dream scenario.”
“It helps us mature our innovative 3D battery technology quicker by leveraging the manufacturing expertise from the team in Scotland, thereby reducing time-to-market,” said Unnikrishnan.
The acquisition comes hot on the heels of LionVolt’s announcement that it is building a pilot production line at the Brainport Industries Campus (BIC) in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
LionVolt was spun off from the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) in 2020 with a mission to develop and scale its 3D solid-state thin-film battery technology. The technology is said to deliver enhanced energy density, superior cycle-life, higher charging speed, and enhanced safety compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries and be particularly suitable for wearables and electric vehicle applications.
LionVolt's batteries are made by covering billions of pillars with thin layers of functional material, creating a 3D structure with a very large surface area and very short distances between both battery electrodes. Charging and discharging times are reduced, as the lithium-ions only have to travel a short distance.
The manufacturer said this approach enables the technology to overcome two major hurdles to its commercial rollout – the conformal coating of the full battery stack and the development of scalable manufacturing tools. The creation of the micropillar arrays is reportedly able to reduce the technological challenge of conformal coating, and the open and regular structure facilitates the deposition of consecutive layers.
LionVolt said its battery configuration is fully retrofittable into existing commercial formats and a production line can be set up in a very short time. Almost 80% of the supply chain needed to build a production line can be sourced locally, according to the Dutch company.

The procurement exercises will kick off on April 9 and bids will be received for at least three months. 
The minimum capacity for PV project particitaing in the auction will be 1 MW. The tender will procure a total of 60 MW of solar projects. 
“We absolutely expect new tenders. By the end of the year, we will know the results of these auctions. Afterwards, we are considering organizing the next round of RES auctions since the Vulcanesti – Chisinau 400 kV line will be operational by the end of 2025,” Carolina Novac, secretary of state for Moldova's Energy Ministry, told pv magazine. 
The total capacity for wind projects is almost twice that for PV projects. Novac explains that the decision on capacity allocation was made considering the overlap of different incentive schemes as well as some structural reasons. 
“Firstly, we have already allocated feed-in-tariffs to 120 MW of ground-mounted PV and additionally to 15 MW of rooftop PV,” said Novac. “Secondly, we also know that wind's capacity factor, that is its energy output, is higher than the PV one. We also look at the principle of the highest efficiency for utilisation of land and, in Moldova, 98% of land is arable with some of the best soil in the world. And thirdly, wind energy delivers electricity in the evening as well, and we know that the load peak is usually the highest around dinner time.” 
The Ministry expects big renewables producers and developers to participate in the tenders. The secretary of state says the most promising bidders will be companies that are already established in Moldova, have experience in the sector, and have already kickstarted the process to obtain required permits.
Broader context
“The first-ever tenders for fixed-price power plants will allow for the construction of large wind and photovoltaic parks, reduce dependence on imported energy, decarbonize the economy, and create new jobs,” said the Moldovan government. 
The country has long been exposed to gas supply shock risks, as Russia traditionally supplied all gas consumed in Moldova via Ukraine. Last year, Moldova started its six-year-long energy sector reform program, receiving the support of international, mostly European, institutions like France's Agence Française de Développement (AFD), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also offered support.

The government is working to approve several documents in preparation for the launch of the tenders. 
“According to the timetable for the launch of the tenders, in February this year, the amendments to the Regulation on the conduct of tenders for the status of eligible large producer, the appointment of the ‘Tender Commission,' the publication of the tender documentation and, during February-March this year, its consultation with stakeholders will be approved,” said the government. 
Provided that the entire capacity allocated in the “fixed-price” support scheme is awarded following the tender procedure, the government plans to organize a single tender procedure for the 2024-2025 period to grant the status of “large eligible producer”.
“These capacities of 165 MW in total for wind and solar are allocated as a result of modeling of energy consumption, generation, availability upon the grid, and other parameters, and the goal is to have 410 MW of renewable energy capacity installed overall (both under feed-in tariffs and fixed prices),” said Novac. “After 2025, we will have the Vulcanesti – Chisinau transmission line operational and two other transmission projects in the works, so it will be possible to integrate more renewable energy.”
In 2025, the Ministry of Energy will initiate a new national power system modeling exercise to determine the capacity of renewable energy under the support schemes in line with its renewables target of 30% of the electricity mix by 2030. 
The Ministry of Energy has also developed and is promoting the draft National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, a policy document developed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union Regulation No 2018/1999 on the governance of the Energy Union.

The X1-IES series includes four models, with rated output of 3 kW to 8 kW, while the X3-IES series includes five models, with rated output power ranging from 5 kW to 15 kW.
“It supports up to 200% photovoltaic (PV) oversizing, 200% PV input, and a maximum of 20A DC input per Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT),” the company said in a statement. “This remarkable capability ensures that the system operates at peak efficiency, translating to higher yields and a more sustainable energy output.”
All of the systems use lithium-ion batteries with a nominal capacity of 5.1 kWh. The X1-IES series includes models with one to four batteries, ranging in a capacity from 5.1 kWh to 20.4 kWh. The X3-IES series includes models with two to six batteries, ranging from 10.2 kWh to 30.7 kWh of capacity.
“With a switchover time of less than 10 milliseconds, the transition from grid to backup power is virtually instantaneous,” the company said. “The system can handle an impressive 200% Emergency Power Supply (EPS) overload for up to 10 seconds and boasts a 50 A charging/discharging rate.”
All of the systems have an operating temperature of -30 C to 53 C. Users have the option to integrate safety features such as Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) and Rapid Shutdown, while all of them come with Type II Surge Protective Devices (SPD) on both AC and DC sides.
“The X1/X3-IES manages energy with its artificial intelligence-driven features,” the manufacturer said. “Smart Schedule, Intelligent Loads Management, and Smart Scene capabilities allow for control and customization, ensuring that energy is allocated and utilized efficiently in accordance with user preferences and demands.”

Its goal is to kick off production this spring with a capacity of 1 GW and eventually scale up to 2.5 GW per year.
It has ordered equipment for the thermal process steps of annealing, diffusion and PECVD from Germany’s Centrotherm. The last of a total of three system packages for the 1 GW production line will be delivered in January, the German PV equipment supplier said this week.
“Centrotherm already supplied turnkey production lines to Suniva in 2008 and 2009, and we are proud to contribute to the resurgence of the photovoltaic industry in the USA,” said Jan von Schuckmann, CEO of Centrotherm. “As part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which supports domestic manufacturing of clean energy equipment, we expect further impetus from the US market.”
Since its passage in August 2022, the IRA has ushered in a new era of US clean energy manufacturing and installation. Based on tracking by nonpartisan trade group Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), over 274 major clean energy projects have been announced across 41 states, leading to over $110 billion in private investment announcements and the creation of over 95,000 jobs. In 2023 alone, more than 80% of all projects and 95% of capital investments announced were in the manufacturing industry, said E2. 
Suniva announced plans in October to restart the idled factory in Georgia, which operated at around 450 MW of production capacity at the time of its closure in 2017.
“The reopening of production in Norcross is the first step in rebuilding solar cell manufacturing in the United States, which will bolster our country's energy independence and security,” said Matt Card, president and COO of Suniva.
Once considered one of the largest solar cell and panel manufacturer in the United States, Suniva filed for bankruptcy in 2017 after claiming it could not compete with cheap solar imports.
In response to a Section 201 trade petition filed by Suniva and SolarWorld, the Trump administration imposed duties in 2018 on imported solar cells and panels for a period of four years. The tariffs were extended but somewhat eased by the US government in 2023.
According to Suniva’s Card, the tariffs have helped US panel production, but he credited subsidies contained in the IRA for finally enabling Suniva to produce solar cells again.
Suniva has been owned by New York investment firm Lion Point Capital since it exited bankruptcy in 2019. Last year, the manufacturer secured a $110 million financing commitment from Orion Infrastructure Capital which it said would use to purchase new manufacturing equipment.

According to tender documents, the Saba Renewable Energy Project Phase III will include a 4 MW solar plant, a 0.5 MW wind farm, and a 15 MWh battery energy storage system on the island in the Lesser Antilles chain.
Once operational, the solar, wind and battery storage will be integrated into SEC’s grid, adding to an existing 2.1 MWp of solar, 2.3 MWp of battery storage and 4.3 MVA of diesel generator capacity, developed from the first two phases of Saba’s renewable energy project.
Renewable energy currently accounts for around 40% of Saba’s annual energy usage, with reciprocating diesel engines remaining the island’s primary source of power generation. SEC has set a target of 100% renewable electricity generation as part of its overall sustainable energy strategy.
The company said the tender is not a solicitation for formal proposals at this stage. It will use information gathered to evaluate market interest, gauge market prices and help develop the final request for proposals. 
Saba is a special municipality within the Netherlands and, along with the islands of Bonaire and Sint Eustatius, can be referred to as the Caribbean Netherlands. This project is funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Change Policy and UE MIP, a branch of the Dutch government.
The deadline for expressions of interest is Feb. 5, 2024.

LevelTen Energy released its quarterly PPA pricing index for North America, releasing data for the full year ending in 2023. The company operates a PPA marketplace with over 900 project developers, energy advisors and resellers, and some of the world’s largest clean energy buyers.
The report noted that P25 prices for PPAs rose 3% in the fourth quarter and 15% for all of 2023. P25 pricing represents the 25th percentile of prices developers are offering in contracts, not the final transacted PPA prices.
LevelTen reported a mixed regional picture for the US solar market. P25 prices rose 15% in CAISO, California’s regional grid operator, while falling in other markets.
“The increases were likely driven by regulatory adjustments, prevailing market conditions and increasing buyer demand,” said Sam Mumford, an analyst at LevelTen Energy. “The CAISO increase in particular was likely caused by select developers pricing projects much higher than the previous quarter’s P25 price, potentially to account for expectations around cost of capital or future REC value.”

The company develops software and services to be able to offer the commercial and industrial (C&I) market customized electricity contracts that are linked to solar and wind farm power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The new capital will be used to scale operations, expand internationally, and grow the team. Early investors also participated in the round, namely The Footprint Firm, a Danish investment company, and Germany’s UVC Partners, an early-stage investor.
Founded in 2020, Reel develops software that analyzes the electricity usage of customers, along with energy consumption, budget, and risk tolerance. It then uses the information as the basis for electricity contracts tied to solar and wind park PPAs. The contracts are set for five- to 10-year periods.
“Reel electricity contracts provide companies with attractive, fixed electricity prices that mitigate the volatility of energy markets by offering price predictability and budget certainty,” Reel CEO Jon Sigvert told pv magazine.
Acting as an electricity supplier, Reel enables businesses, even smaller ones, to switch to renewable energy. Sigvert pointed out that the companies Reel supplies electricity to are often those who cannot access PPAs on their own due to constraints related to the size of their electricity consumption, credit rating, and legal expertise.
Some of Reel's customers are Baettr, a German wind turbine component manufacturer, Viggo, a Danish electric vehicle ride-sharing company, and compatriot Combitherm, a polyamide film manufacturer.
The company is not yet disclosing how large an installed base of solar and wind assets it has already commissioned, except to state that it is currently supplying electricity in Denmark and facilitating PPAs across Europe, including in Denmark and Poland.

8,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/31/reducing-pv-module-temperature-with-graphene/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MALAYSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-01-31,Reducing PV module temperatures with graphene,"Scientists at Monash University Malaysia have looked at how graphene and graphene derivatives could be used as materials to reduce the operating temperature of solar panels.
In an in-depth review published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, the researchers explained that graphene has attracted the interest of the scientific community as a medium to enhance heat transfers in cooling systems since 2004.
When used for PV cooling applications, graphene can be used in different ways. For example, it can be used as a selective absorber coating or embedding it into a working fluid as a nanofluid. Graphene nanoparticles can also be added to thermal interface materials (TIMs) or phase change materials (PCMs) used for solar module cooling.
The group divided all graphene technologies applied to PV into two categories – passive and active cooling.
The first category was split into pre-illumination and post-illumination techniques. The latter involves all methods that use a heat receiver to dissipate heat generated from solar cells, while the former includes all approaches that decompose the sun spectrum before it reaches the PV cells.
The pre-illumination category is represented by all types of graphene-coated neutral density (GCND) filters used as selective absorber coating.
“The application of the GCND filter as a pre-illumination passive cooling technique is highly advantageous, particularly in cooling CPV systems,” the academics said. “This pre-illumination cooling technique attenuates the solar radiation before it reaches the PV panel, thus reducing the amount of heat generated at the PV panel.”
They also recommended using GCND filters only for small-scale domestic applications, due to their high costs.
“Rather than coating graphene across the entire substrate, focusing the graphene coating specifically at the focal spot area could contribute to reducing coating costs,” they added.
As for the post-illumination category, the list includes using graphene as a thermally conductive filler in TIMs and PCMs.
“While both TIM and PCM present advantages and disadvantages of their own, there is no universal answer to whether TIM or PCM in passive cooling of PV panels is better,” the group said.
The active cooling category includes all techniques based on graphene nanofluids configured as working fluids. These techniques, like all active cooling methods, require the construction of pumps and pipes to circulate the nanofluid around the modules, which the scientists said raises significantly production costs.
“The challenge of using graphene nanofluid is the costly and complex fabrication process, which prevents graphene nanofluid from being adopted in common industry practice,” said the researchers.
The group acknowledged that more research will be required to reduce costs and improve cooling efficiency. The researchers also said that synthesizing graphene nanofluid and hybridizing graphene nanofluid and graphene-enhanced PCMs are the main technical challenges to overcome.

9,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/31/photovoltaics-for-wastewater-disinfection/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,SPAIN,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,2024-01-31,Photovoltaics for wastewater disinfection,"Researchers from Spain’s University of Jaen have developed a novel technology for wastewater disinfection and the production of PV energy.
The Open SoWat system is designed for tertiary treatment – the third and final process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). It is an upgrade of SolWat technology, which consists of a photochemical technology integrating PV modules and water disinfection reactors.
“To extend the system to commercial use, preliminary experimental studies need to be carried out using a large-scale prototype. Optimization of this technology will involve the use of energy-efficient water pumps. In addition, a study of their energy consumption and an economic analysis of the system will be carried out,” researcher J. Torres told pv magazine. 
The research group said that the technology harnesses various wavelengths of solar radiation for distinct purposes. It uses ultraviolet (UV) and far infrared (FIR) radiation to disinfect water, significantly reducing the presence of harmful microorganisms. Additionally, visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) radiation are used to generate electricity through the photovoltaic module.
The Open SolWat system operates dynamically with water recirculation to reduce the operating temperature of the solar module. It consists of a PV module over which a 1 mm thin film of water flows thanks to a pumping system. The water is spread across the front side of the panel and is then collected in an external water tank made of aluminum L-profiles, with a funnel transferring the water to the tank.
“The tank is exposed to solar radiation and functions as a solar water disinfection reactor,” the scientists said, noting that in the classic SolWat closed configuration, an 18 mm thin film of wastewater is applied to the PV module, enclosed with borosilicate glass.
To test the feasibility of the system, the scientists have built two prototypes – the Small Open SolWat system and the large Open SolWat system.
“The first reactor consisted only of an L-shaped aluminum profile on top of the PV module, which was equipped with a perforated tube with 53 microtubes for the water outlet, spaced 1 cm apart,” they explained. “The second reactor was an open, translucent water tank measuring 62 cm x 45 cm x 18 cm.”
The largest prototype uses a 45 W module from UK manufacturer PV Logic, two water reactors and a magnetic coupling water pump with an average flow rate of 8.9 L/m manufactured by Germany's Flojet Corporation. The smaller system uses a module with a nominal power of 5 W.
 

 
After building the prototypes, the researchers placed them on a roof in the Spanish municipality of Linares and conducted a series of experiments. Those included physicochemical and microbiological analysis, as well as electrical performance.
“The Linares WWTP provided the experimental samples which were obtained directly after secondary treatment, which means it is not lab-prepared but natural water containing organic matter,” the scientists said. “The representative samples were always collected between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. on the day of each experiment. The experiments were started around 11:00–12:00 p.m. local time, 2–3 hours before solar noon.”
The larger setup had a radiation exposure of around 95% to 97%, whereas the smaller one had only 2.8% exposure because it lacked an external, fully exposed water tank. Water quality results from the larger prototype met Spanish and European regulations, making it suitable for urban, agricultural, industrial, and environmental purposes.
The smaller setup showed energy losses of up to 2.89% compared to a reference system without cooling, due to partial shading from the system itself. However, in the case of the larger setup, the system improved electricity generation by 15% to 21%. Nevertheless, the researchers concluded that it did not significantly affect the final energy production of the classic SolWat reactors.
“The energy generated could be used to power the SolWat pumping system and meet other energy needs at a wastewater treatment plant,” the researchers concluded. “To achieve this in future research, it is intended to scale up the system to a larger prototype and optimize this technology using low water consumption pumps, as well as to carry out a study of its energy consumption.”
The researchers presented the system in “SolWat technology for simultaneous wastewater disinfection and higher energy generation utilizing PV module front surface,” which was recently published in the Journal of Water Process Engineering.
“The present research highlighted the Large Open SolWat system with the most optimal results in SolWat technology to date, both for solar water disinfection and for simultaneous energy production,” said Torres.

10,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/31/a-behavioral-perspective-on-residential-pv-system-adoption/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,CHINA",LIOR KAHANA,2024-01-31,Behavioral perspectives on adoption of residential PV systems,"Researchers from State Grid Corp. of China, the nation's largest state-owned grid operator and power utility, have explored the effects of individual behavioral interactions on the adoption of residential PV technology.
The scientists conducted their analysis based on surveys and behavior-driven computer simulations.
“This study adopts the agent-based modeling method (ABM),” they explained. “It can better simulate the formation of consumer preferences, information exchange, and the adoption process, calculate the adoption scale at different stages of the technology, and explore the influence mechanism of behavior and its interaction characteristics on the adoption of distributed photovoltaic technology.”
The group used NetLogo software, a platform for social network simulations, using two datasets. The first was based on a survey of urban and rural users from Tianjin, northern China. It incorporated a five-point Likert scale to capture variables such as psychological factors, sociodemographic attributes, and other relevant parameters. A Likert scale is a rating scale used to measure opinions, attitudes, or behaviors.
Out of 984 participants, 219 households had already installed PV systems. The second data set was the energy use behavior of PV system owners. The group randomly chose 219 households to correspond with the active users from the survey.
“This approach provides robust data support for updating the energy use behavior after an agent's adoption of the technology,” it noted.
Using all of those data points, the scientists then modeled the decision of agents, the social network, and the information exchange into the simulation. They did so partly based on the “theory of planned behavior” (TPB), in which an actor's attitude level, personal subjective norms, and perceived control determine their behavioral intention, affecting their final green adoption behavior.
They also used the “small world” network structure, in which all members of a curtain geographical community may randomly establish connections. To establish who became friends with whom, similarities in social attributes were taken into account.
In the simulation, the research group first looked into the effect of environmental constraints. They varied the threshold at which users decide to adopt PV. Strong environmental constraints might include strict regulations or societal pressures, while weak constraints might include social norms, minor incentives, or user-friendly interfaces.
“While strong environmental constraints may drive a quick uptake of distributed PV power generation technology, it's the weak environmental constraints that are more likely to sustain this adoption in the long term,” the researchers noted. “This is because they work by aligning with users' preferences and making adopting the new technology more appealing and less burdensome. As a result, weak environmental constraints are more likely to lead to a higher overall adoption ratio.”
In the final step, the researchers used the simulation to assess the effect of external intervention on the adoption of PV panels. They modeled subsidy levels, economic rewards, and economic penalties into the simulation. A benchmark model was used to allow both strong and weak environmental constraints to operate simultaneously, thus controlling the influence of environmental constraints.
“While each of the economic interventions studied in this research has some effect on the adoption rate of distributed photovoltaic technology, the most effective is providing additional economic rewards,” the results showed. “Cost subsidies and economic penalties also have a positive effect, but the free installation seems to reduce the adoption rate.”
They presented their findings in “The diffusion path of distributed photovoltaic power generation technology driven by individual behavior,” which was recently published in Energy Reports.

The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) latest report shows that new records are rapidly being set for the amount of renewable energy, including grid-scale and rooftop solar, being fed into the National Electricity Market (NEM), reducing the reliance on traditional coal-fired generation.
AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said there were moments in time in the final three months of 2023 that show just how fast Australia’s energy transition is happening.
“Early in the afternoon of Dec. 31 rooftop solar met 101% of South Australia’s total electricity demand,” he said. “While on the afternoon of Oct. 24 rooftop solar and grid-scale renewables provided 72% of all electricity across the east coast. These events are snapshots of the transition that’s happening, and they are becoming more frequent. We are regularly seeing records set for the higher contribution of renewables, and lower levels of energy drawn from the grid because of rooftop solar.”
The latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report shows that average distributed PV output reached an all-time high in Q4 2023 of 3,433 MW, 505 MW or 17% higher than the same period in 2022 and a new record for any quarter.
The market operator said distributed PV output reached record highs in all regions, with October yielding a particularly notable 44% year-on-year increase in monthly average for the NEM. By contrast, the NEM-wide November average rose only 7% year on year, with New South Wales and Queensland experiencing decreases on 2022 levels.
The February edition of pv magazine, out next week, considers the ramifications of Dubai’s COP28 climate change summit for solar and asks where the workers will come from to staff the energy transition. A busy edition also ranges as far afield as Bulgaria, the South Caucasus, Cyprus, South Africa, Poland, and Navajo Nation in search of solar updates.
In December, this position reversed, with monthly averages falling in Victoria and South Australia within a 7% NEM-wide increase. At 17% for the fourth quarter as a whole, year-on-year growth of distributed PV output was lower than in recent quarters which had recorded annual growth rates of about 30%.
By region, New South Wales experienced a 20% increase in distributed PV output, reaching a quarterly average of 1,155 MW, while Queensland saw an 18% rise to average 1,063 MW.

The panel has a power conversion efficiency of 25% and an output of 421 W. It measures 1.68m2 and uses cells produced by Oxford PV, a UK-based perovskite solar cell manufacturer with pilot production in Germany. Oxford PV says that the module was assembled by the Fraunhofer team using its specifications.
“This new world record is a crucial milestone for Oxford PV, proving that our tandem solar cells can deliver record-breaking performance when assembled into solar panels,” Oxford PV CEO David Ward said in a statement.
The tandem cells produced by Oxford PV are M6-format. Last year, the company broke a record with a verified cell efficiency of 28.6 %. The tandem cells are currently produced in a small series line in Brandenburg, Germany, with commercial production slated for later this year.
The researchers said they utilized commercially available PV production equipment installed at the Fraunhofer Module Technology Evaluation Center (Module-TEC) and optimized the processes to make the glass-glass modules. “The fact that mass production-compatible technology was used for its manufacture demonstrates the enormous potential of tandem technology for the PV industry,” said Stefan Glunz, head of PV at Fraunhofer ISE.
The solar cells were interconnected using conductive bonding equipment at Fraunhofer ISE's Module-TEC. As the perovskite layer of the tandem cells is temperature-sensitive, the research team said it had to develop low-temperature processes for the interconnection and encapsulation of the solar cells.
“In the future, we will also be testing another alternative: soldering the solar cells at low temperatures,” said Achim Kraft, who heads up the interconnection technology group at Fraunhofer ISE. “These are suitable for industrial mass production and can be implemented on commercial systems. The necessary adaptions can also easily be implemented in today’s PV production lines”
For the calibration measurements, the Fraunhofer ISE tapped its well-equipped calibration lab to determine the module efficiency, noting that precise and reproducible statements about the tandem module’s power, are only possible if both the perovskite and the silicon cell layers are illuminated by appropriate LED light sources under conditions as close as possible to natural sunlight.
“As the currently standardized measurement methods are not fully transferable to this new technology, the method used was additionally validated with field measurements,” noted the researchers.
The project teams from Fraunhofer ISE and Oxford PV are now working towards certification of the PV module and tests on long-term stability.
This article was amended on 31.1.2024 to reflect that the module was assembled by Fraunhofer ISE using cell technology and module specifications from Oxford PV.  And to amend typo that transposed numbers for verified efficiency of cell to the corrected 28.6%.
