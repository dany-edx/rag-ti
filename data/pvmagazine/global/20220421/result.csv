The majority of the world's nations which host off-grid solar arrays had the same installed capacity at the end of December as they had 12 months earlier, according to IRENA's Renewable Capacity Statistics 2022 report.
In Bangladesh and Myanmar, the volume of connected off-grid solar generation capacity actually fell last year, with Bangladesh losing 16 MW of arrays to have 139 MW at the end of the year, and Myanmar falling from 44.5 MW to 40.4 MW. The latter nation also shed 4 MW of grid connected photovoltaics last year, according to IRENA, to host 80 MW of grid capacity at the end of December.
In off-grid terms, Lebanon added the only 10 kW of capacity observed in the Middle East last year, Fiji added all of Oceania's 33 kW, and Ecuador added the only 23 kW recorded in South America.
While most of Africa's off-grid numbers remained in stasis, however, Mali's standalone PV generation capacity rose from 19.5 MW to 49.5 MW last year and Somalia's advanced from 15.5 MW to 23.5 MW.
Grid connected solar capacity additions remained robust last year, according to the study, with China adding almost 53 GW to reach 306 GW, India adding 10.3 GW to hit 49 GW, and the US seeing almost 20 GW of new solar, to reach 93.7 GW.
EU member states provided 21.4 GW of the new panel capacity recorded across the European continent last year, led by Germany, which added more than 4.7 GW to reach a cumulative 58.5 GW. Other hot markets included Belgium, which added more than a gigawatt to reach 6.59 GW; the Netherlands, which added almost 3.3 GW for a total 14.2 GW; Poland, which advanced from 3.96 GW to 6.26 GW last year; Portugal (up from 1.1 GW to 1.8 GW); and Spain (10.3 GW to 13.6 GW).
Estonia, Ireland, and Moldova also made significant advances, albeit from low baselines but Czechia and Slovenia lost solar capacity last year, the former retreating from 2,123 MW at the end of 2020 to 2,119 MW, and the latter from 370 MW to 367 MW.
While Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Morocco, Senegal, the Seychelles, Somalia, Togo and Zimbabwe all made advances in solar in 2021, South Africa added 231 MW of the underwhelming 298 MW of new PV connected to African grids during the year.
Kazakhstan was an Asian solar star in 2021, according to IRENA, adding 1,115 MW of grid-connected photovoltaics to advance from 1.72 GW to 2.83 GW and there were also advances in Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore and Uzbekistan – which turbocharged its solar sector to advance from just 4 MW of grid solar to 104 MW. The remarkable solar revolution witnessed in Vietnam, however, appears to have stalled. After rocketing from 8 MW of grid solar five years ago to 16.7 GW in 2020, IRENA's number crunchers said the nation added no new capacity last year.
Panama almost doubled its grid solar capacity last year, from 242 MW to 465 MW, and there were notable Central American additions too in Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, with Nicaragua adding its first megawatt of grid solar, although the zero capacity previously recorded by IRENA can include up to 500 kW of panels.
Turkey drove most of Eurasia's new solar in 2021, according to the statistics, rising from 6.67 GW to 7.82 GW, with Armenia almost doubling its grid solar fleet, from 95 MW to 183 MW. Similarly, Australia provided 1,732 MW of the 1,736 MW of new panels installed in Oceania, with New Zealand accounting for the balance, and Saudi Arabia made the only notable solar deployment in the Middle East, as it reached 389 MW of grid connected capacity from just 59 MW at the start of the year.
Brazil added more than 5 GW of new grid solar last year, to reach a cumulative 13 GW, with the markets in Argentina and Chile also ticking over as Colombia more than doubled its capacity, from 86 MW to 184 MW.
According to IRENA, there are still a dozen territories worldwide without any grid-connected solar capacity: the Central African Republic, Djibouti, Lesotho, and Sao Tome et Principe, in Africa; and the British Virgin Islands, St Barth, and Dominica – which had 1 MW in 2026 and 2017, according to the Irena stats – in the Caribbean; plus Bhutan; the Faroe Islands; the Malvinas/Falklands; Paraguay; and Greenland.

The state-owned solar project company reported the bullish prediction reportedly made by the China Electricity Council as the developer surveyed market prospects in its annual report for 2021, published on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today.
Beijing Energy, formerly Panda Green, was reporting revenue of CNY 2.83 billion (US$441 million) from last year, up 31% from the CNY 2.15 billion recorded in 2020, for a profit of CNY 650 million, up from CNY 262 million a year earlier.
The scale of the company's solar portfolio rose dramatically, thanks to a mixture of solar farm acquisitions and its own construction projects, with the total installed generation capacity rising from 2.07 GW, at the end of 2020, to 3.84 GW and the company also branching out into wind farms.
That expansionary approach meant Beijing Energy's net debts rose from CNY 14.6 billion to CNY 26.5 billion by the end of December, with CNY 5.68 billion and $2.15 billion due within a year, from total-borrowing figures of CNY 27.8 billion and $4.45 billion, respectively.
Chairman Zhang Ping said the company would place stress on developing PV clusters in “Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, and other regions,” in line with government policy, as well as expanding its energy storage activity.

Portugal's government has approved exceptional measures to simplify the procedures for energy production from renewable sources, which will be in force for two years.
Decree 30-A/2022, promulgated on Monday, includes among its measures the exemption for renewable energy developers from securing an operating license or an operating certificate for power plants, battery storage, and production units for self-consumption, provided that the network operator confirms the existence of conditions for the grid connection of these facilities.
The new provisions also simplify the procedures related to a project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). In the case of power generators from renewable sources, as long as they are not located in sensitive areas, the government wants to adopt a case-by-case evaluation approach.
The same should apply to the analysis and decision of hydrogen production projects whose production process is free of danger and contamination.
The decree also established that, in order to reduce analysis and decision times, the opinions and authorizations required from administrative bodies will become part of the EIA procedures. It further makes it mandatory for projects to be accompanied by proposals to involve local populations, specifically through the exploitation of traditional activities such as sheep and chicken herding and beekeeping; the authorization of areas for planting native species with economic value or community gardens; nature and biodiversity conservation projects; and the supply of electricity to energy communities or local industries or the co-investment of resident populations.
Finally, it is possible for the existing wind power generation centers to inject all their production into the network without limiting the administratively assigned injection capacity, so as to guarantee the maximum possible production based on the installed power of each generation center.

In the lawsuit, Maxeon alleged Canadian Solar Japan infringed its Maxeon's Japan Patent No. JP6642841B2 relating to its shingled solar module.
“Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, Canadian Solar has agreed to withdraw challenges to Maxeon's Patent,” Maxeon said in a statement. “Canadian Solar has also agreed to discontinue selling shingled solar cell solar modules in Japan until the second calendar quarter of 2025 after satisfying certain outstanding 2022 orders.”
Canadian Solar is facing similar patent claims in the United States. Local PV manufacturer Solaria recently lodged three different patent infringement claims against the company, which also concerns the process of separating photovoltaic strips from solar cells for use in shingled modules.

“Reversible fuel cells can be an economically viable source of backup electricity during periods of surging prices, such as Texas experienced in 2021 when winter storms knocked out power plants fueled by natural gas,” the research's main author, Stefan J. Reichelstein, said, noting that reversible systems can help get economic value from renewable electricity when prices are low.
In the paper Reversible Power-to-Gas systems for energy conversion and storage, published in nature communications, Reichelstein and his colleagues developed an analytical model of the unit economics of the reversible fuel cell system. “While modular systems require sufficiently low hydrogen prices in order for the reversibility feature to be valuable, integrated systems can be economically viable for higher hydrogen prices by primarily generating hydrogen but also providing electricity during times of limited power supply,” the study reads.
Through the proposed model, which mainly considered the electricity markets in Germany and Texas, the research group found that fuel cell systems based on solid oxide cell (SOC) technology may be competitive at current hydrogen prices, provided that there is sufficient variation in daily electricity prices, as in the Texas market.
The reversible systems are said to be economically viable even in the presence of substantially lower hydrogen prices in the future. “This is because the inherent flexibility in these systems enables them to respond to lower hydrogen prices by operating more frequently in reverse mode, delivering additional electricity to the power markets,” the researchers said.
They also took into account the potential drop in costs for SOC fuel cells over the next 10 years and found that they may still be competitive even with substantially lower hydrogen prices. These systems may become particularly valuable during periods of electricity scarcity, including regular demand peaks and irregular supply shocks. “The reversible systems can be built to almost any scale, they add, so they can be used by individual companies or small communities as well as by large urban power grids,” Reichelstein concluded.

A shift to green ammonia would significantly reduce the Indian government’s massive fertilizer subsidy burden and boost energy self-reliance by cutting dependence on imports of expensive liquified natural gas (LNG) for fertilizer manufacturing, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). 
Fertilizer subsidy in India is budgeted at INR 1.05 trillion (US$14.2 billion) for 2022-23, exceeding one trillion rupees for the third year in a row. The subsidy will likely have to be increased drastically with fertilizer prices pushed to record levels due to high and volatile global gas prices, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war. 
Gas prices increased from $10.75/MMBtu (metric million British thermal units) in January 2021 to $33 in January 2022. Global urea prices soared to record highs of $690-794/ton (INR 51.4-60.4/kg) between October 2021 to March 2022. However, urea for the Indian agriculture sector remained at a subsidized retail price of INR 5.3/kg ($71/tonne), reflecting the heavy subsidy of more than 90% on the global benchmark price of urea.  
“Demand for fertilizer in India is expected to grow, and this will increase the need for further subsidies and LNG imports unless we switch to a cleaner and domestically produced feedstock,” says report author Kashish Shah, energy finance analyst at IEEFA.
“Green hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources and can replace grey hydrogen, which is generated from natural gas, or methane, as a feedstock for ammonia production.”
Shah expects the demand for hydrogen in the Indian fertilizer industry to rise from about 3MT per year today to 7.5MT by 2050.
The International Energy Agency estimates that 8 MT of green hydrogen to green ammonia production capacity is planned worldwide. 
The IEEFA report looks at leading green hydrogen to green ammonia projects worldwide and reviews the cost competitiveness of producing green ammonia using various electricity inputs: grid electricity, round-the-clock renewable power, and solar power plus batteries. 
The cost of green hydrogen production is currently at about $5.5 per kg, or $3 per kg in countries with good solar resources and is projected to continue to decline steeply this decade. For it to compete with grey hydrogen at $2 per kg, the costs of two critical inputs – electrolyzers and renewable energy – must fall further. 
“While the gap between the cost of producing green hydrogen and hydrogen from fossil fuels is narrowing, there is still further to go,” says Shah. 
Electrolyzers must fall below $250 per kilowatt from $700-1,000 and renewable energy to $20 per megawatt-hour from US$30-35, according to the report.
Making electrolyzers in India, in tandem with the growing solar PV manufacturing base, would cut the cost of producing green hydrogen for green ammonia, says Shah.
The government’s new green hydrogen policy offers a range of incentives to green hydrogen and green ammonia manufacturers, including land allocation in renewable energy parks, interstate transmission charges waiver for 25 years, and banking of renewable power for up to 30 days.
“These incentives mainly focus on the supply side,” says Shah. “In addition, developers and investors would need a strong offtake pipeline for their product to make the projects bankable. This could be done by implementing a green hydrogen consumption obligation (GHCO) mechanism for fertilizer production and petroleum refining, similar to Renewable Purchase Obligations.”
The report says the next phase of policy incentives could include production-linked incentives (PLI) similar to those provided for solar modules and battery manufacturing. This could bridge the viability gap for interested manufacturers ready to risk capital for green hydrogen and green ammonia projects. 
The international green bonds market will be a key funding avenue for projects as developers look to derive value from the synergy of renewables and green hydrogen, the report says.

It is a KRW 6 billion (US$4.8 million) initiative aimed at testing the deployment photovoltaic panels on railroad noise barriers.
The project will be developed with the support of the Korea Railroad Corporation (Korail) and other government entities.
The installations will rely on bifacial solar modules and will be applied to noise barriers in high-speed and conventional railroads as well as on bridges. The solar modules will be adapted to the aesthetics of each side and should be resistant to pollution, the city government said in a press release.
“The foundation has been laid for the development of solar power generation on railroad sound barriers, and if the technology will become viable it will contribute to the creation of an energy-independent and carbon-neutral city,” the statement reads.
PV developers in land-scarce South Korea have recently considered building solar systems in roadway noise barriers, along highways, and on water reservoirs.
Scientists from the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) developed last year a photovoltaic-thermal noise barrier that could be used to replace conventional soundproof walls to reduce traffic noise. Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co. (KHNP), a unit of Korea Electric Power Corp. (Kepco), also recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Hanmaeum Energy, a Singapore-based private equity firm owned by Affirma Capital and Duham Partners to deploy 100 MW of solar capacity on idle areas close to highways in South Korea.
In the future, the country may host one of the world's largest floating PV projects – a 2.1 GW floating solar complex the South Korean government is developing near the Saemangeum tidal flats, on the coast of the Yellow Sea.

“The batteries are currently manufactured at our facility in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, with a capacity of 100 batteries per month,” the company's CEO, Ryan Brown, told pv magazine. “Currently, we are in the process of ramping up production at this same facility to the pilot scale to support pilot projects in the residential space. We are also developing our first gigafactory plant design, which will be located in the USA or Canada.”
According to the manufacturer, its zinc-ion battery acts the same way as existing lithium-ion storage systems. “The battery can respond almost instantaneously to store or deliver clean power as needed. Since it has similar power capabilities to Li-ion, it is also well-suited for short-duration storage, which is a term for energy storage systems that can completely charge or discharge in just a few hours,” Brown explained.
“Generally, zinc-ion energy storage systems function the same as lithium-ion, with the important differences between the two being in cost, safety, and supply chain abundance as opposed to performance. Additionally, its water-based chemistry eliminates the risk of fire, making it a safe alternative to existing systems.”
The battery measures 26cmx24cmx1.2cm and weighs in at 1.3 kg. Its rated capacity is 60 Ah and the nominal voltage is 1.3 V. The volumetric energy density is 100 Wh/L and the gravimetric energy density is 60 Wh/kg. The shelf life for two weeks is 100% and that for six months is 95%.
“Our initial focus is on the residential market, specifically starting with targeting homebuilders who are developing net-zero homes and communities,” Brown continued. “We are starting with residential because of how important safety is to this market – we know that our zero fire-risk systems will greatly simplify installation and peace of mind to homeowners. We plan on expanding from residential into industrial energy storage and utility scale systems built for the grid.”
Zinc-ion has lagged behind other storage technologies due to challenges in controlling side reactions that both limit reversible charging at the anode and cause the cathode to fall apart. Zinc-ion, however, still has the potential for good energy storage performance out of cheap, abundant materials.
According to a recent study from the University of Bremen in Germany, the two main hurdles that must be overcome for zinc-ion batteries in future research are the increase of the specific energy of the full Zn-ion cell and the prevention of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction occurring during the Zn electrodeposition step.

It immediately became clear that the market is undergoing a major acceleration. According to Mesa, the country has installed 710 MW of solar PV to date, with most of this being grid-connected solar systems. This is substantially more than the country had in cumulative PV capacity at the end of last year.
Mesa recounted the history of solar PV adoption in his country, which was kickstarted in 2014 with legislation to promote renewables. But it would take another four years for the right policies and incentives to emerge. Accordingly, in 2018 the country had only one significant PV installation with a capacity of 18 MW. According to Mesa, this represented quite a mismatch to the heightened competitiveness of solar PV in 2018, especially in light of Colombia’s exceptional irradiation, about 60% higher than the global average.
With an improved policy environment, including attractive tax incentives, the country’s three public auctions have been a success. 2,800 MW of renewables have been awarded in these auctions, encouraging a ramp-up in major PV installations in the country. According to Mesa, “every other week I am inaugurating solar plants.” Italy’s Enel Green Power is leading the way and Colombia’s largest solar project so far was just connected to the national grid six weeks ago. Developed and owned by Enel Green Power, this solar farm in Alaloma boasts 187 MW of clean energy capacity, more than Colombia had installed cumulatively in PV by the end of last year, according to the most recent statistics published by the International Renewable Energy Agency.
Enel had already raised eyebrows in 2019 with the construction of an 87 MW PV power plant in El Paso, which is also located in the department of Cesar. Top tier Chinese PV and battery storage manufacturers Canadian Solar and Trina Solar have also spearheaded the market, with Trina developing 100 MW of PV assets, which it subsequently sold to the Colombian utility Isagen. The Canadian fund Brookfield is now the key owner of these 100 MW, of which 60 MW is already in operation. A further 40 MW is set to come online this quarter.
“Auto-generation” or self-consumption is another popular business model, especially in the country’s oil and gas sector. As the Minister revealed, “tomorrow I’m going to the department of Casanara, which is traditionally an oil and gas producing region, and we are going to be inaugurating a solar farm in one of the auction sites for one of the oil and gas companies. It’s only about 7 MW. It’s a good size for auto-generation.” Mesa also mentions two other such plants, one inaugurated late last year (61 MW) and another in 2020 (25 MW).
And just last month the country began construction of South America’s largest PV power plant, excluding the Brazilian market. Enel Green Power is behind this project as well and this 500 MW plant should be completed by the end of this year, delivering power to Colombia’s grid early next year. Mesa anticipates further price declines in the country’s public auctions, mentioning a range of US$0.025 to $0.027/kWh. But he also expects “temporary shocks” due to the ongoing PV supply chain constraints.
Public auctions will continue to act as an important policy instrument to establish a robust PV market in Colombia, but the emergence of private auctions have served to diversify the overall market. According to Mesa, more legislative action is required to introduce more competition in Colombia’s nascent distributed generation (DG) market and distributed rooftop solar seems a market that Mesa is keen to develop.
Grid constraints have further limited market growth, but the country’s transmission expansion plan passed in 2019 should improve the pace of interconnection. New on- and off-shore transmission capacity will help bring more renewable energy to the country’s load centers and this might include high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) capacity in the not-too-distant future.
But we will see significant grid-scale battery storage even earlier as part of the country’s transmission expansion plan. The other top-tier Chinese module manufacturer mentioned, Canadian Solar, was awarded a grid-supporting 50 MW battery storage project as part of a tender last summer and this stand-alone battery storage facility should start operation in June next year.
So while Colombia has been a late starter in the global PV industry, we can expect plenty of action and further investment this year and in the following years. Enel Green Power’s landmark 500 MW Guayepo project will certainly do its part to put Colombia on the map of global PV players and Canadian’s 50 MW battery storage project could mark the start of more ESS opportunities in this South American market.

Western Australian solar window company ClearVue said the results from its Murdoch University greenhouse trials, running for a year now, are strong and demonstrate the readiness of the company’s product for commercial applications.
With higher than expected power generation and thermal value – effectively insulation quality – the trials which were set up to prove the viability of solar windows have done just that.
Well timed, the company is actually already installing its solar window glaze technology at a commercial greenhouse in Japan via its licensed distributor, Tomita Technologies.

The greenhouse at the Aqua Ignis Hot Springs tourism resort in Sendai City, Japan will be used to supply produce for the resort. Completion of the solar glazing there is expected over the coming weeks, ClearVue said, with overall completion of the greenhouse and its opening anticipated within the next months.
Back to the Murdoch trials in Western Australia, the company has said Stage 1 is now complete with Stage 2 already getting underway. To that end, ClearVue said it has made “significant upgrades” to the greenhouse systems as part of the second phase and the aim now is to find the “optimum balance” between power generation, thermal efficiency, water savings and maximizing plant growth across a wide range of species through the adjustment to photosynthetically active radiation light.
The Murdoch greenhouse comprises of three ClearVue glazed rooms and one control room which acts as a baseline from which to measure the performance of the ClearVue product. Of the three ClearVue rooms, one uses the current commercially available ClearVue glazing product while the third and fourth rooms are variants of that product using different amounts of nano- and microparticles to look at optimization of power generation and impact on plant growth dynamics.
According to the findings, the ClearVue product generated 5.3 MWh of solar energy over the year from April 19, 2021 to now.

The solar windows also displayed strong insulative or thermal value, proving to be around 2˚C warmer overnight and slower to heat up in the morning. This has a double benefit by minimizing electricity usage in the greenhouse, making it more efficient – a feature ClearVue has previously pointed out will be advantageous in the high rise building market it is targeting.
“The results from the ClearVue Greenhouse at Murdoch have demonstrated the power performance of the ClearVue’s PV glazing both as a power source for the project but also as a significant contributor to energy reduction within the operation of commercial greenhousing where growers are willing to invest into a long-term capital asset that can pay itself back – both financially and from a carbon perspective – something no other greenhouse covering product on the market can offer today,” ClearVue’s Executive Chairman Victor Rosenberg said.
“The recent upgrades made to the greenhouse will offer an even greater insight into the role the ClearVue glazing can play in commercial greenhousing,” he added.
“Whilst the results show that we still have a little work to do in finding the optimum balance between power generation, minimal water use, and optimized light conditions for maximum plant growth – we are confident that we are close to finding this equilibrium point and are looking forward to working with the Murdoch team on the Stage 2 plant science trials but also with Tomita on the commercial greenhouse at Sendai in Japan to round out this work.”

“The Tomita Technologies greenhouse installation is itself progressing very well and will in addition to offering a commercial greenhouse as a reference point it will also serve as a good demonstration of larger sized ClearVue PV glazing performing in a cold-climate real-world setting. We very much look forward to the finalization of this exemplar project and its opening in the coming months.”

Called H2arvester, the first prototype has been deployed on sugar beet land in Oude-Tonge, South Holland, and was inaugurated last week by Netherlands' Agriculture Minister, Henk Staghouwer.
“The solar car concept was developed four years ago by my company and two other partners,” Marcel Vroom, responsible for design and business development at design services provider Npk design, told pv magazine. The other two companies are L’orèl Consultancy and LTO Noord. “At the moment, there are two pilots being tested, the one in Oude-Tonge and one in Lelystad, at the research farm of the Wageningen University. Both systems will be operating for one year to test the effect on the yield and the land, to show that there will be no loss of agricultural production.”
The local farmer Jacob Jan Dogterom invested €166,000 in the system located in Oude-Tonge, which consists of four solar cars hosting a total of 168 solar panels and an irrigation system that can also provide water to the surrounding area. “It is a pilot project, the investment is far from being complete. We will continue to build it and if we can develop this on a mass scale, it will only become cheaper,” the consortium said.
InnovationQuarter, the regional economic development agency for the Province of Zuid-Holland, subsidized around half of the project's costs.

Each car measures 12×6 m and is able to move slowly, at a pace of 10 meters per hour, and, during harvesting, it can be moved to the side. According to its developer, the system should cover up to 10% of an agricultural field, which would thus not lose its agricultural purpose. “They are movable arrays of solar panels, assembled on lightweight structures and supported on wheels, moving in pre-defined directions,” Vroom further explained.
The system could also be combined with an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen, which could then be used as a green fuel for agricultural applications. Residual heat coming from hydrogen generation may also be used to dry crops, such as oats, grass and alfalfa.”The solution to convert the generated kWh directly into hydrogen not only provides an autonomous production plant, but is also a solution to the need to balance the production and use of generated energy without worrying about reinforcements of the electricity network,” said Robert Jacobs, energy specialist at L’orèl Consultancy.
The project is part of the H2GO Program, which is an innovation program supporting the combination of electricity and green hydrogen. Partners of the projects are Kitepower, Npk design, L'orèl Consultancy, Rho, Accenda and TU Delft, among others. According to its creators, H2arvester is a circular energy model for a local and regional economy.

The report also reveals that silver was sold at the $24 to $28 range during the first half of last year, and reached then a lower range of $22 to $26 during the second half.
Global silver demand surpassed pre-pandemic levels and reached 32,627 tons, which represents the highest level since 2015. Industrial fabrication grew by 9.3% to 15,807 tons last year.
“This mainly reflected the effects of a resumption of industrial operations and the re-opening of businesses as economies began to recover from Covid. Other supportive factors included the demands of the home working economy, a boom for consumer electronics, 5G infrastructure investment, inventory build along the supply pipeline and rising end-use in the green economy, chiefly in photovoltaics,” said the Silver Institute.
The report also reveals that silver demand in the solar industry grew by 13% to 3,536 tons last year. It is expected to climb by another 12% to 3,950 tons this year.
The researchers said that the current transition to TOPCon modules and the ongoing adoption of HJT heterojunction cells, which require 30% to 80% more silver than current panels, may push the PV industry towards higher silver consumption.
“As such, it is forecast that PV silver demand will stay healthy as growing capacity additions counter the negative of the finger width being expected to drop a further 30% to 25μm by 2025,” the Silver Institute said, noting that the “finger width” is the width of the lines of silver paste that are printed onto the front and rear of panels.
Looking forward, the Silver Institute said that the boost to precious metal prices from the war in Ukraine will prove short-lived. It claimed that silver’s traditional macro drivers will soon take center stage.
“We believe the silver price will keep to its recent trading range over the next few months, even after support from the Ukrainian conflict wanes,” it warned. “Later in the year, however, liquidations and price downside will be hard to avoid.”
Overall, the Silver Institute forecast the silver price will average $23.90 per Troy ounce in 2022.

And as the website created to display them points out, they do not take into account how much Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed the picture.
With the arrival of Russian tanks prompting the EU to pledge to dramatically accelerate its energy independence plans, the scenarios modeled by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (Entso-E) – and its gas peer Entsog – could already appear out of date.
The two EU-wide bodies published their latest 10-year network development plans (TYNDPs) this month and included two scenarios which would take the bloc to a net-zero energy system by mid century, as well as a “national trends” model based on current energy policies.
Second fiddle
The TSOs' two more ambitious outcomes – the large scale, more centralized approach entitled “global ambition” and the more community, consumer-driven “distributed energy” model – both envisage wind and imported biofuel playing a more significant role than solar in the EU generation fleet in 2050, with the former scenario also featuring more nuclear generation capacity than photovoltaics.
With large offshore wind facilities featuring more heavily in the centralized approach to net zero, the graphic included in the report indicates solar would occupy around 5% of the European energy mix in eight years' time, rising to 7% in 2040, and around 10% in mid century. Although solar is a more natural fit in the prosumer approach of the distributed energy model, the relative numbers remain modest, at around 7% and 10%, rising to 20% in 2050.
As Entso-E and Entsog are at pains to explain in the executive summary attached to their latest ten-year plans, the scenarios are “technology and energy-carrier neutral.”
With the two bodies trumpeting consideration of technology such as vehicle-to-grid charging, prosumer modeling, district heating, power-to-gas and power-to-liquid fuels, and Europe-wide hydrogen and electrolysis for the first time, the authors of the report added: “Acceptance of energy infrastructure expansion is [of] paramount [importance] to achiev[ing] climatic targets.”
Stressing the critical importance of integrating electricity, methane, and hydrogen infrastructure, the ten-year plans estimate peak daily hydrogen demand of 2 TWh at the end of the decade, rising to 10 TWh in 2040, and around 15.5 TWh in mid-century, under the global ambition scenario. The distributed energy model posits daily demand of 1.75 TWh, more than 7 TWh, and almost 10 TWh, respectively.
EV outlook
And as for electric vehicles, the report estimated battery passenger vehicles will make up around 22.5% of the total European fleet in 2030, rising to 87.5% in mid century, under the consumer-led distributed model, with the global ambition outcome featuring a 12.5%-strong battery car fleet at the end of the decade, rising to 77.5%.
All of which brings the reader back to that hefty disclaimer, which reads: “The invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Feb. 24, 2022, has led to a major overhaul of energy policy objectives in terms of energy security and diversification of supply that the TYNDP 2022 scenarios do not currently reflect. Entso-E and Entsog would like to explain that due to these recent events affecting the energy supply in ­Europe, some assumptions used in this report regarding gas supply may be impacted for the short and longer terms.”
