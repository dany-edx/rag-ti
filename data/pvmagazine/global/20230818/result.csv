With the recent selections, DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) has announced investments of more than $122 million in 72 projects since January 2021. “These projects support DOE’s Hydrogen Shot initiative, which seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in one decade to grow new, clean hydrogen pathways in the United States,” said the DOE.
A research team from Korea and US, led by Chanho Pak from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in Korea, has developed a novel mesoporous tantalum oxide (Ta2O5)-supported iridium nanostructure catalyst via a modified formic acid reduction method that reportedly achieves efficient PEM water electrolysis.“The electron-rich Ir nanostructure was uniformly dispersed on the stable mesoporous Ta2O5 support prepared via a soft-template method combined with an ethylenediamine encircling process, which effectively decreased the amount of Ir in a single PEMWE cell to 0.3 mg cm–2,” said Pak. The Ir/Ta2O5 catalyst design improved the utilization of Ir, while facilitating higher electrical conductivity and a large electrochemically active surface area. “X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectroscopies are used to demonstrate the strong metal-support interaction between Ir and Ta. The charge transfer from Ta to Ir has confirmed through density functional theory, which leads to enhanced OER activity of Ir/Ta2O5 (ɳ = 0.385 V) over IrO2 (ɳ = 0.48 V). Ir/Ta2O5 presents a higher activity with an overpotential of 288 ± 3.9 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and mass activity of 876.1 ± 125.1 A gIr−1 at 1.55 VRHE,” the researchers wrote in the paper “Electron-rich Ir nanostructure supported on mesoporous Ta2O5 for enhanced activity and stability of oxygen evolution reaction,” which was published in the Journal of Power Sources.
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced that Fidelis New Energy has selected Mason County as the site for a lifecycle carbon-neutral hydrogen production facility called The Mountaineer GigaSystem. “Mountaineer will be implementing the proprietary FidelisH2 technology that enables the production of hydrogen with zero lifecycle carbon emissions from a combination of natural gas, carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) and renewable energy,” said the West Virginia Governor. The project should be built in four phases, each producing over 500 metric tons per day (MTPD) of net-zero carbon hydrogen at an approximate capital cost of $2 billion per phase. The first FidelisH2 train of the Mountaineer GigaSystem should commence operations in 2028. Fidelis New Energy is also working on an onshore CO2 storage facility in Aalborg, Denmark. 
Denmark‘s Minister of Industry Morten Bødskov visited HySynergy to discuss green fuels and the next big export adventure, hydrogen. “On- and offshore renewable energy combined with Power-to-X and the production of green fuels can become the next big export adventure supporting finance Denmark's welfare society for generations to come, says Everfuel and Crossbridge Energy,” said Everfuel, underling that the facility already displays a small hydrogen pipe that can deliver more than 8 tons of hydrogen per day from the producer Everfuel to the customer Crossbridge Energy. 
Wärtsilä will provide the front-end engineering design (FEED) for the liquefaction and storage of liquefied synthetic methane (LSM) at the plant to be built in Kristinestad, Finland, by Koppö Energia, a joint venture between Germany's Prime Green Energy Infrastructure Fund and CPC Finland. “The FEED will be booked by Wärtsilä in Q3, 2023. The Power-to-X plant … will have a capacity of 200 MW and will convert green electricity into hydrogen and sustainable LSM. Up to 500 MW of wind and 100 MW of photovoltaic power will be developed under the Koppö Energy Cluster to supply the plant with completely emission-free renewable energy,” said the Finnish technology company. 
The British government announced that 262 MW of electrolyzer capacity had made it to the penultimate step of the Hydrogen Business Model allocation round. The government shortlisted 17 projects to negotiations. “Government is working at pace to ensure that the first electrolytic allocation round (HAR1) concludes before the end of 2023. We expect to award contracts totaling up to 250MW of capacity from HAR1, subject to affordability and value for money. We aim for contracts to be awarded in Q4 2023, with first projects becoming operational in 2025,” said the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero. 
Toppan announced it plans to enter the hydrogen market, leveraging its base sheet transfer technology and uniform coating process for large surfaces. The Japan-based company installed production equipment for Catalyst Coated Membrane (CCM)/Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEA) at its Kochi Plant in Kochi Prefecture. “Aiming to enter the hydrogen energy market, Toppan is using a first-of-its-kind proprietary manufacturing method to enable mass production of high-performance, high-quality CCM/MEAs and is launching sales in August,” said the Japanese company. CCM/MEAs are core components of water electrolysis equipment for hydrogen production.

“It will be easier for companies, farmers, citizens and municipalities to invest in photovoltaics,” said Sven Giegold, state secretary for the economy ministry.
The proposed legislative changes primarily simplify plug-in solar devices, while encompassing all areas including rooftop and ground-mounted systems, as well as tenant electricity and community energy supply.
Rooftop installations will be streamlined, as the existing simplified grid-connection procedures will be extended to PV systems up to 30 kW in size. Direct marketing access for smaller PV systems will also be simplified, and technical equipment requirements for systems up to 25 kW will be eased.
For medium-sized commercial plants, a plant certificate will only be necessary for a feed-in capacity of 270 kW or an installed capacity of over 500 kW.
A new model in the draft also promotes the supply of solar power within buildings, extending to residential tenants or commercial customers. The existing EEG subsidy for PV systems on buildings will also encompass outdoor areas.
Plug-in solar devices are limited to an output of 2 kW and an inverter output of 800 VA. They must be operated behind a final consumer's point of use.
The previous EEG amendment introduced a new repowering regulation for ground-mounted photovoltaic systems, which will now extend to roof systems, allowing the replacement of old modules with more powerful ones while maintaining the original feed-in tariff.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
Key for ground-mounted PV systems is the expansion of area coverage, allowing agricultural land in disadvantaged areas for construction. Extensive agrivoltaic systems meeting extensification criteria will receive a bonus, and biodiversity solar parks will receive additional funding through separate ordinance authorization.
A dedicated PV tender sub-segment is planned for ground-mounted systems, including agrivoltaics, floating, and parking lot systems, up to 3,000 MW per year.
Following cabinet approval, “Solar Package 1” proceeds to the Bundestag for consideration. The economics ministry is also developing “Solar Package 2” to implement additional measures from the jointly created “Photovoltaics Strategy.”

China will set up a recycling system for ageing wind turbines and solar panels, drawing up new industrial standards and rules to decommission, dismantle, and recycle wind and solar facilities, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and five other state agencies said on Thursday. The state planning agency said that China would have a “basically mature” full-process recycling system for wind turbines and solar panels by the end of the decade.
China’s new energy sector, which covers wind, solar, battery, and other emerging energy technologies, will face a problem of “mass decommissioning of equipment” as industry upgrades accelerate, the state agencies said. The country is set to retire about 250 GW of solar panels and 280 GW of wind turbines by 2040, according to Greenpeace.
Wind and solar manufacturers should design equipment that is lightweight and easy to disassemble and recycle, according to the NDRC’s guidelines. Renewable energy generators will also be responsible for decommissioning end-of-life equipment and will not be allowed to discard or bury the waste in landfill sites, it added.

Toyota Tsusho has completed a project development study with the support of the Benin government, including Beninese Electricity Production Co. Toyota Tsusho and Germany's EPC RMT, a subsidiary of Eiffage Group, now plan to construct a 25 MW solar plant – set to become one of the largest in Benin. They aim to complete the project in 2024.
Separately, the Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF), a non-profit organization, recently commissioned 24 solar-powered water pumps and five solar-powered vaccine refrigerators in Kalalé.
In the water pump initiative, solar arrays were integrated with pumps in 24 villages. These pumps operate during the day, pulling water from underground into elevated reservoirs. The water is then distributed by gravity to a central station, accessible to the local community for a small fee, covering maintenance. This innovation eradicates the need for residents to spend hours fetching water over long distances daily.
The vaccine refrigerators use direct-drive with an energy harvest control (EHC) to charge clinic devices. Surplus energy is diverted to power battery-operated lights or cell phones. Solar streetlights were also installed near the clinics for patient accessibility at night.
Benin, which is mainly reliant on thermal power plants, aims to achieve 150 MW solar capacity by 2026.

Switzerland's Meyer Burger Technology AG produced 302 MW of its heterojunction solar modules in Freiberg, Germany, during the first half of this year, surpassing its output for all of 2022. The company reported a 71% year-on-year jump in sales to CHF 96.9 million ($110.5 million). It says that it remains financially strong and is capable of proceeding with its production expansion plans.
However, the company is now shifting its strategic focus from Europe to the US market. This transition became evident in July, when its announced plans to establish a 2 GW cell production facility in the United States, alongside an existing module plant.
By combining US module and cell manufacturing, Meyer Burger will benefit from the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit 45X system, a component of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This initiative could potentially provide up to CHF 1.4 billion in cumulative funding from mid-2024 to the end of 2032.
Meyer Burger is capitalizing on the favorable financial conditions in the US market, but it is also actively tackling current market obstacles in Europe. The European market has experienced the entry of Chinese PV manufacturers, introducing 85 GW of solar modules in the first half of this year, frequently at prices below manufacturing costs.
This influx has significantly influenced market dynamics. During the first quarter, Meyer Burger effectively sustained its selling prices at almost consistent levels. However, in the second quarter, the company made price adjustments downwards in reaction to the broader decrease in solar module prices.
Global demand for solar modules is rising, including in Europe, but market conditions are not ideal, according to Meyer Burger.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/18/july-sees-above-average-irradiance-across-most-of-asia-typhoon-doksuri-couldnt-dim-high-irradiance/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA",,"AUGUST 18, 2023","July sees above average irradiance across most of Asia, Typhoon Doksuri couldn’t dim high irradiance","July 2023 was a remarkable month in terms of weather activity worldwide, and Asia was no exception. After a sunny start to the month, Super Typhoon Doksuri and the associated cloudiness could not bring monthly irradiance below the long term averages for most of the continent, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.

In a normal July, regions from Bangladesh to Indonesia see seasonal rains from the monsoon. However, this year, the rain and associated cloud were mostly concentrated further south. This led to up to 20% higher irradiance than normal in Bangladesh, and up to 10% higher than normal through Northern Thailand and Vietnam. The relatively high levels of solar capacity in Vietnam and Thailand will have benefited from this increased irradiance.
Japan
A dominant high-pressure weather system formed off Japan's east coast, which resulted in winds blowing from the west across the country. When these winds crossed Japan's mountain ranges, they lost moisture, resulting in clearer skies, especially towards the east. For irradiance, this meant a significant boost, up to 20% in some areas surrounding Tokyo compared to the usual for July.
North Eastern China
While Japanese solar production benefited from this system, North Eastern China faced the cloudier side of it. Increased rainfall and the after-effects of Super Typhoon Doksuri meant a slightly cloudier July than average. It's noteworthy that this area was the only region in Asia to see less-than-average irradiance this month.

 
Super Typhoon Doksuri's shadow
As well as the damaging effects of the storms, typhoons like Super Typhoon Doksuri dominate the regional cloud effects, which can limit solar energy generation. As the below visualization shows, the footprint was significant and drove cloud up the Chinese coast. While as this storm made landfall over Taiwan and parts of mainland China near the end of July, the month had already seen so much irradiance until then that the overall monthly total GHI remained consistent with or even higher than average, other than in North Eastern China.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

State-owned SJVN expects to commission a 1 GW solar project in Rajasthan by September 2024. 
It said that the project will be commissioned in two parts. The first 250 MW section will become operational in March 2024. The remainder will go online by September 2024.
The state-run hydropower producer is now working several PV projects. It expects to commission 125 MW of solar in Uttar Pradesh (75 MW in Gurah district and 50 MW in Gujrai) by the end of December of this year.
SJVN expects to commission several projects by December of the following year, including the 70 MW Bagodara solar power project in Gujarat, the Raghanesda solar project in Gujarat, 90 MW of floating solar at Madhya Pradesh's Omkareshwar reservoir, and an additional 100 MW in Punjab.

Researchers can deposit phase heterojunctions on solid substrates to enable durable PV installations, or on flexible substrates for applications such as portable electronics or the Internet of Things. The key benefit of the phase heterojunction approach lies in its use of a single material on both sides of the junction, albeit in distinct crystalline phases. This eliminates the necessity for doping and mitigates the adverse effects of ion migration.
The research team selected the β- and γ-phases of CsPbI3 perovskite material to form the two polymorphs. The approach involved combining the anti-solvent-free dynamic-hot-air (DHA) processed β−CsPbI3 front absorber with the triple-source thermally evaporated γ−CsPbI3 rear absorber in a simple phase-heterojunction configuration, explained Sawanta S. Mali, the corresponding author of the study. This DHA method enhances the quality of inorganic perovskite thin films and improves device performance under ambient conditions.
To establish phase stability in the β−CsPbI3 front cell, the researchers introduced a Zn(C6F5) molecular additive. For the γ−CsPbI3 rear cell, they employed triple-source guanidinium iodide (GAI)-assisted thermal evaporation deposition. The addition of a small amount of GAI led to enhancements in morphology, optoelectronic properties, efficiency, and stability.
The device exhibited remarkable performance metrics, including a power conversion efficiency of 21.59%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.220 V, a short-circuit current of 21.72 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 81.5. The team also underscored the excellent stability of the encapsulated device, which retained more than 90% of its initial efficiency after 200 hours of storage under ambient conditions.
The researchers described the solar cell and the related manufacturing process in “Phase-heterojunction all-inorganic perovskite solar cells surpassing 21.5% efficiency,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. The research team includes academics from the Chonnam National University in South Korea, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Pennsylvania State University in the United States, and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).
“In future work, different polymorphic phases of either organic−inorganic and/or all-inorganic halide perovskites could also be the best alternatives for highly efficient PHS devices,” they concluded.

The DBRs consist of alternating dielectric layers, commonly serving as reflectors and dielectric mirrors, and their multilayered composition alternates between high and low refractive indices, resulting in customizable reflection spectra.
The DBR structures exhibit a distinct blue hue and use transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) derived from thin-film aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) and indium tin oxide (ITO). This choice of materials reportedly enhances light scattering. The connection between TCOs and the DBR electrode incorporates a diffuser layer, serving as a transparent front electrode.
“The AZO diffuser layer was chemically etched, and the light-scattering structure was controlled by varying the etching time,” the researchers said. “As the etching time increased, the reflectance spectra tended to decrease over the entire wavelength range, owing to the textured surface of the diffuser layer.”
The researchers said that the textured PV cells exhibit greater intensity in external quantum efficiency (EQE) across the entire wavelength spectrum when contrasted with flat PV cells. EQE signifies the efficiency of power conversion, calculated by considering all incident sunlight or photons.
“The absorption of PV cells was improved by enhanced light scattering with a higher etched DBR-diffuser electrode, but the spectral response of the EQE decreased in the highest light scattering structure of 150 second,” explained the scientists.
They said that they will now investigate these interfacial defects in solar cells with increased light scattering.
“The optimization results of the DBR electrode and diffusion layer will be applied not only to a-Si:H but also to other colored thin film solar cells and will help BIPV to research utility and aesthetics,” they said.
They described the cell technology in “Surface modification of color-clarifying layer in transparent conductive oxide based distributed Bragg reflector-diffuser electrode for building-integrated photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The research team includes scientists from the Korea Institute of Materials Science, the University of Science and Technology (UST), and Pusan National University.

Perth-based ClearVue is claiming a win, with its clear solar windows delivering positive peer-reviewed results following a two-year study.
The ASX-listed West Australian company notes that its fully transparent solar windows, set up in a BIPV construction for a greenhouse at Murdoch University in Perth, delivered 19 kWh/day, offsetting nearly 40% of energy costs. In addition, the windows performed through all conditions, and occasionally outperformed traditional PV modules during periods f rain, including installation across a range of angles, and in dusty areas. The paper, titled ‘Field Performance Monitoring of Energy-Generating High-Transparency Agrivoltaic Glass Windows’ was published in MDPI’s Technologies journal.
ClearVue specializes in solar windows that allow up to 70% of visible light transmission through optically clear glass, simultaneously harnessing the entire spectrum of light, including UV rays. A noteworthy aspect of these windows involves directing long-wavelength light to the window’s edge, where solar panels capture the energy.
While the paper does not extensively emphasize the overall window efficiency, it highlights that each window, measuring 1.2m by 1.1m, produced a range of 30–33 W per m2. The paper calls for additional research to better ClearVue’s latest iteration boasts improvements such as reduced weight, enhanced thinness, accelerated manufacturing capabilities, and higher efficiency approaching 5% overall.
Now as a proven technology, following decades of attempts to make conforming products over the years, ClearVue has an advantage with a scalable and mass-produced product, sized to industry standards, and has reached a second-generation BIPV glass window product following research and development progress.
This peer-reviewed data substantiates ClearVue’s aspirations. As a publicly listed entity, the company continues to provide investors with quarterly and occasional updates regarding revenue, income, and outflows incurred due to ongoing investments in technology and customer acquisition. The company posted a $2 million loss without revenue in the last reported quarter, with just over $5.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Aside from R&D efforts and revenues from customers, a $2 million grant was awarded in May 2023 for the local manufacturing of its core technology, providing a boost outside of sales.

Mono M10 wafer prices climbed 3.57% to $0.377/pc and Mono G12 wafer prices rose 3.68% to $0.507/pc, OPIS assessed this week.

Leading wafer manufacturer TCL Zhonghuan raised its list prices for Mono M10 wafers to CNY3.15 ($0.43)/pc, a significant 6.78% increase on the company’s previous list prices two weeks prior. Following that, many tier-2 manufacturers raised wafer prices accordingly, prompting the market price for Mono M10 wafers to climb from CNY2.95/pc to over CNY3/pc, sources concurred.
High downstream demand has made wafer producers confident of raising prices, according to numerous sources. Cell businesses are currently procuring wafers in high volumes, making the current market tight, explained one source.
The third quarter is often a busy time for procurement and manufacturing as cell and module manufacturers increase production to prepare for China’s solar installation requirements in the second half of the year, another source added.
Upstream, China polysilicon prices rose for a sixth consecutive week to CNY71.9/kg. This 3.77% increase – comparable to the gain in wafers – takes prices past the psychologically significant figure of CNY70/kg. Polysilicon faces a “shortage of supply,” with overall market inventories estimated at 30,000-35,000 MT, one source said.
While wafer prices have been heading up, their prices could fall once the supplies required for solar installations are met, a source warned, adding demand would then decline and wafer stockpiles accumulate. “This may be seen in late October or November,” the source also said.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
