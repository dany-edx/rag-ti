An idea that began with PowerField Energy co-founders David Flory and Paul Burdick tinkering in a garage is now a growing company scaling up in production, funding and project pipeline. Both Flory and Burdick came from solar backgrounds and aimed to find a simple, low-cost racking solution. That tinkering led to development of the PowerRack, which is an injection-molded high-density polyethylene container that can be filled on site and used to mount solar panels of almost any size, no tools required.
pv magazine USA spoke with Drew Bond, co-founder and chief executive officer, Patrick Fleming, chief operations officer, and Corbin Abshier, director of business development, on the history of PowerRack. One of the first PowerRack installations was at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colo., where they set up a two-year test model. To date, the company has installed PowerRacks supporting more than 4 MW of solar in residential and commercial as well as portable installations, like the one at this year’s Coachella music festival.
In seven years, the Virginia-based company has scaled production several times, has raised $1.3 million in funding and now is raising a Series A for $5 million to scale sales, manufacturing, and product development for global distribution.
In 2022 the company landed its first utility-scale contract for an installation in Brodheadsville, Pennsylvania where the developer, Endless Energy, had run into challenges around site conditions and environmental concerns and the developers couldn’t get the project across the finish line. The developer had already sunk a lot of money into the project, so they needed a solution that would get the project up and running as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Once the contract was signed, it was delayed for a year due to permitting issues, but once approved, the PowerRacks were installed, and modules mounted in four weeks. The project is at a ShopRite store, where 8,800 PowerRacks hold 4,400 Hanwha Qcells 480 W solar modules in the 2.1 MW system, powering more than 85% of the store’s energy needs.
According to Fleming, the site had underground water table issues and there was exploratory well equipment on the site that had to be avoided, so penetration with a traditional racking system was not going to work. The developer had already sunk a lot of money into the project, so they needed an inexpensive solution. The PowerRacks met their needs, and while the project was ten times larger than anything PowerField had done previously, they said they only needed to have one field employee on site to get the job done.

The racking is brought on site as empty 15-pound plastic containers, which are filled with any dry loose aggregate material such as gravel or crushed rock. The solar modules slide easily onto the racking and are held in place with clips. Clips are attached by hand, with no tools needed. When it’s time to decommission the solar installation, the modules are removed, the racking is emptied, and they can be removed from the site and recycled.
PowerRacks were also used to set up a temporary solar installation to power lighting the Coachella music festival held in April in Indio, California. Overdrive Energy Solutions chose the PowerRack after seeing them at a trade show and thinking their portability would meet their needs. Neel Vasavada, founder and president of Overdrive said a crew of four installed 15 kW of solar divided across ten locations.
“And we had never used the product before. We were down to 10 min. a location – less time than it takes to fuel a gasoline generator,” he said.
Once the festival was over and it was time to disassemble the temporary solar installation, Vasavada explained that “disassembly” doesn’t apply in the same manner as other products here.
“We used PowerRack specifically because there isn’t any disassembly of the racks themselves, except for picking up the plastic locking pieces after the panels are lifted off,” he said.
With the PowerRacks being portable and sitting above the ground, installers have a few options when it comes to handling the wiring. Fleming noted that there is a channel in the rack where the cabling rests along the sidewalls of the rack and up under the modules, just as it would with any system. The wiring can be run above ground with cable hangers or messenger cables, or the site can be trenched if that works better for the installation.
To date, PowerField has sold its racks in 38 states, with customers ranging from electric utilities to do-it-yourself homeowners. The company recently expanded its manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand and PowerField is developing future versions of the PowerRack to accommodate ever-larger modules, different pitch angles and other unique customer requirements.

Germany's Agri Energie has commissioned an agrivoltaic project in Hallertau, near Munich, in the German state of Bavaria. The €1.5 million ($1.64 million) project combines solar generation with hop growth.
Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University of Applied Sciences supported Agri Energie in the development of the facility, which will cover an area of 1.3 hectares. It will produce enough solar power to supply around 200 households.
The company installed the PV system on steel masts, providing protection to hop plants from sunlight and hail, while also reducing evaporation. In addition, the system serves as support for the hop plants.
“This pilot project will provide us with numerous valuable insights that are of great relevance for future agrivoltaic projects,” said Bavarian Economy minister Hubert Aiwanger. “The local potential is also huge. After all, hops are grown on 17,200 hectares in the Hallertau.”
In July, Q Energy France switched on an agrivoltaic installation to grow hops on 1 hectare of land in the town of Luçon, France.

The SCIO, which refers to information from the state-run Xinhua news agency, said the Tianjin Binhai Dagujie solar farm was built in several phases. It covers an area of around 1,333.3 hectares and is able to generate approximately 1.5 billion kWh of clean electricity per year. It was connected to the grid last week.
Huadian constructed the facility with a 14-meter spacing plan between panel rows and a module tilt angle of 17 degrees, as reported by CGTN. These parameters were selected by the project developers to minimize the panels' effect on the water surface and enhance salt production.
The Chinese energy producer is currently building a 3.3 GW solar power plant in Changdu City, in Sichuan province in the southwest of the country. The CNY 16 billion ($2.21 billion) project includes the Mangkang Angdo and Gongju Lator solar plants. The company said the site will be integrated with agriculture and pastoral cultivation.

“The main contribution of our work is the division of PV integration development into four stages, spanning from the past to the future,” the research's corresponding author, Yang Du, told pv magazine, noting its main goal is to display the research gap and motivate the research on fully dispatchable PV. “The paper identifies forecasting, energy storage, and curtailment as the cornerstones for enabling dispatchable PV in the future.”
The scientists focused their efforts, in particular, on forecasting and controlling PV power. “This paper advocates using PV inverter control, that is, curtailment, rather than energy storage with the help of advanced solar forecasting as a major source of flexibility,” they explained, adding that, currently, effective general solutions to converting PV to dispatchable are still to be found. They also acknowledged, however, that PV electricity is now becoming more predictable and controllable.
The paper presents all existing technologies that can eventually facilitate firm generation using PV, which the group said is becoming particularly urgent, as more and more fossil fuel power generation assets are being increasingly decommissioned.
As for PV power forecasting, the researchers described two main approaches – central forecasting and self-forecasting. The latter consists of a strategy implemented by a grid operator to obtain forecasts by collecting the self-produced power export prediction from each PV system it is connected with. The former is a strategy to obtain forecasts by centrally analyzing environmental data.
They also presented all possible strategies to achieve active PV system control. These include: Controlling PV power below maximum power point (MPP); controlled curtailment; smoothing PV power; grid support; PV forecasting-based control; and virtual power plant (VPP) approaches.
The research team also described all possible solutions to help PV provide firm generation. “Forecasting, energy storage, and controlled curtailment are three cornerstones for firm generation,” it highlighted. “A PV generating unit planning for its output and tracking the planned trajectory is therefore believed viable. However, efficiently planning the behavior of a PV generating unit for control purposes has not been achieved.”
The academics concluded that the missing link in this transition toward more dispatchable solar power is the creation of a framework for optimal decision-making for locating firm generation facilities. “Future work is needed on enabling planning and generalizing this ability to PV generating units regardless of system scale,” they stated.
The strategies are presented in the study “Evolution towards dispatchable PV using forecasting, storage, and curtailment: A review,” published in Electric Power Systems Research.

Residents of remote parts of East Gippsland, Victoria, are participating in the Australian state’s first trial of standalone power systems (SAPS) with Ausnet investigating the use of the technology as part of its ongoing efforts to strengthen network efficiency and resilience.
The distributed network service provider said the SAPS, featuring a combination of solar, batteries and a backup generator, offer an independent, reliable and renewable power supply solution to energy users in remote locations without the need to be connected to the network.
AusNet’s commercial unit, Mondo, said the trial units include ground-mounted solar panels, a battery energy storage system, and a back-up diesel generator. The self-sufficient units also include control hardware that allows electricity use to be tracked.
“We now have 17 systems successfully installed and operational across Victoria and look forward to seeing more homes and businesses benefiting from reliable and renewable energy,” Mondo said.
The trial has prioritised residents in remote areas with a single-wire network connection. The targeted areas also are typically in bushfire and extreme-weather-prone zones where the poles and lines are often affected, leading to outages.
Mondo, which will be responsible for all the operation and maintenance of each standalone power system, said the SAPS aim to use solar energy as the primary source of electricity and have been designed with a large amount of battery storage to minimise generator usage and improve users’ energy resilience.
With the installation and commissioning of the first 17 SAPS now complete, Mondo and AusNet will monitor and evaluate the performance of the systems as part of the open-ended trial.
While the key benefit of SAPS is an improvement in resilience and reliability of supply for customers in hard-to-reach areas, AusNet said it expects all customers could enjoy cost savings as a result of it not having to repair and maintain remote parts of the distribution network.
Mondo said the SAPS are already providing benefits to the customers, including the increased uptake of renewables and increased resilience during severe weather events.
“As the trial continues, we are excited to observe and learn from each system and we look forward to leveraging our knowledge to implement more standalone power systems across Australia,” the company said.
While the AusNet trial is a first for Victoria, the technology has been widely deployed in Western Australia.
Previous regulations made it extremely difficult to deploy SAPS in the National Electricity Market (NEM) but those regulations have now been amended, paving the way for broader roll out of the technology in the NEM jurisdictions of Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/10/csem-epfl-reveal-technical-details-of-31-25-efficient-tandem-perovskite-silicon-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 10, 2023","CSEM, EPFL reveal technical details of 31.25%-efficient tandem perovskite-silicon solar cell","The Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) and the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) announced in June 2022 they achieved a power conversion efficiency of 31.25% for a 1 cm2 tandem perovskite-silicon solar cell, which they said represented, at the time, a world record for a PV device of this kind.
The two scientific institutions, however, did not release many details about the cell technology and how the new record was made possible. Now, more than one year later, they presented the cell and the related manufacturing processes in the paper “Interface passivation for 31.25%-efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells,” which was published last week in Science.
“Our team took a pioneering approach by designing a tandem solar cell with a perovskite layer conformally coated on a silicon bottom cell,” the research's lead author, Xin-Yu Chin, told pv magazine. “The silicon bottom cell featured micrometric pyramids, an industry-standard modification that enhances its photocurrent generation.”
One of the key challenges in perovskite/silicon tandem cells is the recombination losses occurring at the perovskite top surface interfacing with the electron selective contact. Recombination is a process where the photogenerated charge carriers – electrons and holes – recombine before they can be collected and utilized to produce electricity, which leads to efficiency losses. “To address this issue, we incorporated an additive into the processing sequence, which proved instrumental in regulating the perovskite crystallization process,” Chin explained. “This step efficiently passivated the interface, effectively mitigating recombination losses that hamper overall cell performance.”
The scientists used a phosphonic acid known as 2,3,4,5,6-Pentafluorobenzylphosphonic acid (FBPAc) to passivate the perovskite absorber and another phosphonic acid called methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) to obtain passivated interfacial defects in the hole transport layer (HTL).
The cell is based on a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a Me-4PACz HTL, an absorber made with the FABr:FAI perovskite with an energy bandgap of 1.70 eV, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a top electrode based on copper (Cu).
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the device showed an efficiency of 31.25%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.91 V, a short-circuit current of  20.47 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 79.8%, which were all certified by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
“The use of Me-4PACz reduces voltage losses at the perovskite/HTL interface, whereas the inclusion of FBPAc in the perovskite deposition sequence reduces the voltage losses at the perovskite/C 60 ETL interface and leads to more favorable perovskite microstructures with larger domains,” the researchers emphasized, adding that the outcome also indicates that the technology is prepared to advance to the subsequent stage of its development, which necessitates a central focus on stability and scalability aspects.
“It is probable that the technology will still require 5 to 10 years to enter the market. Existing industrial solutions are already applicable to all the thin-film materials used in the tandem solar cell, as exemplified by Oxford PV's recent results,” Chin added. “The primary concern that the scientific community must address is the stability of the perovskite material. Can these materials be rendered stable enough to endure over 20 years in practical applications? This is the pivotal question that will determine the commercial success and impact of this technology.”

Sumitomo said that external experts collected data from the 2MW/8MWh Redox Flow Battery Demonstration Project until the end of 2021. A preliminary analysis conducted in December revealed that the battery system achieved a 99% operating rate in the final year of the project. Sumitomo believes that the battery system has the potential to retain a capacity rate of 90% or more for 20 years in the electricity market.

The experts assigned a rating of 2.6 out of three to the overall project results. Sumitomo said that the demonstration project successfully showcased the business feasibility of using storage battery technologies for electric power market bidding and the fundamental capabilities of redox flow batteries in microgrid applications. The battery operates within a microgrid, supplying power to 66 residential and commercial customers for approximately five hours.
Sumitomo and SDG&E set up a microgrid by integrating the battery into an electrical distribution network. This setup demonstrated the battery's dual operation capability, allowing it to serve the wholesale electricity market under normal conditions and provide grid resilience during emergencies. The battery also features black start capability, enabling it to initiate and sustain service even after a complete power outage.
The project received support from Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and California's GO-Biz. Development of the project commenced in 2015. Sumitomo has already deployed 37 redox flow battery systems across multiple countries, with a total capacity of 47 MW/162 MWh.

Solar Analytics, an Australian solar energy analytics company, has launched a new service that allows solar owners to retrieve consumption data directly from retail meters, eliminating the need for additional consumption metering. Known as Integrated+, the release to all eligible homes in the National Electricity Market (NEM) follows a trial in Victoria.
Integrated+ is made possible by the Federal Government’s Consumer Data Right (CDR) program, which aims to standardize secure data sharing for the benefit of consumers. It “allows you to ask for your data to be securely transferred to an accredited provider so you can investigate, compare and access services more easily.”
Initially implemented in the banking sector, this program has now been expanded to encompass the energy sector, with the big three retailers with 65% market share taking part, and more retailers to come, following rules that any retailer with more than 10,000 customers will be required to comply with the CDR.
There are limitations to the potential savings, though they are substantial. This is partially offset by the need to pay a monthly subscription of around $10 per month to Solar Analytics for Integrated+, though there are additional features beyond the service. Additionally, the standard method for data uploads on retail metering involves a once-daily data upload, which may not be ideal for solar owners seeking real-time data, meaning consumption data will always be historical and a day behind. Still, the company said the majority of solar owners who participated in the trail found it sufficient.
“Having been in the solar industry for 30 years, it has always bothered me that valuable data captured by retail meters was not easily accessible to solar owners,” Nigel Morris, head of business development at Solar Analytics, told pv magazine. “It has taken far too long, but retailers are now legally obligated to share this data. It is a game-changer for solar owners and, in my opinion, represents the future of data access.”
