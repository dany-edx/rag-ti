New capacity is split evenly between PV and onshore wind, with PV making up most of the growth in the Middle East and North Africa region. China is set to deploy more than 18 GW of dedicated renewables capacity by 2027, while Europe will add 7 GW. “Spain is in the lead, accounting for half of Europe’s growth, followed by Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands,” said the IEA, noting that regulatory and policy uncertainty are the two obstacles to for European hydrogen development.
The Netherlands is on track to potentially exceed its ambition of 500 MW of domestic electrolysis capacity by 2025, said Energy Minister Rob Jetten in a letter to the Dutch parliament. “In the coming year, the government expects about 1 GW of electrolysis capacity to be subsidized, after which investment decisions are expected in the short term,” he wrote. Jetten said he expects subsidies for 800 MW to 1,000 MW of electrolysis capacity through the Important Project of Common European Interest. The final selection of the electrolysis projects presented in September 2022 for the first round, with a budget of €783.5 million ($822,40 million). The final aim is to reach 20 GW of hydrogen capacity by 2030.
Ørsted and Skovgaard Energy have signed a letter of intent to jointly develop a multi-phase Power-to-X facility in Idomlund, western Denmark. “The first phase of the project will have an expected electrolysis capacity of 150 MW and will be powered by onshore wind and solar PV,” said Ørsted. The electrolysis capacity could eventually increase to more than 3 GW, said the two companies.

It plans on producing one car a week and gradually scaling up its production in the first quarter of 2023. After six years of developing efforts, the Dutch company has become the first automotive company to manufacture an electric vehicle that generates power directly from sunlight. The final design of the long-range solar car Lightyear 0 was launched in June. It has a Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) range of 625 kilometers and consumption of 10.5 kWh per 100 kilometers.  However, the Dutch startup claims that a theoretical range of 695 kilometers could be achieved, with a battery pack capacity of 60 kWh. “The optimized solar roof and holistic design mean that the car can drive for weeks, even months, without charging,” the company said. Lightyear is already readying its second solar electric car, which will be available by late 2024 or early 2025.
Acciona Energia has set up the first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network in Spain. The Balearic Islands demo project comprises 16 bi-directional chargers that allow to charge vehicles with renewable electricity, recover energy from the batteries for self-consumption (vehicle-to-load or V2L), or inject it back into the grid (V2G). The project involves eight Balearic companies that will install the charging points. Two more will join in the second phase, expanding the V2G network to the islands of Menorca and Ibiza. Acciona Energia has provided participating entities with eight V2G-equippped EVs. According to the renewable energy firm, “the pilot marks the first implementation of V2G technology on an industrial scale in Spain, with a sufficient dimension to establish patterns of behavior and use.”
ADS-TEC has launched its battery-based, all-in-one EV charging system ChargePost. The solution is said to deliver more than 100 kilometers of range in just a few minutes. It comes with two high-power connections that can deliver up to 300 kW to one vehicle or 150 kW to two cars charging simultaneously. It has up to two optional 75-inch digital displays on its exterior surfaces. The system integrates the battery, power electronics, cooling system and charger in a compact package requiring less than 2 square meters of ground space. Its battery capacity is configurable and ranges from 143 kWh to 201 kWh and battery modules can be replaced individually as needed. The integrated charging cable with uncooled CCS1/CCS2 connector is at least three meters long. ChargePost is said to be able to deliver ultrafast charging even on low power grids. According to ADS-TEC, this makes it possible to install it “almost anywhere, including inner cities and rural areas where high-voltage grids are often not available.” The solution features plug-and-play installation at the ground level and can be quickly set up by forklift. As of now, ChargePost is available in Europe and will be soon reach the US market.
Volkswagen Group and its battery subsidiary, PowerCo, have launched a site search for the first battery cell factory in North America. “Canada is a logical option for the construction of a gigafactory in the North American region. The country offers high sustainability standards and ideal economic conditions, and the government of Canada has already proven to be a strong and reliable partner,” said Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume. Last week, Blume and François-Philippe Champagne, the Canadian minister of innovation, science, and industry, signed an addendum to the non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of August this year to identify suitable sites for PowerCo cell factory in Canada. In addition, a separate agreement was inked between PowerCo and Belgian materials technology group Umicore to secure cathode materials for future cell production in North America. This concerns a volume of up to 40 GWh per year in 2030, corresponding to about 550,000 EVs. Deliveries are planned to start in 2027.

EUPD Research said that about 220,000 new residential storage systems were likely connected to rooftop PV installations in Germany this year. It partly attributed the growth to increasing demand for residential PV systems, which are often combined directly with battery storage.
The installed PV capacity in the small system segment increased by 47% in the first half of the year, compared to the same period in 2021. Demand has roughly doubled for solar arrays with capacities between 10 kW and 20 kW.
For systems up to 10 kW in size, demand has increased by 26%, while average power output has risen from 8.3 kW to 8.7 kW. The size of the batteries has also increased, as they are mostly used to optimize solar self-consumption.
Bonn-based EUPD Research said that the almost 130,000 new PV systems in the segment up to 20 kW in size were combined with battery storage in 105,000 cases. This means an increase in storage installations of 44% compared to the first half of 2021.
The latest print edition of pv magazine – out today – visits Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and includes coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
Due to the war in Ukraine and rising electricity prices, EUPD Research assumes that demand will continue to increase in the second half of the year. It said it expects around 220,000 new residential storage systems in 2022, which would be more than double the figure recorded last year.
Four companies continue to dominate the market, accounting for three-quarters of all newly installed residential storage capacity in the first half of the year. China's BYD overtook German manufacturer Sonnen, which had been at the top for years. BYD claimed a market share of 23%, according to EUPD Research. Sonnen and Senec followed closely behind with 21% and 20% of the German residential market, respectively. E3/DC came in fourth place with 10%.

The novel cell configuration purportedly prevents so-called Fermi-level pinning from occurring on metal-semiconductor interfaces. This phenomenon involves the creation of a barrier for electrons and holes by bending the bands at the interface, which results in lower solar cell efficiencies.
“We used photoelectron spectroscopy to analyze the electronic structure of the interface where molybdenum oxide (MoO3,) was deposited on a SnS single crystal,” said researcher Issei Suzuki, noting that this innovation resulted in the absence of the Fermi level pinning. “We confirmed that the interface state achieved a high open-circuit voltage.”
They used vacuum cleaved n-type SnS single crystals and thermally evaporated MoO3, in the manufacturing process and demonstrated via in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the Fermi energy of SnS at the interface can be shifted through the entire band gap. According to their measurements, this is the first time Fermi level pinning has not been detected in SnS solar devices, potentially opening the way for more efficient cells.
Their work builds on their previous research in 2021, when they built an SnS single-junction solar cell. Despite a low conversion efficiency of 1.4%, the group said its approach offers the potential to push SnS solar cells beyond the highest efficiencies achieved thus far, between 4% and 5%.
SnS has emerged as a promising semiconductor material for solar cells in recent years. It is abundant in nature, non-toxic, and can be supplied at a low cost. It also has a near-optimal direct bandgap of about 1.3 eV, a high level of environmental and chemical stability, and a high absorbance coefficient.
The efficiency of solar cells built with this technology lags behind other established thin-film solar materials, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) or copper, indium, gallium selenide (CIGS). However, tin sulfide could be produced at such low costs that it could be used application in small devices or BIPV installations.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/06/pv-and-the-cable-guide/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"DECEMBER 6, 2022",PV and the cable guide,"As solar plant owners channel efforts towards strengthening the performance and efficiency of their operations, DC cabling selection cannot be overlooked. Based on the interpretation of IEC standards, and considering factors such as safety, bifacial gains, cable carrying capacity, cable loss, and voltage drop, plant owners can determine the appropriate cabling to ensure safe, stable operation across a PV system’s life cycle.
Solar module performance in the field is greatly affected by environmental conditions. The short circuit current on a PV module datasheet is based on standard testing conditions, including irradiance of 1 kW/m2, a spectrum air mass of 1.5, and a cell temperature of 25 C. The datasheet current does not consider the rear surface current in bifacial modules either, so factors such as cloud enhancement; temperature; irradiance spikes; and albedo-driven over-irradiance on the rear surface can significantly affect the actual short circuit current for PV modules.

DC cables are PV system lifelines as they interconnect modules to combiner boxes and inverters.
Plant owners must ensure the size of cable is carefully chosen for the current and voltage of the PV system. Cables used for wiring the DC section of a grid-connected PV system also need to withstand potential extremes of environmental, voltage, and current conditions. This includes the heating effects of both current and solar gain, especially if installed near the modules.
Here are some crucial considerations.

In PV system design, short-term cost considerations can result in poor equipment selection and lead to safety and performance issues in the long run, including catastrophic consequences such as fires. The following areas need to be carefully assessed to meet national safety and quality standards:
Standards are essential for ensuring the reliability, safety, and quality of PV systems, including cabling. Globally, there are several recognized standards for the use of DC cables. One of the most comprehensive sets are the IEC standards.
IEC 62548 sets out design requirements for PV arrays, including DC array wiring, electrical protection devices, switching, and earthing provisions. The latest draft of IEC 62548 specifies the current calculation method for bifacial modules. IEC 61215:2021 outlines the definition and test requirements of bifacial PV modules. It introduces the solar irradiance test conditions of bifacial modules. Namely, BNPI (bifacial nameplate irradiance): the front side of the PV module receives 1 kW/m2 solar irradiance and the rear 135 W/m2; and BSI (bifacial stress irradiance), where the photovoltaic module receives 1 kW/m2 solar irradiance on the front and 300 W/m2 on the rear.
An overcurrent protection device is used to guard against the potentially dangerous effects of overloads, short-circuits, or ground faults. The most common overcurrent protection devices are circuit breakers and fuses.
The overcurrent protection device will cut off the circuit when the reverse current exceeds the current protection value, so the forward and reverse currents flowing through the DC cable will never be higher than the rated current of the device. In this case, the DC cable should have a carrying capacity equal to the rated current of the overcurrent protection device.
Iz>=In. Where Iz is the current-carrying capacity of the cable under field conditions and In is the current rating of the overcurrent protection device.
Overcurrent protection nominal rating In=1,1 ´ NSA´ ISTRING MAX. Where NSA is the number of strings in parallel, ISTRING MAX is the max current of the PV strings: ISTRING MAX = 1,25 * KCorr x ISC MOD,Where Kcorr is a location and design correction factor. For bifacial modules it is usually 1.1 (however it can be determined by other methods described in IEC62548). ISC MOD is the module short circuit current.
If there is no overcurrent protection device in the circuit, plant owners need to consider the maximum forward current and maximum reverse current that may flow through the DC cable and then take the larger value of the two when selecting the cable.
When designing and installing DC cabling, it's essential to calculate the current-carrying capacity of the cable under certain field conditions, to ensure the cable is not overloaded. An empirical formula can be used to determine the current carrying capacity of the cable after derating (Iz): The formula includes various factors affecting the nominal current carrying capacity (I0) including different soil temperatures (f1), multiple cables laid in parallel directly in the soil (f2), soil thermal resistance (f3), and buried depths (f4).
A large, ground-mounted PV power station in the Middle East used the following process to analyze and determine DC cable selection, for safety and performance.
The PV array comprises: Bifacial modules, generating 540 W with maximum power usage; a rated voltage of 41.3 V, a maximum power point current of 13.13 A, a short-circuit current of 13.89 A, and 70% bifaciality of the PV modules; 28 modules in series in a PV string; the photovoltaic support adopts a horizontal single-axis tracking system and the height above ground is 1.5 m; a DC combiner box with 16-in and 1-out is adopted; The whole PV array has 30 DC combiner boxes integrated into centralized inverters; Kcorr is 1.1, which is simulated by PVsyst software; desired cable current carrying capacity Iz=In=1,1 ´ NSA´ ISTRING MAX=1.1*16*1.25*1.1*13.89=336.14A; Total derating factor: Ktot= 0.93´0.75´0.8´1=0.558; and cable nominal current-carrying capacity: I0=Iz/Ktot=336.14/0.558=602.4A.
Based on the PV array configuration, the nominal current carrying capacity of the DC cable used in this case should be greater than 602.4 A.
The nominal current carrying capacity of the cable is selected based on the manufacturer's datasheet (or according to cable selection standard IEC60364-5-52, but the corresponding derating coefficient must also be selected according to that standard).
The formula resulted in a recommendation of two parallel, 2×300 mm2 aluminum DC cables from the PV string combiner box to the inverter. The cable length was also reviewed to ensure that the voltage drop of the DC cable, and total cable losses, met project-specified requirements. To ensure the DC voltage drop is less than 2%, the specifications of some long-distance cables should be increased from 2×300 mm2 to 2×400 mm2. It should also be noted the cable laying coefficient will be further reduced when two cables are laid in parallel.
Due to the radiation, temperature rise, gain at the back of the bifacial modules, and the derating coefficient of the cables, DC cables with a thicker diameter will be applied, increasing cost. With the purpose of controlling costs and ensuring plant safety, the DC cable length should be shortened or the DC current should be limited by power electronics equipment such as string inverters.
In a central inverter configuration, multiple PV strings are connected in parallel into a DC combiner box, and multiple combiner boxes are connected, in parallel, into the inverter.
Image: Huawei
Therefore, the maximum output current at the combiner box and the input current at the inverter are constantly varying and of significant uncertainty. There are safety risks and additional design margins that must be considered during electrical equipment selection (of fuses, disconnectors, and cables in the PV sub-array and PV array), which significantly increase the final balance-of-system cost.
By contrast, string inverter solutions convert fluctuating, uncertain energy on the PV side into controllable electricity output. The inverter limits the current output. Thus, the diameter of the inverter output cable does not need to consider changes in light and temperature or bifaciality. This enables designers to select the most cost-effective cables and overcurrent protection devices. Moreover, string inverters have a shorter DC cable and lower DC voltage drop, which results in less mismatch loss and more inherent electricity generation.
Image: Huawei
Unlike conventional power plants, the operating current of PV modules is greatly affected by environmental conditions and bifacial gain. These factors need to be fully considered in cable selection during the design phase, along with restrictions on voltage drop and cable losses, to ensure the long term return on investment of PV plants.

“One of the main novelties of this work is that the simplicity of the model allows us to incorporate a wider range of performance influences than have previously been investigated, ranging from empirical fits to predict the photovoltaic response of the solar cells, to the costs and benefits for both heating and cooling of the building, to using architectural design guidelines to estimate the quality and value of the modified interior lighting,” researcher Eric Johlin told pv magazine. “In particular, we find that lighting quality can make significant differences in the optimal design, depending on the location and orientation of the building in question.”
The proposed framework covers design constraints for PV shade systems, weather and radiation data, building properties and orientation, and solar module specifications, according to “Multi-objective optimization of building integrated photovoltaic solar shades,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The energy modeling considers solar electricity, heat transferred through windows, and daylighting inside buildings. 
“Each value function can be used as a criterion for optimization alone, or in combinations together,” the academics said.
They applied the proposed modeling to a room with a square 55 m2 footprint, no obstructing surroundings, and with two south-facing and two east-facing windows across five different locations: Canada, California, Iran, Germany, and Singapore. The researchers said that the recurring yearly value of the BIPV system needs to be weighed against the upfront cost.
“It is important to note that while the overall value function may stay at a similar level between design modifications, the balance between the three specific value functions may change significantly,” they said. “The actual decision of which point is economically optimal will depend on the current price of PV cells and modules, installation and frame material costs, as well as the discount rate of the owner.”
In non-tropical climates, the value of the BIPV installation increases because fewer, longer shades are used according to location and building specifications, the scientists said. 
“We showed that it is important to recognize the value produced by the window without shades to compare to when considering the true BIPV system value, as this can be significantly positive or negative, again depending on location and building specifics,” concluded Johlin.

“The first novelty of this work lies in the development of comprehensive thermal network models for a typical house for two different system configurations,” they said.
The two configurations consist of a standard heat pump system coupled with a hot-water cylinder and an advanced configuration featuring a heat pump system paired with two phase-change material (PCM) thermal storage systems. PCMs can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
“Thermal storage volumes typical of heat pump products for small- or medium-sized dwellings (200 L) are assumed for the two configurations, aiming to demonstrate whether economic savings can be achieved even in the presence of significant space limitations,” the scientists explained, noting that they used data sheets from different manufacturers to develop performance models of the PV and heat pump systems. “Another contribution of this work is that all scenarios are conducted for two different, carefully selected, locations: Oban in Scotland, UK, a location which experiences low solar irradiance and mild temperatures, and Munich in Southern Germany, which is a sunny location with large diurnal and seasonal temperature variations.”
The first system configuration features an ASHP, including a backup electric heater, an array of heat emitters, a hot-water cylinder and a PV system. The latter is only used to power the heat pump, while the remaining power is taken from the grid.
The second system design includes an ASHP, two separate PCM thermal stores, an array of heat emitters, and a PV array.
“The main differences to the first configuration are that the hot-water cylinder has been replaced by a PCM thermal store and the ASHP does not provide SH directly, as a second PCM thermal store acts as a buffer between heat supplied by the ASHP and SH demand,” the researchers explained.
They estimated DHW demand for a single-week probabilistic demand profile, with the reference supply temperature being 43 C. They described this as the typical range for baths, showers, and other domestic hot-water applications.
They developed the system with a heat pump with a nominal heating capacity of 8.5 kW and a minimum heating capacity of 3.2 kW in both configurations. The backup electric heater has a fixed output of 3 kW and the PV system relies on eight panels with a combined area of 13 square meters. They compared the systems with that of an unoptimized baseline case, which was taken to be the standard configuration.
“The work involved the development of comprehensive thermal network models for a typical house,” the academics said.
They found that the system with the two PCM thermal stores offered the best potential for cost savings, which they estimated at up to 39% per year in the United Kingdom and at 29% in Germany.
“Depending on the objective function, configuration and location, the system seasonal coefficient of performance (COP) varies between 2.4 and 2.8,” they said.
They described the systems in “Operational optimization of an air-source heat pump system with thermal energy storage for domestic applications,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management. They claim that operational costs can be lowered by avoiding peak electricity-price hours.

PNNL researchers have investigated how energy storage used as a transmission asset could also be operated and compensated as a market participant, primarily in energy markets.
As an example of storage used as transmission, Jeremy Twitchell, a senior energy analyst at PNNL, said in a recent webinar that Midwest grid operator MISO selected a $12 million storage project as a transmission asset in Wisconsin, instead of a $13 million transmission project. MISO’s storage-as-transmission project will recover its cost through MISO’s transmission system rates, approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), he said, and will not participate in energy markets.
The opportunity for dual use of such a project arises because “even on fully contracted, heavily used transmission lines, there is unused capacity most of the time,” Twitchell said. “We build the grid based on peak needs plus reserve margins, but we’re only at that peak a few hours a year.”
That means storage, when it’s not being used as transmission, “can go do other things,” he said. FERC “recognized this in 2017,” Twitchell said, and issued a policy statement saying that storage deployed as a transmission asset can also provide market services.
“FERC was doing this to reduce system costs,” he said, adding that FERC cautioned that a storage asset cannot recover all its costs as a transmission asset, and also recover all its costs as a generation asset, “and keep it all,” because in that case there’s no cost reduction.
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and MISO began exploring how to respond to FERC’s nonbinding policy statement, Twitchell said, with CAISO considering how market revenues could be shared with customers, but both closed their proceedings without resolving the complexities of market participation and compensation for dual-use storage.
Without clear compensation mechanisms to enable developers to recover the costs of energy storage investments, the investments “will not go forward,” said Charlie Vartanian, a senior technical at PNNL who moderated the webinar.

It also sets an EU-level binding target to make renewables account for at least 32% of the electricity mix by 2030.
“The deadline for implementing such a directive was July 2021,” Mihaela Nyerges, a partner at law firm Vlăsceanu, Nyerges & Partners, told pv magazine. “Through these reasoned opinions, the commission granted such member states a two-month term to comply with the transposition obligation or else it may initiate the infringement process. Against such background, this emergency ordinance has not been published yet in the official gazette so it is not yet in force, but such should occur during the next days. The new legal enactment provides new important rules regarding prosumers.”
The new provisions will simplify the grid-connection process for renewable projects below 10.8 kW in size.
“Within six months from the entry into force of the emergency ordinance, the Romanian Energy Regulatory Authority must adopt a simple notification procedure for ensuring the connection to the grid of prosumers’ installations,” Nyerges said. “Such a procedure should allow the distribution grid operator the right to reject the connection or to propose an alternative connection point within 15 days from such notification, based on grounded reasons related to the safety or technical incompatibility with the system.”
Nyerges said the Ministry of Energy recently defended the possibility of introducing a tax for prosumers. “The possibility to impose such taxes is to occur toward the end of 2026 and entails the fulfillment of multiple requirements,” she said.
Romania launched a net metering scheme for distributed solar in 2018. Earlier this year, it raised the size limit for solar installations under the scheme to 400 kW.

Australian households and small businesses can use SunSPOT to determine which solar system sizes will give them the best returns on their investments. The tool offers cost estimates, as well as calculations for annual savings with different battery sizes.
“It’s the only independent tool tailored to your circumstances that’s publicly available in Australia. All other solar calculators seek to capture personal information and generate sales leads,” said Bruce. “Now, with nationwide delivery and improvements to its usability and accuracy, SunSPOT will be able to help the vast majority of Australians confidently navigate the complex solar market.”
Previous versions of APVI’s flagship tool have only been available in areas where there is spatial mapping LiDAR data available and the local council has taken up a subscription. Now there are two versions of SunSPOT available: the premium, council subscription version –which maps the area with LiDAR data – and the standard version, which is free for all Australians.
Users of the two versions can also add their smart meter data and electricity tariffs for more accurate estimates, if desired.
“Householders no longer need to depend on salespeople to educate them. With this latest version of SunSPOT, everyone can get reliable tailored answers to common questions about solar and batteries,” said Mike Roberts, SunSPOT project leader. “The APVI has found that Australia has the potential to install 179 GW of rooftop solar capacity – but so far we’ve installed less than 10% of that.”

Enphase plans to build four to six new microinverter manufacturing lines in the United States, CEO Badri Kothandaraman said in a recent ROTH Capital Partners webinar. The new lines are expected to add between 4.8 GW to 7.2 GW of new capacity.
Kothandaraman said that the company believes it will be able to keep a majority of the $0.11/W production tax credit (PTC) released under the US Inflation Reduction Act, although it remains uncertain how the credits will be paid out. He said that Enphase will not make a significant investment in US manufacturing unless it can secure a significant return on investment and retain 50% or more of the PTC value. 
Enphase said it plans to work with three contract manufacturers on the new capacity, two of which are current partners. Kothandaraman said the company will commit to at least three lines, regardless of the PTC credit results, to meet expected growth. 
Kothandaraman said that Enphase expects steady growth in the US residential sector, and “hyper growth” in Europe. He expects that European growth will more than double year on year in 2022, after doubling in 2021. ROTH said there remains potential for another doubling in 2023, but Enphase’s management has set more conservative guidance.

Last year, the country deployed 6,545.2 MW of new solar capacity. About 2,992 MW of the total came from centralized installations, 3,551 MW from distributed-generation solar arrays, and 2.2 MW from off-grid systems.
Izumi Kaizuka, the director of RTS Corp., said the Japanese market could reach a cumulative capacity of up to 90 GW by the end of 2023.
“We expect between 5 GW and 6 GW of new PV capacity both in 2022 and 2023,” Kaizuka told pv magazine, noting that the market share between centralized and distributed projects might not change substantially.
Large-scale will solar account for between 2.5 GW and 3 GW of all newly installed capacity this year.
“It will be mostly for projects under the expired feed-in tariff scheme for utility scale installations,” Kaizuka explained. “Only a small portion will come from auctions and the PPA market.”
Rooftop PV will account for the rest of this year's installations – especially commercial and industrial systems.
“Rising energy prices are currently pushing businesses to install solar installations under the feed-in tariff scheme,” said Kaizuka.
The feed-in tariffs for PV systems up to 10 kW will decrease from JPY 17 ($0.13)/kWh in 2022 to JPY 16/kWh this year, but only for surplus power. The tariffs for installations ranging in size from 10 kW to 50 kW will drop from JPY 11/kWh to JPY 10/kWh. The owners of such installations will be allowed to inject all electricity into the grid.
The tariff for PV systems ranging in size from 50 kW to 200 kW will decline from JPY 10/kWh to JPY 9.5/kWh. All systems larger than 200 kW will have to compete in auctions.
“The feed-in tariff scheme for rooftop PV will be in place until the end of next year and we don't know already what may come afterward,” said Kaizuka.
The IEA-PVPS said that PV system prices continued to drop in 2021. The price of residential PV systems up to 10 kW in size, for example, fell from JPY 231/W in 2020 to JPY 220/W in 2021. Prices for commercial installations ranging in size declined from JPY 187/W to JPY 178/W. The average price of ground-mounted PV plants over 1 MW, meanwhile, decreased from JPY 128/W to JPY 122/W.
Kaizuka acknowledged that Japan is dealing with limited land availability and high land costs. These issues are obstacles for the deployment of large-scale solar facilities.
“We may already have reached our tipping point,” she said, in reference to the availability of land for solar. “But I am confident that some support may come from local governments and prefectures, which may decide to allocate public land for this purpose. Currently, there is intense activity to define the zoning processes for either conventional ground mounted projects or agrivoltaic plants.”
Agrivoltaics could potentially become a new market driver for the Japanese energy market in the years to come. According to the IEA-PVPS, the combined capacity of all agrivoltaic systems deployed in the country reached 300 MW at the end of December.
