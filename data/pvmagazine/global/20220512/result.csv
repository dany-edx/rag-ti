Soon after our interview with paXos, Meyer Burger Gunter Erfurt spoke to pv magazine on the show floor. Erfurt was unable to provide a definitive date for the market debut of its new solar tiles, which had previously been earmarked for a 2022 launch.
However, Erfurt was able to say that the company has determined that in the DACH region  – Germany, Austria and Switzerland – the company sees a “theoretical market of 2 GW for solar tiles. In France we saw an additional market of 1.6 GW … after seeing so much potential, we didn’t see the need to keep counting.”

The solar tile market is famously difficult to crack, as demonstrated by the Tesla solar roof. In 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk admitted that the company had made “significant mistakes” in its solar roof projects, and conceded that rooftops are actually a lot more complicated than he initially thought.
Erfurt said the key to unlocking the solar tile market will be quality and flexibility. That means not simply gluing Chinese solar cells to existing roof tiles, as has been done in the past, and certainly not making one of Tesla's mistakes, which was to make their solar-tiled rooftops a single complete system.
“Unlike Tesla, we can replace tiles individually in the unlikely event that they are damaged or need replacement, rather than integrated tiles, which can be replaced individually,” said Erfurt.
What Meyer Burger is able to do is take quality solar tile technology and incorporate its solar cell expertise to ensure quality.
“Whereas some competitors’ cell-efficiency hovers around the 6% t0 8% mark, our solar tiles are almost on par with our traditional modules,” said Erfurt.

At Intersolar 2022, paXos is showcasing a range of new innovative applications, including its “Solar Solar Beaver Tail Tiles, which come in black and, more importantly, terracotta.
Building-integrated PV (BIPV) is having a strong showing at Intersolar 2022, which is a good sign that the still-niche application is finally on the verge of more widespread adoption. As the long tussle between PV engineers and architects attests, the main opposition to widespread adoption is aesthetic in nature. However, innovations such as paXos's terracotta Beaver Tail are promising, as many European buildings are historical, listed structures requiring a certain level of aesthetic appeal.
In many European countries, such as Poland, the use of plain tiles is widespread, and demand for BIPV is proving to be indelibly tied to the technology's ability to remain inconspicuous. Marius Nennewitz, a paXos project manager, told pv magazine that the Beaver Tail tiles were designed in partnership with Fraunhofer ISE, in order to reduce their reflectivity, in line with local requirements. The result is a duller, rusty colored tile.
Like the Solar Roof Tile Mild-Hybrid product that paXos sold to Meyer Burger, the individual tiles can be removed and replaced as required. PaXos has ensured that the tiles have high hail and storm suction resistance, while maintaining the walkability of rooftops. However, the heat utilization is lower than in mild-hybrid systems, in favor of aesthetic improvements.

The plant generates green hydrogen via alkaline electrolysis technology.
The project is fully independent of the grid. It is co-located with a solar project in the state’s Ujjain district. 
“An existing solar plant of Vivaan Solar was disconnected by Hygenco from the grid and fully reconfigured for the green hydrogen plant. In this process, swathing changes were made in the solar plant using technologies not yet prevalent in India,” Hygenco CEO Amit Bansal told pv magazine. “Hygenco executed the project as the sole builder (EPC), owner (investor), and operator of the plant. No EPCs were involved in this case, reflecting Hygenco’s technical capability.”
The plant started trial operations on March 31 and was fully commissioned by April 15.  
“This pilot plant will be part of our R&D Center of Excellence in hydrogen technologies,” said Bansal. “We hope to provide clean and affordable hydrogen for end-use industries and facilitate their journey to decarbonize operations.”
Hygenco’s green hydrogen pilot plant is controlled by an advanced energy management and control system (EMCS). The EMCS monitors parameters such as solar PV generation, state of charge, hydrogen generation, pressure, temperature, and purities from the electrolyzer and makes autonomous decisions in real time to achieve high efficiencies. The technology enables Hygenco to augment the hydrogen yield and deliver cost-competitive hydrogen to the end clients.
Hygenco, based in the Indian state of Haryana, aims to become a global leader in deploying green hydrogen and green ammonia-powered industry solutions. It designs, engineers, optimizes, and commissions end-to-end green hydrogen and green ammonia assets on a build-own-operate and build-own-operate-transfer basis.

The University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the University of Newcastle (UoN) said this week that they will lead an industry-backed R&D, clean energy and recycling business to “help Australia and the world transition to sustainable recycling and clean energy solutions and systems.”
The federal government said this week it will contribute AUD 50 million ($34.5 million) over four years as part of its Trailblazer Universities Program, to leverage more than AUD 220 million of co-investment from the universities and their industry partners. UNSW and UoN will contribute AUD 50 million in cash and AUD 47 million of in-kind investments to the initiative. The universities said more than 20 industry partners have already expressed support for the initiative and have committed more than AUD 130 million in cash and in-kind contributions.
UNSW Deputy Vice-Chancellor Nicholas Fisk said the Australian Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy program is targeting the commercialization of at least 63 new products. Development and commercialization efforts will be in four priority areas: electrification, energy systems and storage; sustainable fuels and chemicals manufacturing with a special focus on Power-to-X (P2X) production methods for hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels; next generation solar PV and systems; and recycling and MICROfactories.
“Our projects, partnerships and investment under this initiative will accelerate a decade’s worth of change in just four years and create a legacy in industry-university collaboration,” Fisk said. “It is truly national, with projects in metropolitan and regional areas, and in all Australian states and territories, and beyond.”
The initiative has attracted 27 industry partners, including 23 small businesses. They will work with the universities to develop and research commercialization initiatives for clean energy solutions and systems, including developing ultra-low-cost solar with cutting-edge engineering. They will also build the first at-scale printed solar manufacturing plant, providing the step-change needed to vault the technology to full commercialization.
In addition, the program will look to develop and commercialize lightweight hydrogen storage that can deliver for transport and fuel replacement needs, while also looking to extend the success of green steel technology to other metals such as aluminum.
UoN Vice-Chancellor Professor Alex Zelinsky said the program would deliver real-world outcomes and “accelerate Australia’s clean energy and recycling industries and bring more, greener technologies to Australians.”
“This program will transform the way technology readiness, commercialization and industry-led research are prioritised, taught and rewarded in our universities with targeted opportunities for university staff and students to succeed,” he said.
The collaboration builds on the NSW state government’s announcement that a AUD 15 million Decarbonisation Innovation Hub would be based at UNSW Sydney. The hub is a key part of the state government’s Net Zero Industry and Innovation Program and will bring together government, industry, and researchers to fast-track technologies to decarbonize New South Wales.

AutoGrid, a specialist in AI-driven optimization for distributed energy resources (DERs), has signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Schneider Electric.
Schneider Electric and AutoGrid are no strangers to one another, as they have previously partnered on a fully integrated advanced distribution management system, as well as a distributed energy resources management system (DERMS), which was released two years ago.
Schneider Electric focuses on products for sustainability and efficiency, including XW Pro and SW hybrid inverters, MPPT charge controllers, power distribution panels, InsightHome and InsightFacility edge devices, and accessories. Three years ago, it pulled out of the utility-scale segment in order to strengthen its profile in the residential and commercial and industrial space.
“Schneider Electric and AutoGrid have a shared vision for a more sustainable world through electrification, digitization and decarbonization. With AutoGrid, we can deliver significant value to energy companies by delivering cutting-edge technologies to drive adoption of smart grids and reduction of carbon emissions,” said Nadège Petit, chief innovation officer at Schneider Electric.
AutoGrid’s product smooths out sudden fluctuations in renewable energy supply and customer energy demands. The company’s AI-powered virtual power plant (VPP) and DERMS offers a sustainable fossil-fuel dependent backup power plants by managing and deploying additional untapped capacity from batteries, electric vehicles, and flexible load.
“Joining forces with AutoGrid will give customers the most advanced platform to integrate and orchestrate distributed energy resources for the benefit of all grid stakeholders,” said Luis D’Acosta, executive vice president of digital energy at Schneider Electric. “These new capabilities will accelerate prosumer engagement for a more sustainable and efficient grid.”
In February, Schneider Electric purchased a controlling stake in EnergySage, an online comparison-shopping marketplace for rooftop solar, energy storage, project financing, and community solar. The capital from that acquisition is expected to allow EnergySage to accelerate its growth and product innovation.

Korea Zinc’s Australian subsidiary, Ark Energy, has completed its purchase of Sydney-based renewables developer Epuron Holdings, in a deal that gives it access to a potential 9 GW pipeline of utility-scale wind and solar PV projects.
Ark Energy said the acquisition includes 4.2 GW of early-stage utility-scale wind and solar development projecta across Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM), with a focus on the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania. It will also acquire 4.8GW of projects in the investigation stage and a 50% stake in Fulcrum3D, a renewables monitoring and forecasting specialist. In addition, the deal includes the acquisition of Epuron’s 7 MW portfolio of fully contracted off-grid solar assets in the Northern Territory.
Ark Energy Chairman and Korea Zinc Vice Chairman Yun Choi said the purchase, which was first announced in December, will support its ambition to become a major domestic supplier and exporter of green hydrogen and fast track the parent company’s vision to become one of the world’s largest producers of green zinc.
“The acquisition of Epuron is an important milestone for Ark Energy to become a world-class green independent power producer and green hydrogen business,” he said.

“Our company has currently a capacity of 12 GW for both cells and modules spread across Korea, Malaysia, China and the US,” CEO Justin Lee told pv magazine at a press briefing for the Smarter E event in Munich, Germany.
It wants to invest $320 million in the expansion plan, of which $170 million will be devoted to the construction of a 1.4 GW factory at an unspecified location in the United States. Another $150 million will be used to expand cell capacity in South Korea, where the new investment will increase domestic cell capacity to 5.4 GW.
The new US factory is expected to begin production in the first half of next year. This will raise its total US panel capacity, which also includes a 1.7 GW manufacturing facility in Georgia, to more than 3 GW.
“We see strong demand for Made in America modules, especially among the residential sector,” said Lee.
He noted the importance of the polysilicon supply chain that the company is setting up in the US market, where Hanwha Solutions recently acquired a stake in REC Silicon, with the aim of supporting the company in restarting its factory in Moses Lake, Washington, in 2023.
“Currently, we are still sourcing around 95% our ingots and wafers from China, but this will change soon, as we have also recently signed a $1.2 billion deal with Korean manufacturer OCI, which is increasing its manufacturing capacity in Malaysia,” Lee said. “We are not planning, however, to restart our own polysilicon production in Korea,” he also stated.
The company also plans to improve the carbon footprint of its products, as a big portion of the power supply used for new production, or polysilicon supply, should come from hydropower or other emissions-free energy sources.
“Growing uncertainties tell us that securing reliable, sustainable energy has become more important than ever before,” Lee said. “To do this, Q Cells will increase renewable supply from diversified sources and find cleaner ways to produce energy. That way, we will contribute to both energy security and net-zero emissions.”
Lee said the company is open to building more factories in other parts of the world.
“But carbon footprint rules would not be enough and other incentives such tax credits may be necessary,” he said in response to a question about whether the company would be open to producing PV modules in Europe.
The regional diversification of the company’s production activities is also a response to the crisis triggered by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
“High polysilicon prices and logistics costs are becoming unsustainable,” he said, noting that shipping costs currently account for between €0.04/W and €0.06/W per module. “We expect lower polysilicon prices before the end of the year or in early 2023, but we will never go back to 2019 levels.”

It said that the Proteus PV inverter is an upgrade over the existing Gamesa Electric 3X series.
The Proteus central inverter can be deployed in four configurations and can be combined with DC-coupled storage and AC storage. It can also be used for the conditioning of electrolyzers in green hydrogen generation.
“Proteus is related to the mythological figure that represents flexibility, speed, versatility and also has the ability to foresee and anticipate the future,” said Enrique de la Cruz, sales director of solar and storage at Gamesa Electric. “These are characteristics with which we feel very identified since they are part of the DNA of our solutions. In fact, one of the reasons why we consider this denomination so appropriate is that Proteus links perfectly with our motto: shaping new energy.”
The 1,500 V inverter solution has an efficiency rating of 99.45% and a European efficiency rating of 99.24%. It features Gamesa Electric’s CoolBrid cooling technology, with liquid cooling and forced-air cooling. Liquid cools the inverter bridge and grid filter, while forced air cools small components such as switches and fuses. The liquid is changed every five years. The outdoor design is rated at IP55, and operates at up to 60 C.
Gamesa Electric claimed to have achieved market-leading maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency. It said the MPPT voltage ranges from 835 V to 1,300 V. It has also claimed that the inverters offer best-in-class total harmonic distortion, with THDi at the 50th order reported at 0.7%.
It said it chose “Proteus” as the name of the new product “from more than a hundred alternatives proposed by the company’s workers.” The inverter won one of this year's prestigious Intersolar Awards.

The new 5k3XP battery can be connected to either low- or high-voltage inverters, thanks to a double circuit and an integrated battery management system that works without the need to add components.
“Our new battery can work in parallel as a low voltage storage system or in series to work in voltage, without the need for accessories or special programming,” Giorgio Tibolla, the company's sales manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told pv magazine
The 5.3 kWh battery can be used as a wall solution or in a stackable configuration. Thanks to a special casing, up to 15 modules can be stacked without additional components. It measures 580 mm x 463 mm x 155 mm and has a weight of 57.3 kg.
The device can purportedly operate for more than 8,000 cycles and deliver up to 98.8% of stored energy. The energy density of the module is around 335 Wh.
In low-voltage mode, the storage system can be connected in parallel to form a low-voltage system with up to 105 batteries, providing for a storage capacity of up to 548 kWh. In high-voltage mode, the storage systems can be connected in series to form a cluster with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V (DC), with the clusters stacked in 10 towers composed of 16 modules each, providing a storage capacity of up to 836 kWh.
The lithium-ion system uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has an ambient operating temperature range of -20 C to 45 C. Nanographene used in the chemical solution contributes to the stability and duration of the LiFeP04 chemistry used in the battery, said the manufacturer.
“This new version is equipped with a device with artificial intelligence capable of communicating with the WeCo Cloud database, ensuring correct operation also based on seasonality and temperatures,” Tibolla explained. “It is also able to dynamically manage the charging and discharging functions of the solar inverter also connected to electric vehicle charging stations.”
The company produces the batteries at its facility in Italy and at a factory in China, where its unit WeCo Batteries China is operating. “We are also considering the opening of a factory in the US,” said Tibolla.

It has raised the density of the panels by eliminating the empty spaces between the cells.
“REC’s advanced gapless cell connections allow to increase power while keeping the panel compact,” the company's head of global PR, Agnieszka Schulze, told pv magazine. “In addition, it eliminates soldering for better build quality and reduces cell stress for long-term durability.”
The REC Alpha Pure-R Series is available in three versions, with power ratings ranging from 410 W to 430 W, and efficiencies of 21.2% to 22.3%. The new product is made with 80 heterojunction, half-cut monocrystalline solar cells and its maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
The open-circuit voltage is between 55.8 V and 56.3 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 7.12 A to 7.24 A.  All three versions of the solar module measure 1,730 mm × 1,118 mm ×30 mm and weigh in at 21.5 kg.
The panel can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C and the operating temperature coefficient is -0.26% per degree Celsius. It is enclosed between 3.2 mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, and also features a junction box with an IP 68 rating, a black polymer backsheet, and an anodized aluminum frame.
The manufacturer offers a 20-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. It said the module series is eligible for the premium REC ProTrust warranty package, which offers up to 25 years coverage on product, performance and labor, with a guaranteed power of at least 92% in year 25 of operation.
“Featuring heterojunction (HJT) cells in the large G12 format in a patented panel design, REC’s newest product delivers power output of up to 430 Wp, while keeping the module under twom² in area,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “This makes the new product ideal for residential installations where space is limited.”
The company will start production of the REC Alpha Pure-R module at its facility in Singapore in August.
“The new product will be sold in all REC markets across the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific,” a company spokesperson said.

Swiss start-up Hero.wind is taking a new approach to rooftop solar.
Its modules combine photovoltaic, solar thermal, and wind power generation with the 50 cm by 38 cm product featuring 12 half-cut PERC cells.
The start-up rates the PV efficiency of its panel at 20% and it will likely be a bit more, says Korab Shabani, project lead at the business.
The reason for that is active liquid cooling on the back of module that cools the cells. The heat is not wasted as it creates a 45 degree Celsius circuit of warm liquid which can then be used to heat up water for showering or use in radiators.
There are wind channels at the top of the module that lead to small, computer fan-sized rotors. These miniature wind turbines are said to produce 5 watts.
Asked about whole-system efficiency, Shabani said there is no real calculation, yet. But that might follow from two pilot installations, in Switzerland and Germany.
Beatriz Santos was part of the crowd drawn to hear German superstar Everest climber Reinhold Messner discuss sustainability at the E3/DC booth, where it looks like it's standing room only.
The solar Twitterati have swooped by the pv magazine booth, in the form of pv magazine USA editor John Weaver, AKA Commercial Solar Guy and @SolarInMASS plus solar legend BloombergNEF's Jenny Chase (@solar_chase).
Chase is known both for her adroit insights into the solar industry and her prodigious goose breeding.
While with us today, Chase provided a typically sharp-witted take on this year’s Intersolar. She started on a rather apologetic note, feeling her previous predictions of declining module prices – that have yet to come to fruition – may have played a role in delayed module procurement decisions; although she did admit the industry would have probably waited anyway.
After she leaves Intersolar on the bus back to Switzerland, Chase’s job is to make the end-of-year module price predictions. Will they come down from the current high of $0.262 per Watt to a quarter? Feathers will fly either way.
It appears module buyers have given up expecting prices to come down any time soon and are starting to get back to the business of building projects again. Particularly as developers are keen to lock in financing before central banks raise interest prices further.
Chase observed people appear to be flocking to the German solar market; although in the wider industry there are a lot of delayed projects, particularly those to be developed under tender, which developers will either have to abandon or build at a loss – due to increasing component costs, inflation, and interest rates. According to Chase, African projects in particular, are likely to be worst affected.
This year saw records fly in terms of exports, she said, with China hitting an all-time high of $4.1 billion in March, with India buying the bulk of those products, probably due to a rush to supply the market before the 40% import tariff which took effect at the start of April. From March on, Europe was the recipient, with a record $1.9 billion in exports reaching the EU from China. Chase doesn’t believe that is down the Russia-Ukraine conflict either.
Dampening the joy, while some European solar manufacturing plans appear to have been fully incubated, Chase does not believe the continent will be successful in re-establishing a strong domestic base; rather a few isolated factories supplying the rooftop market will be the most concrete result, despite all the soaring production announcements.
Before taking flight, Chase said despite all the challenges, the overall mood from those she spoke to was “very excited!”

We Do Solar is the brainchild of Karolina Attspodina and Qian Qin and pv magazine had the pleasure of catching up with Qin at Intersolar to hear about the innovations behind the Berlin start-up, which is gearing up to deliver its first balcony solar modules to customers within three weeks.
Weighing in at a remarkable one kilogram, the product is a sleek, black solar module that can be clipped onto balconies or anywhere else there is sun and a power socket.
Taking the idea of plug-and-play a step further, the kit is designed for anyone to be able to install, without the need for an electrician or engineer.
The innovation is particularly interesting for people who rent or do not have a rooftop since it is also possible to unplug the module when its owner moves home.
There are three We Do Solar business models: You can buy the kit outright for €1,299; if you have an electric vehicle, you can exchange your CO2 certificates for a free kit; or employers can take advantage of an employee benefit program.
Given the made-in-China module’s low weight, it can be shipped as a package and it comes wrapped in paper, rather than plastic.
There are too many other exciting details to go into here, so watch out for a longer article on We Do Solar next week!
Laser expert 3D-Micromac is confident future cell and module concepts will require even more cutting.
And in Europe, at least, manufacturers seem fairly convinced the company's thermal laser separation process is the best option and a sure way to avoid damage to the edge of cells.

And on the orders side, they told us to watch this space for a big announcement that will be on the way soon!
As has been widely reported, Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries has been on a solar shopping spree in recent months. One of the beneficiaries was Sterling & Wilson, also based in India, with Reliance taking at 40% stake in the global engineering, procurement and construction services provider.
Sterling & Wilson CEO Amit Jain told pv magazine that with $100 billion in revenues, Reliance is a great partner to have with a global reach and strong financing to help the EPC execute its plans.
The investor will also be able to help supply components along the solar value chain. In India, for example, Reliance has plans to install 100 GW of projects by 2030 and Sterling & Wilson expects to be a “frontrunner” in executing that pipeline.
The developer suffered project delays and a hit to its margins last year thanks to those very supply chain constraints, said Jain, however work is picking up again and many projects are nearing completion.
The CEO believes the next couple of quarters will be more positive and 2023 will see price and supply issues resolved and stability restored.
In other trends, Jain expects to see “solar taking off in a big way” next year and after, with many more projects coupled with hydrogen, particularly in Spain and North Africa. There will also be a shift away from smaller projects to very large scale sites, perhaps in the multi-gigawatt range alongside hydrogen, wind turbines and energy storage.
Having recently opened its first European office, in Spain, Sterling & Wilson is now targeting debut projects this year in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Holland, and Romania. Initially, its pipeline will be between 500 MW and 1 GW, although no concrete details are available as yet.
The temperature is rising at the Intersolar show and pv magazine‘s answer to David Attenborough, Tristan Rayner, appears to have found one sad victim.
You recall that proud AE Solar polar bear promoting the company's products yesterday, right?
NYSE-listed iron flow battery specialist ESS is expanding into Europe with its first deployment in Spain already in operation.
A project commissioned by Enel Green Power and coupled with a solar farm, features 17 of ESS' long-duration Warehouse iron flow battery systems with a cumulative capacity of 8 MWh.
As pv magazine passed the company booth, we saw staff talking with another major Spanish utility: Iberdrola. While ESS is clearly negotiating projects and seeing strong demand for its systems in Europe, the company still hasn’t decided where to set up its European headquarters.
European insurance policies, however, are in place. ESS systems are supplied with what the company claims is an industry-unique 10-year warranty through Munich Re for its flow battery technology and electrolyte management system, supporting system performance guarantee regardless of project size or location.
And the company is expanding its US-based production at a fast pace. As Alan Greenshields, ESS director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa told pv magazine, US production capacity stood at 250 MWh last year but is now already topping 2GWh. “The customer interest is massive,” Greenshields said.
ESS iron flow batteries provide 4-12 hours of storage and unlimited cycles with no capacity loss. The product is made using earth-abundant materials such as iron, salt, and water, which makes it low-cost, sustainable, and safe.
And while lithium-ion might have a lower capital cost per kilowatt-hour, ESS' company’s iron flow system can reportedly claim parity at four hours, and win thereafter..
Compared to their technological cousins – vanadium-flow batteries – iron flow claims to win by a large margin. According to Greenshields, the cost of iron-flow stands at around $20/kWh whereas vanadium-flow costs can be as much as $200/kWh.
M10 this week lifted an Intersolar Award for its ‘shingled matrix’ – surely one of the most innovative new manufacturing solutions on show this year: Cells cut into 5-7 pieces are assembled into the “matrix” – allowing for huge flexibility in module size and shape.
At the company booth, M10’s Marco Saladin told pv magazine the approach makes far more efficient use of the silver-containing glue than other shingled module approaches, using as little as 1 gram per module, a mere 10% of the amount used in a typical shingled module.
M10 has begun manufacturing the machines with joint venture partner Zahoransky, and says it will soon be supplying tools to two customers, one which makes building-integrated PV products and another which produces conventional solar modules.
IHS Markit solar analyst Josefin Berg, an Intersolar veteran, has described the intensity of this year’s show as being back at 2010-levels.
Sitting down with pv magazine for a chat about the market data company’s solar PV market outlook for 2022 and beyond, Berg said “PV in Europe is beginning a strong growth period.”
And that mood has certainly been reflected on the ground here at Intersolar Europe.
Whether manufacturing will return to Europe on a large scale “is the big question,” Berg said.
We’ll have to wait for more details on the European Commission’s REPowerEU policies but the analyst added: “European companies are certainly preparing for it.”
This week, things are looking particularly rosy for Europe’s factory equipment suppliers, with a few large projects already in the works, and plenty more signalling serious interest! Stand by for more updates from Mark Hutchins in hall A3…
Trina's new control system for trackers, the SuperTrack, promises up to 8% more yield through improved behavior under cloudy skies and better “backtracking” on complex terrain.
First test installations in China have shown promising results, according to the manufacturer. In June, the first ground-mounted systems in Spain and Chile will be equipped with the system.
While conventional tracker algorithms are primarily based on the astronomical position of the sun, according to José Carlos Talavera, head of project management at Trina Tracker, this is not always the best decision.
An overcast sky, in combination with bifacial modules, would see the optimum of direct radiation and reflections from the ground deviate from the standard orientation, for example.
The Trina software now automatically, through a self-learning process, determines the optimal setting and adjusts the trackers accordingly.
Presenting the new product at Trina's booth at Intersolar, Abel Córdoba de S García, from the company's tracker development department, said the model takes into account a dozen different parameters, where only four were previously used.
The second improvement concerns the backtracking. The tracker control ensures individual rows do not shade each other. In complex terrain with hills and valleys, however, this decision must be adjusted row by row. Here, Trina promises more precise control. At the same time, the system learns which setting leads to minimization of shadowing.
Another interesting feature is that Trina shares the data from the sensors, such as pyranometers and snow sensors, on a system level. If a sensor fails, the row affected can still be controlled.
During tests in Hebei and Jiangsu in China, Trina equipped individual strings of power plants with the new Supertrack system. Talavera said 3.84% yield increases were achieved in Heibei during the test. On typical days, with overcast skies, the new solution reportedly performed 8% better.
In Jiangsu, a 4.6% increase in yield was achieved on typically sunny days, and 9.4% on overcast days.
Since the new system causes practically no additional costs, Talavera said, he assumes it will become the new standard after a start-up phase.
If PV is the element connecting more and more technology, as we can see here at the trade fair, it is becoming increasingly clear plenty of products are also geared to work whether the sun is shining or not.
One of those key technologies is the heat pump, which allows fossil-fuel-free heating.
One company that takes the coupling of solar and heat seriously is M-tec. The company produces its own air-to-water and geothermal heat pumps and the challenge lies in the controls, CEO Peter Huemer told Cornelia Lichner.
It is very important the heat pump can adjust its output and work even with a low solar electricity surplus.
SG-ready is by no means sufficient for the controller because it only transmits switch-on and switch-off commands. Instead, a heat pump must be given precise instructions by its energy manager about the amount of electricity available, said Huemer. The heat pump can then store heat in different heating circuits so it is available when the sun has gone down.
The system is also good for solar optimization if the heat pump can operate with source management. M-tec heat pumps can use five sources, be it geothermal energy, roof absorbers, or ice storage, for example, in order to always use the energetically cheapest source. Oh, and not to forget – the heat pumps can also cool in summer.
For the REPowerEU plan to deliver more affordable, secure, and sustainable energy, the roll-out of battery storage will play a key role.
However, the lack of uniform certification on a pan-European level is not making things easy for battery manufacturers. According to Sven Albersmeier-Braun, head of international business at Senec, such a standard is the missing link to securing Europe’s energy future.
Lengthy and complicated certification processes are also hindering the roll-out of batteries Down Under. For Senec, the most challenging aspect is requirements which can be changed by regulators, plus the complexity of certification processes. After that, of course, getting onto the Clean Energy Council (CEC) of Australia's list of approved products presents another layer of certification.
To further complicate matters, the Senec executive said, Australia lacks the testing facilities needed to achieve certification for three-phase battery inverters so manufacturers are being redirected to China or back to Europe for testing. There have been reports some European manufacturers have even been de-listed by certification bodies in Australia due to the introduction of new requirements.
For Germany’s Sonnen, keeping product rolling off its local manufacturing lines is also no simple business. According to Nathan Dunn, who heads the company’s Aussie operations, certifications are the biggest pain point and hindrance to its ambitious manufacturing plans in South Australia – and also to bringing new products to market. Late last year, Sonnen launched its Evo battery in Australia but the company has not still managed to secure CEC certification.
Our head honcho Eckhart Gouras is getting the crowd warmed up at the booth of Sofarsolar, where the manufacturer is launching its PowerAll product.
If you get along to the stand you can get more details.
There is a strange mix of positivity and negativity on the show floor this year, with big expectations for solar market growth and manufacturing being tempered by the conflict and supply chain constraints that are driving demand.
As Nicolas Chouleur and Ragna Schmidt-Haupt, of consultant Everoze, shared when they swung by pv magazine’s booth, politicians in many regions have barely begun to consider the size of the challenge that securing a reliable, clean energy supply presents.
It is land availability that the pair see as the first big bottleneck, meaning agrivoltaics will need to be developed and rolled out rapidly to offer anything close to a solution to rising global temperatures.
Singaporean solar manufacturer REC, recently acquired by Reliance Industries, celebrated its Alpha Pure-R at Intersolar with hats!
A booming presentation engulfed nearby booths and many rounds of applause could be heard. And the biggest cheers? When chief exec Jan Enno Bicker closed his speech with the stirring words: “The bar's open!”
PS: The blog has been informed REC's new Alpha Pure-R module was one of this year's Intersolar Award winners, which were announced on Tuesday.
*This copy was amended on 12/05/22 to indicate REC is based on Singapore, not Norway, as previously reported.
In these times of disrupted supply chains and logistical challenges, it’s not easy to secure timely delivery without damage, writes Jonathan Gifford.
The proof of that has been on display at one solar manufacturers’ booth at Intersolar – with a module on display that was a little worse for wear. The panel’s front glass was smashed in two different locations on the single module.
Perhaps the manufacturer should have tapped the services of the PVpallet – which claims to be able to reduce transportation damage with its nifty, specialized module-transportation solution. The company was one of the finalists for the 2022 Intersolar Award – in which the top gongs went to Gamesa Electric, M10 Solar Equipment, and REC. There will be more from the award winners later.
With busted modules and booths still under construction during the show, perhaps logistical solutions deserve a higher profile.
Oh yeah, there's also the fact the Intersolar Award organizers had to go ahead with their ceremony on Tuesday “sans trophies” due to a logistical hiccup…
At Intersolar 2022's Green Hydrogen Forum, Hydrogen Europe chief executive Jorgo Chatzimarkakis gave an animated, not to say frustrated, response to a Bavarian questioner who thought it inefficient to import green hydrogen from the Middle East, North Africa and elsewhere, implying Bavaria could generate green hydrogen for Bavarians.
“I'm getting angry with this narrative,” said Chatzimarkakis, “it keeps coming up.”
The Hydrogen Europe head pointed out how much more efficient solar electricity produced in the highly irradiated MENA region was than its European equivalent, particularly from Germany. Indeed, it is far more cost-efficient to import the gas, even despite the added transport costs, a point supported by fellow panellist Veronika Grimm, economic theory chair of Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg, who was not as pessimistic as her name might suggest.
“We cannot transition away from fossil fuels without this cost-efficiency,” continued Chatzimarkakis. “I urge you to change this narrative, it's wrong. This small group with the wrong efficiency narrative has been hindering the transition. It can't just be ‘generate hydrogen in Bavaria for Bavarians.' That's not going to help us, it's more efficient to get green hydrogen from Morocco etc.”
QCells’ new Q.TRON module series is the company’s first n-type, TOPCon-style solar module, and an interesting addition to this portfolio is the Q.TRON SMART. This module is a smart version of the newly launched Q.TRON-G1+ and boasts an MLPE feature in the form of an embedded power optimizer at the string level.
The MPPT optimization offered by the Maxim Integrated power optimizer offers energy gain by up to 30%, thereby delivering better yield and more revenue for the customer. The Q.TRON SMART also has an easy-to-use module level monitoring system (provided by SunSniffer) to ensure end users enjoy greater control and oversight of their energy consumption.
In combining its new Q.ANTUM NEO cell technology with smart MLPE solutions, Qcells is really raising the bar in efficiency and energy yield with the Q.TRON SMART.
The pv magazine team passed by the Sonnen booth and spoke to its human resource manager about gender equality.
The company says that half of its employees are women.
CEO Oliver Koch said that the company can still can deliver batteries in a reasonable time frame while also increasing shipments by 70% from last year. This is due to the engagement of the staff, said Koch.
The company transports components in suitcases from China to Germany, where its production facilities are located.
Each person can carry five items on flights, so Sonnen employees often travel back and forth between the countries to secure components, while undergoing quarantine procedures each time they arrive in China.
E3/DC, a Hager Energy brand, is one of the bigger suppliers for residential and small commercial storage systems in Germany.
It is presenting new products for charging infrastructure at Intersolar this week.
CEO Andreas Piepenbrink said that the key for the success of solar charging is a working vehicle-to-home solution which allows for the use of car batteries for electricity as well as stationary batteries.
The company is also working on vehicle-to-grid solutions and has already reported about deploying DC charging in homes.
One of its other new products is a wall box that can charge at high power but also down to 1.2 kW.
This is done by automatically switching from a three-phase to a one-phase operation when the charging power needs to be reduced below a certain level.
E3/DC said that it will increase its capacity from 25,000 storage systems to 35,000 units per year.
Given current supply chain issues, the good news is that its partners can still expect steady supplies.
At the beginning of the first day of Intersolar, we met Marcus Brunner, general manager Europe for 8 Star Energy, and Julian Sweeney, the company's Australian managing director.
For the next 25 years, the company will be allowed to use the Energizer brand for its batteries, software and energy management.
For those who do not know, non-rechargeable Energizer batteries can be purchased in supermarkets.
Since 2017, 8 Star Energy has operated in Australia, but now it is starting to look at European markets.
Just before Intersolar, the company said that Memodo, a wholesaler, had taken it into its portfolio.
Brunner is well known in the German energy storage scene as he has worked for companies such as Mercedes-Benz Energy and CellCube. He said that customers can expect delivery times of 120 days for the batteries.
If 8 Star Energy can keep this promise, it will offer good value under current market conditions, compared to other storage providers.
On Day 1, we covered everything from shipping problems and full order books, to mounting systems as first responders, Rolls Royce microgrids, and sustainable ambitions.
We also featured a number of new products, including:
Stay tuned for more live coverage throughout the day!"

UL, a global safety science company, has announced the release of software to optimize the value of utility-scale energy storage systems, either as standalone storage, or when paired with solar or wind. The HOMER Front product is a licensable, web-based software platform for designing and optimizing energy storage systems. 
HOMER software was originally developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and has performed more than 250,000 project calculations in over 190 countries. The suite of HOMER products includes “Pro,” which is designed for microgrids and distributed energy resources, and “Grid,” which is designed for commercial and industrial customers operating hybrid renewables-plus-storage projects.
UL’s newest energy storage software platform arms developers and financiers with insights to evaluate a system’s performance and make project decisions to advance the buildout of energy storage – a key counterpart to both solar and wind energy. 
The platform is built with battery dispatch modeling and performs technical and economic analysis to maximize revenues. The software allows users to align battery augmentation strategies for participating in capacity and energy markets and meeting off-take agreement requirements. It provides insights on the wide set of possible revenue streams across diverse markets like Texas’ ERCOT and California CAISO operating regions. 
The software is available to developers in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. The set of services provided by the platform include:
“By providing accurate, detailed results for different system configurations, HOMER Front allows developers and financiers to evaluate the system’s performance and make critical project decisions with confidence,” said Colin Tareila, engineering manager of renewables for UL. “We’re extremely pleased with the significant advantages we’ve seen HOMER Front provide through our work on UL’s advisory projects and feedback from early users of the software. The capabilities will help advance deployment of energy storage projects worldwide.”
