The researchers also looked at the impact of post-pandemic policies and identified the optimal PV system designs for four different community configurations in the two countries, based on financial incentives.
The simulations modeled an energy community comprising four families: a working couple, a family with one child and one working parent, a family with three children and both parents at home, and a retired couple spending most of their time at home. The divergent results observed between the Portuguese and Italian cases reflect the incentives and energy policy contexts of each country.
In September 2020, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development, the MISE, established two different remunerations for self-consumption ranging from €8 ($8.75)/MWh to €110/MWh. These values are granted as an incentive to those who sell electricity to the network, which adds to the income from the sale of electricity to the network, set according to the corresponding price and time.
Italy has also been granting two different fiscal credits for the installation of PV and storage projects in the frame of building renovation projects, the so-called Superbonus and Ecobonus, covering 110% and 50% of the project costs, respectively.
In June 2020, the Portuguese government allowed individual prosumers not to pay 50% of the CIEG, a part of the electricity tariff paid by Portuguese consumers that represents 29% of the price of low-voltage electricity, and energy communities not to pay 100% of the CIEG.
The Portuguese authorities are also offering rebates for PV systems with or without storage that cover up to 85% of the investment up to the limit of €2,500 per project.
The analysis showed that using the Superbonus favored the smallest systems, while the Ecobonus was more favorable to the largest ones. This is due to the lower cost of smaller systems, in which the savings come mainly from self-consumed energy.
In this case, the configuration that maximizes self-consumption is the most beneficial. Furthermore, the incentives offered cover almost the entire cost of the system. If batteries are included, the optimal system is the one with the smallest battery because it is the cheapest configuration.
This approach is due to the higher cost and shorter useful life of batteries compared to photovoltaic systems, which require eventual replacement. Therefore, using smaller batteries is the most effective strategy to maintain the economic viability of the project.
The analysis in Portugal revealed that the optimal system for all family types without storage was the smallest, while storage scenarios generally resulted in unprofitable projects.
According to the authors of the research, “a sensitivity analysis should be carried out to determine which Portuguese incentives would be appropriate to promote storage equipment.”
Simulations of energy communities for all families showed that, in Italy, the best configurations consist of families acting as producers with higher PV capacities and smaller batteries. By contrast, in Portugal, policies favor smaller PV systems without batteries, leading to optimal configurations where households are solely consumers.
The main conclusion of the study is that, for both countries and the four family schemes, being part of an energy community is more economically viable than being in a regime of individual self-consumption. This is because individual households continue to prioritize self-consumption and personal savings, while selling their excess energy at a more favorable price than they would receive from the grid.
The academics published their findings in “Techno-economic analysis of self-consumption schemes and energy communities in Italy and Portugal, published in Solar Energy. The research group included scientists from the University of Lisbon in Portugal, as well as Italy's Eurac Research and the Polytechnic University of Milan.

While ongoing efforts are focusing on deep technology solutions to the climate crisis, there are also novel options available that can reduce energy consumption, and thus our carbon footprint, if deployed at scale.
As you read this article, thousands of people are pedaling exercise bikes in gyms, health centers, and at home. Every movement of their feet creates kinetic energy that could potentially be converted to electricity and used to power phones, laptops, fridges, wi-fi routers, and other home appliances.
To harness this power, Tukas EV created the HR Bank – an exercise bike and power storage device that converts pedaling into electricity. On an HR Bank, a person can generate from 50 W per hour to 500 W/h of electricity simply by pedaling, depending on their fitness level. All the energy is stored in a 2 kWh battery that provides enough electricity to keep a light on for a week or to power a microwave oven for around 100 meals. Just 15 minutes of exercise generates enough power to charge a phone.
Devices to convert pedaling to electricity already exist but none have such a high-capacity battery. The storage device can also be charged from other types of green energy, such as solar panels or wind power, as well as by the electric grid or a car generator. At the same time that the HR Bank is being pedalled, or charged from an external source, it can power any connected device, thus generating around 4 kWh to 5 kWh of electricity every day, energy which can be used wherever needed.
When Tukas envisioned the HR Bank it was conceived as a device primarily oriented toward home users. We wanted families worldwide to harness their kinetic energy in a product which could be moved to a vacation home or countryside escape, or be taken on a camping trip, for use as an alternative energy storage solution. Additionally, we aimed to create a reliable source of sustainable energy.
Although the HR Bank was created primarily for domestic use, we saw a number of businesses interested in this novel way to generate and store electricity soon after the first version was launched. Sustainability-focused companies such as hotels, wellness centers, rental vacation homes, and gyms want to offer healthier, eco-friendly lifestyle options for their customers. While the HR Bank is not a professional-grade exercise bike typically found in a sports center, it meets the needs of the average user.
Families, employees, and anyone else pedaling exercise bikes represent an untapped opportunity for a new energy source that could help propel humanity toward a more sustainable future. While governments subsidize solar and wind to help clean power contribute more than a third of global electricity generation by early 2025, the potential of human-generated energy is largely unexploited.
We believe pedal power, as well as other types of human-generated kinetic energy, could become an alternative source of green energy. For example, human, motion-based energy can be created in many different ways, including joint rotation, limb swings, and organ motion. In the future, as our technological capabilities advance, such energy harvesting from daily human activity, and its conversion into electricity, might replace traditional batteries and wearable electronic devices.
Similarly, as battery efficiency and capacity improve, we are committed to progressing toward a future energized by pedal power.

Chile deployed 1.652 MW of new PV systems in 2023, according to new statistics from Acesol, the Chilean PV association.
The country's cumulative installed solar capacity reached 8.5 GW as of the end of December 2023, which represents around 25.6% of its total power generation capacity.
Acesol also said that around 2,941 MW of the total PV capacity comes from systems deployed under the scheme for medium-sized distributed generation PMGD, which is open to projects up to 9 MW in size.
Chile ended 2023 with 7,729 MW of solar capacity under construction. There was 5,681 MW of large-scale solar, while distributed-generation projects accounted for the remainder.
PV became the electricity generation technology with the greatest presence in Chile in 2023. Of the more than 8,500 MW that is currently in operation, 71% is installed between the northern regions of Arica Parinacota and Atacama.

All perovskite PV devices offer the advantage of effectively harnessing sunlight across a wide range of wavelengths. “By strategically applying two-step filtered spectrum and current matching techniques, our team has fully realized the capabilities of the three-junction tandem solar cell design,” the research's corresponding author, Jaya Madan, told pv magazine.
The scientists used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell configuration. “This device simulator is known for its reliability in modeling standalone and two-junction tandem solar cells. However, until now, there hasn't been a method for simulating three-junction tandem solar cells using SCAPS-1D. Thus, our work fills this gap.”
The solar cell relies on a 287 nm-thick top cell comprising an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin oxide (SnO2) and buckminsterfullerene (C60), a perovskite active layer with a bandgap of 1.99 eV, and a hole transport layer (HTL) made of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz).
Moving down the tandem structure, the 500 nm-thick middle cell features a perovskite absorber layer with a bandgap of 1.6 eV. The top and bottom subcells are interconnected through an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, facilitating efficient charge transport between the layers. The 670 nm-thick subcell integrates a perovskite absorber with a bandgap of 1.20 eV.
The performance of the cell was simulated under standard illumination conditions and, according to the scientists, it achieved remarkable photovoltaic parameters. The device reached an efficiency of 26.24%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.76 V, a short-circuit density of 10.70 mA/cm², and a fill factor of 69.00%.
The researchers explained that the precise determination of the filtered spectrum and the current matching points played a crucial role in the cell optimization.
The novel cell concept was described in the study “Design and simulation of three-junction all perovskite tandem solar cells: A path to enhanced photovoltaic performance,” published in Materials Letters.

The series includes seven models with DC input ranging from 6 kW to 22.5 kW and AC output ranging from 4 kW to 15 kW.
“It supports up to 120% three-phase unbalanced output, it is fully adapted to the access of 18 A large solar modules, and provides 1.5 times DC overmatching,” the company said in a statement. “It can be parallelized according to customer scenario requirements, with up to 9 maximum number of parallel operations. At the same time, through advanced inverter control technology, the maximum conversion efficiency can reach 98.4%.”
The smallest product of the series comes with a maximum input of 6 kW and an output of 4 kW. For the largest device, these values are 22.5 kW and 15 kW, respectively.

“There has been growing research on lead (Pb) and tin (Sn)-free perovskite alternatives, but we were surprised that only single cells have been reported so far, so we focused on fabricating modules with commercially available equipment. The fact that the Sb-based solar cells we developed had good air and thermal stability enabled us to do all patterning steps in air,” the research's lead author, Thomas M. Brown, told pv magazine.
“The key property of the antimony-based perovskite-inspired materials that we developed is stability, especially compared to other lead-free alternatives,” he added. “Consequently, enhancing efficiency should become the prime focus for Sb-based technology whereas stability should become the focus for Sn-based devices.”
According to the research group, the cells withstood temperature stability tests of up to 85 C in air and all three P1, P2, and P3 laser patterning steps could be performed outside the glovebox, simplifying the manufacturing step. Key to the results were two cations in the precursor mixture.
The solar cells were manufactured with MAxCs3−xSb2I3Cl6 using a one-step spin-coating solution process. The methylammonium (MA) and cesium (Cs) mixed double-cation Sb-cell stacks were made with fluorine-doped compact-titanium oxide (TiO2), mesoporous TiO2, the MAxCs3−xSb2I3Cl6 absorber, a hole transport layer made with conventional Spiro-OMeTAD, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The cells achieved a power conversion efficiency of 1.5% and its long-term stability was boosted by 60%, with a loss of only 10% after about 1800 h of aging in air, according to the researchers. The mini solar modules built with these cells achieved a 1.2% efficiency over a 2.52 cm2 active area.
The group has plans to investigate applying the technology to indoor solar cells and panels. “This is because we have shown that perovskite technology has high potential for light harvesting in indoor environments and because suitable band gaps for the semiconductors need to be higher under artificial lighting which opens up the possibility of using even antimony-based perovskites for this purpose,” said Brown.
Looking forward, the research team is planning to reduce the device bandgap by adjusting perovskite composition, adjusting the crystallization rate, minimizing defects by introducing additives, and optimizing energy level matching and passivation of defects by interface engineering.
Their findings were introduced in the paper “Air-Stable Lead-Free Antimony-Based Perovskite Inspired Solar Cells and Modules,” published in ACS Energy Letters.

Stacking algorithms can learn how to best combine the predictions from two or more base machine learning algorithms.
“The use of such ensemble methods can revolutionize the PV module fault diagnosis field by leveraging the capability of several models to achieve higher classification accuracy,” the scientists explained. “Whenever a PV module is discovered to be in faulty condition, the proposed methodology focuses on determining the type of PV module fault.”
The new approach utilizes augmented digital images of PV modules collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and detects snail trails, delamination, glass breakages, discoloration, and burn marks. According to the research group, the augmentations improve the learning and classification capabilities of the machine learning model.
The data collected by the images are then fed for feature extraction into pre-trained AlexNet, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) used primarily for image recognition and classification tasks. In the following step, the extracted features are split into training and testing datasets with a train-test split ratio of 70 % and 30%. In the final stage, the selected features are classified using machine learning classifiers and the ensemble strategy is applied to determine the condition of PV modules.
The researchers also used the open-access Weka software tool to perform the feature selection and classification tasks according to five different algorithms called support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (kNN), logistic model tree (LMT), random forest (RF), and Multilayer perceptron (MLP).
“By combining the strengths of these models, stacking can produce more accurate predictions than any individual model alone,” they added. “The main idea behind stacking is to use the strengths of multiple models to compensate for their weaknesses. For example, one model may perform well on some parts of the dataset but poorly on others, while another model may have the opposite strengths and weaknesses.”
The novel technique reportedly achieved a combined classification accuracy of 99.04%, with the four-class stacking ensemble model consisting of the SVM, kNN, LMT, and RF algorithms and the five-class ensemble providing the best performance. “However, considering the dimensionality expansion, computational complexity and time taken to build the model, a four-class stacked ensemble was preferred over five-class ensembles,” the academics emphasized. “Thus, adopting stacking-based ensemble techniques has enhanced the performance of base classifiers.”
The new methodology was described in the paper “Detection of visual faults in photovoltaic modules using a stacking ensemble approach,” published in Heliyon.

Caillau and  B&K Solare Zukunft have been partners for two years.
“The combination of our expertise, the complementarity of our product portfolios and our capacity for innovation will allow us to conquer new markets together and generate significant synergies,” said B&K Solare Zukunft Director Patrick Behnke.
B&K Solar specializes in lightweight structures for rooftops, 90% made of aluminum. Caillau-AdiWatt is more focused on steel structures for ground-mounted power plants, roofs and solar shades.
Caillau has a workforce of around 600 employees, a production plant in Romorantin, France, and subsidiaries in China, the United States and Brazil. It achieved a turnover of around €150 million ($164.0 million) in 2023.
“The acquisition of AdiWatt in 2021 marked an important step in Caillau’s growth and diversification strategy,” said Stéphane Drivon, president of Caillau. “This operation allowed us to create a new solar business unit, complementary to Caillau's historic strengths and professions. Our ambition is now to play a key role in the consolidation of the European market for high added value fastening systems.”
Due to this integration, the combined turnover of the solar division will exceed €50 million in 2023, according to Caillau.

A tech start-up from The University of Queensland (UQ) has developed a system that utilizes machine-learning algorithms to analyze existing data and detect, locate and identify faulty and underperforming solar panels in real time, and recommend targeted maintenance.
The Solaris AI system has been developed to detect, locate and identify any faults and underperformance issues in large-scale solar farms. It also tries to see if there are any trends or patterns that indicate the likelihood of occurrence of faults in the future.
Associate Professor Rahul Sharma from UQ’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science said the technology is able to monitor data that is already available at the solar farms, including the current and voltage data, and locate potential performance issues down to individual array and panel string levels.
“Using the data, Solaris AI’s algorithms are meant to sequentially extract information about the degradation across the farm, soiling levels across the farm or wiring faults across the farm and that information is then translated into actionable items for the on-site technicians, that is where the maintenance work needs to be prioritized,” he said. “Solaris AI is an all-in-one solar farm operation and maintenance system.”
Sharma said the technology, which requires no specific hardware to be installed for it to work, could significantly reduce the amount of generation lost to underperformance, potentially saving solar farm operators an estimated $200 million annually.
“Underperformance in Australian solar farms cost the industry around $400 million a year,” he said. “That’s a huge amount. We’re aiming for Solaris AI to reduce those losses by half, and potentially deliver an uplift in revenue of up to 8%.”
UQ said the Solaris AI system was tested in a pilot study on a small-scale solar farm before being trialed on a commercial solar farm.
Discussions are now underway to roll out the technology at Edify Energy and Gentari Solar Australia’s Hamilton solar farm at Collinsville in north Queensland and Genex Power’s Kidston solar farm in the state’s northwest.
The March edition of pv magazine is dedicated to energy storage and considers sodium-ion’s chances of toppling lithium-ion, takes a look at compressed air technology, and asks whether big or small is the best approach for African solar and storage.
Edify Energy Chief Executive Officer and founder John Cole said the technology offers a potential solution to the challenge of detecting faulty or underperforming solar panels at large-scale solar farms.
“The key to maintaining grid reliability and achieving success as a network operator is effective and efficient asset management,” he said. “This technology has the potential to drive solutions to the world’s energy crisis.”
Solaris AI was founded by UQ’s commercialization company UniQuest, spearheaded by investment from Uniseed as well as the UniQuest Investment Fund. The project also benefitted from a partnership with German electronics and connection technology company Wiedmueller, which supported the creation of early prototypes.

15,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/12/california-has-become-rooftop-solar-and-batteries-nem-esis/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-12,California has become rooftop solar and batteries NEM-esis,"From pv magazine USA
California, once known as a clean energy leader, has fallen off track with its clean energy goals. That was the view shared recently by the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) during a panel discussion at the Intersolar North America 2024 conference in San Diego, California.
The state passed a bill in 2018 targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. Governor Gavin Newsom recently set an interim target of 90% carbon-free electricity by 2035, further accelerating the ambition for deployment.
Considering California’s lofty goals for whole-home electrification and a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, electricity demand is expected to rise sharply, making the state’s clean energy goals even more ambitious.
Policy and planning body the California Energy Commission (CEC) projects that the state will need to build 6 GW of solar-plus-storage capacity every year for the next 26 years to meet the 2045 target.
Over the past five years, California has only averaged approximately half of that 6 GW figure.
“We started to get on pace in the past two years but it is driven at least 50% by the distributed [rooftop solar] market,” said CALSSA Executive Director Bernadette del Chiaro.
Based on CEC projections, total solar generation capacity will need to increase by 350%, and total energy storage capacity by 700%, to meet the state’s policy targets.
During its march toward 100% carbon-free power, however, California has shot itself in the foot by introducing the NEM 3.0 policy, which cut customer compensation for exporting power to the grid. Combined with a high interest rate environment, project economics for rooftop solar in California have been eroded and demand has imploded.
Storage costs
As the share of intermittent solar generation in California’s energy mix rises, the need for energy storage to even out generation and consumption has increased as well. When regulator the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) passed NEM 3.0, it was described as a “modernized solar tariff to support reliability.” “The new tariff promotes solar systems and battery storage, with a focus on equity, and advances the new clean energy technologies we need to meet our climate goals and help ensure grid reliability,” said CPUC President Alice Reynolds.
The regulator said that under the new tariff, average residential customers who installed solar could expect to save $100 a month on their electricity bills, and customers who installed PV paired with battery storage could expect to save at least $136 a month. However, that economic analysis has not proven to be the case.
While the new rate environment does support the economics of solar-plus-storage projects over standalone solar arrays, it no longer represents a cashflow-positive benefit to homeowners, making such systems a very difficult sell.
Ross Williams, chief executive officer of regional installer HES Solar, shared this grim reality at the Intersolar panel discussion. What was once a $20,000 to $25,000 standalone solar system, with a five-to-seven-year payback period, has turned into a solar-plus-storage system that costs $40,000 to $45,000 and has a nine-to-10-year return.
“You weigh that against all the other options in the investing world and that is not a good option,” said Williams. “Simply adding storage increased the cost by almost double.”
At the same time, high interest rates have further squeezed the industry, making it more expensive to borrow money to pay for systems. Williams said a $25,000 standalone system used to be a cashflow-positive investment, meaning, on an annualized basis, that paying for the loan would cost less than simply remaining with a traditional utility company contract. Now, with a $40,000 project and higher financing costs, customers would expect to pay more for power with a solar-plus-storage system. “It’s not as simple as ‘just add storage’,” said Williams.
Part of what made the NEM 3.0 decision such a disaster for rooftop solar companies was the business turbulence it caused. For HES Solar, a rush of consumers trying to secure NEM 2.0 rates led to the company booking 20% more sales in the first quarter of 2023 than it had in the whole of 2022. Once NEM 3.0 went into effect in April 2023, HES Solar sales dropped to zero.
“We had one sale in May,” said Williams at the Intersolar discussion. “In the first quarter, we sold 600 systems. I’m telling you – it went to zero.”
When July and August came around for HES Solar, and sales were still at 50% of what was needed to retain staff, Williams had to lay off employees. A similar story has plagued most of the rooftop solar installers in the state, leading to the loss of some 17,000 jobs.
California interconnection data indicate batteries would typically be paired with 10% to 15% of rooftop solar systems before NEM 3.0. In the first three weeks of selling NEM 3.0 systems, residential installer SunPower reported battery attachment rates rose to 47% and solar and storage modelling software platform EnergyToolbase projects that attachment rates will reach as high as 70% to 80%.
Demand for rooftop solar has fallen 65% to 80% during NEM 3.0, according to interconnection queue data. So did CPUC accomplish its goals?
Based on middle-of-the road analysis, the numbers would suggest the outcome has been mixed at best. Assume a scenario where, in the NEM 2.0 era, 100 rooftop solar projects were installed with an attachment rate of 12%, indicating 12 battery systems. Under NEM 3.0, the solar installation figure would be reduced to 28 arrays due to lower demand. With optimistic battery attachment rates of around 75%, that would lead to 21 battery installations. Industry reports indicate the actual battery attachment rate could be as little as 48%, meaning 13 batteries under that model.
Essentially, the new net metering regime may have led to a marginal increase in total distributed battery storage capacity but it has also cratered rooftop solar installations.
Trouble ahead
CALSSA has warned that the next couple of months could be even worse, as this is typically a slow season for rooftop solar. CALSSA’s Del Chiaro said cashflow issues and other ongoing concerns are likely to be raised in the first quarter of 2024.
Insurer Solar Insure told pv magazine USA that 75% of the companies it covers are considered to have a “high risk” of bankruptcy. Major publicly traded global equipment suppliers, including Enphase and SolarEdge, have made significant cuts to their workforce. National installer Sunworks has filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. In December 2023, SunPower issued a warning that it endured recurring operating losses for three of the nine months ending Oct. 1, 2023.
California has averaged around 2.3 GW of utility scale solar-plus-storage installations per year over the past few years – far below the 6 GW pace needed to reach the 2045 goal of 100% carbon-free power.
Del Chiaro said she believes that goal will be impossible to reach with a utility-scale-only energy storage model that the state seems to be hurling itself toward.
Policy changes
The Intersolar panelists in San Diego warned that California may only be the beginning for the fall of rooftop solar. Del Chiaro said 15 to 20 states are already mulling cuts to their net metering payments, including Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington. She said utilities now have the wind at their backs and are citing California’s decision to cut net metering compensation as justification for their own reductions.
As they are currently structured, utilities in California and much of the nation have a perverse incentive to inefficiently spend money on transmission projects. The more capital that utilities spend on infrastructure, the more they can get electricity rate increases approved.
Customer-sited solar is preferable to centralized, utility-scale solar, as it pertains to reducing transmission needs, system wide costs and efficiency and transmission-line energy losses. Distributed solar also cuts down on the development of land that could be used for other purposes. California’s largest solar-plus-storage facility just went online and, to power more than 200,000 homes, more than 4,600 acres of previously undisturbed land was developed into an expanse of almost two million solar panels.
“Getting the utility to stop fighting customer solar is ultimately the thing that is needed in California and around the world,” said CALSSA’s Heavner. “We’ve had it in our head for years, how do we change this perverse incentive? It’s a hard thing to undertake but I’m hearing more talk about it.
