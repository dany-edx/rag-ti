The portable system which requires only single-person installation, incorporates a high efficiency hybrid inverter with a modular high-voltage battery known as the Energy Cube. 
The unit's high-voltage charge controller delivers up to 6 kW of continuous charge or discharge with an efficiency of up to 97% interlinked with lithium-ion energy storage capacity scaling to 10.4 kWh. 
Attuned to the demand for sleek and unobtrusive all-in-one residential systems that don't shirk on reliability, Fox told pv magazine its all-in-one storage solution was designed to be compact, aesthetically pleasing and robust. 

According to the company, this makes the system suitable for both indoor or outdoor installation, and to ensure it's compactness Fox relocated the power board and the control board into two separate layers. Further adjustments made to the board's circuitry and a shifting around of components provided another space saving of 20%. 
What is more, not only does the sleeker design suit the system to an indoor setting, but Fox's system does not contain a noisy internal fan, rather, it cools the system via an aluminium alloy radiator. 
The 3-phase Hybrid inverter tops the whole system off, ensuring optimal power from solar panels is stored and ready for use day and night. If a blackout rears its ugly head the inverter's switch time is less than two seconds. 
Energy cubed
Fox's energy storage device, the Energy Cube, is capable of 6,000 life-cycles and operates confidently in a wide temperature range of between -10 C and 55 C.

JA Solar was the biggest winner with three bids totaling 3.1 GW in orders. Chint won 1.25 GW, new TOPCon player DaSolar took 600 MW and Jinko secured 150 MW. All panels will be 540 W or higher. Four other players participated in the biding, including Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, Risen and Eging PV.
Trina Solar has launched a new branch for upstream operations. The leading PV manufacturer and solar integrator recently established a new wholly controlled subsidiary company based in China's western Qinghai Province with registered capital of CNY 400 million ($60 million). The company will focus on the group's upstream business, including polysilicon production, ingot growing and wafer cutting.
Longi, the world’s largest solar company, announced that its name has been officially changed to LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd, to reflect a more comprehensive business scale in renewable and green technology, including the recent announcement that it is entering thegreen hydrogen equipment manufacturing field. The company will retain the same stock code on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), 601012.
China's southwestern province of Sichuan plans to add 10 GW of solar by the end of 2025. In its renewable energy development plan of the fourteenth five-year period (2021-2025), which was released on Tuesday by the provincial branch of the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Sichuan will install over 40 GW of renewable energy sources by the end of 2025. This will include 24 GW of hydropower, 6 GW of wind power and 10 GW of solar PV. Additionally, around 74 MW of other renewable sources, including biomass power and waste-to-energy, will be built.
The board of state-owned solar panel glassmaker Irico New Energy this week proposed a series of changes to the company’s articles association, including the lifting of the ban on senior management transferring their Irico stock while in office. Under the proposed changes, which will be subject to a shareholder vote at the next annual general meeting, management would be able to transfer up to a quarter of their stock per year, provided it is not within a year of the stock being listed and within six months of the shareholder leaving their position.
State-owned developer Beijing Energy International this week announced it will pay around CNY 1.04 million ($155,000) per year to lease two warehouse roofs from logistics services company CMBL upon which it will install solar rooftops. CMBL, which is owned by Beijing Energy major shareholder China Merchants Group Ltd, will pay up to CNY 3.23 million this year for the solar electricity generated by the rooftops, then CNY 5 million per year from 2023 through 2041, and CNY 1.77 million thereafter until May 9, 2042, when the leasing agreement expires. The two rooftops have a combined surface of 41,345 square meters.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/13/lebanon-issues-11-solar-licenses-for-165-mw/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,LEBANON,MIDDLE EAST",ILIAS TSAGAS,"MAY 13, 2022",Lebanon issues 11 solar licenses for 165 MW,"The Lebanese Council of Ministers has finally concluded the licensing phase for a 180 MW solar tender involving 12 projects of equal size, with the approval of 11 licenses this week, for a total of 165 MW of new PV capacity. The 11 projects are spread across four main regions: Bekaa (including the provinces of Bekaa and Baalbek-Hermel), Mount Lebanon, South (the provinces of South Lebanon and Nabatiyeh), and North (including North Lebanon and Akkar).
Initially, the tender aimed to license 12 solar projects across these regions, and the selection process was a competitive negotiation procedure based on the lowest received tariff. However, one investor did not agree on a tariff. pv magazine has confirmed with the government that the sole 15 MW project that was abandoned during the negotiation process was from the North portion of the tender, involving the provinces of North Lebanon and Akkar.
Nevertheless, the authorities approved 11 licenses for a number of consortia. They included Ecosys-Kaco, Dawtec-Looop-Staunch and Labwe Solar Farm in the Bekaa region; Joun PV, Sibline Solar Farm and E/One in the Mount Lebanon region; South Power, Rimat 15 and Gds-Et-Nabatiyeh in the South; and Kfifane Phoenix Power Plant and Elect-Stc-Solistis in the North.
Tariffs are a key element of every tender. The design of Lebanon’s 180 MW tender allowed the government to negotiate a different tariff for each of the four tender regions (Bekaa, Mount Lebanon, South and North). The lowest bid submitted in a given region would apply to all PV projects within the same area. For Bekaa specifically, one group submitted a $0.057/kWh bid, so all three 15 MW farms had to accept that tariff.
However, Bekaa has the strongest solar irradiance of the four regions of the tender, as well as cheap land and easy-to-install plots. Therefore, it is no surprise that all remaining projects in the other three regions will receive tariffs of $0.0627/kWh. These tariffs are valid for a period of 25 years, starting from their commercial operation dates.
Bankable structures
The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) said in a press release that Lebanon’s “macro fiscal situation and the deterioration of the local currency was a key element within the negotiation procedure.” Gabriel De Lastours, who is the regional head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), told pv magazine last year that it is preparing for what happens when there is a stable government in place and Lebanon’s macroeconomic prospects improve.
“We believe investment in renewable energy is on hold until the macro-economic situation improves. [However,] we want the independent power producers model supporting the tender scheme in Lebanon to move ahead. So, one of the things we are now working on is how to develop bankable solar projects relying on a power purchase agreement backed by a government in a comparable macro-economic situation to Lebanon,” he said.
Perhaps this is why Lebanon’s government also said this week that it has agreed to disburse future generation payments for the 11 licensed projects “in accordance with the Sayrafa platform of the [Banque du Liban] and 70% in US dollars, while the remaining 30% of the amount of each payment to be disbursed in [Lebanese pounds].”
The LCEC added that “the licensees will have one year to sign a bankable power purchase agreement (PPA), then one more year to reach financial closure, and one additional year to reach commercial operation. The term of the PPA will be for 25 years following commercial operation date.” But it remains to be seen whether the agreed tariffs and structure will allow investors to implement their projects. 
Lebanon formed a government on Sept. 11, 2021 – 13 months after a sudden explosion in Beirut killed more than 200 people and drove the country into a political and economic crisis. However, the government’s reforms have not kept pace with the dire economic situation on the ground, which also includes power blackouts. The country goes to the polls on May 15 for the first time since the deadly blast.

According to their paper, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, nickel nanoparticles tend to adsorb oxygen-containing reaction intermediates. The “hydrogen fuel cell has an anode catalyst consisting of a solid nickel core surrounded by the carbon shell. When paired with a cobalt-manganese cathode, the resulting completely precious-metal-free hydrogen fuel cell outputs more than 200 milliwatts per square centimeter,” the researchers wrote. According to the team, an additional advantage is that the configuration of the active site increases the tolerance for carbon monoxide impurities in the hydrogen fuel. “This means the fuel cells do not need a special unit to remove carbon monoxide and can use less refined hydrogen, further reducing costs.”
Europe is a clear opportunity for Australian companies, and the Netherlands is taking the lead. Europe “is an important marketplace,” said Jason Crusan, vice president of technology at Australian gas producer Woodside, during the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam. Many Australian attendees took part virtually and in person. During the three-day conference, the Port of Rotterdam proved once more its hydrogen ambitions. Together with companies, it offered European institutions to supply northwestern Europe with 4.6 million tons of hydrogen annually by 2030. “This is considerably more than expected,” the port wrote on Tuesday. On Friday, Gasco, HyNewGen, Linde, Vopak, and Port of Rotterdam said they were concluding a feasibility study to develop a 200 to 500 MW green hydrogen project in Chile (Project Tango).
Also taking part in the event, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans underscored the importance of Australia, the Americas and the Mediterranean. “I started out today with scientific revolutions in Rotterdam, and I am ending with new energy forms coming from Africa and the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is back, which I find fascinating. But the Mediterranean and the North Sea are connected,” said Timmermans on Tuesday. 
Imports of green hydrogen and green ammonia “are already cost-competitive and can substitute most fossil fuels used by heavy industry and transport in the EU within eight years,” wrote Colorado-based non-profit organization RMI in a study, adding that the European Union should incentivise infrastructures for industrial hubs, promote a certification system and define import rules that prioritise low-carbon fuels. “Incorporating green hydrogen and ammonia into trade policy with renewables-rich countries like Australia, Brazil, Chile, and North African nations will enable imports to reach the continent as early as 2024.” According to RMI’s work, imported green hydrogen from regions with optimal renewable power should cost less than $4/kg in 2024 (including transport), falling below $2/kg by 2030. Renewable hydrogen produced in Europe would then be cost-competitive in 2030. 
Trade Association Hydrogen Europe wrote that a reduction in hydrogen delivery price, an increase in renewable electricity generation, and hydrogen storage solutions are three necessary conditions under which steel can be produced economically from iron ore using hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Regarding costs, the end consumers should receive significant financial support till production costs fall, unless they are willing to pay a green premium. In less than a decade, hydrogen prices should not be an issue. “Electrolyser CAPEX alone, are expected to fall by around three-fourths compared to current levels – enough to enable renewable hydrogen production costs with low-cost renewable energy, to reach $1.50/kg by 2025,” wrote Hydrogen Europe in its “Steel from Solar Energy” study. With regard to scaling up, Hydrogen Europe wrote that the sector would need to access, alongside public support and both debt and equity finance to install the required additional renewable electricity generation. “Converting just a single steel plant with a capacity of 4 Mt of crude steel per year (EU average) would require: 1.2-1.3 GW of electrolysis running at full load, €3.3 billion of capital investment (including €1.2 billion for electrolysis) and between 10.2 to 21.7 ha of land for the electrolysis plant (and additional area for new renewable power deployment). … When using solar PV exclusively for hydrogen production, the required electrolysis power would grow to around 4.5-5 GW, driving up the required CAPEX to almost €7 billion for a single plant of average capacity,” Hydrogen Europe wrote. Multiple salt caverns could be necessary for storage capacity for a single steel plant, the trade association added. Hydrogen Europe launched the study during the Smarter E event in Munich.
In a new report, trade association RenewableUK calls for the creation of a green hydrogen roadmap in order to achieve the UK's 5 GW target, fully exempt electrolyzers from levies to reduce market distortions, and unlock strategic infrastructures. The report adds that high-skilled green jobs could provide ample opportunities for the UK to become an exporter of green hydrogen, especially to the EU. “The Scottish government has estimated that becoming an exporter of green hydrogen to Europe could create up to £25 billion of GVA [gross value add] and over 300,000 jobs in Scotland by 2045,” reported RenewableUK.
New Delhi-based Gail awarded a contract to set up one of the largest proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers in India. The project is to be installed at Gail’s Vijaipur Complex, in Madhya Pradesh's Guna District. “The project has been designed to produce around 4.3 metric tons of hydrogen per day (approx. 10 MW capacity) with a purity of about 99.999 volume percent. It is scheduled to be commissioned by November 2023. In line with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the project has been awarded to a vendor having domestic value addition of more than 50 percent,” Gail wrote on Thursday.
US-based heavy equipment and hydrogen technologies company Cummins is collaborating with heavy-duty truck manufacturer Daimler Truck North America (DTNA) to supply Freightliner Cascadia trucks with its Cummins hydrogen fuel cell powertrains for use in North America. “Freightliner will leverage Cummins’ fourth generation fuel cell powertrain, which provides improved power density, efficiency and durability,” wrote Cummins. Upon successful validation, the companies intend to have initial units available in 2024 for selected customers.
Meanwhile, Renault hopes to receive first orders for its hydrogen-powered minibuses and vans from the Netherlands and Germany soon, the head of the company's light commercial vehicles department told Reuters.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/13/dnv-aims-to-achieve-fpv-specific-reference-standards-for-floating-solar-pv/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,NORWAY,WORLD",EDGAR MEZA,"MAY 13, 2022",DNV aims to achieve FPV-specific reference standards for floating solar PV,"Norwegian classification society DNV is aiming to develop the world’s first recommended practice on the design, development, and operation of floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) systems.
The independent energy expert and assurance provider estimates that the potential global capacity for deploying FPV power is currently around 4 TW and expects installed capacity to reach 10 GW worldwide by 2025.
The group points out, however, that standards applicable to FPV are still largely lacking, which could result in project delays and obstacles in permitting and authorization of utility-scale projects.
“FPV players are at best relying on inconsistent and diverse procedures and adjacent codes adopted from other sectors, which may hinder the industry’s capacity to rapidly scale up,” DNV notes.
In an effort to provide comprehensive guidance to FPV operators, DNV has taken the lead on two new joint industry projects (JIPs) to achieve FPV-specific reference standards. DNV previously spearheaded a JIP involving 24 of the sector’s leaders to develop the world’s first recommended practice (RP) on the design, development, and operation of FPV systems — DNV-RP-0584 — which was introduced in 2021 as the first step towards FPV standards and certification. FPV-specific reference standards will further enable companies to manage risks and facilitate the shift to renewables, according to DNV.
The first new JIP is to share and improve the best practices for the design of FPV-specific anchoring and mooring structures. Based on a selection of floating solar concepts, the project will address a variety of anticipated challenges when deploying installations in larger islands with shallow drafts. The second JIP would draw from DNV’s expertise and network to create “an adequate unified FPV-specific floats design, testing and qualification standard that will introduce clearer, faster and cheaper performance-based procedures that are layout-neutral and failure-mode-specific.”
Many water bodies remain largely available for power generation – making the business case for FPV extremely attractive. After a slow start, the FPV market grew to 2 GW of globally installed capacity in 2020. DNV foresees a total of 7 to 11 GW to be installed by 2025 with a major increase from 2023 onwards.
“The use of industry standards will ultimately lead to higher quality, lower failure rates and more adequate access to data-driven digital solutions and assurance services like verification and certification,” said Juan Carlos Arévalo, executive vice president at GPM&S, a DNV company. “This can only be achieved through joint efforts and continuous knowledge sharing. This will not lead to the convergence of floating solar photovoltaic technology into a dominant concept, but rather establish a common approach to analysis and simulation that allows players to consistently improve on one another’s best practices and lay out industry-wide testing and quality assurance procedures.”
Dana Olson, global segment lead for solar power, Energy Systems at DNV, added, “FPV structures present unique challenges to the solar industry due to specific hydrodynamic loads, risks of corrosion and specific components, such as floats, anchors and mooring lines.
“Several large customers in the solar community have requested that we develop new, tailored standards to guide them in the development of resilient FPV projects,” Olson added. “In particular, our input on the determination of design environmental loading will provide crucial guidance to the whole field, and we’re eager to engage directly with customers across the industry at this crucial step of FPV project development.”

Auckland-based renewables developer Far North Solar Farm (FNSF) said this week that it has partnered with German investment manager Aquila Capital to develop an estimated NZD 1 billion ($625.8 million) suite of large-scale solar PV projects across New Zealand’s north and south islands.
FNSF, which recently started building a 16 MW solar farm near Pukenui, said the pipeline of projects could supply approximately 4% of New Zealand’s total annual energy demand. That would represent approximately 11% of the country’s current clean energy generation capacity. The 1 GW pipeline includes multiple project sites across the north and south islands, with FNSF confirming it has already secured 13 sites close to transmission points.
FNSF Director John Telfer said both companies have “invested significant capital and resources to select and assess suitable project sites and obtain the required permits and consents to advance these sites to ready-to-build status … We can’t wait to start constructing the solar photovoltaic sites we have planned and consented. To be partnering with such a committed global investor in clean energy generation as Aquila Capital, and on the scale we collectively intend, is exciting not only for us but also the entire country.”
Telfer said the companies aim to break ground on at least four North Island projects this year, with the remainder of the projects to be rolled out over the next two to five years. Hamburg-based Aquila Capital, which manages more than 12 GW of wind, solar PV and hydropower assets throughout the world, said the projects would support New Zealand’s clean energy transition and target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
Aquila Asia Pacific CEO Alexander Lenz said the companies had been encouraged by New Zealand’s progressive renewable energy targets and the government’s soon-to-be-announced Emissions Reductions Plan.
“We are excited to reach this stage of development after assessing all possible sites and preparing for our solar PV build-out with FNSF,” he said. “This would not have been possible without New Zealand’s focus on meeting its progressive clean energy targets. The time for clean energy is now, and together with FNSF, we are ready to support New Zealand’s ambitious energy transition goals.”
The announcement comes as FNSF continues construction on its Pukenui solar farm being developed on the Far North’s Te Aupōuri peninsular. The NZD 30 million project will feature 32,000 solar panels spread across a 12-hectare site. The asset is expected to be commence generation later this year.
FSNF and Aquila Capital are the latest firms to target solar developments in New Zealand. While the largest operational PV facility in the country is Sunergise’s 2.1MW Kapuni Solar Power Plant that began operations in May last year, power companies Meridian, Contact Energy and Genesis and new players Lodestone and Helios have all announced plans to build solar developments of various sizes in the past 12 months.
These commitments come with New Zealand’s biggest solar array currently under construction. The 150 MW Kōwhai Park solar farm is being developed by Christchurch Airport on a 400-hectare site adjacent to its runways. The project will scale up over the next 30 years with the first stage to deliver a 220-hectare solar array capable of generating enough electricity to power 30,000 homes.

Trina Solar is expected to release its first sustainability report in the coming weeks, and pv magazine learned today that the release of Longi’s report into the same subject is also imminent.
Gulnara Abdullina, vice president Europe for Longi Solar, met with pv magazine today and noted the company’s engagement in developing green hydrogen, its membership in the RE100 Initiative, and the forthcoming publication of its sustainability report as evidence of its commitment to environmental values across its supply chain.
Abdullina said that while there are supply chain challenges across the industry, spirits are still high at Intersolar. She noted that the company remains committed to supplying its partners in a timely fashion and to transparency in terms of sustainability.
Longi, a partner of pv magazine‘s UP Initiative, plans to soon reveal more details about its sustainability endeavors.

Anyone passing by there can visit the Zappi charging station, which can charge e-cars with 100% renewable electricity, without requiring a complex connection to the inverter. What is needed instead is a clamp that can be easily placed around the power cable at the grid connection point. It transmits information to the Zappi energy management system in the wallbox when excess electricity is flowing into the grid – no cable connection required.
The installation is made by companies acquainted with the product through online training. The training courses are very popular, said Pattberg. Around 70 installers have participated in the courses, which are held once or twice a week. The company's goal is to simplify the installation of wall boxes. “You don't make a project out of it when you buy a new television,” said Pattberg.
Formula E – officially known as the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship – is coming back to Berlin this weekend. But the one-seater racing vehicle simulator exhibited at the Smarter-E show has had one crash it didn’t recover from: When we got to the furthest corner of Hall B6, the software was down and we couldn’t enjoy the experience.
Back on the PV waste trail this afternoon, pv magazine stopped by the 2nd Life Solar booth to find out about its innovative reuse concept. The Hamburg-based startup began life 15 months ago. It is part of the Buhck Group, a long-established waste management company that has 35 subsidiaries and 1,400 employees. Having dealt with end-of-life modules since 2016, they saw volumes increasing, and noted that not all modules needed to be shredded – there was a business case for reuse.
After a PV installation is decommissioned, 2nd Life Solar can test modules in a mobile lab and either qualify them for a second life, or send them to be recycled. They also have demonstration installations on their rooftop in Hamburg, and are exploring various routes to get the modules back into the market.
The enormous demand for PV that’s been on show this week also means, eventually, enormous volumes of PV waste that will need to be kept in circulation and out of landfill for the industry to make any claim to environmental credentials. And it’s encouraging to see this being taken seriously, with a few recyclers and reusers visible on the show floor.
Germany’s Luxchemtech has developed a process using a concentrated water jet to strip modules apart, and can completely separate the backsheet, encapsulant, silicon and busbars for introduction into various recycling streams.
CEO Wolfram Palitzsch told pv magazine that the company is seeking investors for a module recycling plant. What’s missing for now is the volume: For the facility to operate profitably it would need to process at least 10,000 tons of PV waste per year. And these must also be collected locally – within or close to Germany.
What are the three factors that determine the success of a solar manufacturing industry? “Demand, access to finance, and industry regulation,” said Rodrigo Lopes Sauaia, CEO of Brazilian solar PV association, ABSOLAR.
The first two pillars have been in place in Brazil for a while, but robust industry regulation had been lacking, Sauaia explained. With the elimination of several taxes on solar cells, modules, inverters, and trackers since August 2020, Brazil has the third pilar in place: industry regulation.
Sauaia is confident the country will be able to install 10 GW in 2022. Key industry players have already recognized the opportunity and have scaled up their presence in the country, Suaia said.
Brazil is seeing huge growth on a year-on-year basis, having 15 GW of installed capacity as of April 2022. It is set to become a top five solar market by 2026.
According to myenergi Managing Director Carsten Pattberg, the installer’s favorite charger is in Hall B6. Anyone passing by there can visit the Zappi charging station, which can charge e-cars with 100% renewable electricity without requiring a complex connection to the inverter.

The installation is made by companies that have become acquainted with the product through online training. The courses are very popular, said Pattberg. Around 70 installers take part in the courses, which take place once or twice a week. The company's goal is to greatly simplify the installation of wall boxes. “You don't make a project out of it when you buy a new television,” said Pattberg.
Mitrex, a Canada-based BIPV building material manufacturer, is enjoying its first escapade into the European market at Intersolar 2022. CEO Danial Hadizadeh told pv magazine that he has noticed a much more knowledgeable solar market here in Europe compared to the United States, where he said the company has a significant pipeline. “The US still doesn't get solar,” said Hadizadeh.
The CEO added that he has been pleased by the interest that Mitrex has received from building developers who are looking for ways to incorporate solar into greenfield projects in the growing number of European municipalities that require solar, such as Berlin. Of course, high-rise developers have a particular interest in BIPV solutions due to limited rooftop space. “People building high-rises are being penalized,” Hadizadeh said, noting that the company's solutions enable it to meet solar requirements through integration.
Chinese battery manufacturer BYD plans to deliver 250,000 of its flagship energy storage systems, BYD Battery-Box Premium, to Europe this year, in response to a high demand.
“Demand is through the roof,” Florian Blaser, operations director manager for Central Europe, told pv magazine.
BYD has expanded its production capacity for lithium cells to 250 GWh and has doubled the production lines for the Battery-Box modules. Presently, it has around 250,000 Battery-Box systems installed throughout the world, including 100,000 systems, or around 1 GWh, that were delivered to the European market in 2021.
This year, ambitious plans are in place to deliver 250,000 systems to Europe alone. According to Blaser, Germany remains the key market for BYD residential battery storage products, followed by other countries in the DACH region, as well as Italy and Spain. Demand is also growing significantly in the Benelux countries. Waiting times for products are said to be average, which in Germany presently means around five months.
The addition of new products to the company’s portfolio, including the Battery-Box HVC system – which was just introduced at the Smarter-E show and is will set for market launch in the fourth quarter – is expected to satisfy the market’s hunger for BYD battery products in Europe.
pv magazine‘s Julia Wolters reconsidered her career choice as she tested how easy it is to connect a solar array to an inverter at the Phoenix Contact booth. All you need is a well-considered connector system and a small screwdriver. Phoenix Contact has simplified the connections so that no special tools are required after stripping the cables. You only need to use a screwdriver if you want to remove the connector without destroying it, in order to use it elsewhere.
The economical use of plugs is currently very important because Phoenix Contact, like many companies in the industry, is having difficulties in meeting demand. The certified feed-in management system, in particular, is severely affected by the shortage of chips, explains Marc Mende, a spokesman for Phoenix Contact. The company has production facilities in Germany, Ukraine and Shanghai, so it is currently being hit hard by the turbulence on the world market. However, it promises to improve availability, product by product.
pv magazine’s UP Initiative has been focusing on sustainability in the solar industry since 2019. While we have addressed issues like PV module recycling, green finance, sustainable electricity sourcing, and agri-PV, one item has not yet been on the agenda: the sustainability of conferences and trade shows.
The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed travel off the agenda for companies over the past two years; however, with the pace picking back up, one cannot ignore the giant carbon footprint of travel and the physical trade shows. Booths and giveaways, in particular, must be a green consideration, especially in the renewable energy industry.
This year, it was wonderful to stumble upon IBC Solar’s booth which has employed the Cradle-to-Cradle circular economy principles. Innovations include using paint from Keim, which is said to contain no harmful substances and can remain on wood for later use, and polyamid ropes as bracing for the ceiling elements, which can be either reused or recycled.
The Germany-based company also decided not to use extra flooring, instead remaining with the original trade show flooring, while using sustainably sourced spruce wood that is screwed rather than glued together. Following the exhibition, the wood will be donated to a local school to be used as fencing for a bee garden, Christina Pfeufer, director of marketing and corporate communications, told pv magazine. Moreover, the aluminum structures will go back to the booth builder for reuse, and the employees have been encouraged to take the decorative plants home with them. She added that the booth design was not more expensive this year compared to past versions.
In terms of its internal strategy, Julius Möhrstedt, head of corporate sales services, said IBC Solar is gearing up to publish its first sustainability report soon.
Let’s hope we will see more of this innovation at future events!
There’s nothing quite like an award winner proudly holding a trophy aloft. Unless, of course, the trophies are still in transit.
The Intersolar, ESS, Outstanding Projects, and Smart Renewable Energy award winners weren’t left empty handed at the awards ceremony on Tuesday, but they did have to wait until today for the physical trophies to arrive. But arrive they have!
pv magazine stopped by the REC booth to find company employees proudly grasping their Intersolar Award this year, for its new REC Alpha Pure Series. The module boasts a series of innovations, the most outstanding of which is that it is now entirely free of lead.
The maturity of robotic module cleaning was on display in hall A5 at Intersolar this year, with robots of all shapes and sizes crawling, brushing, sweeping, and washing the booths.
One of the most striking solutions was from Israel-based Ecoppia, which had both its T4 and its new H4 autonomous robots demonstrating their effectiveness. A major challenge, said Anat Segev, Ecoppia’s VP marketing, was stopping people from interfering with the robots’ work.
“Please don’t touch signs don’t seem to be enough,” said Segev.
The H4 robot was launched at Intersolar this week, and Segev said interest in the larger robot was high.
“A lot of people are stopping by and people that have heard the T4 and want to know what is coming next – and they can see that the H4 builds on our experience in providing autonomous cleaners that are robust, reliable and proven.”
The automation of O&M is presenting as a significant opportunity, allowing projects to boost power generation and implement preventative maintenance regimes.
“With the sites getting larger and more remote, automation is the key for effective and efficient O&M,” said Segev. “O&M is the key now to make projects profitable and optimizing O&M is what everyone is struggling with.”
pv magazine is partnering with Ecoppia to take the temperature of the O&M marketplace and to understand what the opportunities and challenges are in automating module cleaning and monitoring PV project health and performance. The survey takes less than five minutes and the results will be shared with the PV community in a feature article in the September 2022 edition of pv magazine global.

Engineering innovator paXos has developed a solution for vertical agri-PV systems that reduces vulnerability to wind. As Project Manager Marius Nennewitz told pv magazine, high winds put an enormous amount of pressure on the bend point at the base of the stanchion. The solution paXos has come up with is called the “Solar Agricultural Element Foundation System,” or more simply, the “Earth Screw” (pictured).
Inspired by the root systems of trees, which grow horizontal surface roots to stablize themselves against the pulling force of winds, the Earth Screw combines a screw with a rigid concrete slab that rests just below the top soil to absorb bending forces. Nannewitz said the solution has proven 85% more effective at resisting wind – a figure he says improves with the thickness of the plate.
Austrian solar manufacturer Sonnenkraft has recognized that there is not only space on rooftops. With a wide range of special modules, it satisfies the demand for solar power from all kinds of other spots, including canopies and carports that can be beautifully covered with semi-transparent glass-glass modules. The building approvals required in Germany, which ensure that overhead modules will not injure anyone if they break, have already been granted.
There are also black glass-glass modules or stylish modules with coloured glass in delicate brown or blue tones for the façade. This reduces the solar yield by around 10%, Dajana Scherr, head of marketing for Sonnenkraft, told pv magzine‘s Cornelia Lichner when she visited the stand.
Is there also room on the balcony? One or two socket modules will definitely still fit. The two-piece set is priced from €1,299 ($1,350), including the mounting kit and PV inverter.
Even fences offer options for solar power. Sonnenkraft produces smaller glass-glass module formats especially for this purpose. The technology for module production in Austria comes from domestic supplier Kioto Solar, which Sonnenkraft bought in 2019 and integrated into the company. This know-how is developing further into a new half-cut module, which is also exhibited.
Proving popular at the busy QCells booth has been the new Q.HOME CORE energy storage solution. The system is available in two versions; hybrid and AC-coupled, but it is the hybrid H4 version that is being displayed here at Intersolar Europe.
The Q.HOME CORE H4 consists of a 4.6 kW hybrid inverter and a battery pack of 6.86 kWh, and with the Q.SAVE, which is the battery pack of the Q.HOME CORE, the system is scalable with the option to increase the storage capacity by 6.86 kWh increments, up to 20.5 kWh – which is enough to easily cover the needs of most households.
The Q.HOME CORE H4 is perfect for markets such as the UK and France thanks to its easy configuration with any new solar installation. With an embedded PV-generator, hybrid inverter, two MPPT trackers and a maximum voltage of 800 V per tracker, this intelligent, attractive battery pack promises to be a cool and reliable addition to any household eager to take a cleaner grasp of their electricity bills.
Canada-based Intech Clean Energy is prioritising ease of transport, ease of installation, and ease of maintenance for its floating PV (FPV) solution. Starting with its simple two-screw solution (pictured), in which the nut is installed prior to shipping so that installers need only insert and turn the screw, the floaters also possess collapsible panel rests for ease of transportation.
Project engineer Christoph Vollmer told pv magazine one such shipment is currently on its way to a chicken farmer in Queensland, Australia, who is particularly buoyed by the added FPV benefits of reduced water evaporation and algae growth. “Unlike competitors,” said Vollmer, “you can access each panel on our floaters for ease of maintenance, and the orientation can be adjusted, a bit like a chessboard, for south or, as in Australia, to the north.”
Over the past two days, the pv magazine team has scoured the halls of Intersolar, searching for the latest PV and energy storage trends, innovative new products, market predictions, and hot gossip. 
We've covered everything from animated debates at the green hydrogen forum, the women at Sonnen, and the philosophy of Reinhold Messner, to plug and play solar panels you can install yourself.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/13/evs-cheaper-than-gas-powered-cars-in-us-depending-on-state-incentives/,"MARKETS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 13, 2022","EVs cheaper than gas-powered cars in US, depending on state, incentives","From pv magazine USA
As gas prices escalate in the United States, many Americans are considering electric vehicles. The initial purchase price is a deal stopper for some, but when you look at the numbers, it appears that owning an electric vehicle is, in many US states, actually cheaper on a monthly basis than a gas-powered vehicle.
A new study by Energy Innovation Policy and Technology LLC finds that in most states, new EVs are cheaper to own on a monthly basis than gasoline-powered vehicles from the day they are driven off the lot.
The study found that owning an EV can save consumers an average of $6,000 over a vehicle’s lifetime. The big caveat, however, is that the savings are dependent on upon Congress passing EV consumer incentives. This includes, at minimum, the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV sales.
While the tax credit is a useful method of stimulating sales (and purportedly removing gas-powered vehicles off the roads), it comes with a catch – manufacturers can extend the credit to 200,000 EV sales in year. It is not insignificant that both Ford and Nissan will likely exceed the federal tax credit cap this year. Results of the study show that increasing the tax credit amount to $10,000 would make EVs cheaper in nearly every state-vehicle comparison in the study’s modeling. Currently gas prices are even higher than when the modeling was done, but if gas prices were to drop, tax credits take on even greater significance because the operating cost difference shrinks.
The study reviewed the monthly costs of owning six different EVs, comparing them to their gasoline equivalents.
These costs include financing, state taxes and fees, state and federal rebates and tax credits, fuel, maintenance, and insurance.
Financing costs are about the same between EVs and gas-powered vehicles, except where manufacturers are discounting interest rates for EV purchases. The good news is that after a loan is paid off, EVs become dramatically cheaper to own, with some saving as much as $1,500 to $2,000 per year, with some vehicle-state combinations as high as $3,000 per year.
Maintenance costs were found to be about 40% lower for EVs ($0.061/mile) compared to gasoline vehicles ($0.101/mile). Annual maintenance costs were estimated using per-mile estimates from DOE and estimated average annual mileage of 13,469 over the loan term using data from modeling done by the US Environmental Protection.
Vehicle fueling costs are estimated using annual mileage, fuel efficiency from FuelEconomy.gov, current average state gasoline prices from AAA as of May 4th, 2022 (which have risen since then) and 2021 average residential electricity rates. Different states levy different fees on electric vehicles—many assessing a “tax” to compensate for lost gasoline tax revenue. (The study does not look at the associated costs of charging from home with solar energy.) Maintenance, fuel costs, and other fees were added together to get the estimated annual operating costs.
The results show that the EV models of the Hyundai Kona SEL and Ford F-150 are cheaper in every single state to finance and own today than the equivalent gasoline model. The Volvo XC40 and Nissan models are just a few dollars or less in several of the states where it is cheaper to own the gasoline version. For example, the Nissan Leaf’s monthly difference is less than $15 in Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, and less than $1 per month in some states. Yellow shaded cells below show combinations where EVs were $15 or less per month more expensive to own. In states that have high electricity prices and/or lower gasoline prices, gasoline vehicles remain cheaper to own than EVs. Some of these states include Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.
While the initial sticker price on an electric vehicle may deter some from making the jump to electric from gas vehicles, the data shows that many EV models in many states are cheaper than a gasoline vehicle. The report authors noted, however, that increased EV adoption is contingent on a federal tax credit of at least $7,500. “GM and Tesla have already exceeded the sales cap under this program, and Nissan and Ford will likely hit the cap this year. Without this incentive, it would cost consumers more per month during loan repayment to purchase an EV for nearly all vehicle-state comparisons we evaluated.”

IKEA has launched a partnership with SunPower to deliver home solar solutions, starting in the fall in select markets in California. Members of the IKEA customer loyalty program will be able to purchase residential solar systems and battery energy storage at store locations.
The partnership brings IKEA's strengths in retail and home living, and SunPower carries more than 35 years of solar industry experience. SunPower systems are backed by a 25-year warranty, covering everything from panels to racking to monitoring hardware. It has among the highest DC power output protection in the solar industry, claiming 92% DC power in year 25.
SunPower’s energy storage offering, called the SunVault, offers backup power and can perform other services like peak demand response. It is equipped with 6.8 kW continuous power, 13 kWh/26 kWh rated energy capacity, and a 10-year warranty. It measures 26 inches x 63 inches x 15 inches and is rated for indoor or outdoor use.
“At IKEA, we’re passionate about helping our customers live a more sustainable life at home. We’re proud to collaborate with SunPower to bring this service to the US and enable our customers to make individual choices aimed at reducing their overall climate footprint,” said Javier Quinones, CEO and chief sustainability officer, noting that the goal is to expand the service at additional locations beyond select California retail sites in the future.
The company's sustainability measures also expand beyond the residential solar partnership, including goals to become “climate positive” by 2030. It has a portfolio that includes multiple utility-scale solar, wind and geothermal systems. Solar arrays top 90% of its retail locations.
The company has also instituted a buyback and resell program, which gives loyalty program members the opportunity to sell back gently used IKEA furniture in exchange for store credit. Rather than being landfilled, the furniture can be reused and sold affordably in the “as is” section in the store.
