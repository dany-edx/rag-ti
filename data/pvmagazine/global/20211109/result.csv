Passivation layers, deposited on top of the perovskite material, play an essential role in reducing material defects and unwanted reactions within the material, to improve both performance and stability. One strategy that has proved effective in research is the use of materials from a group known as alkylammonium halides. In many cases these form an additional two-dimensional perovskite layer on top of the perovskite, which can improve device stability but also negatively affect performance.
An international group of scientists representing institutes in China, Italy, Lithuania, Switzerland and Luxembourg, looked to overcome this challenge by using an isomer – a different arrangement of atoms – of a previously investigated passivation material, which was shown to be less ready to form a two-dimensional perovskite, but still offered many of the advantages. The approach is described in full in the paper Tuning structural isomers of phenylenediammonium to afford efficient and stable perovskite solar cells and modules, published in Nature Communications.
Cells fabricated with the passivation reached a conversion efficiency of 23.9% on a device measuring 0.09 cm², and 21.4% when this was scaled up to 26 cm². The devices maintained 85% of this initial efficiency after 1000 hours in operation, and 75% after 1000 hours heated to 85 degrees Celsius ina nitrogen atmosphere.
The team states that its study demonstrates a new material that could be of interest in perovskite cell manufacturing, and also a new approach in chemical engineering of the passivation layer that could yield even more impressive results. “This study demonstrates that altering functional groups and chemical structures should be an effective strategy to develop novel organic cation passivators with continuous and stable passivation effect,” they state, “which may pave the way for scaling up perovskite photovoltaics to sizes of commercial relevance.”

Two Belgian sites – Antwerp and Zeebrugge – have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chilean government at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, to speed up green hydrogen flows between South America and Western Europe. “This cooperation will remove the last barriers and gaps in the run-up to the effective start-up of green production, the establishment of the logistics chain between the continents, and the logistics in the Belgian seaports and their hinterland,” the Port of Antwerp wrote last week. The Belgian facilities are convinced the future Western European energy system will have to focus on solar and wind power, plus imported renewable hydrogen. Chile aims to produce the world's cheapest green hydrogen by 2030 and wants to be among the top three exporters by 2040. The renewable hydrogen generated in Chile in the foreseeable future will primarily be used for domestic purposes.
The Australian government, through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), will deliver an extra AU$1.5 million (US$1.11 million) to support Macquarie Group’s Green Investment Group, the Port of Newcastle, and project partners, to conduct an AU$3 million study on the potential of a hub for the energy storage medium at Newcastle, the Ministry for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction wrote yesterday. The study will focus on the best location at the port for the hydrogen infrastructure. “Newcastle is the biggest port on the east coast, with 50% of its capacity available for future industry development, making it a great asset for the region to become one of the seven Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs my government is delivering,” said Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, adding Newcastle and the surrounding Hunter region will be a key part of the AU$1.2 billion (US$889 million) investment in Australia’s hydrogen industry.
The Hydro Havrand green hydrogen unit of Norwegian mining and metals company Hydro, and Shell New Energies Holding Europe have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the potential for joint projects producing hydrogen from renewable electricity. The ambition is to use hydrogen to help decarbonize the operations of Hydro and Anglo-Dutch energy company Shell, and to supply customers in heavy industry, maritime and road transport. Replacing natural gas with green hydrogen for heating purposes in aluminum production will contribute toward Hydro’s commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 30% this decade, the company wrote today.
U.S. Democratic Party politicians have voted for the final passage of a US$1 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan, calling it a “largest-ever investment in America’s roads and bridges, water infrastructure, climate resilience projects, [and] internet access.” The bill was approved by the Senate in August. According to the White House, the legislation will enable a US$7.5 billion investment to build out a national network of EV chargers in the United States. The legislation will also focus on energy infrastructure and hydrogen. A majority of Republicans opposed the plan. Next week, Democrats are expected to support a second bill. “I also voted with a majority of my House colleagues to advance the [US]$1.75 trillion Build Back Better package, which would be our largest-ever investment in [combating] climate change and [reinforcing] our social safety net,” said Congressman Ed Case. “We are on course to pass this equally historic bill out of the House and send it to the Senate [on] the week of November 15, subject to Congressional Budget Office confirmation of the measure’s revenues and expenses.”
Europe is still leading the way for investment in electrolysis technology but other regions are catching up, Oxford-based Aurora Energy Research wrote in its biannual Hydrogen Market Attractiveness Rating Report. “The vast majority of electrolyzer projects are still located in Europe, but the share has fallen from 85% to 57%,” Aurora wrote last week. “Germany, the Netherlands, and the U.K. remain the most attractive markets for investment in hydrogen in Europe, with France and Norway close behind, in joint fourth place,” added the business intelligence firm.
Early testing by the Queensland University of Technology, in Australia, has suggested Titan Hydrogen’s fuel cell enhancement technology delivers significantly higher voltages than regular fuel cells. “The early work by the Queensland University of Technology on the company’s high-performance, low temperature hydrogen fuel cell found that it produced significantly higher voltage compared with a standard polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell operating at the same current density,” read an article republished by the Melbourne-based company last week. “We are encouraged by these early-stage results and look forward to further validation of the novel approach we are following,” chairman David Vinson said.
Scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), in California, have found atomic disorder in certain boron-based hydrogen storage systems can potentially improve the rate of hydrogen uptake, the the federal research facility wrote on Thursday. “Metal boride surfaces and their single-layer variants – known as borophenes – are generally thought to feature a regular arrangement of atoms at low to moderate temperatures,” said the lab on its website. “The LLNL team proved that, in many cases, these atoms actually disorder dynamically: a surprising phenomenon in contrast to conventional understanding of how most solid-state surfaces behave. The surface disorder means each atomic site has different local properties.” According to the team’s research, some of these sites can make dissociation of hydrogen molecules easier, which is expected to accelerate activation of the material during hydrogen storage. The work is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office.

Having last month announced it would consider divesting the commercial operation, the Californian business last week revealed C&I projects had contributed an $8 million hit to its third-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) figure of $17.5 million. Without that red result from its C&I customers – caused, in part by supply chain problems – the earnings number would have bested the $22.2 million posted in the previous three-month window.
Trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather and more will be discussed this afternoon at pv magazine‘s virtual Roundtables USA 2021 event. Join us as solar experts discuss the big issues from 4 p.m. (CET). For more information and to register free for the event, click here.
Although chief financial officer Manavendra Sial insisted in Wednesday's update the “commercial and industrial solutions (CIS) business also had strong bookings for the third quarter,” the financial update added: “The company is considering strategic options for CIS and will provide an update in the fourth quarter.”
The uncertainty over the future of the business unit was deepened by the fact SunPower – which is controlled by French giant TotalEnergies – stripped out its CIS numbers – plus its already-confirmed legacy businesses – in the section of the update devoted to its expectations for the current quarter and full year.
That is probably because the inclusion of the commercial and industrial segment has prompted SunPower to revise down its full-year expectations for revenue, from the previous $1.41-1.49 billion, and for EBITDA, from $110-130 million. Curiously, the press release issued to announce the Q3 update did not appear to specify what those outlook numbers have been pulled back to.
SunPower posted a quarterly net loss of $84.4 million – down from net income of $75.2 million in the previous window – with the reverse “primarily driven by” a negative adjustment to the value of the stake SunPower holds in microinverter and storage business Enphase Energy, which would appear to have knocked that income-loss number by $86 million, according to the section of the update concerned with more friendly, non-generally accepted accounting principles.
The installer was rather more keen to stress its rising number of residential customers, with 108 MW of such systems recognized in the last quarter, to take the business to a total 390,000 household customers, not including the extra 20,000 acquired when SunPower paid “up to $165 million” for rival Blue Raven Solar last month, to open up new custom in the Northwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets of the U.S.
SunPower said it expects to recognize 345-375 MW of residential solar systems this year, with 55,000-60,000 new customers added. The business also said it is on track to hit $100 million worth of storage systems, and revealed it had secured a grant of $6.65 million from the U.S. Department of Energy last quarter, for its role in the ‘connected communities' project which will assess the merits of community versus individual-household storage systems in two locations.

Despite CEO Mark Widmar warning “extended transit times for ocean freight impacted our third-quarter results,” and net sales for the three-month period falling $46 million from Q2, to $584 million, the solar manufacturer said it now expects to have a year-end net cash balance of $1.45-1.55 billion, a range $100 million higher than previously forecast.
That may be, in part, due to a lower-than-expected 2021 capital expenditure figure which has come in from $825-875 million to $675-725 million, with First Solar reporting, in Thursday's financial update, it began building its third factory in Ohio in the last quarter, and also started ordering equipment for its first Indian fab.
First Solar said it produced 2 GWdc of modules last quarter and pointed out the $51 million operating-income figure posted in Q3 was battered by $66 million worth of depreciation charges, $9 million related to the aforementioned production start-up costs, and another $6 million for shares compensation awards.
The other full-year forecasts made by the company remained unchanged and include an expected annual ‘gross margin' – net sales minus the cost of producing the goods but without selling expenses, tax etc taken into account – of $695-760 million. First Solar expects full-year net sales worth $2.88-3.1 billion on the back of an anticipated 7.6-8 GW of products shipped, as previously announced.

Chris Gordon, manager, project development, EDF Renewables North America
Karl Rábago, principal, Rábago Energy, LLC
Marlene Motyka, US and global renewable energy leader, Deloitte
Massoud Amin, professor, department of electrical and computer engineering, University of Minnesota
 
Motyka: Nations are currently operating with over 50% renewable penetration with no reliability issues.
Gordon: Distribution scale is where the industry is headed. Generation should be sited near load centers. This poses a high land-cost issue, as well as NIMBY concerns. Local zoning laws are slowing development.
Rábago: The path forward to the best value capture is the inclusion of both distributed AND utility-scale.
 
Ann Marie Augustus – co-founder, VP of operations, Urban Electric Power:
UEP reworks chemistry found in alkaline batteries (double AA) and makes it rechargable.
Zinc and manganese used in the batteries are much more abundant than lithium, offering a low-cost alternative.
The tech is safer, no issues of thermal runway.
George Schulz, VP, Clean Energy at Ariel Re:
New technologies present challenges for insurance underwriting.
Data is king when creating impactful insurance. There is a lack of data transparency in existing and emerging technologies.
Vartan Oskanian, advisor to the CEO, Recom, and Hamlet Tunyan, CEO Recom present: Heterojunction modules: technology, supply chains, and innovation.
Tunyan: Recom is still considering a heterojunction gigafactory in the U.S.
Recom module whitepapers provide extra levels of transparency showing where its supply chain originates. It also traces the total carbon emission output in its module creation, which it said is lower than industry averages.
Heterojunction combines silicon and thin-film technologies.
Parr:
A large amount of manufacturing (70-90%) is located in China.
Chinese solar has nearly double the carbon emissions of the rest of the world.
If manufacturing continues solely in China, within 20 years carbon emissions could double the global emissions of the aluminum industry.
A geographically diverse manufacturing supply chain is needed.
Ossoff and Demings bills create a web of policies that will expand manufacturing in the U.S.
Market demand will be the strongest force for reducing carbon. Buyers must actively select low-carbon module sourcing, which will spur manufacturing in low-carbon regions.

Speakers:
Suzanne Leta, head of policy and strategy at SunPower
Elizabeth Sanderson, exec. director at Solar Energy International
Dean Solon, founder, Shoals Technologies Group
Paul Wormser, VP of technology at Clean Energy Associates
 
Leta: One of the best ways we can address the soft costs of permitting is through automated permitting. This is widely available from DOE-backed SolarAPP+
Sanderson: 30% of the solar workforce are women, 8% are Black. The industry needs to address these diversity shortcomings.
Nielsen:
Decarbonization plus electrification could save $1.7 trillion in net savings through 2050.
About 0.5% of total land area of the entire U.S. is estimated to be needed to decarbonize the grid. (1/80th the land used for agriculture.)
Securing the domestic supply chain is a chief concern of the DOE.
Long-term policy efforts are being considered, but the low cost of energy and market forces are driving the bulk of solar growth.
DOE's deputy director Garrett Nielsen will present a keynote discussion on solar futures.
He will be followed by a panel discussion “Lead, follow, or get out of the way: What solar needs to expand”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/09/gallium-arsenide-nanowire-solar-cell-with-7-7-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORWAY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",Gallium arsenide nanowire solar cell with 7.7% efficiency,"Solar cells based on III-V materials such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) can achieve much higher efficiencies than those ensured by conventional crystalline silicon. Their costs, however, still confine the technology to niche segments such as applications in space or expensive innovative projects with relatively long implementation timeframes.
Some researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) have decided to take a different approach and used GaAs not as a substrate for the solar cell but as a material to fabricate an axial p-i-n junction nanowire array. These nanowires are then used to build a nanowire solar cell to be used as a top cell in a dual tandem cell with a bottom silicon cell.
Nanowire solar cells have the advantage over planar solar cells in allowing for a thick absorbing layer to fully absorb the solar spectrum. Other advantages are reduced reflection, extreme light trapping, improved bandgap tuning, facile strain relaxation, and increased defect tolerance.
The nanowires were grown through molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which is a technique commonly used for thin-film deposition of single crystals in the production of semiconductor devices.
“We have worked to minimize the cost of growing the top GaAs nanowire cell, because it’s the GaAs fabrication cost that is one of the major issues that is currently holding back the technology,” said researcher Helge Weman, noting that these nanowires could be easily produced on an industrial scale through metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The latter is a different type of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and is commonly utilized for the deposition of crystalline micro or nano-thin films.
The nanowire structure used in the cell has a tiny footprint and this, according to the research team, enabled the formation of high-quality crystals in the nanowire and in the interface with the silicon, which improved the overall cell's efficiency.
“Employing this method, a GaAs nanowire array solar cell with only around 1.3% areal coverage of the nanowires shows a photoconversion efficiency of around 7.7% under 1 Sun intensity [at standard radiation conditions], which is the highest achieved efficiency from any single-junction GaAs nanowire solar cell grown on a silicon substrate so far,” the researchers stated. “This corresponds to a power-per-weight ratio of the active III–V photoconversion material [of] as high as 560 W/g, showing great promise for high-efficiency and low-cost III–V nanowire solar cells and III–V nanowire-silicon tandem solar cells.”
The details on the solar cell and the related manufacturing technique can be found in the paper GaAs/AlGaAs Nanowire Array Solar Cell Grown on Si with Ultrahigh Power-per-Weight Ratio, which was recently published in ACS Photonics. “We are exploring growing this type of lightweight nanowire structure on atomically thin two-dimensional substrates such as graphene,” said researcher Anjan Mukherjee, referring to the further development of the technique. “This could open up enormous opportunities to produce lightweight and flexible solar cells that can be used in self-powered drones, micro-satellites and other space applications.”

“The new microCELL MCS advanced laser system has been designed to meet the photovoltaic  market’s demands for boosting module power output and service life by minimizing power losses and providing for an exceptionally high mechanical strength of cut cells,” the manufacturer said. “It enables the highest throughputs for cutting cell sizes up to M12/G12 into half-cells or shingled cells.”
The machine purportedly can produce more than 6,000 wafers per hour and is suitable for solar cells with temperature-sensitive coatings, or depositions such as heterojunction (HJT) devices.
“Depending on the number of laser sources, the system is able to cut up to sixth-cut cells without decreasing the throughput,” the company said.
The system is based on 3-D Micromac's patented thermal laser separation process and includes a one-pass contactless dicing process. The manufacturer said this enables the manufacturing of solar cells with significantly higher mechanical stability.
“The ablation-free technique guarantees an excellent edge quality,” it said. “As a result, the separated cells have up to 30 percent higher mechanical strength compared to ablative laser processes and enable a lower power degradation over the solar module’s life cycle.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/09/quantum-dot-solar-window-with-3-6-efficiency/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",Quantum dot solar window with 3.6% efficiency,"UbiQD, a U.S. manufacturer of luminescent glass panels, has deployed its quantum dot-tinted glass luminescent solar concentrator technology on several windows at a Holiday Inn Express hotel in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the company is based.
“These building pilot installations represent the first real-world tests for UbiQD, and some of the earliest and largest known luminescent concentrator window installations in the world,” the manufacturer said. “The trials aim to validate the importance of parameters like window orientation, time of day, seasonality, temperature, and manufacturing and installation methods.”
It developed the technology with the support of the U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Washington, and Western Washington University.
The 3.6%-efficient solar window is made via a low-cost manufacturing process with laminated glass and luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), based on copper indium sulfide and zinc sulfide (CuInS2/ZnS) quantum dots (QDs). The quantum dots are provided by U.S. nanotech company Nanosys and are embedded in a polymer placed in the fluorophore interlayer of the laminated glass.
The QD-tinted glass absorbs sunlight and the glow from the QDs gets trapped in the glass by internal reflection. Glow light is then guided to the window edges, where solar cells are placed in series. These cells form a PV system that can reach a power conversion efficiency of up to 3.6%.
The type of quantum dots used to create the laminated interlayer determines the color of the window.
“We can access nearly the entire color spectrum range with quantum dots, and so there is the customer option to create a really beautiful thing that makes a building pop in a fun way while also creating an impact,” UbiQD CEO Hunter McDaniel said. “The customer can also choose a more normal neutral color tint with our near-infrared dots, and we’ve installed two versions of that as well.”
The manufacturer said its solar concentrator tech is a drop-in solution that can be easily adopted in conventional processes to fabricate windows. It also claims the solar windows have a five-year payback time.
The company recently secured $7 million of venture financing to support the commercial deployment of the windows.
“UbiQD intends to accelerate the deployment of its quantum dot window technology in 2022,” the company said. “Additional window projects are planned in New Mexico, Colorado and Washington state.”

The trial project is being developed with the support of the City of Cape Town municipal authority, the Water Research Commission, and South Africa-based specialist Floating Solar (Pty) Ltd, and is aimed at assessing the potential of the floating PV technology for Cape Town's territory. “We will run this experiment for 12 months, while continuing with other projects across Southern Africa,” said Peter Varndell, from Floating Solar.
The one-year timeframe is aimed at evaluating the project performance during a full seasonal weather cycle. “During this period, we will be reporting at contracted intervals,” said UCT researcher Richard Larmour.
The scientists will also assess the effect of water in reducing PV panel temperatures, and that of the panels themselves in reducing water evaporation.
The floating PV system was built with the Hydrelio floating platforms developed by French specialist Ciel&Terre. “The Kraaifontein floating solar plant produces electricity at pilot scale only and is designed for research purposes,” Larmour added. “Once the performance of this technology has been accurately ascertained, the city will be in a position to include it in strategic planning at scale on larger bodies of water.”

The heat pump will be provided by Germany-based MAN Energy Solutions SE – which is a supplier of large-bore diesel engines and turbomachinery for marine and stationary applications – and will be powered by wind farms located nearby.
The electro-thermal energy storage (ETES) heat pump is a large scale ‘trigeneration' facility for the simultaneous storage, use, and distribution of electricity, heat, and cold. The system uses electricity to produce thermal energy that can then be used for heating or cooling or reconverted into electricity. It has an electrical input and output ranging from 2 to 5o MW and its storage capacity ranges from 10 to several hundred MWh.
Through this heat pump technology, electricity, heat, and cooling are no longer treated separately but become part of an overarching energy management system. In the process, ETES functions as a bridge between the electricity-supply and heating and cooling supply markets.
Stored cooling and heat from ETES can be distributed to different types of consumers. For instance, heat can be transferred to district heating, the food processing industry and laundry facilities. Applications for cooling, meanwhile, include data centers, ice hockey or skating arenas, and air conditioning for skyscrapers.
“ABB will deploy its complete electrical, instrumentation and control (EIC) package, motors and variable speed drives for the powerhouse of the heat pump, which will be the world’s largest seawater heat pump based on CO2 as refrigerant,” the company said in a statement. “With Esbjerg facing the UNESCO world heritage area of the Wadden Sea, the careful selection of the right pump was essential.”
“This project demonstrates how energy harvested from the increasingly important renewable [energy] sector can be harnessed outside of the power grid, and how essential sector-coupling will be to a decarbonized energy future,” said MAN Energy Solutions in a statement released in September. “With an overall heating capacity of 50 MW, the coming district-heating plant will supply around 100,000 local inhabitants with approximately 235,000 MWh of heat annually.”

The study proposes an “extended producer responsibility” (EPR) regulatory framework for efficient management of India’s EOL solar PV modules. The EPR concept, as practiced in Europe, makes producers responsible for developing an efficient takeback system.
The study was done by Suresh Jain and Tanya Sharma, both from the Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati. They worked with Anil Kumar Gupta from the National Institute of Disaster Management. They said that around 2.95 billion tons of solar power material (including PVs and balance-of-systems) is expected to enter India’s electronic-waste stream by 2047. 
At present, solar power waste management is a neglected sector in India and follows an unregularized, unscientific and informal approach. Solar waste is currently regarded as general electronic waste under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. There is no mention of solar PV as a potential waste stream in the e-waste rules. And the presence of an informal and illegal sector to manage e-waste in India hampers circularity and requires regulation.  There is therefore significant scope for the development of a policy approach to manage this emerging waste stream.
The proposed framework provides for a multi-sector and multi-stakeholder approach for solar PV waste management by advocating the constitution of two committees: a technical and regulatory committee and an executive management committee. The technical and regulatory committee would be responsible for developing policies to regulate the EOL management of solar PV waste. 
The management committee would work under the technical and regulatory committee on the execution of EPR. It would be responsible for managing solar PV panels that reach the EOL stage. It would also be accountable for repurchasing solar PV modules and developing transport systems between end-users and EOL management units.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture awarded the University of Illinois a $10 million grant for an agrivoltaics project called Sustainably Colocating Agricultural and Photovoltaic Electricity Systems (SCAPES).
The project seeks to provide interdisciplinary scientific knowledge, along with extension and education programs, to study sustainable agrivoltaic designs in various combinations of crop species. Row crops, foraging crops (for livestock), and specialty crops all will be studied across three biophysically diverse regions of the United States.: Illinois, Colorado, and Arizona.
SCAPES seeks to combine farm-scale economic analysis with cutting-edge field experiments. It aims to study the system-wide effects on markets and climate systems which result from various agrivoltaic configurations. The program will take a systems modeling approach to extrapolate biophysical and economic outcomes.

If the right data emerge, then professionals will likely be able to develop software tools for use in agrivoltaic project development and deployment.
The study is timely, a rapidly falling prices of solar panels have created an impetus for the construction of solar fields, which are often perceived as competing with crop production.
Potential land use conflicts have been brewing for years in the United States, despite emerging agrivoltaics research showing that land conflicts can be solved by co-locating solar panels with crops, thereby increasing both food and electricity production.
For example, agrivoltaic research from the Fraunhofer Institute has suggested that a wheat field covered with raised solar panels would generate around 80% of the wheat that would otherwise result without panels, and roughly 80% of the electricity. However, combining food and energy production dramatically increased the net revenue output from the same piece of land.
The Illinois-led project has three objectives. The first is to engage key stakeholders – including farmers, landowners, and solar developers and their associations – to determine hypothetically optimal configurations of solar integrated with food crop production.
The second goal is to optimize design considerations based on location-specific crop productivity, resource needs, and electricity generation models. The last objective will create what are expected to be high-impact experiential educational programs integrated with research to reach students as well as farmers.
The approach will search for existing solar facilities in each region and plant C3 (for example, soybeans, spinach, and rice) and C4 crop  species between panels to learn how they respond to various levels, duration, and timing of shade. C4 plants such as corn use a CO2 respiration process which improves nitrogen, water, and photosynthetic efficiency, and would likely find benefit from the shade of solar panels in only the hottest climates. C3 plants are more common, making up 95% of green plants, and typically grow more efficiently in partial shade.
Once collected, the data will be used to set up an agrivoltaic simulation model to guide the design of the three research and demonstration sites.
Three existing solar farms – Solar Farm 2.0 at Illinois, Jack’s Solar Garden at Colorado State University, and the Agrivoltaics Learning Lab at the University of Arizona – will be used to generate the initial data. The model built from these data will have a goal of representing onsite light transmission as well as water and thermal dynamics. It will then be integrated with crop growth models to guide design.
