The membrane-less battery charges and discharges by using an electrolyzer that splits sodium chloride (NaCl) into sodium (Na) and chlorine.
“The chlorine is then stored in the aqueous electrolyte, while the sodium is stored in the cathode,” Salgenx CEO Greg Giese told pv magazine. “In this instance, the cathode comprises a sacrificial material, graphite, which intercalates the sodium. Salgenx applies a proprietary technique that exfoliates the graphite into individual layers of graphene, which can be further processed for higher purity.”
The process of graphene exfoliation occurs during charging due to an electrochemical process. When an electric potential is applied to the graphite host, it causes guest-charged species in the electrolyte to intercalate into the graphite’s interlayer galleries and produce gaseous products that contribute to structural expansion, according to a recent paper on the topic.
The method does not use up sodium, leaving it for the battery’s discharge process. Salgenx claims it produces graphene for less than $1.25 per gram, compared to an average price of graphene of $100 to $400 per gram. “Salgenx's flow battery system typically takes 4 to 6 hours to charge, usually during off-peak hours, enabling simultaneous production of graphene to enhance payback and become a revenue model,” the US-based tech startup said in a statement.
The on-demand graphene production machine will initially target the fiberglass and carbon fiber fabrication industry but can reportedly be applied to any graphene additive space.
In March, Salgenx said it had developed a system that uses the electricity stored in its battery to produce clean drinking water from seawater.

“Using lighter materials and frames, Panda 3.0 Pro 108 cell has advantages of lightness and easy installation in addition to high power, high efficiency, high bifaciality, and high reliability,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The product is more suitable for residential power plants and other distributed power plants.”
The 108-cell Panda 3.0 PRO modules are available in six versions, with power outputs ranging from 410 W to 435 W and efficiencies ranging from 21.0% to 22.28%. The open-circuit voltage is between 37.75 V and 38.69 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.91 A and 14.22 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels measure 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 24.8 kg. They feature IP67 enclosures and 2 mm tempered glass. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“A new surface passivation system improved the cell's open-circuit voltage,” the company spokesperson said. “And a low-power laser splitting technology reduces cell cutting loss.”
The modules are based on a TOPCon 24.5%-efficient cells with front-laminated composite film passivation. This reportedly enables the back tunnel oxide passivation contact technology to improve the cell open-circuit voltage by more than 710 mV.
Yingli currently has a TOPCon cell capacity of 5 GW. It should reach 10 GW next year and 15 GW in 2024. In August, it unveiled a 156-cell Panda 3.0 PRO module with power outputs up to 615 W.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/13/getting-real-on-forced-labor/,"EMPLOYMENT,LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,EUROPE",,"APRIL 13, 2023",Getting real on forced labor,"From pv magazine Global 04/23
The European Commission’s proposed ban on forced labor would apply to EU internal markets and put import and export controls in place. Under the plan outlined by the commission in September 2022, products featuring traces of forced labor at any stage of their supply chain would be withdrawn from the market and disposed of. The recall of products that have already reached end-users in the EU, however, would not be covered by the proposed regulation.
Conducting a thorough due diligence review of forced labor content would be mandatory and would be the key instrument for investigation of any potential supply chain presence of forced labor. The EU plans to provide guidance within 18 months after the proposal would come into force. While a ban would be a powerful stimulus to address the problem of forced- and child labor, human rights NGOs see shortcomings in the commission’s draft proposal.
Unlike similar US legislation, the proposed EU ban would not come into effect from the moment there is suspicion of forced labor but rather, from the point it has been proven.
In addition, the proposed EU legislation does not prioritize the victims of forced labor. It should include remedies for the people affected. Furthermore, it does not include a procedure of withdrawal and disposal of forced-labor products and could lead to the rerouting of forced labor goods to countries that do not have sound policies in place.
From an industry perspective, renewables developers and investors have raised concern about rising raw material prices which are increasing production costs and putting pressure on margins. The compliance costs related to conducting the relevant due diligence to comply with the proposed EU legislation, however, are likely to be a minor burden compared to expected overall pricing pressure.
Companies can take six steps to be ready for EU forced labor rules.
There is an increasing body of research focusing on human rights violations in renewable energy supply chains and manufacturing processes. There is a growing awareness of just how serious this issue is. Forced- and child labor are present across industries such as food, electronics, textiles, and automotive, to name just a few.
There is a risk that everyday consumers are contributing to human rights violations and injustice. The true cost of what consumers buy is often paid by someone else, someone end users have never met. Upgrading moral standards sometimes comes at an economic cost but it must be done anyway, simply because it is the right thing to do.
The renewables sector has a chance to show leadership once again, building on the incredible contribution it has made towards addressing the climate crisis. This time, let’s walk the talk on environmental, social, and corporate governance policy by working to eliminate forced labor from supply chains.

Tesla has unveiled the third iteration of its Master Plan series, outlining the company’s vision for transitioning the United States and the world toward a sustainable future powered by clean electricity generation sources. The report covers a wide range of topics, including electricity generation, energy storage, transportation, investments, mineral use, heat pumps, electrification of industrial heating, recycling, and the electrification of boats and planes.

The document projects a need for 30 TW of predominantly wind and solar capacity, along with 240 TWh of energy storage. The Master Plan’s bibliography cites numerous data sources, including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Fraunhofer, the International Energy Association, and Princeton University’s Net Zero America plan.
The plan envisions a global deployment of 18.3 TW of solar power, 12.1 GW of wind power, and 2.5 TW of electrolyzers. The generation sources will supply 112 TWh of vehicle batteries, 40 TWh of plane and ship batteries, 46.2 TWh of stationary ‘e-chem’ batteries, 41.4 TWh of thermal batteries, and a substantial 642 TWh of hydrogen storage.

For the United States, the report proposes 3 TW of solar generation, which includes 15 million residential rooftops, industrial storage paired with 43 GW of commercial rooftop solar, 1.9 TW of onshore wind, and 64 GW of offshore wind. No new nuclear generation was considered.
In addition to generation resources, the Master Plan estimates a need for 6.5 TWh of 8-hour lithium-ion batteries, 6.9 TWh of industrial thermal storage, and 418 GW of electrolyzers providing 107 TWh of hydrogen storage facilities in the United States. The plan also considers an additional 1.2 TWh of distributed stationary batteries as replacements for over 200 GW of existing backup generator capacity.
Tesla categorizes the required 30 GW of capacity into six areas: repowering the existing grid, EV charging, heat pumps, high-temperature heat, hydrogen, and power for planes and boats. Repowering the grid demands the largest share, with 11 TW of capacity, while both EV and heat pumps require 5 TW each.

The report recommends utilizing the shoulder seasons of spring and fall, when electricity demand is low and solar and wind generation curtailment is more common, to produce and store hydrogen. This approach would align well with the higher consumption periods during summer and winter.
The Master Plan indicates that the total necessary manufacturing capacity for solar panels is 610 GW per year, with an estimated cost of $347.3 million per year per gigawatt of manufactured solar panels, following an initial $212 billion investment to build the factories. The document estimates the total twenty-year investment at $424 billion, resulting in a base cost of about $0.024 per watt.
The company estimated that solar recycling would cost $14 million per year after a $9 billion factory investment.
The document’s implementation relies on the interconnection of the United States’ major power grid regions.

AGL’s $180 million Torrens Island battery energy storage system is approaching commercial operation with South Australia’s electricity transmission network owner ElectraNet confirming it has executed the transmission connection agreement following the approval of performance standards by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
The one-hour-duration battery is being developed at the site of AGL’s gas-fired Torrens Island power station and will be used to support South Australia’s energy transition, providing essential capacity when renewable generation is impacted and during periods of high demand.
“Full energisation and commissioning activities for AGL’s Torrens Island battery will happen in the next few weeks.” Electranet’s Manager Customer Connections Niketan Tyagi said.
“We have been providing essential support in the testing and commissioning of the auxiliary load of this project while waiting for the required performance standards to be approved by the Australia Energy Market Operator and our team.”
AGL’s project director for the battery, Thomas Hill, said the execution of the connection agreement is a significant milestone for the energy storage system, which features grid-forming technology and will initially focus on providing grid services.

The battery, being delivered by Finnish technology company Wärtsilä, is initially sized at 250 MW and 250 MWh but expansion plans allow for up to 1,000 MWh, or four hours of storage capacity.
“The Torrens Island battery is an important asset, both for AGL’s portfolio and the state of South Australia,” Hill said.
“The battery will support the uptake of greater levels of renewable energy, improve the security and reliability of the grid and help to put downward pressure on power prices. It’s also a key pillar of our plan to transition the Torrens Island site into an integrated, low-carbon industrial energy hub.”
The Torrens Island project forms part of AGL’s ambition to have 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by 2030, expanding upon a 2.9 GW pipeline of renewable generation and energy storage projects in active planning and development.
Among the company’s other energy storage projects is a 200 MW, four-hour duration grid-scale battery to be built at the Loy Yang A power station site in Victoria, and a 500 MW/2 GWh battery at the soon-to-be-closed Liddell power station in New South Wales.
It has received the tick of approval from NSW planning authorities for a 50MW/100MWh battery in Broken Hill, and It has announced a deal with Maoneng Group to buy capacity from four 50 MW /100 MWh batteries in NSW and is already operating the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South battery in Queensland and the 30 MW/8MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.

Lodestone Energy has commenced construction of the 32 MW Edgecumbe Solar Farm after announcing it has reach financial close on the project being developed in the Bay of Plenty Region on New Zealand’s North Island.
The Edgecumbe Solar Farm, being built near the town of the same name, will comprise approximately 60,000 Trina PV modules with tracking technology and when complete is expected to generate about 53 GWh of clean energy per annum, enough to supply more than 6,000 New Zealand homes and businesses.
Lodestone Energy Managing Director Gary Holden said the project is the second of five solar farms included in the company’s first phase of growth and the start of construction follows on from the start of construction of the 39.4 MW Kaitaia Solar Farm in December.
“Today we’ve reached financial close on our Edgecumbe site,” Holden said. “We’ve got our senior debt facility in place with Westpac and have engaged Infratec New Zealand to construct the farm.”
Holden said the solar farms are underpinned by long-term power purchase agreements with retailers Pulse Energy and Prime Energy with the first of the projects to be generating clean energy before the end of 2023.
“We’re underway in Kaitaia and expect to be generating electricity on in the second half of this year,” he said. “In early 2024, we’ll also be generating electricity at Edgecumbe, and we have a further three sites already confirmed and underway.”
The company is also developing solar farms in Dargaville, Waiotahe Valley and Whitianga, and is also looking for other sites to build on with a number of locations “under advanced stages of investigation.”
Lodestone said each of its solar farms is designed to allow stock grazing and horticulture to continue around and underneath the solar infrastructure, ensuring it maximises New Zealand’s renewable energy output in the most sustainable way.
The company said the approach will allow the land to continue to be productive, with more than 85% of baseline farming yield expected when the solar farm is operational.

KAUST Professor Stefaan De Wolf made the announcement on the university's LinkedIn account.
“Glad to announce we obtained a certified power conversion efficiency of 33.2% for our monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solars cells developed at the KAUST Solar Center,” he said. “With this, perovskite/silicon tandems are now the most efficient two-junction solar cell technology under standard illumination conditions, even better than III-Vs.”
The European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) has certified the result.
“The 33.2% efficiency was just added to the NREL chart,” he told pv magazine. “The cells are indeed a further improvement on our previous devices.”
In January, KAUST announced a power conversion efficiency of 28.1% for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell based on textured silicon wafers. In August 2022, it claimed a 26.2% efficiency for a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem photovoltaic device.
In December 2021, KAUST researchers achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.2% for a tandem solar cell with an area of around 1 cm2, based on an n-i-p perovskite stacked on top of a silicon heterojunction.
The same research group recently announced an inverted perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell with a 1 nm interlayer based on magnesium fluoride (MgFx) placed between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL), in order to reduce voltage losses.

Viessmann has integrated a Wallbox into its hybrid energy system, which features photovoltaics, battery storage, and a heat pump. The product has a charging capacity of 11 kW (three-phase) and is equipped with a 7.5-meter “Type 2” charging cable. An integrated Measurement Instruments Directive (MID) counter enables charging processes for company vehicles to be billed.
The Wallbox can be integrated into the house's energy management system via the Viessmann One Base platform, whose Green Charging function allows charging with solar power alone. The Mixed Charging mode also allows electric vehicles to be charged quickly with grid electricity and solar power. Customers can monitor the system via an app.
The German heating specialist has also launched a new sub-distribution system to link the individual components of the package. It says the pre-assembled sub-distribution system offers all the necessary electrical pre-wiring and fuses for a three-phase “Viessmann One Base” energy system. The sub-distribution system can also be used to integrate additional components at a later stage, says the company.
Viessmann recommends using “Adminprofi,” a digital application assistant for its electricity-based systems. All of the necessary information can be provided within just a few minutes, as there is no need for time-consuming communication with the network operator, says the company.

But, with an eye on solar’s history of deployment on space missions – combined with an enthusiasm for big screen classics – the folks at West Yorkshire-based PV installer Solar Fast have put their heads together to have a stab at estimating how many 400 W panels would be needed to power the technology in some of our favorite on-screen moments.
Let’s start with the world’s most famous DeLorean.
“Great Scott, Marty, we need 1.21 GW!”
That’s the kind of energy you were only going to find in a bolt of lightning in 1955 – at least in a small town in the US.
The 1.21 GW weren’t to power the car itself, of course, they were needed to kick-start the nuclear reaction in the flux capacitor (see Busted’s forthcoming UK tour for more details).
That means Doc would have needed 3.025 million 400 W panels set up in Hill Valley’s main street to get Marty back to 1985 in sustainable fashion, not to mention a fair wedge of batteries, given Marty was travelling at 10:04 p.m.
By contrast, the task of juicing up the electric fences needed to keep Jurassic Park’s velociraptors at bay would be much more achievable.
With the fences charged to deliver 10,000 V, and with agricultural electric fences today able to reach that level and use a single energizer to power 14 km, we reckon you’d need only nine panels to power the 80 miles of fencing on Isla Nublar. None of which solves the problem of grasping employees switching them off, of course.
As far as Star Wars’ Death Star is concerned, the member of Solar Fast staff who tried to work out how much energy would be required to power the planet-destroying laser had to be taken for a lie down in a darkened room so we reined in our ambition and instead looked at the load required to simply keep the lights on.
Wikipedia authoritatively states the Death Star has 85 levels and 257 sub-levels with more than 2 million staff occupying a floor space of 120km x 120km for a volume of roughly 9.05e14m3.
If we estimate around 101.76 billion 100 W lights bulbs would be needed, that’s more than 25.4 billion panels needed on the surface of a spaceship upon which windows appear to have been at a premium, although, Darth Vader would probably have been quite handy at securing a bulk purchase discount.
Staying with space opera, we pondered how many panels would be needed to power the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D Federation Galaxy-class starship captained by Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Now there’s a chap likely to be on board with the energy transition.
The Treknology website informs us “Warp drive in Star Trek works by annihilating matter (in the form of deuterium, a kind of hydrogen gas) and antimatter in a fusion reaction mediated by dilithium crystals. This produces the enormous power required to warp space-time and drive the ship faster than light.” But y’all knew that already, right?
With the potential to produce 2.5 PW of energy – to get the ship to warp 9 – and 2.5 million panels needed per gigawatt of output, the Enterprise would have needed 6.25 trillion panels.
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
How about, then, the Ghostbusters’ proton packs, desired by every kid attending a fancy dress party in 1984 and enjoying a renaissance since their appearance in Netflix smash Stranger Things?
The GBFans.com website informs us each pack was powered by Curium-246 and needs 1.5 MW to trap a Focused, Non-Terminal Repeating Phantasm or a Class 5 Full-Roaming Vapor.
With that kind of load, each pack would have needed 3,750 of our panels to get going but we’re confident Egon would have trimmed the number by using batteries and having a decent rooftop system installed at the station.
The Proton Pack requirement is considerably less than what’s needed to fire up the arc reactor that powers Tony Stark’s Iron Man suit and just think, it had gone through 42 designs by the third film, all apparently powered by a domestic socket!
As Stark says during his big screen debut, “If my math is right – and it always is – three gigajoules per second” is the load required. That would equate to 3 GW of generation capacity and, therefore, 7.5 million panels.
Still, if anyone would be able to rise to a technical engineering challenge like that, it would be our man Tony, although, given it’s a palladium-powered fusion power source, maybe Stark Industries wouldn’t have been the most likely candidate to be pursuing solar power.
And don’t get us started on the subject of the reputational damage recent Daniel Craig whodunnit Glass Onion has caused to the green hydrogen industry. That’s a whole ‘nother debate entirely.

Commission de régulation de l'énergie (CRE), the French energy regulator, has published the results of the third tender round for ground-mounted and commercial and industrial rooftop installations.
This last round of the French renewable energy tenders was undersubscribed, with a significant increase in final prices. Finergreen, a French consulting firm specializing in renewable energy, analyzed the latest results and compared them with those of the previous tender rounds.
“It would appear that many bidders failed to comply with the financial security requirement in the latest version of the tender specifications due to misinterpretation, which made their bid null,” Finergreen said in a recent report on the procurement exercises. “This situation echoes the results of the latest tenders for onshore wind and ground-mounted photovoltaics – both published in the last two weeks – where many developers met the same fate with their applications.”
The CRE allocated just 58 MW of the 400 MW originally planned in the undersubscribed C&I rooftop PV tender. It selected 16 projects at an average final price of €104/MWh, up 15% from the September 2022 tender. The regulator selected just seven projects in the ground-mounted solar power plants, for a total capacity of 115 MW, against initial expectations for 925 MW. The final average price was €82.20/MWh, up 20% compared from the August 2022 tender. The selected developers included Q Energy, Neoen, and Kronos Solar.
The French government has announced plans that hold a 1.5 GW tender for ground-mounted PV and another tender for 800 MW of rooftop capacity, in order to compensate for the high failure rate of the latest tenders.

With a peak capacity of 562 kW, the Tambak Lorok plant is operated by PLN subsidiary PLN Indonesia Power (PLN IP). PLN claims the installation is Indonesia's largest floating solar array to date.
The floating plant is part of a larger 920 kW PV project under construction at the site of the Gas and Steam Power Generation Complex, which is operated by the company’s PLN IP Semarang Power Generation Unit. Built by PLN IP and its PT Indo Energi Hijau subsidiary, the floating PV plant was constructed over an eight-month period on a pond measuring 1 hectare. The company claims the plant will produce 1.4 million kWh a year, helping to reduce CO2 gas emissions by up to 1,304 tons.
PLN has already undertaken a number of initiatives to achieve that goal, such as the phase-out of coal-fired power plants, said PLN Managing Director Darmawan Prasodjo. Instead, PLN has started building new renewable energy plants. The company’s main strategy is shifting away from fossil-based generators to renewable energy-powered generators, he added.
The floating PV array is also part of the group’s efforts to optimize potential land that can be integrated with renewable energy generation.
PLN IP recently said that it is looking for potential investment partners for its Proyek Hijaunesia 2023 project. The plan includes several large-scale ground-mounted and floating solar plants, as well as wind farms.
