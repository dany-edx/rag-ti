Terabase Energy, developer of Terafab, an automated utility-scale solar installation platform, announced it has successfully completed its first commercial installation. The company’s “field factory” installed 17 MW of a 225 MW solar project in Arizona in development by Leeward Renewable Energy and engineering and construction contractor RES.
The Terafab system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7.
In the Arizona project, Terabase said its labor productivity improved 25% when compared with manual installation.
“[The project] demonstrates that Terabase’s technology can drive substantial progress in solar construction safety, quality, cost, and schedule,” said Will Schultek, vice president of construction, RES.
The installation system cuts the amount of labor needed on-site and improves working conditions for laborers. Workers are housed in shaded and cooled conditions, allowing for system operation and installation in harsh desert environments.
Reducing labor requirements to install utility-scale solar projects may prove useful for accelerating the energy transition. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects a demand of 800,000 new solar workers by 2030 to build the projects the United States needs to be on pace with its decarbonization plan. However, 44% of solar industry employers report it is “very difficult” to find qualified applicants, said the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC).
Terabase’s field factory also enabled a 100% return on solar panel packaging for reuse by the manufacturer.
Leeward Renewable Energy executive vice president of project execution Sam Mangrum said the benefits demonstrated in the project underscore the “transformative potential of automation” in solar.
“This milestone marks a pivotal moment in our mission to accelerate solar plant deployment to meet the terawatt scale demands of the future,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer at Terabase Energy. “Furthermore, the Terafab system was deployed alongside our Construct digital twin software for managing and monitoring solar power plant construction.”

Dutch company Gasunie reported in an emailed note that, the same day that BP, Uniper, E.ON/Essent, Onyx Power, Equinor, and Engie signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to transport hydrogen via the Netherlands to industrial customers in Germany. EnBW and Rotterdam's import terminal ACE Terminal also announced plans to cooperate in supplying hydrogen from ACE Terminal's planned facilities at the Port of Rotterdam to German end-users.
Gasunie and Danish national transmission system operator Energinet agreed on the next steps for developing the Danish-German hydrogen network. “From 2028, a cross-border transmission connection between Denmark and Germany will enable the transport of green hydrogen. To this end, the two companies want to jointly develop the hydrogen network between Western Denmark and Northern Germany,” said Gusanie. The cross-border network is expected to span from the hydrogen underground storage in Lille Torup in the north of Denmark to Heidenau, south of Hamburg, with a total length of approximately 550 kilometers.
Turneo, a joint venture between Hamburg-based Karlsson and the energy service provider EWE, started operations of its 2 MW electrolysis plant producing the first green hydrogen in Cuxhaven, a seaside town on Germany's North Sea coast. German energy company Turneo supplied the fuel for the first of four supply vessels in the Mittelplate fleet of Wintershall Dea. The ship transports passengers and goods between Cuxhaven and the Mittelplate drilling and production island. “In the future, the plant will also produce hydrogen for other ships and provide a hydrogen refueling station in Cuxhaven,” said Turneo.
HDF Energy committed to co-developing the green hydrogen White Dunes project in the Dakhla region of Morocco. “This collaboration has been made possible by HDF Energy's forthcoming minority stake in the project, sealing a strong partnership with Falcon Capital Dakhla, a leading Moroccan developer,” said the French company. The project is part of Morocco's Green Hydrogen tender. According to the French developer, it could eventually reach a capacity of 10 GW of wind energy, 7 GW of solar energy, and 8 GW of electrolysis. The first phase of the project, estimated at an investment of 20 billion Moroccan Dirhams ($1.97 billion), is currently under development.
Soltec has inaugurated a dedicated Green Hydrogen Laboratory at its Molina de Segura facilities. “This facility becomes a hub for research and development with the goal of improving hydrogen production using methods that leave no carbon footprint,” said the Murcia-based solar energy provider. The laboratory will focus on processes ranging from water purification to hydrogen storage. Soltec will experiment with various electrolyzers and technology optimization.
Asahi Kasei, Gentari Hydrogen, a wholly owned subsidiary of Petronas clean energy arm Gentari, and JGC completed a detailed feasibility study for the production of up to 8,000 tonnes per year of green hydrogen using a 60 MW alkaline water electrolyzer system in Malaysia. “The parties also signed a MoU for a front-end engineering design (FEED) study for the said project,” said the Japanese company in a statement. According to the MoU, the parties expect the FEED study to start in January 2024 with operations to commence in 2027. JGC is constructing a clean ammonia production demonstration facility adjacent to Asahi Kasei's electrolyzer at Namie-machi, Japan.

Construction will start next year.
The companies claim in a press release published yesterday that this will be the “largest” battery energy storage project in southeast Europe and the facility will support an already existing 33 MWp solar plant. The press release did not mention who owned the existing 33 MWp solar project.
China-based energy storage company Hithium is supplying the 55 MWh project’s batteries while Bulgarian-based solar energy contractor Solarpro is providing turnkey engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services.
Hithium will supply 16 3.44 MWh capacity energy storage containers.
An unnamed subsidiary of the Vienna-based independent power producer Renalfa will own the battery energy storage systems (BESS), according to the press release. The investor decided to co-locate the battery within the existing 33 MWp capacity PV plant.
The array will have a PV tracker mounting system and a substation.
Bulgaria recorded 1,948 MW solar PV installed capacity at the end of 2022, according to recent statistics published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Last month the Bulgarian government launched its first renewables program, which is expected to allocate over 1,400 MW in power generation and 350 MW of storage.

The scientists explained that cool roofs are roofs made of highly reflective coatings with a high emissivity in the thermal infrared. “They are normally used on building roofs because they lower their temperature compared to corresponding roofs without the coating,” they said. “They have been shown to significantly reduce the energy required for cooling buildings and the heat island effect in urban environments and can offer economic benefits.”
These roofs are based on coating materials with high reflectance properties, which the researchers said increases the radiation received at the panels’ backside.
The group tested its new approach on the test bench located on a building in Barcelona. The installation comprises four PV systems, each consisting of three bifacial PV modules connected in series. The systems are a reference monofacial array, a bifacial array above a conventional floor, a bifacial array above a cool-roof-coated floor, and a bifacial array above the normal floor with other types of PV modules.
For all systems, the academics used 320 W modules from Chinese manufacturer JA Solar and 1.5 kW inverters from China-based Solax. The testing period ran from April 2020 to November 2021. During the winter months, the surrounding buildings cast shadows on the arrays.
The analysis showed that the bifacial array above a cool-roof-coated floor achieved the highest energy yield.
“When a cool roof coating is used beneath the bifacial modules, PV production can be substantially boosted (+8.6%) compared to the monofacial solution, meaning an economic benefit about 18.3 €/kWp/year,” the group said. “Moreover, the [cool roof] coating can help reduce floor temperatures in unshaded areas during summer (−3.8 °C), potentially leading to significant energy savings in cooling the building.”
The scientists said that cool roofs could be either added to the floor of existing bifacial rooftop PV systems or used for new installations. “It is an already available market product with reasonable costs that offers dual advantages: increased energy yield and reduced building cooling consumption, both yielding economic benefits,” they concluded.
The researchers presented their findings “Experimental energy performance assessment of a bifacial photovoltaic system and effect of cool roof coating,” which was recently published in the Journal of Building Engineering. The research group is formed by academics from Spain’s research center Tecnalia, Algeria's Center for the Development of Renewable Energies (CDER), the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, and the University of the Basque Country.

Unreleased Department of Forestry and Fire Protection documents obtained by the publication state a sagging SCE electricity line allegedly touched a communication line below, leading to sparks igniting nearby vegetation and starting the Fairview Fire.
SCE spokeswoman Diane Castro told pv magazine that “our hearts are with the community and the people who suffered losses in the Fairview Fire.”
“We cooperated with CALFIRE during its review of the fire and are examining their latest report,” she said.
Asked whether pv magazine could obtain the report, Castro said she does not have a copy. pv magazine asked the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection for the document but did not get a response.
SCE, a subsidiary of Californian-based Edison International, delivers power to 15 million people across the state.
The company is being sued by the US government for alleged negligence of poorly maintained power lines, which led to another wildfire that burned close to 466 square kilometers in 2020.
According to the SCE’s “2023-2035 Wildfire Mitigation Plan” published earlier this year, up to seven catastrophic wildfires were “opined” to have been caused or linked to SCE utility infrastructure since 2007. The report states the Fairview Fire is still under investigation.
SCE’s safety report contains “lessons learned” and “resulting mitigations” following the fires. This includes modifying its inspection form with new questions to “capture and remediate” issues, and starting transmission and distribution structure inspections from the ground and sky.
A catastrophic fire is defined as a fire causing at least one death, damaging over 500 structures or burning over 2,023 hectares.
SCE said in March it had reduced the probability of catastrophic wildfires associated with its equipment by up to 80%.
The company published its “Countdown to 45” report earlier this year, which calls for a range of measures to achieve the Californian government’s pledge of net zero by 2045 goal. Measures include developing an extra 90 GW of utility-scale “clean” generation, around 25 GW of utility-scale energy storage and more than 15 GW of behind-the-meter solar and storage options.

“It is a higher volume process enabled by use of solar ink materials. It combines established roll-to-roll with our core production processes, which are protected by patents and trade secrets,” Jonas Bergqvist, CTO of Epishine, told pv magazine.
The roll-to-roll production process for the company's indoor PV modules, which are used in low-power electronic devices, involves applying a less than one-micron thick solar cell stack to 50-micron foils using a slot-die coater.
The foils are pre-printed with silver busbars and identification markings. There is a proprietary lamination and curing step, followed by inline encapsulation and cutting to create 0.2 mm thick finished modules.
Rounding out the production line is quality testing. “We performance test every module and have a customized visual inspection system to be used inline,” said Bergqvist, noting that the emergence of a technical specification for low-light performance testing is going to improve the indoor PV industry’s chances for success.
The company claims a relatively low-temperature process, with efficient material usage, compared to other methods, which it backs up with an independent lifecycle assessment vetted by a third party. “We are planning to transition from silver to copper to reduce resource usage even further,” said Bergqvist.
The site in an industrial area of Linköping was chosen with future expansion in mind.

Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber material candidates for potential use in lower-cost thin-film solar cells. Kesterites include common elements such as copper, tin, zinc, and selenium. Unlike CIGS compounds, there are no supply bottlenecks expected in the future.
However, kesterite is still less efficient than CIGS in mass production. The world record for such cells is 12.6%, achieved for large-area devices by Japanese thin-film producer Solar Frontier in 2013.
The scientists said they implemented a dual-temperature zone selenization approach to realize a solid-liquid/solid-gas synergistic selenization reaction strategy.
“The introduction of a large amount of liquid selenium (Se) has facilitated a solid-liquid reaction pathway, while the high Se chemical potential has promoted the direct and rapid formation of the Kesterite phase,” they explained. “In the subsequent stage, a synergistic regulation of Se condensation and volatilization has led to improved crystal growth and enhanced removal of organic residues.”
They also explained that the strategy requires pre-depositing a sufficient amount of liquid selenium onto the precursor film to facilitate liquid-phase-assisted phase evolution and crystal growth. The following synergistic control of selenium volatilization is intended to balance the film crystallization and organics removals.
The research team built the cell with an absorber based on Kesterite films with reduced bulk and interface defects, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO), an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, and anti-reflection coating (ARC) based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2). The device has an aperture area of 0.2627 cm2 and a designated illuminated area of 1.066 cm2.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a peak power conversion efficiency of 13.6 efficiency. China's National PV Industry Metrology and Testing Center (NPVM) has certified an efficiency of 13.44% for the device.
The November edition of pv magazine is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
When tested in a large-area device of 1.09 cm2, the cell technology achieved a certified efficiency of 12.1%.
The scientists introduced the new cell design in the study “Controlling Selenization Equilibrium Enables High-Quality Kesterite Absorbers for Efficient Solar Cells,” published in nature communications.
Looking forward, they intend to develop novel strategies to control solid-gas/solid-liquid reactions in kesterite materials. “Overall, our work represents a positive endeavor to precisely control the selenization reaction process and the multiphase reaction pathways,” they concluded.

Energy giant BP’s plans to produce green hydrogen at its Kwinana Energy Hub in Western Australia have reached a major milestone with the company’s H2Kwinana project entering front-end engineering and design (FEED).
The company said the H2Kwinana project, supported by AUD 70 million ($45 million) from the Australian government as part of its Regional Hydrogen Hubs program, is to include a 100 MW electrolyzer, with the potential to expand to a total of 1.5 GW production in subsequent phases.
The project also involves the installation of hydrogen storage, compression and truck-loading facilities and upgrades to BP’s existing on-site hydrogen pipeline system.
When operational, the facility could produce more than 14,000 tons of green hydrogen per annum for industrial use and heavy transport.
Site works for H2Kwinana are already underway, with construction proper to start in 2026 and the project expected to be delivered by mid-2027.
The project is part of BP’s plans to transition the site near Fremantle, which has been serving as an import terminal since the oil refinery shut in 2021, into an energy hub to produce green hydrogen and other renewable fuels. This includes renewable diesel and aviation fuel.
Lucy Nation, BP’s vice president of hydrogen in Australia and the Asia Pacific, said the project will leverage existing infrastructure. Hydrogen produced from water and renewable power will have the potential to decarbonize the planned biorefinery where hydrogen is to be made from natural gas and biogas.
“We are repurposing existing process units, tanks, pipelines and utilities from the former refinery as the starting point for Kwinana Renewable Fuels and H2Kwinana,” Nation said. “Both of these projects will allow us to supply ourselves and our customers with products that allow them to meet their own emissions targets while also contributing to Australia’s decarbonization targets.”
BO.
The H2Kwinana project is part of a growing pipeline of green energy projects BP is pursuing in Western Australia.
Earlier this year BP announced it had secured land for a proposed 10 GW wind and solar generation project that would be used to power an export-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production facility in the state’s mid-west.
The company has also acquired a stake in the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) project planned for Western Australia’s Pilbara region.
“We are all-in in Australia, with major investment plans in WA and specifically in the Kwinana area,” BP Australia President Frédéric Baudry said. “H2K at Kwinana is BP’s strategy in action, leading from the front in decarbonisation in the region and providing energy security through diversity.”
The H2Kwinana project has attracted support from the state and federal governments with Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen announcing a AUD 70 million investment as part of its Regional Hydrogen Hubs program.
Bowen said Australia’s hydrogen industry is projected to generate $50 billion in additional gross domestic product by 2050, creating tens of thousands of jobs in regional Australia as the country transforms into a renewable energy superpower.
“Investing in an Australian hydrogen industry is investing in Australia’s future,” he said. “Kwinana has been an industrial and economic powerhouse for decades, making it an ideal location for a hydrogen hub that can support decarbonisation of heavy industry and connect our renewable resources to the world.”
The Australian government is investing more than AUD 500 million in regional hydrogen hubs, including in Gladstone, Townsville, the Hunter, Bell Bay, Pilbara and Port Bonython.

This was due to blocking high-pressure systems that kept low-pressure systems further north and reduced cloud formation, according to analysis collected by Solcast API. India saw drier conditions – something cricket fans would appreciate for the October to November Cricket World Cup.
Otherwise sunny conditions were tempered by an early October typhoon making landfall in Taiwan and eastern mainland China. A large high-pressure system hovered over Asia and concentrated over western China, which dampened normal cloud formation patterns. This caused above-long-term October average irradiance levels for almost the entire continent. Regions with increased irradiance, as seen below, include the east coast of Japan and the western Yangtze Basin in China, which received over 130% of normal irradiance for the month.

Typhoon Koinu was strengthened by warm sea surface temperatures and the weather system impacted Taiwan and eastern mainland China in early October. The Typhoon smashed through the blocking high pressure and the resultant cloud brought down the irradiance for October to 80-90% of the long-term average.
The Northern Hemisphere winter is becoming evident when looking at actual total irradiance rather than the deviation from the average. The difference in irradiance totals between the mid-latitudes and the tropics is much starker than several months ago.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-kilometer and 2-kilometer resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with a typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

Weak market sentiment and lackluster export demand continue to weigh on the module segment.
Module prices have fallen for a fourth consecutive week with CMM seeing its largest percentage drop of 5.8% in over two months. Most buyers and sellers priced mono PERC modules in the $0.120-130/wp range and TOPCon modules in the $0.130-140/wp range. Successively lower prices continue to emerge, a module seller said. “Now, we all don’t know how to predict module prices,” he said.

Module manufacturers have lowered their manufacturing output due to the oversupplied market, with one stakeholder estimating the segment’s overall operating rates are 50-60% lower than the previous 70-80%. A module seller said that his firm’s operating rate is now around 60%. “In the present stage, maintaining current operating rates is enough,” he said. Small factories “with inefficient production capacity” that can’t maintain rates will gradually exit the market, he said.
China’s export markets continue to look weak. Installation rates will slow as Europe celebrates the Christmas holidays in December, said one stakeholder. Low-priced cargoes continue to be offered in Europe, according to multiple people. People are frantically attempting to “clear their inventories,” said one module seller. Persisting with these low prices means “victory,” an employee at a tier-1 solar major said. “If you can’t carry on, you’ll go bankrupt,” he said.
Weakness was evident in other export markets too. Module imports in Brazil, the largest solar market in Latin America, could decrease at least 11.2% year-to-year, assuming total imports of up to 15.8 GW in 2023, according to Brazilian consultancy Greener. “Everyone is not doing well,” said a module manufacturer with clients in Brazil. According to multiple sources, prices in Southeast Asia below $0.130/wp for PERC are low but realistic.
Prices are expected to keep falling. One module maker is offering PERC modules at 0.99 yuan/wp this week, which is a signal that the market is on the threshold of the psychologically significant barrier of 1 yuan/wp.
The entire solar value chain will “go through a phase of inventory-clearing before the end of the year,” a module manufacturer said. Bottom prices across the value chain will come between December and China’s Spring Festival next year. After the 1 yuan/wp era arrives, “one may wonder when we will see [prices] below $0.10/wp,” a solar market veteran said.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

The system couples a hydrogen generation chain consisting of an electrolyzer and a fuel cell with a thermochemical unit. The hydrogen chain is used as a storage unit, using electrolysis to split water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen and then convert H2 back to electricity via a fuel cell. The thermochemical unit is designed to recover waste heat from the electrolyzer and fuel cell to enable deferred cooling production for air conditioning purposes.
“The RECIF installation comprises the following components: a hybrid inverter, PV panels, a Li-ion battery pack, a PEM electrolyzer for H2 production, an H2 storage tank, a PEM fuel cell for electricity production from stored H2, a controllable electrical load and a custom-made air conditioning system with a thermochemical unit for thermal energy storage and deferred cold production,” researcher Franco Ferrucci told pv magazine, noting that the components are installed in a 20-foot container.
As a thermochemical solid/gas pair, the system utilizes a barium chloride salt (BaCl2) reacting with ammonia (NH3), which in turn serves as the coolant fluid in the refrigeration circuit. “This pair has the advantage of being able to work with heating sources of relatively low temperature (55 C), making it compatible with PEM electrolyzers and fuel cells,” the researchers said.

The research group deployed the system in 2018 and ever since, concerns about the safety of the system have arisen. “The commissioning of such an installation was very challenging, mainly due to the lack of experience in the territory with this type of installation and an unclear regulatory context regarding safety systems and explosive atmospheres,” the scientists explained.
In order to address these safety issues, the group also developed a safety system that is intended to reduce explosion risks related to H2 and NH3 gases. In a small hydrogen installation, the greatest risk may materialize in the event of a hydrogen leak that cannot be detected within an improperly ventilated enclosure.
“Our installation has solar panels covering a surface of 23m2, and the protection system features 1000 V contactors that disconnect the panels when the safety system detects an accident condition, as one of the safety actions is to interrupt the production of renewable electricity,” Ferrucci said.
“In the case of a larger PV installation, it is not practical to disconnect the panels directly, as there is not a wide variety of high-voltage DC contactors on the market. In that case, the safety system would need to disconnect the inverter so that it cannot supply power to the rest of the installation. Additionally, there should be a physical distance between the PV electrical panel and the hydrogen installation,” he added.
The safety system also includes an electrical cabinet that contains a safety programmable logic controller (PLC), which can disconnect the power flow. Another tool employed is a forced ventilation system with continuous air renewal and emergency ventilation modes, along with fire extinguishers and smoke detectors.
In addition, a set of relief values is installed in the H2 storage unit, and sensors can monitor the H2 levels at the fuel cell and the electrolyzer. Also, several transmitters can interrupt the power supply of the thermochemical unit when danger is identified. All the safety tools can be controlled and monitored via a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and a safety instrumented system (SIS).
“In broad terms, the primary goal of the installation is twofold: to provide power to the electrical load and maintain a suitable level of thermal comfort inside the container in which components are installed,” said Ferucci, referring to the safety system.
The microgrid concept and the related safety system were presented in the study “Design and implementation of the safety system of a solar-driven smart micro-grid comprising hydrogen production for electricity & cooling co-generation,” published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.
“The study establishes the reliability of the gas detection system, affirming its adherence to safety integrity level SIL-2 based on risk analysis and recommendations from the specialized inspection and certification company overseeing RECIF installation validation,” Ferrucci said. “The simulations conducted demonstrate that the safety system promptly detects and stops any leaks inside the container, effectively reducing the gas concentration to negligible levels.”
