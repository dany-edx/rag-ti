And while they are already doing this, and progress has been rapid, the technology still has a host of challenges to overcome. Not least is increasing the lifetime of batteries to match expectations for vehicles, energy infrastructure, and other devices they will be powering.
Batteries with lithium-ion chemistry are affected by several degradation mechanisms that can cause them to lose capacity over time. In many cases, these involve oxygen, with battery components becoming oxidized and with reduced capacity for the desired chemical reactions that amount to energy storage. Various interface-engineering and other strategies have been employed to reduce oxidation during battery cycling but, for the most part, they have only been able to slow the inevitable.
A group of scientists led by the Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT), in China, noted oxidation reactions happen in a lot of places other than inside batteries and, given the abundance and reactivity of oxygen, such reactions are one of the most common types of chemical degradation on the planet. In many cases, organisms have naturally developed processes to limit oxidation and related degradation and aging processes. “So, we thought: ‘why not just try to replicate what nature already does, and put it inside a battery instead?'” said QIBEBT researcher Cui Guanglei.
The group developed an additive known as a photostabilizer, which they showed could ‘scavenge’ oxygen particles which would otherwise contribute to degradation. With calculations and experiments, they showed such an additive could deliver improved electrochemical performance in batteries and also worked at elevated temperatures. The research and results are described in full in the paper Bioinspired Antiaging Binder Additive Addressing the Challenge of Chemical Degradation of Electrolyte at Cathode/Electrolyte Interphase, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
“This bioinspired strategy to scavenge reactive oxygen and free radicals heralds a new paradigm for manipulating the cathode/electrolyte interphase chemistry of various rechargeable batteries involving layered transition metal oxides-based cathodes,” said Cui.
The group says it now plans to explore commercialization of its approach in high-voltage li-ion batteries based on layered oxide cathodes, to produce “the next generation of energy storage devices beyond traditional lithium-ion technology.”

According to the Taipei Times, the company is expanding TOPCon cell output to meet growing demand for high-efficiency solar modules.
“As photovoltaic systems integrator companies become more educated about the benefits of TOPCon solar cells, we are seeing strong demand,” President Fred Yeh reportedly said. “Orders are backed up into the second quarter of 2022.”
Motech Industries began developing a pilot TOPCon cell production line with the support of Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in 2018. In October 2019, it said that its TOPCon cell had reached a power conversion efficiency of 23.2%.
In its home market, the company offers a TOPCon module with a maximum power output of 360 W and an efficiency of 21.1%. The XN60CA-B product is based on 120 half-cut n-type monocrystalline TOPCon cells and is sold in five versions with a nominal power ranging from 340 to 360 W. Its open-circuit voltage is between 40.9 V and 42.1 V and the short-circuit current between 10.49 A and 10.57A. The panel can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V.
The module measures 1,702 mm × 1,002 mm × 40 mm and weighs in at 20.1 kg. It comes with a 25-year performance guarantee and a 12-year product warranty. According to the manufacturer, its power output can still reach 89.4% of its original performance after 25 years. Its power temperature coefficient is -0.32% per degree Celsius.
Motech Industries has undergone a comprehensive restructuring process in recent years, due to  the Taiwanese cell and module industry crisis, which began in 2018, when the Chinese module industry was able to offer very cheap prices due to overcapacity. But now that module prices are skyrocketing and supply bottlenecks are reported in all markets, the tide seems to have turned for Taiwan's solar manufacturers.

The developer will own a majority stake in the planned 20 MW solar project which will sell electricity to state-owned utility the Lesotho Electricity Company under a 25-year PPA signed off by the government of the Southern African nation.
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
A press release issued on behalf of Scatec on Thursday did not indicate how much the electric company will pay for the clean power, where the project will be based or when it is expected to be operational, but did state Scatec expects financial closure on the facility early next year. pv magazine in 2017 reported a subsidiary of clean energy developer OnePower Lesotho had been awarded a $696,000 grant from an African Development Bank fund to draw up a business case for a 20 MW solar project in the Mafeteng district of western Lesotho but it is not clear whether this is the plant being developed by Scatec.
The solar farm will be part-financed by the U.K. government-backed Renewable Energy Performance Platform, which co-finances clean power projects in sub-Saharan Africa alongside private sector partners, has £148 million (€174 million) of public money, and is managed by London-based professional services company Camco Clean Energy.
The other investors who will hold a stake in the solar plant are Norwegian state-owned development finance body Norfund; the OnePower Lesotho clean power start-up based in the capital of Maseru, and which was spun out of Massachussetts-based STG International; U.S.-based developer Izuba Energy; and the Lesotho Pension Fund.
Quoted in the press statement, Jan Fourie, Scatec general manager for sub-Sahara Africa, said: “We are proud to be the first IPP [independent power producer] to develop a solar project in Lesotho, an important step for Scatec in the country. The Southern African region is a key market for Scatec, and a region with great potential for the development of affordable clean energy. Scatec is the leading solar IPP in the region, and we look forward to expanding our footprint and developing more renewable energy in the years to come.”
This copy was amended on 01/12/21 after the company responsible for the press release quoted confirmed Izuba Energy is an American developer, rather than the French energy transition software company Izuba énergies.

Spanish mounting system manufacturer Alusín Solar has launched its Picos 4.0 system for rooftop PV systems built with large-size solar panels.
The mounting structure was conceived, in particular, for those flat-deck-type roofs with PVC or asphalt covers that cannot be drilled.
“Installing a panel horizontally at 10 degrees, with a 60-cell panel with [a] length of 1.65m was not a problem,” Javier Font, general director of Alusín Solar, told pv magazine. “But now we have moved to 2m modules and in rooftop installations, when the modules grow, the problems grow.”
According to him, large photovoltaic modules are more subject to vibration problems and the possibility of being blown away by strong winds.
“Our system is a ballasted structure without drilling and uses a deflector plate that prevents the wind from entering from the back,” he further explained. “We have also incorporated a slot that holds the panel in six different points, which means two extra fixing points are added, to prevent any minimal movement of the module.”
According to the manufacturer, the Picos 4.0 system is currently the only one on the market that provides six fixing points for a solar panel in ballast-secured structures.

BloombergNEF solar analyst Yali Jiang moderated the session and opened the discussion by noting the surge in module prices this year.
Gao made it clear that the surge in prices caught the industry by surprise and said “We didn’t expect it to happen that module prices would exceed two yuan per Watt ($0.314).” He pointed to a strange paradox impacting the solar PV industry, adding: “Now we are in a paradox: The scale [of production] is bigger and bigger but the price from … upstream increases rapidly. This means a bigger market but not all enterprises benefit. Only [a] few benefit. That is abnormal.” He pointed to polysilicon producers benefiting from 80% gross margins and said that this would quickly lead to a situation of over-supply. He told the audience of a conversation he had had with a leader of a polysilicon materials company who predicted 500 GW of polysilicon production capacity by the end of 2023. Gao summed up the situation as follows: “With the price surge, there will be a price slump.”
Join our webinar tomorrow which will consider how and why TOPCon technology is leading the n-type solar race to the mainstream. The event, held in conjunction with our partner Jolywood, will start at 11 a.m. (CET) and you can register here.
Lower prices from polysilicon producers should ease pressure on module prices, much to the relief of downstream players in the industry, whether in China or overseas markets. Shen, of the wafer manufacturer Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor, expects a 15-20% reduction from current price levels in the second half of next year. Trina’s Gao is more optimistic, and regards it as “very likely” that price declines will happen already in the first half of next year.

Qu cautions that the era of steady price declines for solar modules has come to an end, saying: “The price rebound of polysilicon and component materials marks the beginning of a new era. And this era means that going green and carbon neutrality have a cost. There will be an end to the price drop for solar.” The solar PV industry cannot be expected to keep lowering its costs as the world seeks to decarbonize and wean itself off fossil fuels. Other industries have to make their contribution as well.
BloombergNEF’s Jiang then steered the conversation to wafer, cell and module technologies and the favorite, at least for the short and medium-term, is TOPCon technology, with both Chen and Gao predicting a massive ramp-up of TOPCon production lines in coming years. Chen put it as follows: “We feel that TOPCon has huge potential.” Shen and Qu were more guarded and highlighted a range of cell and module technologies that promise to further reduce costs and boost efficiencies. Qu even had a surprise up his sleeve when he announced that Canadian Solar would be bringing a 700 Watt module onto the market, based on n-type technology the Sino-Canadian manufacturer has developed. Further details will be revealed in an upcoming official announcement.
The session ended with bullish forecasts on China’s PV market size in 2022 and efforts by Chinese module manufacturers to further reduce the energy payback times of their products. Jinko’s Chen sees China installing 40-45 GW of solar PV this year and then doubling that build in 2022, to 90-100 GW. In terms of energy payback times, Gao offered the scenario of a PV project in northern China where Trina modules produced enough energy in six months to cover the energy used in the upstream manufacturing process. Qu sees “three months or less” by 2028, at least for Canadian Solar, which has pledged to be carbon neutral by that year. High-powered modules like Canadian’s forthcoming 700 MW high-performer should help in this process since, fundamentally, the higher the power rating, the shorter the time period needed to recoup the energy invested in the supply chain to produce the module.

In October, Brazil imported 1,049 MW of photovoltaic modules, reaching a total of 7.5 GW for imported panels in the first ten months of 2021, according to a recent report by Brazilian consultancy Greener. The month represented a recovery in the pace of imports, which have been below 700 MW since June.
By way of comparison, solar module imports in Brazil had totaled 4.7 GW in the first ten months of 2020.
Module prices have increased, so far this year, by more than 18%, and reached between $0.21/Wp and $0.26/Wp. The biggest growth was observed in the importation of monocrystalline models, which suffered an increase of 26% in free-on-board (FOB) prices.
Bifacial modules represented 61% of the monthly volumes, and high-power modules (above 500 Wp) accounted for 69.7% of the total, with 731 MW. Greener forecasts a strong increase in module prices, possibly extending into 2022.
In October 2021, Brazil also imported 715 MW of inverters, reaching a total of 7.6 GW for the first ten months of the year, a volume that is 98% higher than in the same month of 2020. In the first ten months of last year, a total of 4.89 GW of inverters was imported.
In October, small inverters (up to 10 kW) represented 42.6% of the total imported volume of string technology devices. Medium-sized inverters represented 31.6%, and large-sized 25.7%.

The pilot plant will be tested until mid-2022 and its design could be used to build an offshore PV facility with an installed capacity of up to 5 MW in the North Sea, connected to existing offshore wind farms.
The floating system features flexible, ultra-thin copper indium gallium di-selenide (CIGS) solar panels by turnkey equipment supplier Midsummer. The Swedish manufacturer has provided its Bold-144 (Magnum) products for the project. Each 485 W Magnum panel consists of 144 solar cells.
Installed on the float, the photovoltaic modules are partially connected in series and in parallel. They are then connected to a string inverter on land, where TNO has installed equipment to collect information on the performance of the array, including irradiation, temperature and wind speed data.
“Photovoltaics at sea does not really exist yet,” said TNO researcher Wim Soppe.”It is technically very difficult to install large floating systems with solar panels in the sea and keep them operational for decades.”
He said the design for the pilot system is viable, as it requires much less material and has lower costs compared to floating arrays built with crystalline silicon panels.
The standard version of the Bold model was originally intended for use with roofing felt and a membrane as a base and for both flat and sloping roofs. It is only 2 mm thin and weighs in at 3kg/m2. The cells are encapsulated by several waterproofing film layers. 
The TNO is also studying the impact of wind and waves on the performance of floating solar systems at a special testing facility. Recently, scientists from the Copernicus Institute at Utrecht University claimed that offshore PV plants could be more productive than ground-mounted arrays after running a simulation comparing a North Sea project to a conventional system at the Utrecht Photovoltaic Outdoor Test field.
According to a recent report from DNV GL, the North Sea could host around 100 MW of floating solar capacity by 2030, and 500 MW by 2035. The levelized cost of electricity for offshore PV systems is currently estimated at around €354/MWh, but in the future it should be close to that of ground-mounted solar parks.
The research consortium includes Bluewater Energy Services, Genap, and the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (Marin).

While organic PV presents opportunities for low cost and low carbon footprint manufacturing, balancing efficiency with long term stability is still a challenge, and the best performing cells in terms of efficiency most often rely on solvents that are highly toxic and difficult to work with in manufacturing.
A collaboration between scientists at Linköping University in Sweden and China’s Soochow University looked to address these issues, working on an organic solar cell made from a material known as Y6. For solution processing of this cell material, they chose paraxylene, which they say has no toxic ingredients and a higher boiling point making it easier to use in manufacturing.
With this solvent, the group was able to manufacture laboratory-sized solar cells with an efficiency better than 17%, as well as a 36cm² device that reached 14% efficiency. The cells are described in the paper A guest-assisted molecular-organization approach for >17% efficiency organic solar cells using environmentally friendly solvents, published in Nature Energy.
“This is a major step towards large-scale industrial manufacture of efficient and stable organic solar cells, say Linköping University researchers Feng Gao and Rui Zhang. “Our results now open for the manufacture of organic solar cells at larger scales for outdoor use.”
Key to these achievements, the researchers say, was the addition of a guest molecule ‘BTO’, which served to keep the Y6 molecules closely packed and ordered within the solvents. Keeping the structure uniform in this way benefits the cell efficiency, improves long-term stability and allows for the fabrication of larger area devices.
As well as paving the way for industrial development of organic solar cells, the group says its approach could be applied to other materials. “Our strategy leads to clear design rules for optimising the interaction between organic donors and acceptors in multicomponent blends, meeting the critical requirements for future development of organic photovoltaic technology,” said Professor Yaowen Li, Soochow University.

The battery is now available in three different versions with capacities of 6.5 kWh, 13.0 kWh, and 19.5 kWh. The storage capacity can be expanded with an additional battery module, depending on a project's requirements. The storage capacity can also be increased by connecting up to five Varta energy storage systems with the Varta “Link” or the Varta “pulse neo” batteries.
The product is guaranteed for 10 years or 4,000 cycles. According to Varta, no additional hardware is required for communication with various PV inverters. The system is purportedly suitable for retrofits and new installations.

US-based energy storage specialist Powin announced the release of Centipede, a modular battery energy storage system. The system consists of pre-integrated modular units containing batteries, thermal management equipment, and other safety features.
The company said Centipede requires half the time to procure and deploy and uses 30% less space onsite, while reducing lifecycle costs, when compared to contemporary modular storage systems. The Stack750E battery will be the first unit integrated for the Centipede system, and is designed for 2-hour to 4-hour durations. The design offers scalability and supports up to 200 MWh storage per acre.
The third-generation battery module was updated with new thermal controls, a change that Powin said will create an anticipated 80% reduction in service times. The modular units allow for granular control and monitoring of the system, increasing visibility into safety
Mass production of Centipede is expected by late Q1 2022, with first deliveries scheduled a year later. Powin said it has secured more than 2 GWh of contracts for the battery system from multinational independent power producers and utilities.
Powin president Geoff Brown said the platform will aid in increased renewables penetration, non-wires alternatives, and power decentralization. “With Centipede we have meticulously reinvented our entire storage ecosystem, including our supply chain, battery hardware, and balance of system design to create [the design],” he said.
During Centipede’s development, Powin worked with Energy Safety Response Group (ESRG), an independent testing firm, to validate the efficacy of the lithium-ion battery safety systems. The ESRG study found that in instances of failure and fire, fire does not propagate from one unit to the next, and that explosion risk to neighboring units is effectively mitigated. The system exceeded UL standards, said the company.
