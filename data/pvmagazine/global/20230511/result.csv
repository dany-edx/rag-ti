https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/11/building-nature-friendly-solar-parks/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,EASTERN EUROPE,EUROPE,HUNGARY",EDGAR MEZA,"MAY 11, 2023",Building nature-friendly solar parks,"In an effort to share its know-how on the construction of more eco-friendly solar farms, Hungarian solar company SolServices collaborated with national parks, environmental protection organizations, energy companies and even beekeepers to produce a comprehensive white paper.
The “Professional Guide for the Development of Next-Generation Solar Parks” offers a completely new, practice-based methodology detailing how solar farms can be operated in an ecologically conscious and nature-friendly manner and that can be recommended to investors.
Based on the company’s earlier biomonitor surveys but expanded in scope, the white paper aims to ensure that solar parks built on large stretches of land fit into the ecological balance of the area, taking into account as much as possible its ecological, biological and natural features.
Based on Hungary’s geographical and solar radiation characteristics, solar energy has a very high potential for electricity generation in the country. Installed PV capacity reached 1,144 MW at the end of 2019, of which around 38% was made up of household-sized units of less than 50 kW. The remaining capacity is spread among small plants with capacities below 0.5 MW and a few plants of a few megawatts.
Hungary’s new National Energy Strategy aims to expand solar capacity to 6,000 MW by 2030, and which could reach 12,000 MW by 2040. The country, however, requires grid upgrades to meet the challenges of a decentralized and highly weather-dependent electricity generation structure. It also requires the expansion of larg-scale facilities.
Achieving the country’s ambitious goals can only be achieved “in an environmentally and nature-friendly manner, taking into account the ecological requirements and characteristics of the given area as much as possible,” SolServices states in the report.
“Agri-environmental research in recent years has shown that, with appropriate land use and the strengthening of plant communities, wildlife populations can be significantly increased in agricultural areas,” it adds, noting that solar parks can effectively support wildlife and increase biodiversity.
“A particularly positive factor is that, with proper design and minimal management and intervention, a solar park can provide an almost undisturbed habitat for both flora and fauna for some 30 years after construction. A very small part of the solar farm area, less than 5%, is physically covered by various infrastructure (roads, inverters, support poles for panels), and even with the parts of the area covered by panels, this proportion covers only about 50% of the total area. The area not covered and partially shaded by the panels, i.e. roughly 95% of the solar park area, can be a diverse habitat for plants and animals.”
The paper details a number of methods that can be used to create suitable habitats to increase biodiversity and create a more natural vegetation cover that can benefit a wide variety of wildlife, from insects and amphibians to birds, bats, rodents and big game.
Pollinating insects, for example, benefit from a patchwork of plants that flower at different times of the year. “In addition, from herbaceous plants, the planting of red clover, which has been shown to increase the presence of bumblebees and butterflies, is of particular importance,” the paper notes. Clematis and honeysuckle grown on fences can also benefit pollinator species.
Amphibian-friendly solar parks can be considered if site conditions are suitable for permanent or temporary surface water and wetland habitats in the project area. “Reptiles prefer dense, bushy, lush undergrowth, so it is advisable to leave a minimum strip of 2 m of untidy, untrimmed vegetation along wetland areas (e.g. drainage ditches). In addition to offering easier and safer movement for animals, they also provide a home for many species of molluscs, worms and insects, and the latter provide a suitable food source for amphibians.”
For rodent and small game-friendly parks, sufficiently quiet and undisturbed habitats are necessary. Mosaic mowing and the creation of undisturbed green corridors to provide free movement and shelter for small animals are important when managing green areas, the paper advises. Such parks should include shrubs and hedges — taking into account the requirements of emergency management guidelines — as well as haystacks from locally mown hay, which can be used as daytime and winter shelter. Passages or tubes, both on the surface and underground, can facilitate the introduction of ground squirrels.
PV farms also offer different uses for a variety of different bird species. Some may use them as nesting and breeding places, while others may use them as feeding or resting areas. “We can help various species to disperse and breed in the project area by installing different types of dens or artificial nests, or by planting shrubs and trees, as long as this is compatible with the safety requirements of the solar farm and does not interfere with energy production,” the company explains.
Likewise, solar parks can be potential habitats for certain bat species. In Hungary, there are some 30 bat species found in a wide range of biotopes, from urban environments to natural habitats and abandoned mines. Insect-rich solar parks can be suitable feeding sites for bats.
Big game can be expected in arable land and grassland close to forest edges. The presence of big game around in solar parks, however, should generally be minimized to protect both the animals and equipment.
“Therefore, in the case of a big-game-friendly park, we are talking about solar parks that help big game to safely escape from the project area. To this end, it is recommended to install jump exits for big game. In addition, we can also install wildlife guide structures within the solar park to help stray animals find their way out as quickly as possible. These tools are especially useful in the first two years after installation, but can also be a valuable feature of the solar park after that.”

Researchers identified the region of Alentejo in south-central and southern Portugal as the area with the greatest potential as it combines water surfaces and solar resources.
The University of Évora said in a statement that even applying an 85% reduction to the total surface of water available at the national level, “the potential of floating photovoltaic solar energy systems can reach at least an estimated national capacity of 10.8 GW.”
“The analysis results from a mapping of the potential areas for floating photovoltaic solar systems applied in the national territory, establishing a relationship between the availability of solar radiation and the geographical distribution of the bodies of water in the different regions of the country,” said  Luís Fialho, a researcher at the University of Évora's Renewable Energies Chair.

They said that PV systems could become cheaper by up to 50% by 2035.
Based on its analysis of data on electricity pricing in the United Kingdom from 2010-21, the group said that large-scale PV systems were already less expensive than wholesale electricity in 2021. Prices stood at GBP 51/MWh, while the cost for smaller systems was estimated at GBP 149/MWh.
The researchers projected the LCOE for various PV system sizes until 2035, considering different variables. The study's results suggest that in the most optimistic scenario, the LCOE for large-scale photovoltaic systems in the United Kingdom could reach as low as GBP 17/MWh.
The group's projections for small solar system sizes (below 3.99 kW) suggest that the cost of generating electricity from small-scale photovoltaics will drop lower than the price of wholesale electricity around 2027. The researchers said that at this level, “it can be expected that many households and businesses would want to install even small-scale solar PV panels to reduce their electricity costs and promote environmental consciousness.”
The United Kingdom had a capacity of 13.5 GW in 2020, ranking 10th globally and third in Europe. The researchers forecast that the capacity will increase to around 21 GW in 2025 and approximately 29 GW in 2030. Considering the projected efficiency improvements and cost reductions, the study suggests that the UK government should support developers and investors, particularly in the early stages, by facilitating land purchases for PV farms and offering preferential loans with low interest rates to expedite PV system development.
More support would speed up adoption of the technology, leading the country to transition more quickly to a carbon-free future, said the researchers. They presented their findings in “Levelized cost estimates of solar photovoltaic electricity in the United Kingdom until 2035,” which was recently published in Patterns.

The ministry said on Tuesday that homeowners can now apply for financing of solar water heating systems, as well as rooftop PV systems of up to 10 kWp, which may be paired with battery energy storage systems. Applications will be accepted until Nov. 10.
Following the final approval from the European Commission, a total of BGN 140 million will be distributed from Bulgaria’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan, with the remaining sum coming from additional state and private sector funding. As much as BGN 80 million will be distributed in the first funding round.
Under the long-awaited financing scheme, the cost of solar water heating systems can be financed in full but up to a maximum of BGN 1,961. The PV systems no larger than 10 kWp will be financed up to 70% with the maximum sum of BGN 15,000. In order to receive funding, households must be the applicant‘s permanent place of residence and use an inefficient heating source, such as wood or coal-burning stoves, boilers, or a fireplaces.
According to SolarPower Europe (SPE), Bulgaria reached 1.5 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of 2022.
“Bulgaria’s solar target remains low as PV will only account for 2.6% of electricity in 2040,” SPE said in its 2022-26 EU solar market outlook. “Yet Bulgaria benefits from high irradiation rates, notably in the south of the country, and has an important solar potential, which is not reflected in the current target.”
In 2020, SPE forecast Bulgaria to hit 3.8 GW by 2024, thereby exceeding its 2030 target. The momentum was expected to be mainly supported by unsubsidized large-scale solar projects built under power purchase agreements (PPA).
However, in October 2022, Bulgaria‘s electricity system operator revealed that it had accepted applications to build new renewable energy projects with an aggregate installed capacity of more than 24 GW – double the country's installed generating capacity. It said the new projects require a significant expansion of the grid and that it was talking to potential investors about the necessary actions.
Bulgaria's power generation fleet is dominated by lignite and hard coal-fired power stations, which account for 4.5 GW. Non-hydropower renewables make up around 2.3 GW, hydro 3.2 GW, nuclear 2 GW, and natural gas 600 MW.

Solar supply chains have experienced unprecedented volatility, resulting in broken contracts, project delays, and frayed relationships between module suppliers and buyers. Upstream raw material vendors and global shippers have pressured module suppliers, and buyers have borne the brunt of unwanted consequences just to secure products.
While supply chains have recently shown signs of stability, suppliers are in no hurry to return to more neutral contracts. As such, it’s incumbent upon buyers to take proactive measures.
Suppliers may keep all options open until contract signing date, repeatedly revising terms. This can come as a surprise, particularly to buyers with limited recent procurement experience. The reasons vary from delays caused by over-utilized supplier staff to tactical and strategic considerations. Revisions can range from pricing to small details. Some suppliers accept terms and change them after initial payments. To mitigate such risks, buyers should diversify procurement efforts.
Cash-constrained suppliers may want payment in regular installments rather than the traditional down-payment and balance upon delivery. In the US, they might demand full payment before customs clearance, due to regulatory risks.
Whenever shipping terms allow, however, it’s advisable to avoid paying significant amounts before production or shipment. Buyers should insist on scheduling the last payment for each batch after delivery, as their leverage shrinks considerably once final payment is made.
Contracts usually stipulate products be delivered new and undamaged. This can be verified under the delivered duty paid (DDP) and delivered at place (DAP) Incoterms – terminology used to facilitate international trade – with visual evidence during unloading. However, suppliers may insist on payment even if products arrive damaged or even if the wrong product is shipped.
Buyers should insist on terms that ensure verification that deliveries meet agreed-upon specifications and are suitable for use, before final payment.
Suppliers have begun to require financial guarantees for delivered but temporarily unpaid products. However, it is not as widespread for suppliers to provide financial guarantees to buyers whose project success depends on timely delivery. Even if a supplier offers a down-payment guarantee, it may apply to a limited number of cases and exclude liquidated damages for delivery delay.
Although suppliers may disagree with providing widely applicable financial guarantees, buyers should carefully scrutinize guarantees they receive, including financial and parent company guarantees.
In ever-evolving PV supply chains, buyers may be unconcerned about the production location of their product until the supplier informs them about a delay caused by an original equipment manufacturer. They may not realize their order is the first to be produced at a newly built factory experiencing high defect rates.
It is crucial for buyers and sellers to align their interests to ensure the product is delivered without defects and meets all specifications at the first attempt.
Contracts should identify factories and both parties should verify their suitability, including certification, quality, and licenses, if applicable, before production begins, in order to minimize issues and delays. A detailed technical and quality exhibit should include ways to objectively evaluate quality controls, preparedness of production facilities, and product quality.
The next issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
Serial defect warranties are now common in larger contracts. The premise is simple: if a certain percentage of modules exhibit the same type of defect from a common underlying cause, all affected modules should be replaced or repaired, regardless of whether the defect has yet occurred. However, some suppliers suggest alternative remedies that do not consider the entire population. They may propose to fix only the defective modules and “monitor” the rest, undermining the fundamental concept of a serial defect warranty.
Buyers should ensure the serial defect clause allows for dependably solving the underlying root cause, regardless of whether a defect has yet manifested, and may require that the remedy include reimbursement for labor costs during replacement.
In recent years, many contracts have included price indexing to address the volatile and generally increasing costs of polysilicon (or wafers or cells) and shipping. However, with cost declines now in progress or on the horizon, suppliers who previously insisted on such clauses have now largely abandoned this practice.
Buyers may now consider proposing price indexing clauses, which could be particularly beneficial for contracts with longer lead times. Suppliers are unlikely to accept indexation mechanisms without a floor, though, as they may pose significant risks.
Both suppliers and buyers must clearly understand – and have evidence of – the composition of the silica-based supply chain. Buyers should consider what remedies are necessary if an audit finds a breach or a shipment is unable to enter a project country. As the situation is continually evolving, both parties should agree on procedures in case of enforcement changes or third-party allegations.
There are two sides to every contract negotiation. Contracts may share certain standard practices but tweaking the finer details is key to minimizing your risks. Whether a buyer or seller, taking time to understand the other side’s priorities can help secure a deal that works for everyone.

The company's researchers built the cell with an anti-reflection intermediate layer relying on what they call “gentle textured structures” that were applied on the front side of the bottom. This reportedly enables a significant improvement in the typical light confinement effects in perovskite-silicon tandem devices.
“Light management technology is mandatory to fully utilize the wide range of the solar spectrum in a solar cell, especially for a 2T tandem structure, since its top and bottom cells are electrically connected in series and required to satisfy the constraints of current matching whereby the respective currents at the operating point are aligned to some extent,” they said. “Because of the large difference in the refractive indices between perovskite and crystalline silicon (c-Si) materials, the optimized intermediate layer as shown acts as an anti-reflection coating to suppress the reflection loss of the infrared light that is utilized in the bottom cell.”
The tandem device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 29.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.929 V, a short-circuit current density of 19.5 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 77.55%. The result, which was confirmed by Fraunhofer ISE Callab, improves on the 28.3% efficiency Kaneka had previously achieved for a device with the same architecture, withe the main differences being the passivation layer and wafer thickness.
“This is the highest certified power conversion efficiency of 2T perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells using CZ wafer to our knowledge,” the company said, noting that they are currently considering moving to a four-terminal (T4) configuration for the further development of the device.
The company presented the new cell in “High efficiency perovskite/heterojunction crystalline silicon tandem solar cells: towards industrial-sized cell and module,” which was recently published in the Japanese Journal of Applied Physics.
Kanela has developed in the past what is still the second most efficient solar cell based on crystalline silicon – a 26.63%-efficient crystalline silicon solar cell featuring heterojunction and back-contact technology.
*The headline of the article was updated to reflect that the cell is a T2 device and not a T4 cell, as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/11/enerparc-coo-signals-10-20-potential-increase-in-european-pv-module-prices/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,WORLD",MICHAEL FUHS,"MAY 11, 2023",Enerparc COO signals 10-20% potential increase in European PV module prices,"pv magazine: Enerparc is an engineering, procurement and construction contractor and an independent power producer. Politicians and potential manufacturers are currently ramping up efforts to restore European PV production, covering the entire manufacturing process from silicon to wafers, ingots, cells, and modules. Does this interest potential module buyers?
Stefan Müller: Absolutely yes. We also welcome the topic. This is also known in the residential sector. There are many arguments and also marketing campaigns for buying local products. It works very well there, because this purchase is also an emotional decision. We are now seeing more and more that classic corporate PPAs are being signed with larger corporations, for which energy is only part of the whole. For them it's more important to have a good story. And a good story means that they not only reduce their CO2 footprint, but also when the products come from Europe and Germany.
Has something changed in recent years?
Yes, but things are a bit different for energy suppliers. They would perhaps pay a cent more per module, and that would ultimately make the kilowatt-hour of electricity 0.3 cents more expensive. But that is not the only benchmark. I think there is a willingness to pay higher prices out there. Especially for corporate buyers with a strong brand, whose products only partially have something to do with energy.
First we have to look at the market. On the one hand there are power purchase agreements, on the other hand, there are tenders. The latter is obviously about the cheapest price. Are tenders still relevant to you?
Of course we still do that. These are a good basis for getting good basic financing for medium-sized systems. We continue to be active in the market where we market our electricity directly on the stock exchange. But we are now just as strong with real corporate players who not only want energy purchase agreements, but also want to do the developments together with us. A good example is our collaboration with Ikea in Australia. A number of corporations want to do a one-stop shop, the development, support during construction, support with product selection and quality assurance and then hand over the operation to us.
The corporations then hold the plants?
That is different. For example, Ikea holds plants. But we treat the facilities as if they were ours and look after them as such. On the other hand, we also have classic energy consumers or listed companies. These are companies that are, so to speak, trapped in their tendering model. These are, for example, large automotive groups that always have to make the classic tender if they want to own assets. This is difficult to implement in this dynamic world of renewables. If we then develop projects together, we own the system, but make an energy purchase agreement in advance. Sometimes with a cable over the fence, sometimes as a virtual PPA where you sell the quantities produced.
Why does it get too complicated when corporations advertise projects?
It's because of their processes. There are very clear specifications such as RFI, RFQ, i.e. information and offer queries, and at the end the negotiations have to take place. If it says “binding period for nine months”, then that's no longer feasible for us in the industry. The risk cannot be represented in this way.
Because the prices in solar change quickly?
Yes. And of course, as a public company, an automobile company is bound to always take the cheapest price. We know that cheap is not always the best quality. And project development tends to take longer, and a price guarantee for nine to twelve months is a risk that costs additional money.
That means there are buyers who look very closely at the costs. So does it become difficult to use European modules when they are 5% to 20% more expensive?
Exactly. But if, for example, you go into energy trading with the big companies, i.e. if we plan a plant, keep it and sign a PPA contract, there is a different dynamic. Corporate energy traders or buyers know that the market is very dynamic. They are then also open to concluding a short PPA or a PPA over 10 or 15 years. The negotiations are interesting.
But they probably also lack the emotional component to pay more for electricity from European modules.
On the other hand, these companies have another component. The location, for example, plays a major role for them. We recently built a solar system with Volkswagen in Zwickau at their plant and are now building a second one. Their principle is very clear: please close to the factory, because they want to make the solar fields visible to everyone who picks up their e-vehicle there. So there is an emotional component as well.
Would such players spend more on European modules?
Let me put it this way: The talks are there and the interest is there.
Does that mean there is interest?
Yes absolutely. And that goes beyond this one cent per watt, which is what is now being traded in our industry.
What is the extra price you can imagine?
My feeling tells me that it can be up to 10% or 20% more.
Nice for European manufacturers. But you don't build up an industry if you set a goal of 10% to 20% of additional costs from the outset.
That's correct. That shouldn't even be the goal. I think the goal must be that we get very high quality with a low CO2 footprint, with high added value, an “always-availability-guarantee” and with a long product guarantee overall. Germany is certainly the pioneer here. And that's where customers are already looking, and not just in the residential sector.
What other trends do you currently see in the market?
We have just connected our large photovoltaic power plant with storage. An incredible amount is happening there. Separate storage systems are now also being offered that are not planned in combination with wind and solar. Why not? Building permit is easier and grid connection is easier. I believe that an interesting market is developing there. The big question is who is the driver, investors or network operators?
In the past it was a regulatory problem because the network operator was not allowed to serve all business models.
He could write it out, or he can even release network points if he were to act transparently. He doesn't always.
Standalone storage already existed in connection with the primary control reserve. 
And he was always under incredible pressure. There was a huge cannibalization. But when I see the young startups that are active in all business models, it can be exciting. I also find the topic of making energy consumers more flexible very exciting. An unbelievable number of new start-ups are bustling about there. Whether that's vehicle-to-grid, whether that's the bundling of energy purchase agreements. The latter is important because the smaller companies also want to decarbonize and need cheap electricity that cannot conclude a PPA on their own.
Industry needs cheap electricity. It used to be possible to generate solar power for 4 cents per kilowatt-hour. With the high interest rates, these times are over for now, right?
I don't want to say that it's completely over now. But we realize that we really did live in a very good time with low interest rates that were so low that you can no longer even imagine it. The high interest rates really add to the costs. The cost of capital is crucial.
Where are the electricity production costs at the moment?
It also depends on the size. The last Renewable Energy Act tenders averaged around 7 cents. That reflects the situation.
When can the costs go down again?
When interest rates go down or when there are other business models. I believe that if you model for 30 or 35 years, which classic corporate buyers also do, then the values can change again.
That in turn depends on the risk you want to take and whether you can build your financing on that.
Exactly. You don't get financing for 30 years with guaranteed interest. At most 10, maybe 15 years. That's actually the difficulty. But I think other business models will also develop there. We are also talking to very large players who basically do everything with their own capital. They also have a different approach. Some time ago we also sold our America business with the Lego family. They have completely redeemed all loans for the time being. They do it all with equity.
They have money left over and don't even know what to do with it?
Exactly. money is in the market. They also want to generate a return, that's clear. But they can model it a little differently.

The ABC structure, which eliminates metal grid lines that block sunlight, can maximize the use of incidental light and reduce optical loss when combined with the use of pyramid structures and anti-reflection layers on the front and back surfaces.
While Aiko, which was founded in 2009, initially became well-known as a bifacial PERC cell manufacturer, the company turned its attention to n-type ABC in 2021 and began production and shipment of solar modules based on the technology in 2022. Aiko’s ABC Black Hole Series recently received the 2023 Red Dot Award for Product Design.
While the theoretical efficiency limit of crystalline silicon cells is 29.4%, the academic community generally believes the technical limit to be about 27.5%. Despite this, the maximum efficiency recorded in laboratories is presently 26.8%, indicating that the technology is nearing its practical efficiency ceiling. Aiko’s 610 W ABC module has achieved 23.6% conversion efficiency, which is one of the highest efficiencies in the industry, and the company says mass production of modules with 24% efficiency can be achieved in the next 12 months.
Also on the technological front, recent field tests showed an average performance gain of 15.1% for Aiko’s ABC module compared with PERC, and the company is making progress on a silver-free metal coating that will reduce module costs and alleviate supply chain issues.
Although the manufacturer has production sites in China, it established the Solarlab Aiko Europe research institute in August 2020 in Freiburg, Germany, and has secured a spot as a major player on the continent. Aiko has several European partners, including Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC) in Belgium, CSEM in Switzerland, TNO in The Netherlands, and Burgenland Energie in Austria, as well as Forschungszentrum Jülich, Institute for Photovoltaics (IPV), and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Germany. Solarlab’s Chief Scientist, Dr. Frank Feldmann, said that the primary purpose of the institute “is to combine China’s mass production competence with European R&D expertise,” with the goal of developing “the most commercially valuable mass production technology.”
Aiko has also built a 10,000 m2 European logistics center in the Netherlands, which enables the manufacturer to complete deliveries within Europe between 1-6 business days, depending on the recipient’s location. According to data collected by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Aiko ranked first in global PV cell shipment in 2021, with over 31.2 GW shipped. The company currently has a production capacity of 42.5 GW and is poised to continue its global growth.

In the case of PV hybrid systems, solar energy is combined with one or more other energy sources, such as diesel generators, batteries, or wind turbines. The main objectives of PV hybrid systems are to increase the reliability and efficiency of electricity generation, reduce energy costs and minimize the environmental impact of energy production.
To assess whether PV hybrid systems are achieving these objectives, system data must be monitored and analysed. The data sets are typically big and complex but can be analysed within a short period of time with the help of suitable visualisation tools. A report by IEA-PVPS Task 18 defines an easy-to-use, standardized data visualisation for PV hybrid systems.
The method permits a fast review of the performance of the systems in order to gauge success or shortfalls of the optimisation regime or to compare the performance of various systems in a fleet. This standardization and the possibility to compare systems allows for the identification of weak points of the operating and management strategy of single systems. This enables the operators to improve the efficiency of the systems.
The data visualisation focuses on the battery data as this is the most cost-intensive component in any PV hybrid system. To optimize the use of the battery and to increase the lifetime of the battery is always key in order to reduce the overall operating costs of PV hybrid systems. To realise the proposed data visualisation, it is necessary to monitor various battery metrics such as voltage, current and temperature. The visualization draws temperature heat maps, temperature profiles and daily energy profiles, as well as other combinatorial metric visualisations, which are necessary to analyse the load and the input sources.
With the help of these figures, it is possible to adjust and adapt several charging and discharging set-points, scheduled generator start and stop points or any other applied management strategy to the real life operation of the specific system. This is often more valuable than pre-planned strategies as in many systems the reality of the usage differs heavily from the planned and scheduled operation.
This article will focus on some specific visualisations for PV hybrid systems to demonstrate their utility. Further information can be found in the report, which goes through various monitoring and visualisation regimes for a range of system types including pico solar, classic solar home systems (50 W to 500 W), inverter based systems (500 W to 5 kW), PV hybrid systems (5 kW to 250 kW) and larger microgrid systems (more than 250 kW).
To analyse the operating strategy of the energy management system for example, it is reasonable to visualise the behaviour of the battery current and state of charge (SOC) depending on the voltage of the battery. To do so, a diagram can be created as shown below. The x-axis represents the normalised battery voltage, while the battery current or SOC is placed on the y-axis. Displaying all data sets results in a dot-cloud.

The voltage is displayed as the normalized battery voltage in [V/cell] and represents the x-axis in both dot-cloud diagrams above. The current is normalised by the capacity of the battery in [A/Ah] and reflects the y-axis in the left diagram. In case of a 100Ah battery the rating means that a current of 10A is displayed as 10A/100Ah = 0.1A/Ah in the given example. 5A/100Ah = 0.05A/Ah. Positive values are charging currents while the negative values are discharge currents.
In case of the given example in the left side of the figure (red dots) it can be seen:
In case of the given example in the right-hand side of the figure (blue dots) it can be seen:
For an experienced system designer or operator, the insights gleaned from the above data visualisations are obvious and meaningful. A system performing as expected will produce data visualisations that “look” nominal whilst underperforming systems, or systems design inappropriately will appear off-nominal.
Having visualisations that can provide immediate feedback to project stakeholders can help to optimise the system and to make adjustments for future designs. IEA-PVPS Task 18 hopes its report on PV hybrid system data visualisations can help system operators with the optimisation of their systems.

The Australian federal government-owned Australian Rail Track Corp. (ARTC) has confirmed that it will use ground-mounted solar arrays coupled with battery energy storage systems to power more than 80 signaling sites dotted along the nation's rail corridor when the Inland Rail line becomes operational.
Following a successful trial of a solar-powered signaling system at Coolleearlee in northern New South Wales, ARTC has approved its use at the remaining 82 signaling sites that will operate along the rail corridor from Albury in the state’s south to Gowrie, Queensland.
The Albury-Gowrie stretch is part of the ambitious Inland Rail project, a railway line that will connect the ports of Melbourne and Brisbane along a new route west of the Great Dividing Range. The line, which will bypass the Sydney metropolitan area, will also connect to the Sydney-Perth rail corridor.
Construction of the project commenced in 2018 and it was originally due to be completed in 2025 but the project has been beset by budget blowouts and construction delays. While there is no definitive date for completion of the project, ARTC has switched to a solar-powered signaling system in a move that will help deliver savings.
ARTC Inland Rail Acting Chief Executive Rebecca Pickering said using the solar and battery energy storage systems rather than mains power for the signalling system provides significant savings for the project with the move eliminating the need to use the local power infrastructure, or to acquire easements to deliver mains power services to the signaling sites.
“Using solar power also saved ARTC around AUD 300,000 in costs, mostly savings from not building a new transmission line to connect to the electricity network and a reduction in trackside infrastructure associated with mains equipment, and over $10,000 per year in operational electricity cost savings,” she said. “We also use remote monitoring technology on these solar powered signalling installations, which adds further savings by reducing the requirement for maintenance visits.”
If those savings are replicated across the additional 82 signaling sites, the switch to solar backed by battery energy storage will provide an estimated AUD 25 million cost reduction for the project.
ARTC said the capacity of the individual solar generation and energy storage systems vary but Inland Rail’s communication and wayside monitoring project manager Matt Brown said all have been designed to meet the corporation’s solar standard which is 10 days of autonomy.
“The solar system is designed with battery back-up that provides for 10 days of back-up operation and delivers a system which runs 24-hours a day, 365 days a year,” he said. “Delivering power to rural signalling systems can be a real challenge so the successful completion of this solar-powered system in Coolleearlee is a great outcome.”

The ministries earlier this month presented their proposals to the cabinet, which approved a number of measures:
“With this development, the renewable energy capacity in the electricity supply system is anticipated to reach approximately 70% by 2050,” said Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, minister of natural resources, environment and climate change. “The expansion of renewable energy capacity will enable surplus renewable energy generation capacity to be exchanged across borders with regional neighbors based on a mechanism that will be determined by the government, thus advancing the realization of the ASEAN Power Grid.”
The projected increase in renewable energy capacity is in line with government-backed studies on a low-carbon energy system pathway and will be incorporated into the National Power Development Plan (PDP), he added.
Efforts to increase renewable energy capacity in Malaysia’s electricity supply system are expected to require investments of some MYR 637 billion (€130.5 billion) through 2050. That funding would finance renewable energy generation sources and strengthen grid infrastructure, including transmission lines enhancement, energy storage system integration and operation costs of grid system networks.
The natural resources and environment ministry will examine the details of the costs and investment values involved as well as the affect on tariffs for electricity consumers.
Malaysia currently has 2,165 MW of total installed solar capacity, according to data from Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum.
It aims to add an additional 1,098 MW by 2025, and another 2,414 MW by 2035. The country has raised its renewable energy targets to 31% by 2025, equaling 8.53 GW of total renewable generation capacity, and to 40% by 2025, or 10.94 GW.

In 2021, the US Department of Energy announced a goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To help energy planners and policymakers move in that direction, The Nature Conservancy studied strategies that maximize clean energy benefits while minimizing land use. The report, “Power of Place: Clean Energy Solutions that Protect People and Nature,” combines analysis of energy development impacts on emissions, land, and communities in the continental United States, in an effort to identify low-impact pathways to a net-zero national economy by 2050.
The report acknowledges the momentum behind clean energy development and said that recent investments by Congress will accelerate development, shore up and expand infrastructure and encourage deployment of other green technologies such as hydrogen, storage and carbon capture. However, it cautions that the rapid buildout could have a negative impact on land, natural habitats and more.
The report estimates that between 3.1 TW  and 3.5 TW of wind and solar generation capacity is needed for the United States to reach net zero by 2050. If development continues with current methods, it would take over 250,000 square miles to produce that much clean energy. Instead, the researchers have developed a 70% impact reduction scenario where only 135,000 square miles would be needed.
The 70% scenario is achievable by adopting approaches that take up less space and to avoid sensitive areas. Three recommended approaches include co-locating of wind and solar, siting agrivoltaics on farmland; and employing fixed-tilt solar.
Locating solar and wind systems on the same site is an effective way to save land. Fixed-tilt solar installations takes up less space and are a good land-saving option, the report notes. While single-axis trackers generate more electricity in the sunnier, southern regions, the report concludes that fixed-tilt is better for places with smaller average project sizes or high land cost.
Implementing the 70% impact reduction scenario will cost about 6.3% more than the current trajectory, the study says. However, the researchers acknowledge that this may be an overestimate because by avoiding sensitive areas, there will be a reduction in cancellation rates, permitting delays, and the need for mitigation.
Trade-offs will continue between providing clean energy for all and minimizing disruption to communities, protecting natural areas and maintaining productive croplands. It is because of these tradeoffs that the researchers provide a framework for designing policies and practices that will balance these issues.
The framework begins with long-term transmission planning, which the report notes should take into account conservation and community data. “Inclusive, participatory planning processes are needed to ensure that economic and environmental benefits and burdens from decarbonization are shared equitably.”
Adopting a regional approach is the second step in the framework. The report notes that the United States is regionally diverse in terms of geography and land use, electricity markets, economies and more. Energy policies also differ from state to state. It is important for policy makers at all levels to understand the differences in each region in order for them to enable a “responsible energy buildout”.
Further recommendations include ways of speeding up interconnection queues, community engagement, adopting incentives for land-saving approaches on croplands, and prioritizing transmission investments in inter-regional connections.
The report authors acknowledge that decarbonizing the economy is no small feat and will cost an estimated $1.87 trillion. They note that it is larger than the buildout of the interstate highway system that took place between 1950 and 1980. And it is because the clean energy transition is cost effective and beneficial to all, the researchers encourage “informed, equitable and early planning” that considers the use of land-saving technologies and investments.

Located in the town of Loeriesfontein, the facility “is set to significantly contribute alleviate the severe power shortages being experienced in South Africa,” the South African PV plant developer said.
The new solar farm will generate enough energy to power thousands of homes and businesses in the region, it added.
Chinese manufacturer Sungrow recently reported that it had supplied its SG3125HV PV inverters for the project.
Phelan Energy Group, Solar Capital's parent company, fully equity funded the Loeriesfontein plant and it will now undertake a refinance program.
The Loeriesfontein community is now part of Solar Capital’s socio-economic development scheme that has provided more than €8 million in funding in recent years, the company added.
“These initiatives focus on education, skills development, healthcare, and other critical areas and create a lasting positive impact in all communities, where our solar plants are located,” Solar Capital stated.
The company also operates two other PV plants in the Northern Cape, the De Aar projects with a combined capacity of 175.26 MW.
“Our focus on bringing clean, reliable energy solutions to South Africa helps reduce the pressure on the grid and addresses the load shedding challenges, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions of South Africans,” said Paschal Phelan, chairman of Solar Capital and Phelan Energy Group.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/11/german-heat-pump-sales-grow-by-111-in-first-quarter/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,EUROPE,GERMANY,WESTERN EUROPE",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MAY 11, 2023",German heat pump sales grow by 111% in first quarter,"From pv magazine Germany
The debate about the Building Energy Act and the proposed ban on new oil and gas heating systems in the not too distant future appear to have triggered a boom in heating modernization in Germany.
According to the Federation of German Heating Industry (BDH), sales figures in the heat generator market rose by 38 percent to 306,500 systems sold in the first quarter of 2023. Heat pumps were in particularly high demand. The sale of 96,500 units means an increase of 111% compared to the first quarter of 2022.
Gas heaters also found more buyers than in the same period last year, however, and are clearly ahead of heat pumps. The BDH recorded growth of 14% to 168,000 systems following an 8% decline in the first quarter of 2022, largely due to the difficult gas supply situation after the outbreak of the Ukraine war.
The growth in new oil heating systems was even stronger, with sales doubling compared to the same quarter of the previous year to 21,500 systems. However, their market share in the overall heating market is rather marginal at 7%. According to the BDH, pellet heating systems have become less significant, dropping in sales by 11%, which the federation attributes to the massive reduction in state subsidies since August 2022.
“We welcome the trend towards modernizing heating technology,” said BDH managing director Markus Staudt. “It's good for the climate, the German economy and, of course, the citizens too, since modern, efficient heating systems reduce energy requirements.”
The federation, however, renewed its criticism of subsidy cuts for biomass heating systems, expressing concern about the imbalance in growth.
“While the heat pump manufacturers are working at the limit, there is still great potential for biomass, which as a climate-neutral and renewable energy source can also make an important contribution to the heat transition,” Staudt stressed.
With a view to further market development, the BDH assumes that volatile energy prices will be a main factor in increasing demand. However, high inflation and rising interest rates could reduce consumers’ purchasing power. The slump in the market for new buildings is another obstacle. Overall, however, the federation expects sustained growth in heating sales of well over 10%. Heat pumps are likely to account for the largest share.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s cabinet also passed the draft Building Energy Act on Monday but it has yet to be passed. The federal states are to discuss it on Friday and will likely propose postponing the legal requirements to 2027. The German Renewable Energy Federation (BEE) takes a critical view of this.
“Proposals to postpone the law until 2027 thwart planning security for the companies that are now investing on a large scale and let people believe that they can continue as before,” said BEE President Simone Peter. “Following the European Parliament, however, the Council has just approved a comprehensive change to the emissions trading directive at EU level, which is expected to make fossil fuels more expensive. Climate protection and international competition for climate protection technologies are not waiting, as the Viessmann deal shows,” Peter continued.
The BEE considers the Building Energy Act reform long overdue. It must now be implemented and not put off, but socially balanced, it argues. Additional costs, for example, should be divided fairly between tenants and landlords. “With a few repairs, such as using the entire range of domestic renewable energy sources and better social cushioning, it will become cheaper and more efficient for everyone in the long term. This is the only way to create the necessary acceptance for the measures,” said Peter.
