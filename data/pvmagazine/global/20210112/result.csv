The €1 billion project, which will also include a green hydrogen production unit, an agrivoltaic plant, and a data center, will be developed outside the tender scheme for solar managed by the French energy regulator CRE.

Solar PV could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. In Q1 2021, pv magazine’s UP initiative will shine a spotlight on agrivoltaics – the combination of agriculture and solar energy – in recognition of this emerging market. The goal is to understand the potential benefits, and economic, political and technical challenges of such an innovative partnership. Make sure you stay informed!
The electricity generated by the plant will be sold through power purchase agreements (PPAs) to unspecified customers. “We want to demonstrate that solar photovoltaic energy is today mature, reliable, and competitive enough to ensure the direct supply of electricity to industrial companies,” the two companies said in a joint statement.
In December, France's National Commission for Public Debate (CNDP) contacted all the entities interested in the project – Engie, Neoen, French grid operator RTE and the City of Saucats – and decided to organize a public debate that would allow the local population to participate in its development. “We want to develop a new model of renewable energy production, placing both technical and economic innovation at the center of its development, and respect for the environment,” Engie and Neoen said.
In the New Aquitaine region, the goal is to reach 8.5 GW of solar PV power generation capacity by 2030. It currently has 2 GW installed. As such, the project alone would represent more than 15% of the region's projected growth, and if it obtains all the necessary permits, commissioning would take place in 2026.

The company claims it will be the world's largest cell factory once operational. The first 10 GW phase is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of April 2021, while the second 10 GW phase should be finalized by the end of the year. Through this new facility, the manufacturer's total annual cell production capacity is expected to reach 30 GW. It will be powered by a rooftop PV array and electricity generated via a hydropower plant located nearby.
Chinese provider of power transmission, power system management and power network maintenance, Guangdong Energy Group Co.,Ltd and Guangdong Agricultural Reclamation Group, which is affiliated with the Bureau of Agriculture and Reclamation of the Ministry of Agriculture, have announced they will jointly build a 500 MW solar power plant in Jieyang City, Guangdong Province. The unsubsidized project will require an investment of around RMB 2.5 billion (US$385 million).
State-owned energy provider China Energy (CEIC) has set up an ambitious renewable energy target for China's 14th five-year plan (2021-2025). The company is aiming to reach up to 80 GW of power generation capacity from renewables, which would represent a 40% share in its energy asset portfolio.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/12/inverted-perovskite-solar-cell-with-21-1-efficiency-and-high-moisture-resistance/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 12, 2021",Inverted perovskite solar cell with 21.1% efficiency and high moisture resistance,"Scientists at the University of Queensland in Australia have fabricated a solar cell based on a mixture of 2D and 3D salts. They claim that the cell is more moisture-resistant and durable than “conventional” perovskite cells based on 3D materials alone.
The cell should include the advantages of cells based on two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, which generally provide more hydrophobicity and thermal stability than “conventional” 3D structures. But it should also include the benefits of 3D perovskite cells, which can offer strong light absorption, good charge carrier transport, and higher power conversion efficiencies.
In “Engineering fluorinated-cation containing inverted perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of >21% and improved stability towards humidity,” which was recently published in Nature Communications, the cell was built with an inverted configuration (p–i–n). The scientists describe it as a solution with potential low-temperature preparation processes, reduced hysteresis, and improved long-term stability under ultraviolet (UV) light, compared to standard n-i-p architectures.
The device incorporates a fluorinated lead salt – the 2-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl)ethylammonium iodide (FEAI) – into the processing solution, which is normally used to form the 3D methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3).
“We demonstrate that small quantities of the additive enhance the performance relative to the neat MAPbI3 in terms of power conversion efficiency and stability to humidity and temperature,” the Australian team explained. “We also show that when the FEAI concentration in the processing solution is above a critical level the performance of the cells decreases.”
They said the simple addition of 0.3 mole percent of a fluorinated lead salt into the three-dimensional methylammonium lead iodide perovskite, via a low-temperature fabrication process, allows the cell to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 21.1%, without the use of an anti-reflective coating. The cell also exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current of 22.4 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 84%. They also claimed that there is no evidence for the formation of a 2D-perovskite layer, nor well defined large 2D crystals.
“We believe this efficiency is competitive with the highest reported for inverted perovskite solar cells composed of a mixture of 2D and 3D salts in the precursor solution, although with a less complex active layer,” the group said.
Additives that can form 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskite films when mixed with a 3D perovskite do not necessarily have to be used at a concentration to form a 2D/3D mixed perovskite film that will stabilize the cells and ensure performance, they added. Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites have attracted extensive attention in photovoltaics in recent years because they are highly stable, without sacrificing too much efficiency.
“The results show that if there is no FEAI in the active layer composition (pure MAPbI3) or there is too much additive (as little as a few percent), then the devices have poorer performance,” the scientists concluded. “The addition of 0.3 mol% of FEAI led to perovskite films in which there was no observable 2D phase and devices with the best performance.”

The result has been confirmed by Germany's TÜV Rheinland and beats the company's previous record of 22.39% set in January 2020.
“JinkoSolar accomplished this outstanding achievement thanks to its industry-leading vertical integration technology, which integrates the company’s N-type TOPCon high-efficiency cell technology and high-energy-density module design with advanced module welding and packaging technology to increase module optical gain and to reduce module internal resistance loss as well as to increase the proportion of cell area in the module,” the solar module manufacturer said in a statement.
In January 2020, Jinko said it was able to improve the panel performance by applying a new anti-reflection coating and advanced metallization technologies. New Tiling Ribbon (TR) technology was also incorporated into the cell design, which eliminates any inter-cell gap.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/12/south-korea-may-tender-4-gw-of-solar-pv-this-year/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 12, 2021",South Korea may tender 4 GW of solar PV this year,"South Korea may allocate around 4 GW of solar capacity this year across two PV tenders, which will be likely launched in April and October, respectively. “We can expect the capacity in the first half of the year to be around 2 GW, and 2 GW or slightly more in the second half of the year,” Yeji Kim, researcher of Seoul-based Solutions For Our Climate, told pv magazine. “According to our inquiry to the Korea Energy Agency (KEA), it is likely that the next tender's capacity will be approximately between 300 and 500 MW more than that of the latest tender of last year, in which 1.4 GW was assigned.”
Through the tenders, the KEA will assign fixed-price contracts to different categories of PV projects including small-sized rooftop arrays and large-scale solar plants. “As tenders for large-scale capacity of 20 MW or more will start for the first time this year, the government may look at the results of this year's tenders for potential multi-year planning,” Kim said, noting that there are currently no discussions on a multi-year schedule. There are also no domestic content requirements embedded in tenders, but starting from this year, projects relying on solar PV modules with a low carbon footprint will be prioritized.
In the two tenders held in 2020, the KEA allocated 1.2 GW and 1.41 GW, respectively, while in 2019 it contracted 350 MW and 500 MW. In 2017 and 2018, total allocated capacity was 600 MW in each year.
In the last tender, held in the second half of 2020, the final average price was 143 KRW (around US$0.13)/kWh. According to Kim, there are various reasons for this high price, the first being that in Korea, economies of scale are not yet being realized. “Between 2017 and 2019, the average scale of solar PV projects were less than 10 MW,” he said. “In China, the average was 22 MW, and in India, 50 MW.”
In addition, high land costs are also driving higher prices, and solar PV facilities face poor public acceptance and resident opposition, especially in farming areas. “To address these complaints, an increasing number of municipalities have been introducing their own separation distance regulations that require solar PV installations to be sited a minimum distance – an average of between 300m to 1,000m – away from certain features such as roads and houses,” Kim said. “This requires the developer to go through more administrative hurdles, increasing project costs.”
Costs further grow as construction times increase. Regarding this issue, Solutions for Our Climate published the report, Nowhere to Go: How Siting Regulations Are Strangling Solar, which highlighted that of Korea's 226 basic municipalities, 123 have local siting regulations, including separation distance regulations. “Through a GIS analysis of three municipalities – Hampyeong, Hamyang, and Gumi – we found that separation distance regulations exclude 46-67% of total land area from solar PV installations,” the researchers wrote. “If we remove mountainous or forested land which is less economically feasible, less than 1% of the total land area allows for solar PV installations.”
For South Korea to reach its renewable energy and emissions targets, Solutions for Our Climate said that separation distances must be restricted and abolished either by a modification of municipal ordinances through draft standard municipal ordinances, or an amendment to the country's renewable energy policy. “The central government or regional governments need to act and establish restrictions on municipalities’ authority to regulate separation distances,” Kim said.
The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has also recently announced it wants to help development of unsubsidized solar by allowing domestic electricity consumers to buy power from renewable energy power producers through power purchase agreements (PPAs).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/12/neon-plans-500-mw-1000-mwh-battery-in-australia/,"UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 12, 2021",Neoen plans 500 MW / 1000 MWh battery in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
The project, which Neoen is calling the ‘Great Western Battery,’ would be Australia’s largest battery storage project by a long shot. The French renewables developer claims the project “would operate unlike any other device currently connected to the NSW network and would provide a range of services.”
Revealed by planning documents filed on December 15, 2020, Neoen is seeking consent to construct, operate and maintain a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) of 500 MW and up to 100 MWh at 173 Brays Lane, Wallerawang, New South Wales. It is also seeking to build a new transmission line that would connect the big battery to Wallerawang’s existing TransGrid 330 kV substation.
Neoen estimates the project will cost approximately $300 to $400 million.
Positioning itself to play a key role in the 12 GW of new renewable energy generation capacity planned by the state government for this decade, Neoen says the big battery is the key to unlocking future investment in, and uptake of, renewable energy in the state, solving existing grid limitations.
Neoen currently operates the world’s largest lithium-ion battery in Hornsdale, South Australia. Recently expanded, Hornsdale Power Reserve, also known as the Tesla Big Battery, has a capacity of 150 MW / 194 MWh. The Great Western Battery is planned to have at least triple the capacity.
In the submitted scoping study, prepared with the support of consultancy AECOM, Neoen says one of the project’s main project is to improve the resilience and sustainability NSW grid. “The large-scale BESS would reduce the possibility of load-shedding and blackout events in the State, especially considering the multiple existing coal-fired power plants that are planned to retire in the next decade,” the study says.
The proposed site, which about 110km west of Sydney, sits between the now decommissioned Wallerawang coal power station, the Springvale colliery, the Lidsdale coal loading facility, and the Wallerawang ash repository.
Neoen plans to connect its big battery to the 330kV substation which had previously served the coal power station, repurposing the infrastructure located about 1.25km from the proposed site.
The Great Western Battery is anticipated to take about one year to construct, requiring a peak of 150 to 200 workers. If, as anticipated, construction is able to begin by 2022, the big battery could be operational by 2023.
The plan tops off a huge year for Neoen. In 2020, the company was awarded a contract for a 300 MW / 450 MWh Victoria Big Battery to be constructed on the outskirts of Geelong as well as securing a 14-year contract with the Australian Capital Territory.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/12/coveme-pushing-for-a-greener-solar-industry-with-emphasis-on-material-innovation/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",BECKY BEETZ,"JANUARY 12, 2021",Coveme: Pushing for a greener solar industry with emphasis on material innovation,"
Amedeo Maccolini, CEO: We develop the concept of sustainability on two different levels: (1) Operational – On this level, sustainability means compliance with environmental and safety standards. Coveme’s production processes are subject to rigid and well-defined quality protocols and are compliant with ISO 9001:2015 quality management standards. Moreover, Coveme is certified under ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management, and ISO 45001:2018 for health and safety at work.
(2) Ethical – This entails respecting the environment that hosts us and our employees. It also means being visionaries in what the future can look like. In other words, thinking about business with a medium- to longer-term outlook. We are moving toward a future where there will be a growing need for high-quality recyclable materials, so during today’s design phase we need to take into account what the specific requirements of tomorrow’s materials will be. To achieve our final goal – implementing a “circular economy” process – we are investigating recycling models where both the backsheet and encapsulant are separated by a mechanical process through chemical recycling to become feedstock for new PET film production.
In 2019, pv magazine launched the UP initiative, aimed at diving deep into what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar PV and energy storage industries. Via quarterly themes, we looked at raw material sourcing in batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing and PV module recycling in 2020. In Q1 2021, we will be turning our attention to agrivoltaics. Make sure you stay informed!
Coveme conducts monthly reports illustrating the company's energy consumption and environmental impacts. These reports are published internally twice a year. We then carry out an annual environmental analysis and compare it with the reports of previous years. These are currently are not published outside of the company, but we are working on implementing a system that, starting from 2021, will release them to the public.
Our corporate mission is to minimize the environmental impact of production. We do this through mandatory restrictions that must be adhered to; in particular with the consolidated environmental text 152 from 2006 – a legislative decree that deals with environmental regulations, which for us implies authorizations, and limits on and monitoring of polluting emissions.
We also take inline measurements of our emissions’ composition. The pollutants are eliminated through state-of-the-art abatement systems. For example, being a chemical company involves working with acids. Our acids are knocked down inside counter-flow towers with a reactant, which allows the chemical neutralization of the acids and guarantees the release of purified fumes into the environment.
As for the methods and internal processes, we have adopted a whole series of behaviors which are stricter than normative standards. For example, in both our Gorizia plant and Bologna headquarters we have installed solar panels that allow us to produce renewable energy for self-consumption. In Bologna, we cover 100% of our energy needs this way. Meanwhile, we have installed a regenerative thermo oxidizer at our Chinese production site. This virtuous system captures the heat from exhaust gases, converts the solvents into carbon dioxide and water, and generates a thermal energy recovery.
We adopt best practices wherever we are. We always adopt a group logic, which means that if we see that best practices from an environmental point of view are Chinese, we will try to adopt these in Italy as well, in addition to the implemented Italian regulations. The same thing happens on the technology side: if we see that the best practices are coming from Italy, we ensure Coveme Zhangjiagang follows them, of course adapting to Chinese legislation.
Yes, backsheet recycling is up to those who recycle PV modules. They must follow certain obligations. Coveme is working to support final clients both at the product and service level, in order to fulfill these obligations. At the same time, we are working with our suppliers to make polyester easily recyclable and to use already recycled polyester in our production process. In addition, we work with our partners to find new solutions and this bring us back to the “circular economy” concept. To be precise, we help our customers and suppliers develop a disposal system consistent with European, rather than U.S. or Asian regulations. We are part of various international working groups focused on understanding module disposal. In this way, we can offer our customers and suppliers all the references they need about this topic.
Coveme has chosen multinational worldwide companies as suppliers, which must all be ISO14001 certified. Moreover, we often carry out on-site audits to verify that all rules are followed correctly by our suppliers, with a particular focus on their sustainable behavior.
At a time when this topic was not well known, we were one of the first companies to start several studies on backsheet recycling in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute. The 2017 study consists of an analysis of the behavior of different types of backsheets in the various disposal processes (landfill, pyrolysis, incineration). The conclusion was that the use of fluoropolymers or halogenated polymers in photovoltaic modules should be avoided and alternative PET based or biobased backsheets should be used.
We have a wide range of products, which include fluorinated backsheets, that are Tedlar based, but also fluorine-free backsheets that are polyester based. Our company is a technical solutions’ provider so we must put customer care at the center and we always try to offer to our customers the greenest solutions. Furthermore, considering the difficulty of some customers in switching from backsheets based on Fluorurate TPE production to those based on PET PPE, we are also offering recycling solutions to module manufacturers with fluorine based backsheets.
One of the advantages of polyester is that it already has a lower carbon footprint than alternative materials, with clean and efficient manufacturing. An additional advantage is the potential to further reduce the carbon footprint by incorporating recycled content. This helps, because for every kilogram of virgin material you replace, you reduce the related carbon emissions by approximately 1.5 kilos. Increasing those levels comes with better messaging to the wider industry about a further carbon reduction, but this needs to be done step-by-step.
Coveme is pushing for a greener industry, with a particular emphasis on material innovation in recycled and recyclable products. We are working on several fronts, including on an institutional level, a supplier level and an industry partner level. This includes:
First of all, we thank pv magazine for this first year of partnership, which we intend to continue in the future. The activities we have done in this first year have confirmed the importance of exchange of best practices with other players, and to ensure that ecological and sustainable products are at the same time the most highly performing products.
From our first product on there always been a technical and qualitative improvement of the material. This development is still ongoing, so much so that the latest films developed with DTF have performances that can be equated to Tedlar – perhaps better – and that can even occasionally replace the glass layer of the solar panel. We hope to have made a first contribution as a polyester film converter with a know-how of more than 50 years and as a supplier of the PV industry for over 20 years.

In a document published in the country's official journal, the Turkish government specified that it set a ceiling price of TRY0.35 ($0.047)/kWh for the procurement exercise and that winners will receive a 15-year power purchase guarantee. “Although the ceiling price was increased, the industry is worried about the value loss of the Turkish Lira and looking for a new more realistic price escalation calculation method,” the CEO of German company KRC Consulting, Hakki Karacaoglan, told pv magazine.
When the tender was announced, the Turkish government said the ceiling price would have been TRY0.3/kWh.
All projects must use locally produced modules and be located in 36 cities, and across 74 grid connection points. The following cities have been allocated projects under the tender: Adıyaman, Ağrı, Aksaray, Ankara, Antalya, Batman, Bayburt, Bilecik, Bingöl, Bitlis, Burdur, Bursa, Çankırı, Çorum, Diyarbakır, Elazığ, Erzurum, Eskişehir, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Iğdır, Kahramanmaraş, Kars, Kırşehir, Kilis, Malatya, Mardin, Mersin, Muş, Nevşehir, Osmaniye, Siirt, Şırnak, Uşak, Van and Yozgat. The selected facilities will have to range in size from 10 to 20 MW.
Karacaoglan said in July that, considering that locally-manufactured modules must be used and that they are around 30% more expensive than those produced elsewhere, project developers and participating parties will have difficulties in defining the right pricing. The auction will be in Turkish lira and, as a result, fundraising will have to be in Turkish lira. Due to the high inflation rate financing costs will be higher than if the auction was in euros or U.S. dollars.
The Yeka tender was originally postponed in January 2019 and was initially intended at selecting larger PV projects with a power range between 10 and 50 MW.

This is one of the main findings of a recent research project conducted by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS).
Scientists from both organizations have jointly assessed the irradiance-weighted average temperatures (IWATs) of floating solar arrays in the Netherlands and Singapore and have compared the results with those of ground-mounted installations and rooftop PV systems.
The test field in the Netherlands was located on an inland lake close to the sea in the province of South-Holland. The test bed in Singapore was at a 1 MW floating solar array on the Tengeh Reservoir. In the former, two kinds of floating systems were tested: one with a small footprint on water and an open structure (NL1), and one with a large footprint on water and a closed structure (NL2). In the latter, three different systems were investigated: an array with a large footprint and closed structure (SG1), a system with a medium footprint and closed structure (SG2), and a free-standing system with an open structure (SG3).
The performance and temperature behavior of the NL1 and NL2 arrays was compared to those of two reference ground-mounted installations. The scientists called them NL 3 and NL 4. They also compared the energy yield of the three systems in Singapore with the yield from a free-standing rooftop PV system (SG4).
The measurements showed that the irradiance-weighted average temperature (IWAT) of the NL1 system in the Netherlands, which was the best performing system, was 3.2 C lower than the nearby reference system. In Singapore, the best-performing system was the SG3 array, which exhibited a 14.5 C lower IWAT than its reference system. Furthermore, the determined heat loss coefficients of the different systems have been used within PVsyst software to model the annual yield of the floating systems and the reference arrays in a typical meteorological year.
In Singapore, the best-performing system was the SG3 array, which exhibited a 14.5 C lower IWAT than its reference system.
“The determined median heat-loss coefficients of the best-performing systems NL1 and SG3 are with 57 W/m2 per kelvin and 55 W/ m2 per kelvin, respectively, almost identical,” the researchers concluded. “When the heat-loss coefficients of all systems are split into a constant value and a wind-dependent value, and using these values to model the specific yield of all systems, it can be concluded that the largest part of the cooling effect of FPV systems can be attributed to higher wind speeds above water compared to land.”
They also said that the floating systems with the open structure, which allow for wind beneath the modules, can provide a heat loss coefficient that is up to 22 W/m2 per kelvin higher compared to the reference systems.
The scientists described the floating PV systems and their performance in “The cooling effect of floating PV in two different climate zones: A comparison of field test data from the Netherlands and Singapore,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.

Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) and South Korean steelmaker Posco have agreed to a partnership that will see FMG supply Posco with iron ore and green hydrogen. 
At a meeting in Seoul on Dec. 14, Posco CEO Jeong-Woo Choi and FMG Chairman Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest discussed the potential of a cooperative green hydrogen business. FMG has already set a carbon neutrality target of 2040. But Forrest and his executives have been jet setting around the world in recent months securing deals, such as this one with Posco, in support of its ambitious plans to build one of the biggest renewable energy portfolios in the world, delivering more than 235 GW of renewable capacit. That is five times the current capacity of Australia’s National Energy Market. 
“FMG is a long-term contract supplier that has been stably supplying iron ore to Posco,” said Choi. “If competitive green hydrogen can be produced with cooperation between the two companies and is introduced to Korea, the era of green hydrogen in Korea will be accelerated.” 
Part of the deal will see FMG use Posco’s premium steel materials, PosMAC, for all the solar and wind generation behind the green hydrogen FMG produces. As it stands then, Posco will import FMG’s iron ore to make the steel. The steel will then be supplied back to FMG’s solar developments to generate green hydrogen in Western Australia. 
Posco has set itself a carbon neutrality goal of 2050, a target which the company is establishing a green hydrogen business to tackle. 
“Green hydrogen and ammonia are important factors in reducing carbon emissions as the world is in the transition to clean energy,” said Forrest. “I hope that with Posco’s participation in the first green hydrogen project conducted by FMG, both companies can grow together.” 
The partnership with Posco is one of many deals Forrest and his executives have secured in recent months. Forrest himself has been putting serious miles on the engine of the FMG private jet in a world tour to set the stage for the company’s renewable energy business, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI). 
According to the The Sydney Morning Herald, Forrest returned to Western Australia last week after “his four-month mystery world tour.” After undertaking a “formal supervised 14-day quarantine period in New South Wales” Forrest received an exemption from the Western Australian government to return to the state without an additional quarantine. 
At the FMG annual general meeting in November, it was revealed that Forrest intended to visit up to 47 countries on his search for renewable energy projects and mineral resources for FFI. 
Although much of the adventure has been kept secret, it is known that Forrest began his journey in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, where national leaders signed non-binding agreements with FFI for multibillion dollar renewable projects. Next stop, Afghanistan, then onto Japan where Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Iwatani Corp.n signed a deal with FFI to investigate the potential for a liquid hydrogen supply-chain. Presumably, Forrest’s next stop was to meet with Choi and Posco in Seoul. 
It is also believed Forrest or his executives have been on scouting missions throughout Europe, the United States, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, the Congo, Kenya, and Ethiopia. 
FMG’s share price has more than doubled in the last year, making it Australia’s fourth-biggest listed company. Of course, much of this surge has to do with the rising iron ore price during the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is clear that Forrest himself is not sitting back and enjoying his mining billions. The magnate is on a mission to transform his empire into a global green force.

Global corporate investment in the solar sector came to $14.5 billion in 2020, representing 24% growth over the $11.7 billion raised in 2019, according to a new report by Mercom Capital Group.
The growth comes in spite of an especially bad first half of the year, with the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic leading to funding being down 25% year on year in the first half.
The rebound and recovery were driven in large part by publicly traded solar companies, with several initial public offerings and securitization deals creating what Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu referred to as an “investment haven” in the uncertain Covid economy.
While total global solar funding rose in 2020, global venture capital and private equity funding in the sector fell to $1.2 billion in 41 deals, compared to $1.4 billion in 53 deals in 2019. Nearly all of this funding – $1.1 billion of it – went to 27 downstream companies.
Among these companies, India’s Ayana Renewable Power led the way, raising $390 million, followed by Silicon Ranch Corp., which brought in $225 million. Australia's Brighte raised $76 million, Singapore’s Sunseap Group raised $72 million, and Aurora Solar and Zero Mass Water tied for fifth, each raising $50 million.
Of the VC funding that didn’t go to downstream companies, solar service providers raised $61 million, PV companies raised $17 million, balance-of-system companies brought in $15 million, thin-film technology companies raised $15 million, and concentrated photovoltaic companies raised $5.5 million.
Alongside all of the funding, 39.5 GW of large-scale solar projects were acquired in 2020, compared to 26.1 GW in 2019. According to Mercom, those 39.5 GW represent the largest amount of projects acquired in a single year to date. The capacity came from 231 large-scale project acquisitions in 2020, compared to 192 such transactions in 2019.
There were also 62 mergers and acquisitions deals in 2020, most of which involved downstream companies. No surprise, the largest transaction in 2020 was Sunrun’s $3.2 billion, all-stock acquisition of Vivint Solar.
Debt financing came to $8.3 billion in 2020, a 6.4% increase over 2019. Eight securitization deals totaling $2.2 billion were recorded in 2020, which Mercom said represented the largest amount of securitization financing ever in a year.
Finally, public market financing saw an exponential rise, up 101%, with $5.1 billion in 2020. Array Technologies raised $1.2 billion in its initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2020.
