https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/26/enel-unveils-680-w-n-type-heterojunction-solar-panel-for-utility-scale-applications/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2022",Enel unveils 680 W n-type heterojunction solar panel for utility-scale applications,"Enel Green Power (EGP), a unit of Italian utility Enel, unveiled its newest solar panel at the 8th World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion this week in Milan, Italy.
The new product is a heterojunction bifacial panel for applications in utility-scale PV projects. It is based on an n-type solar cell with G12 format and a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%.
“Production will begin in September 2023 with the first 400 MW production line of our 3Sun Factory in Catania, Sicily, southern Italy,” the head of 3Sun, Eliano Russo, told pv magazine. “The cell efficiency was certified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany. According to our roadmap, however, we should be able to increase the efficiency to 25% efficiency in 2025 and over 26% in the second half of 2026.”
The cell has currently a thickness of 150 µm, but the company's roadmap has set a target of 120 µm by the end of 2025.
“Our cell is flexible and, compared to TOPCon and PERC cells, has a higher resistance to mechanical stress,” Russo explained. “We conducted several tests which showed that if microcracks arise, they don't expand as significantly as in PERC cells.”
The new panel is available in nine versions, with power outputs ranging from 640 W to 680 W and average efficiency spanning from 22.6% to 22.9%. The open-circuit voltage is between 43.3 V and 44.2 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 18.9 A to 19.8 A.
All versions of the solar module measure 2,172 mm × 1,303 mm × 35 mm and weigh in at 36 kg. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V and the bifaciality reaches 95%. The panel can be used in operating temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C, with an operating temperature coefficient of -0.24% per degree Celsius. It is enclosed between 2 mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, and also features a junction box with an IP 68 rating and an anodized aluminum frame.
The new products come with 30-year linear power output guarantees and 20-year product guarantees. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 93% of the nominal output power.
“The factory will start operations around September 2023,” Russo said, noting that the factory's capacity at that time will be around 400 MW. “The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of our panel allows us to tackle the market while ensuring remarkable profitability.”
EGP will initially target the European market, where it is obliged to sell up to 60% of its products, as it has received a significant amount of funding from the European Union.
“We are also targeting non-European markets such as the United States, Latin America, and Asia, and we may also consider opening new factories abroad,” Russo said. “By choosing the heterojunction technology, we decided to bet on technology and innovation, but we are also considering increasing our scale. All the economies of scale which we can capture will only increase our competitiveness.”
Enel is investing €600 million ($579.4 million) in the expansion of its 3Sun facility. Out of that amount, €188 million euros are expected to be provided by European Commission and the Italian government through grants coming from the Innovation Fund and National Recovery and Resiliency Plan (NRRP).
EGP started production at the 200 MW facility in October 2019. It invested around €80 million in reviving the factory, which was built in 2011 with Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp and French-Italian semiconductor business STMicroelectronics. Enel took full control of the facility in July 2014. At the time, the factory was intended to produce multi-junction, thin-film silicon PV modules.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/26/super-fast-long-life-aqueous-rechargeable-zinc-battery/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,IRAN,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2022","Super-fast, long-life aqueous rechargeable zinc battery","As demand for battery energy storage systems grows, so does the realization that not everything can hinge on single chemistry. Concerns around raw material cost and availability but also environmental footprint and safety of ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries are making room for alternative chemistries to be considered and advanced to commercialization.
Aqueous rechargeable zinc-based batteries have been explored as a promising alternative due to their low cost, safety, environmental friendliness, and intrinsic non-flammable nature. However, their widespread adoption has been held back by their low Coulombic efficiency and the notorious dendritic growth at the zinc-based anodes, along with the fast capacity fading of the cathodes.
Now, an international group of researchers led by scientists from Tarbiat Modares University (TMU) in Iran have reported a high-performance and super-long-life rechargeable zinc battery. Their device features a mixed ZnCO3 and MnCO3 grafted onto a graphene aerogel (ZMG) negative electrode and a nanotubular sulfidated Ni-Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDHS) positive electrode.
“The input energy required to charge the battery can be provided by renewable energy sources. Note that the voltage of the solar panel should exceed 20-30% of the working voltage of the battery for efficient charging,” Abolhassan Noori, assistant professor at the TMU Department of Analytical Chemistry, told pv magazine.
By virtue of the improved conductivity and boosted electroactivity of the developed electrode active materials, the alkaline ZMG||LDHS supercapacitor-battery hybrid device has displayed excellent performance on a variety of criteria.
It delivered excellent capacity (356 mA h g−1 cathode at 12 A g−1) and rate capability (108 mA h g−1 cathode at 300 A g−1), extremely high specific energy (568 W h kg−1 cathode), and specific power (429 kW kg−1 cathode), along with a high output voltage (1.8 V).
In addition, the device exhibited what is termed as “unprecedented cycling stability” with 99.2% capacity retention after 17,000 cycles at 100% depth of discharge, thanks to an electrochemical pulse-driven regenerative mechanism.
The outstanding high energy and high-power performances are attributed to the favorable structural features of the electrode active materials and the synergistic effects among the constituent elements as well as the pseudocapacitive character of the negative electrode, resulting in an energy storage device that “outperforms most previously reported Zn-based energy storage devices,” the researchers said in “Super-Fast and Super-Long-Life Rechargeable Zinc Battery,”which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.

This was the observation made by Pierre Verlinden, the former chief scientist at Trina Solar and now the managing director of consultancy Amrock. Verlinden, when chairing a panel discussion on how the next terawatt of installed PV capacity can be accelerated.
The session rounded out the morning proceedings at the WCPEC-8, which saw the industry-shaping research of the UNSW’s Martin Green recognized through his receipt of the WCPEC Prize which, like the event, occurs only every four years. Marko Topič, from the Ljubljana Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Colorado State University was awarded the Becquerel Prize for his work in PV device and system measurement and simulation at the event
The mood on the first morning of the WCPEC-8 was high, with researchers clearly pleased to be meeting once again in person, after three years of disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, some disruptions did occur, with Marko Topič unable to attend in person having contracted the illness last week.
Rallying cry
The opening proceedings of WCPEC-8 were further energized by “truly the first global energy crisis” – in the words of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Paolo Frankl, who spoke via video link. He argued that there is a pressing need for the “diversification” of PV manufacturing “to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities,” if solar is to rapidly scale.
Peter Fath, from manufacturing consultancy RCT Solutions delivered an invigorating presentation in which he suggested that vertical integration of PV production can not only deliver more stable industry growth but also a leveling of the playing field in terms of production cost – with his company’s analysis concluding the when subsidies, capital costs, and profit are removed from the analysis, European, US, Indian, and Chinese solar manufacturing would have similar cost structures.
“Don’t be afraid of the manufacturing cost … we are very, very close [between countries],” said Fath, who is the chairman of the PV division of the German Engineering Federation (VDMA) and the former CTO of equipment supplier centrotherm.
Fath argued that countries with large PV installations should target 50% of the PV modules installed to be domestically produced and that vertical integration presents many advantages and opportunities. He noted that all of the major Chinese PV producers were vertically integrated across ingot, wafer, cell and module, to varying degrees, in a model he
described as vertical integration 1.0. For 2.0, Fath includes the production of glass and polysilicon and pointed to six such highly integrated manufacturing projects underway currently in India.
“In this terawatt era we have to focus on the full supply chain,” said Fath. “Shortages [of certain materials] cannot continue if we are head towards TW scale.”
Fath noted he is speaking from experience, having spent the past three years working on the planning, design, and execution of the 2 GW Kalyon PV facility – which includes ingot, wafer, cell, and module capacity on the same site outside of the Turkish capital of Ankara.
Alongside technologists such as Fath, and researchers, the opening of WCPEC-8 featured a video address from Longi’s Li Zhenguo and panel comments from Enel Green Power’s Massimiliano Francone, with both companies sponsors of the event.
The WCPEC-8 continues through to Friday, Sept. 30.

The energy giant said in its 2021 sustainability report that preparation for the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) tender is ongoing. It aims to launch bidding in 2022.
“The preliminary generation and transmission license exemption for self-generation has also been obtained from Authority for Public Services Regulation (APSR),” it said. “The OQ AE Unit received formal expressions of interest from various potential equity partners to invest in Liwa Solar project and its Final Investment Decision (FID) is expected to be finalized by 2023.”
The Block 60 concession area, also known as the Abu Tubul Block, covers an area of 1,485 square kilometers in west-central Oman, about 100 kilometers west of Saih Rawl. The gas and oil extracted at the site are sent to the Abu Tubul Gas Processing Plant, which is operated by OOCEP.
OQ has already built a 100 MW solar park near Nimr at the Block 6 concession area, which is owned by state-owned oil producer Petroleum Development Oman. Block 6 is Oman's largest and most significant oil and gas site, spanning almost 91,000 square kilometers.
“Petroleum Development Oman’s (PDO) Amin Solar IPP Project was successfully registered with the International Renewable Energy Certificates (IREC) Standard Registry which allows for the plant’s energy to be tracked and traced after it enters the electricity grid,” OQ said in a recent statement. “International Renewable Energy Certificates (IREC) make it possible to link ownership rights of electricity from the place of production to the place of consumption by issuing a certificate for each MWh produced from the power plant.”
The Amin solar project is owned by Amin Renewable Energy Company S.A.O.C. (AREC), which is a joint venture between Japan's Marubeni, Bahwan Renewable Energy Co., Qatar-based Nebras Power QPSC, and OQ.
OQ is a wholly owned subsidiary of the government of Oman, held via the Oman Investment Authority.

In recent decades, the United States has made unprecedented technical advancements in a broad array of clean energy solutions with the potential to decarbonize the grid while making it more equitable and resilient. We now find ourselves in a new stage of the clean energy revolution and on the cusp of a dramatic transformation of the electricity sector.
The speed at which this transformation occurs will be determined not by the pace of technical innovation, but by the availability of debt financing for unfamiliar technologies and the ability of innovative grid-scale solutions to tap into viable business models. This is particularly true for virtual power plants (VPP).
As we view it at the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), a VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) like PV, energy storage, EV chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.
Market entry
In September 2020, FERC Order 2222 opened the door for VPPs in the United States. Nearly two years later, VPPs are just beginning to compete in organized capacity, energy, and ancillary services markets at a meaningful scale at the regional level. To truly unlock VPP’s potential, wide reaching deployment at the national scale is needed.
At the state and retail level, utilities have an important role to play in scaling up DER integration and automated demand response. Equally important will be the ability of VPP aggregators to secure revenue contracts that can underpin a successful business endeavor.
To unleash the capital that makes ratepayer and wholesale power cost reductions possible, incumbent financiers need to see lower customer acquisition costs and consistent revenues for the critical services provided. These and other challenges are far from intractable, and well-worth the cascade of benefits we expect to unlock if we come together to solve them.
Consumer advocates, local government, established utilities, and other partners that have earned the public’s trust across income strata can be important allies for aggregators looking to lower customer acquisition costs. Separately, open-source standards and packages like OpenADR, EcoPort, or other measures that enable intersystem transferability will be important tools to empower consumers by enabling them to switch aggregators.
As director of LPO, I lead the provision of public debt capital for technology projects in the US that are large-scale, innovative, and clean when private lenders cannot or will not lean-in. Bridging this gap while protecting the taxpayer interest is a challenge only surmountable with vast expertise across financial, technical, utility, and clean energy fields that comes together at a place like the Department of Energy. From this vantage point, my goal is to educate the audience on the essential nature of VPP – there is simply no other cost-effective way to integrate electric vehicles and heat pumps at scale.
In pursuit of this educational role, I have surveyed the technical components of VPP – from hard assets like PV, energy storage, and grid-interactive efficient buildings and appliances, to the core role of the software and control applications. I have looked at the importance of interoperability between VPP and existing grid control systems, but also among software and the diversely sourced hardware of a VPP itself. One conclusion I have reached is that the technology has been available for decades but integrating and compensating these technologies remains elusive within utility planning.
To explore these challenges further, I will be looking at VPP on the pv magazine USA site with a fresh lens – a new, follow-on video series. I’ll sit down with guests from around the US with real-world VPP experience as customers, operators, and regulators. We’ll talk about the benefits of VPP in terms of resilience, equity, and decarbonization. As well as the growing pains they’ve witnessed as pioneers. We’ll look at what’s working, what needs improvement, and how we can help one another to realize the benefits of the technology’s progress.

Sydney-listed miner Oz Minerals confirmed it will initially source 80% of the energy needs for its West Musgrave Project through an off-grid hybrid renewable power solution, after announcing it had given its final investment approval to develop the massive copper-nickel project in Western Australia.
Oz Minerals said most of the energy needs for the copper and nickel mine will be delivered via an optimized mix of solar PV and wind generation, supported by a battery energy storage system. This will be backed up by diesel-fueled generation. Oz Minerals said the renewable power solution would have a nominal 50 MW base case power supply, with room for expansion.
“Once complete, it will be one of the world’s largest, off-grid hybrid projects,” the miner said.
The renewables-based power solution is to be delivered via a power purchase agreement with an independent power producer. Oz Minerals CEO Andrew Cole said the agreement includes provision for expansion, with the company committed to developing a roadmap to 100% renewable generation.
Oz Minerals plans to start production at the West Musgrave site in late 2025 when it predicts the nickel market – which has been buoyed by demand for battery metals needed for decarbonisation and electrification – will enter a sustained period of undersupply.
“No other metals will have the same intensity of use as the world shifts to cleaner energy and electrification, electric vehicles, wind farms and solar panels,” Cole said.
West Musgrave is expected to produce an average of 35,000 tons of nickel in concentrate and 41,000 tons of copper in concentrate in each of its first five years, with production of 27,000 tons of nickel and 33,000 tons per annum over its 24-year mine life.
Oz Minerals Chair Rebecca McGrath said global electrification is set to drive significant demand for these core metals.
“The board’s approval of West Musgrave is a fundamental step toward realizing Oz Minerals’ strategy to evolve into a modern minerals producer set to supply global copper and nickel markets as the world moves into the decarbonization and electrification era,” she said. “We can see the enormous potential of this project.”

In November 2021, the consortium achieved a 29.2% record efficiency for the device, from an efficiency rate of just 28.7% in March 2020
“The development of the cell will continue until practical limit for two junction devices are reached, however it is key to bring the technology to the market to benefit from a faster learning curve to devices that are actually mass produced,” Gianluca Coletti, TNO's program manager for tandem PV technology, told pv magazine. 
The research institutes, which are all part of the Solliance consortium, were able to increase the cell's overall efficiency by raising the efficiency of the perovskite cell –  a highly near-infrared transparent perovskite device built by TNO with TU Eindhoven and imec.
“This result was achieved by first implementing highly transparent contacts and then working on improving one by one the absorber layer and each of the transport layers,” Coletti explained.
According to the researchers, the efficiency rate of the 3 mm x 3 mm perovskite cell used for the tandem cell increased from 17.8% to 19.7%, a result which was certified by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra, Italy.
“This type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93% of the near-infrared light to reach the bottom device,” said TNO researcher Mehrdad Najafi. “This performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.”
The scientists placed the perovskite device on top of a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell developed by TU Delft.
“The silicon device is a 20×20-mm2 wide, heterojunction solar cell featuring optimized surface passivation, transparent conductive oxides, and copper-plated front contacts for state-of-the-art carrier extraction,” said TU Delft researcher Yifeng Zhao.
In a recent paper, the researchers said that the cell was used in 24.5 mW/cm2 bifacial tandem mini-modules with an area of 100 cm2 in combination with a PERC bottom cell. The panels exhibited a 3 mW/cm2 gain compared to the same device with a monofacial architecture. According to the scientists, outdoor results have shown that the module can outperform the monofacial counterpart by more than 25% in a 10% albedo environment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/26/short-term-scarcity-long-term-uncertainty-weighing-on-green-hydrogen/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2022","Short-term scarcity, long-term uncertainty weighing on green hydrogen","A group of German and US researchers claim that green hydrogen and derived electrofuels will likely supply less than 1% of final energy by 2030 in the European Union and by 2035 throughout the world, if electrolysis grows as quickly as wind and solar power did in the past.
“By 2040, a breakthrough to higher shares is more likely, but large uncertainties prevail with an interquartile range of 3.2% to 11.2% (EU) and 0.7% to 3.3% (globally),” said the researchers. They suggested that short-term scarcity and long-term uncertainty will slow investments in hydrogen end uses and infrastructure, reducing green hydrogen’s potential and jeopardizing climate targets.
“However, historic analogues suggest that emergency-like policy measures could foster substantially higher growth rates, expediting the breakthrough and increasing the likelihood of future hydrogen availability,” the researchers said in “Probabilistic feasibility space of scaling up green hydrogen supply,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.
The researchers acknowledged the importance of demand, infrastructure, and renewable capacity, but used electrolyzers as a proxy for hydrogen developments. They based their conclusions on 2021 data, but confirmed the validity of their modeling to pv magazine.
“Spurred by concrete policies supporting green hydrogen scale-up, the past year has seen substantial momentum in electrolysis project announcements and associated final investment decisions,” said researcher Adrian Odenweller. “However, due to long lead times and time required for construction, recent final investment decisions are unlikely to translate into operating projects already next year. We, therefore, take 2023 as the ‘initial year' in our model.”
The researchers welcomed recent support schemes announced in Europe and North America, like the US tax credit for green hydrogen or the creation of a European bank meant to support hydrogen developments. 
“The European Hydrogen Bank underpins the highly ambitious green hydrogen targets with concrete policy measures,” said Odenweller. “It is a much-needed step in the right direction. The exact design and allocation of the funds remain to be seen.”
The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research academic said that reaching the REPowerEU target for domestic renewable hydrogen production – 10 million metric tons by 2030 – requires unprecedented growth rates for energy technologies.
“The current energy crisis might offer a window of opportunity to catalyze the energy transition by spurring investment into renewable energy technologies. Yet, it is important to note that this should include all crucial zero-carbon technologies, not just green hydrogen,” commented Odenweller. “So if policymakers decide for war-time efforts, they should still balance these measures across technologies.”
The researchers said the uncertainties are due to a lack of a dominant electrolysis technology, and contradictory shreds of evidence about the costs of different hydrogen supply chains. 
“It is likely that the first large-scale imports of hydrogen products can be realised around 2030. Imports via pipelines have a large potential to reduce costs, but cost estimates remain uncertain,” said Odenweller.
Another uncertainty is related to the speed the green hydrogen supply can expand.
“The empirical record shows that small-scale modular technologies are adopted more quickly than large-scale technologies. Electrolyzers are also modular and thus could grow at fast rates,” Odenweller told pv magazine. “However, hydrogen infrastructure is chunky, material-intensive, and labor-intensive, making it less amenable to rapid learning and adoption.”
The researchers suggest that policymakers should include subsidies such as co-financing capital expenditures for electrolyzers on the supply side, while subsidizing operating expenditures of industrial processes on the demand side. Odenweller mentioned carbon contracts for differences (CCfDs) as an example. He warned that investments should prioritize hydrogen in those end-use applications where direct electrification is infeasible.
In terms of additional policies, the researchers consider the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism as a potentially helpful instrument.
“The CBAM should be adjusted such that hydrogen, and derived fuels such as ammonia, are included with all upstream emissions,” they said.
