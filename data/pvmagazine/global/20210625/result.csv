https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/jinkosolar-announces-perovskite-cell-technology-platform-promising-efficiencies-close-to-30/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 25, 2021",JinkoSolar announces perovskite cell technology platform promising efficiencies close to 30%,"“JinkoSolar's long-term commitment to R&D has enabled it to continue to launch industry leading products. We have also completed the construction of a high-efficiency laminated perovskite cell technology platform that is expected to reach a breakthrough cell conversion efficiency of over 30% within the year.”
This statement was given by Chinese module maker JinkoSolar in its financial statement for the first quarter of 2021, in which no further details were provided on the in-house development of perovskite cells. The Chinese manufacturer in July 2017 signed a non-exclusive memorandum of understanding with Australia-based Greatcell, formerly Dyesol, to jointly explore commercialization opportunities of Greatcell's perovskite cell technology.
In the period from January to March, JinkoSolar posted a 6.4% decrease in turnover and a 21.7% decline in net profits in the first quarter of this year.
The company said it achieved first-quarter revenue of RMB7.94 billion ($1.21 billion) and a net result of RMB221.1 million ($33.7 million). The operating result decreased significantly from RMB732.7 million in the first three months of 2020 to RMB149.1 million in the latest quarter and the operating margin dropped year-on-year from 8.6% to 1.9%. The quarterly gross margin was 17.1%, which compares to 19.5% a year earlier.
“During the first quarter, the imbalance between polysilicon supply and strong downstream demand as well as many other factors continued to increase module prices on top of many factors, but we believe the impact on downstream customers is temporary,” JinkoSolar CEO Xiande Li stated. “The lower demand has kept the prices from rising; as the prices of polysilicon stabilize, downstream demand is expected to resume in the second half of the year, with the present polysilicon supply chain sufficient to support 160 GW of installations this year and 210 GW of installations in 2022.”
The manufacturer was able to increase total shipments 33.7% year-on-year to 5.35 GW and expects its annual wafer, cell and module production capacity to reach 30 GW, 24 GW and 33 GW, respectively, by the end of this year.
For the second quarter of the fiscal year, the company expects to ship between 5.1 GW to 5.3 GW of PV products, while for full-year the shipment outlook is between 25 GW and 30 GW. “We are well positioned to navigate through supply chain volatility and continue to manage market risks by fine-tuning our operations and shipment deliveries in 2021,” it explained.

Independent power producers will develop the facilities under the World Bank’s Scaling Solar program. Interested developers will have until Sept. 6 to prequalify for the procurement exercise.
The Côte d’Ivoire government and the World Bank's International Finance Corp. arm signed an agreement for the two projects in November 2018.
Several other utility-scale PV projects are now under development in Côte d’Ivoire, including 66 MW and 25 MW plants in Korhogo, in the northern Poro region. Developers are also working on a 37.5 MW solar project in Boundiali department, in the northwestern part of the country.
Côte d’Ivoire had just 13 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

The company said in a statement it wants to invest RMB 11 million (around $1.71 billion) in the new manufacturing facility and that it expects to begin construction “soon.” The Triumph Group is also the controlling shareholder of state-owned manufacturer Luoyang Glass.
The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China’s Shaanxi Province released a new draft regulation for the deployment of PV in 2021.  According to the new provisions, all future systems will have to integrate some battery storage to stabilize power injection. The storage system will have to be able to store and provide electricity for at least two hours and will have to feature a 10-year lifecycle with 5,000 charge and discharge cycles.
Monocrystalline module producer Longi has held its wafer prices for July. The price for p-type M6 products, measuring 166/223mm and with a thickness of 175um, is RMB4.89 (US$0.75) per piece and the price for p-type G1 (158.75/223mm and 175um) is RMB4.79 per piece. P-type M10 products, measuring 182/247mm and with a thickness of 175um will cost RMB5.87. All prices remained unchanged from the previous release.
A light-on-detail statement published on the website of the Africa Solar Industry Association on Tuesday claimed JinkoSolar will supply 2.6 MW of its panels to SGCC – which pv magazine believes to be the State Grid Corp of China – after the state-owned energy company won a second stage bid to install seven mini grids in towns and villages in Ethiopia under the World Bank-funded Lighting Africa program. The statement said Jinko had supplied 1 MW of products to SGCC for the first stage of the program, with the sites owned by the Ethiopian Power Distribution Company. The statement claimed the first round of sites, which were installed by April, were the “first off-grid PV project in East Africa” and the “first demonstration project of the World Bank’s Lighting Africa program.” However, the Lighting Africa website states the initiative was launched in Kenya in 2009.

The projects are planned for unspecified locations in central and southern Iraq. Masdar will act as an independent power producer under the framework of Iraq's Investment Law 13/2006.
“The project is one of the largest renewable photovoltaic solar projects in the Middle East, and falls within the vision of Iraq’s sustainable transition plan 2021- 2030,” said Suha Al-Najar, president of the National Investment Commission. The project delivers 2 GW of green energy for Iraq's national network.
More financial or technical details on the scheme were not provided.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Iraq has an installed PV capacity of only 216 MW despite a huge solar potential. No additional solar power has been deployed in the country in the past three years. In 2017, Iraq’s installed, mainly fossil-fuel based power generation capacity stood at around 11.3 GW versus demand estimated at 17 GW.
The Ministry of Electricity began procurement of seven PV power projects with a combined capacity of 755 MW in May 2019. The results of this tender are expected to be announced this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/co2-pricing-may-prevent-cannibalization-effect-of-wind-and-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 25, 2021",CO2 pricing may prevent cannibalization effect of wind and solar,"Policy interventions will be crucial for ensuring that the market value of solar and wind will not decrease significantly in the future and CO2 pricing is the best available tool to ensure that they will not end up cannibalizing their own revenues.
These are the main conclusions of a study conducted by researchers from the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and the Technische Universität Berlin in Germany, in which its authors claim that, if CO2 prices are used as policy incentives for solar and wind instead of common renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs or feed-in premium payments, both renewable energy sources may maintain a sufficient market value to keep attracting investments. “We demonstrate that this holds in a power system model even at a penetration of solar and wind above 80%, which is much higher than is usually considered in the market value literature,” the scientists stated.
In their view, the conventional incentive policies tend to depress market prices, as they offer compensation outside of the market, while CO2 price policies do exactly the opposite, as they encourage low-emission generators to participate in the market, especially when power plants based on fossil-fuel generators are operating. “For the CO2 policy, consumers pay more than the generation cost, since they must also pay for CO2 emissions according to the prevailing CO2 price,” the Swedish-German group emphasized. “Both the costs of the variable renewable energy subsidies and the revenues from the CO2 tax can be passed on to consumers, so that consumers only pay the average system cost in the end, thereby evening out the difference between the policy regimes from the consumers' perspective.”
In order to prevent the materialization of a cannibalization and zero profit scenario, and to reduce curtailment of renewables, flexibility options should be introduced in the energy systems. These include the deployment of new grid capacity, battery storage and green hydrogen, the cost of which should be included in a total system cost perspective, which the researchers consider a better approach than considering only the LCOE of the single renewable energy technologies to assess the potential loss of market value of renewables.
The academics described the declining market value of renewable energy power generation assets as a side effect of a technology-specific support policy and said that the total system cost approach offers the advantage of calculating this value regardless of the individual market structure. “By showing the strong dependence of market value on policy choice, we have thus resolved the apparent contradiction between the literature showing market value decline with penetration under support policies, and the literature showing that high penetrations of VRE can be cost-effective under CO2 policies,” they concluded.
Their model is presented in the paper “Decreasing market value of variable renewables can be avoided by policy action,” published in Energy Economics.

The legislation would provide a five-year authorization that strengthens the US Department of Energy’s focus on hydrogen. Senator Heinrich said that New Mexico could become the nation’s center of excellence for clean hydrogen.
Canada-based provider of clean energy solutions Xebec Adsorption announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary HyGear has commissioned an on-site hydrogen generation system for Tayras’ used lubricant oil re-refinery in Turkey. “Approximately 560 kg of hydrogen per day (205 tons per year) will be delivered under 125 bar by the fully automated system under a 15-year gas-as-a-service contract. Tayras’ facility is the first of its kind in the country and will be key to developing Turkey’s circular economy and reducing emissions from API Group II base lubricating oils,” reads a note released by Xebec on Wednesday.
HeidelbergCement and Norwegian agricultural cooperative Felleskjøpet chose Norway’s hydropower company Statkraft and Norwegian utility company Skagerak Energi as suppliers of green hydrogen for a zero-emission bulk ship. HeidelbergCement and Felleskjøpet are jointly working on the Green Shipping Program, aimed at transporting grain from Eastern Norway to Western Norway and rock/gravel on the way back. “This contract is an important milestone in our efforts to establish Statkraft as a leading hydrogen producer in Norway and Sweden and fits well with the series of other initiatives we have on hydrogen for sea and land transport,” Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal, executive vice president at Statkraft, commented. The Norwegian government has recently presented its hydrogen plans, which include the establishment of five hydrogen hubs within maritime transport. “Establishing hydrogen production for this freight route in the Oslofjord area can form the basis for such a hub.” The companies want to make an investment decision by the summer of 2022 and start deliveries in late 2023.
Landsvirkjun, the National Power Company of Iceland, and the Port of Rotterdam have completed a pre-feasability study about exporting green hydrogen from Iceland to Rotterdam. “The results indicate that such a project could be technically feasible, financially attractive and would have a significant contribution to the fight against climate change as economies around the world will switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the coming decades,” reads the note released earlier this month. The study shows that the first such project could be realized in the second half of this decade, totaling between 2 and 4 TWh (some 200 to 500 MW).
The Swedish Energy Agency has allocated €30 million to Project Air, an industrial concept to produce methanol from a large variety of recovered end-of-life streams and hydrogen from electrolysis. “The plan is to create the first-of-a-kind, large-scale, commercial, sustainable methanol plant that uses a carbon capture and utilization (CCU) process for converting CO2, residue streams, renewable hydrogen and biomethane to methanol. The renewable hydrogen will be produced in a new electrolysis plant, which will be the world’s largest hydrogen electrolysis unit installed for production in the chemical sector,” reads a note released on Wednesday. The project is carried out by Malmö-based chemical group Perstorp in cooperation with German energy company Uniper and Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum.
The Aberdeen City Council in the United Kingdom announced it is looking for a new joint venture partner to build a hydrogen hub in the city, “which will be Scotland’s first commercially scalable, investable hydrogen production site.” The new partnership will build on the city’s hydrogen projects, including a fleet of hydrogen-powered buses, public-sector vehicles, and waste trucks. “Aberdeen is already recognized as a pioneering hydrogen city and creating this strategic partnership will be a crucial step in realizing our ambitions for Aberdeen to become a global leader in hydrogen,” Aberdeen City Council Leader Councillor Jenny Laing said Wednesday.
UK-based green hydrogen energy services company Protium announced the opening of Protium Scotland. After two years in business, the company is expanding its client engagement team, employing experts who also hold decision-making roles in associations and institutions committed to the UK’s green economy. “The team will play an influential role in championing hydrogen and its place in the green economy,” the company said in statement Thursday. Protium said its CAPEX totals more than £1 billion for projects across the aviation, road transport, alcoholic manufacturing and food and beverage sectors.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/strong-growth-predicted-for-middle-eastern-solar-pv/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,KUWAIT,MIDDLE EAST,OMAN,SAUDI ARABIA,TURKEY,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES",,"JUNE 25, 2021",Strong growth predicted for Middle Eastern solar PV,"Oil-dependent markets in the Middle East have a strong incentive to diversify their economies and have all set ambitious renewable energy goals. If they are to be realized, the region will have to deploy more than 50 GW of solar PV by 2030.
The development of PV has also been driven by public sector support. Even though the industry experienced a slowdown during the global Covid-19 pandemic, solar energy is once again at the heart of economic recovery efforts. Oil prices are now back at a higher level and supply chain issues are not as severe.
In this article, we profile the large PV markets in the Middle East that are expected to lead the region in solar PV deployment.
The UAE has been at the forefront of the clean energy transition in the Gulf region in terms of PV deployment and ambitious renewable targets. The Emirates aims to generate 50% of its electricity from carbon-free sources, driven mainly by solar PV, by 2050. Abu Dhabi, for instance, plans to install 5.6 GW of PV capacity by 2026 and Dubai aims to source 75% of its electricity generation from renewables by 2050.
Both have been the frontrunners of the Middle Eastern PV industry. Abu Dhabi hosts the world’s largest operational PV plant, the 1.2 GW Noor Sweihan project, which has been feeding electricity into the grid since 2019. The plant is backed by Marubeni and JinkoSolar and has a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with a tariff of 2.94 USDct/kWh.
Another giant project, the 2 GW Al Dhafra plant, is expected to be operational by Q1 2022. This private public partnership project will be 60% owned by the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) and 40% owned by a consortium comprised of EDF, Masdar, and Jinko Solar. A 30-year PPA will be in place with a tariff of 1.35 USDct/kWh.
Utility-scale PV installations in Dubai are clustered in the giant Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park (MBR solar park), the development of which is planned over several phases. Once fully complete, this mega solar park will reach 5 GW in capacity. The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) holds the majority equity share in the project. Each phase sees a growing installed capacity with declining tariffs.
The fourth phase will include a large share of concentrated solar power (CSP). There is also interest from the northern Emirates to become involved with Etihad Water and Electricity having set targets of executing 100 MW of solar PV projects. No further details have yet been revealed, however.
As the level of solar penetration increases in the grid, we expect regulations to expand allowing for small-scale, behind-the-meter storage in association with time-of-day tariffs. Utility-scale tenders mandating a specific size of storage to allow for power plant ramp up and ramp down in coherence with other generation assets are expected. Such regulations would allow for better use of the distributed energy sources that exist on the grid and enable the economical and reliable operation of the electrical network with mixed generation assets working side by side.
In 2019, Saudi Arabia dramatically increased its 2023 renewable energy targets from 9.5 GW to 27.3 GW under its National Renewable Energy Program (NREP). This program divides the 27.3 GW goal into 20 GW of solar PV and 7.3 GW of wind. In addition, the Vision 2030 program sets another ambitious target of 60 GW of renewable electricity capacity by 2030 that will include 40 GW of PV and 2.7 GW of CSP capacity, and the sourcing of 50% of electricity generation from renewable technologies.
The bulk of the target capacity is expected to be reached via large-scale tenders and other mega projects such as NEOM, a sustainable zone in northwest Saudi Arabia that is planned as the hub for the Saudi green economy and a landmark for sustainability.
Last year, however, was a slow one for the Kingdom in terms of PV deployment where almost no capacity increases materialized. Following this stall in the industry, the crown prince announced the signing of PPAs for seven PV projects – six of which were from the delayed second round of REPDO (Renewable Energy Development Office) tenders. REPDO has most recently announced the shortlisted bidders for the projects but has not reported any further developments so far. With the addition of the ACWA Power-led 1.5 GW Sudair project, these seven projects will contribute almost 3 GW of solar PV installations.
NREP maps out two main paths for increasing the installed PV capacity: tenders and direct agreements. 30% of the target capacity is expected to be awarded via tenders by REPDO. The Kingdom’s first large-scale PV project (the 300 MW Sakaka) for instance, was awarded a 25-year PPA from the first round of the tenders in 2018.
Most recently, REPDO received bids for the third round for four projects with a total capacity of 1.2 GW. NREP also includes direct bilateral agreements with developers and the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to develop and build large PV projects. The 1.5 GW Sudair project is an example of such projects and many more are expected in the future. Direct agreement projects will make up 70% of the targeted capacity.
Although PV development in the Kingdom has been entirely driven by utility-scale projects, rooftop PV also has large potential. Currently, 50% of the electricity consumption in Saudi Arabia is from the residential sector, with 70% of this used for cooling requirements. This creates an excellent match between electricity consumption and PV generation.
In 2020, Saudi Arabia enacted a law allowing the installation of rooftop systems of up to 2 MW in size. This ushers in a potential gigawatt‑scale market with the right legislative environment.
Oman has set the target of sourcing 11% of electricity from renewables by 2023, and 30% by 2030. Even though it is one of the countries with the highest solar densities in the region, it has only very recently joined the solar PV world. Its installed capacity is expected to rapidly increase through bilateral agreements and solar tenders run by the Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP).
Oman’s first utility‑scale PV project will be the 500 MW Ibri II PV plant. This project is close to completion and is being developed on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis by ACWA Power (50%), Gulf Investment Corporation (40%) and Alternative Energy Projects Co. (10%) with a 15-year PPA for an undisclosed amount.
This year should see the tendering of two large PV projects in Oman – bids were submitted for the Manah I & II projects, both of which will have a capacity of 500–600 MW. A shortlist of nine companies has been revealed with OWPW awarding each project to a separate developer.
In the north of the Gulf, Kuwait has so far struggled to implement its PV plans but is now showing efforts to revive the market in the country. Kuwait aims to have 15% of its installed electricity generation capacity coming from renewable sources by 2030. Like the other countries in the region, PV development is dependent on the public sector.
Similar to Dubai’s MBR solar park, Kuwait plans to install PV in the Shagaya Solar Park. The first phase of the park successfully deployed 70 MW of power generation capacity (50 MW CSP, 10 MW PV, 10 MW onshore wind) in 2012.
The much larger second phase, the Al Dibdibah project, was initially set to comprise mostly CSP but was later changed to just PV. The first bids were received in 2019. However, the tender was cancelled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The latest plan is to revive the project, but no official declaration has been made yet. Phase three with mixed technology, known as Al Abrag, is expected to be tendered in several packages. The anticipated capacity is 1,200 MW of PV, 200 MW of CSP and 100 MW of wind.
Kuwait is reviewing a plan to reduce government subsidies for electricity tariffs and has independent institutional programs to encourage rooftop solar, which is now required on all government buildings thus spurring a market for small‑scale solar contracting.
Schemes and regulations for small-scale solar rooftop are being reviewed though the impact and uptake of such schemes will be limited without tariff subsidy removal. It is expected that the delay in the Kuwaiti solar market will soon end, with the country trying to catch up on its renewables targets and keep up with the other GCC countries.
Unlike the Gulf countries, Turkey has the opposite motivation to ramp up its renewable efforts. The considerable impact of energy imports on the nation’s current account deficit has directed Turkey to look for ways to generate electricity using domestic sources.
To diversify the imported natural gas dependent energy mix, Turkey provided subsidies for the development of renewable energy. So far, the total installed PV capacity is around 7 GW. The country is aiming to increase the share of renewables within the overall energy consumption to 20.5% by 2023.
The earliest driver for the development of PV was the YEKDEM support scheme established in 2011. Legislation awarded the lucrative 13.3 USDct/kWh purchase tariff for 10 years for all unlicensed PV systems under 1 MW that could obtain a connection permit from the grid operator.
However, the legislation also intentionally allowed for the development of sites next to each other and this led to many collective projects in the range of 5-10 MW that are legally many separate entities with 1 MW capacity, but a single PV plant in reality. This type of unlicensed project development is set to stay as the most common way in the country until the grid connection points are exhausted.
The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources increased the eligible capacity without a license to 5 MW but decreased the support to 32 kurus/kWh (~3.7 USDct/kWh).
Turkey’s first large tender for solar PV, YEKA GES-1, was held in 2017. Turkish Kalyon Enerji and Korean Hanwha consortium (Hanwha has since left) has been awarded the right to build a 1 GW PV plant in Karapinar at a 6.99 USDct/kWh tariff with a 15-year PPA. As one of the tender conditions, PV panel manufacturing must be established in Turkey and the components locally sourced. The Karapinar project is currently generating electricity at 20% capacity and is expected to be fully functional by the end of 2022.
Turkey cancelled the YEKA GES-2 project, which had an identical structure to the previous tender and instead opted for a different tendering structure for the next PV tender, YEKA GES-3 or Mini YEKA. Instead of a large single site, 74 sites are being tendered separately for a total capacity of 1 GW. Each site has a capacity of either 10, 15, or 20 MW.
After being delayed multiple times due to Covid-19, projects are being awarded in the highly oversubscribed tender in Q2 2021 with the lowest bid being 18.2 kurus/kWh (~2.08 USDct/kWh). Projects will receive a 15-year PPA and be subject to a 70% local content requirement for the PV modules used.

Many of these approaches have focused on using additives that affect the formation of the perovskite layer. Experimenting with these has produced encouraging results, and understanding of the role of defects and how to engineer them is improving with each one.
A group of scientists led by Switzerland’s École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) worked with a class of materials called crown ethers, and was able to fabricate perovskite solar cells that achieved better than 24% efficiency, and retained more than 95% of this initial performance after 500 hours continuous operation without encapsulations. Control cells dropped to 80% of the initial value after 300 hours. The cells are described in full in the paper Multimodal host–guest complexation for efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics, published in Nature Communications.
The group attributes the strong performance to a “multimodal host-guest complexation strategy”, further explaining that crown ether material (dibenzo-21-crown-7) serves to infuse cesium ions into the perovskite film without damaging it. “This strategy was found to substantially decrease defects and improve the morphology of perovskite films without significant change in the optoelectronic properties, resulting in high performance and stability,” the group explained.
The crown ether was shown to improve the quality of the film both on the surface and deeper with the material. “We use this multimodal host–guest-complexation to modulate the surface of the perovskite films as well as their bulk composition at the same time,” said EPFL researcher Jovana Milić.
Films treated with the crown ether also remained stable in air for 380 days, while a control film had degraded completely after five days. The group also experimented with accelerated aging tests, finding that the cells retained better than 90% of their performance after 300 hours at 85 degrees Celsius.
As an added bonus, the crown ether was also shown to bind lead ions into the film – demonstrated by submersing it in water and measuring lead content. EPFL states that the cells would release less lead into environment than other cells, and that it expects this effect to increase with higher concentrations of the crown ether.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/huaweis-president-of-smart-pv-on-solar-digitization-and-its-new-pv-storage-solutions/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"JUNE 25, 2021",Huawei’s president of Smart PV on solar digitization and its new PV storage solutions,"
Chen Guoguang, President of Smart PV, Huawei: Huawei brought its new generation All-Scenario FusionSolar + Storage Solution to this year’s SNEC. It is a “5+4+1” solution. The “5” means five core Huawei technologies, including watt technology, thermal technology, storage technology, cloud technology, and AI technology, which help to combine the flows of energy and information. The “4” refers to four major application scenarios, including the Smart PV Generator for utility scale solar, residential green power, industrial green power, and off-grid fuel-removal power supply. Finally, the “1” refers to Huawei’s energy cloud, which will integrate power generation, energy storage, and consumption load with help of AI management.
Huawei aims to promote these new technologies to contribute to the energy structure reform from conventional energy to a renewable energy system, and to help China and other countries achieve their carbon emission and carbon neutrality targets.
Yes. We think there are four essential elements in the building up of a renewable energy system. The first is a high proportion of renewable energy, including the replacement of conventional energy by wind, solar, and storage in the power generation sector. The second is the popularization of electrification on the user side, including electric transportation and electric vehicles. The third is wider utilization of electronics in the electricity power system, and more interaction between power generation, the grid, and electricity users. The fourth is the digitalization and intellectualization of the energy system which can manage massive nodes in the energy internet, including solar PV plants, storage, electric vehicles, and millions of applications. And this point is the core of the system: to ensure its function and security.
FusionSolar was initially designed to reduce system costs and improve total efficiencies. At the early stages, Huawei focused on lower levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) and easy operations and maintenance (O&M) for grid connected, ground-mounted PV plants. However, with the rapid cost reduction over the past years, solar power has achieved economic competitiveness compared to other energy. Our new generation FusionSolar is thus focusing on how to reduce the volatility of solar power by better controlled integration of PV and storage.
For example, we presented the Smart PV Power Generator concept, which aims to not only reduce system costs, but also make PV power systems generate stabilized power, like traditional hydro and coal power. This will help PV to be a popular power source and connect to the grid on a worldwide scale.
Huawei has the All-Scenario FusionSolar solution, and we aim to target all sectors with this, from utility-scale PV, off-grid systems, and commercial and industrial (C&I) to residential rooftop PV.
We think BIPV is a promising market. However, from my experience of visiting over 100 countries and observing their PV markets, I want to emphasize the importance of safety. I think this is a key factor for inverter products in the BIPV field; they must be guaranteed by reliable technology, and rapid shutdown is essential. I want to urge all PV inverter manufacturers to pay attention to this point when marketing and selling BIPV inverters, because the whole market development will be easily hurt or even suspended by fires or explosions if inverters are lacking safety specifications.
We have planned for around 100 GW of inverter capacity in 2021. We benefit from production automation, and have plenty of production elasticity, which makes our capacity flexible to market needs.
We aim to ship 60 GW of inverters this year. However, based on the past few months and the booming market, we will probably exceed this figure by the end of the year. For storage, our target is 3 GWh worth of sales in 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/new-three-phase-hybrid-inverter-series-from-sunways/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 25, 2021",New three-phase hybrid inverter series from Sunways,"China-based inverter maker Sunways has unveiled a new hybrid inverter series for residential and commercial PV projects.
The device is available in six power classes, ranging from 4 kW to 12 kW and has a DC input voltage range of 1,000 V.
The inverter measures 550 x 410 x 175mm and weighs between 26 and 28 kg. It offers a reported efficiency of between 98.1% and 98.2% and a European efficiency of 97.3% for the smallest device and 97.4% for the biggest.
The product comes with two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs while its MPPT range is 150-850 V. Its maximum input current (DC) is 13 A and the maximum short circuit current is 18 A. It is equipped with IP65 protection, natural convection cooling, and can be used in projects at altitudes of up to 4,000 meters and with temperatures ranging from -30 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius.
The inverter incorporates a lithium-ion battery with a voltage range of 180-750 V and a maximum charge/discharge current of 25 A.
According to the manufacturer, the inverter backup port can be connected to inductive loads such as air conditioners, hairdryers or water pumps. The device can provide uninterrupted power supply (UPS) in case of power outages. If there is a main grid failure, the inverter will automatically switch to back-up mode within 10 ms and the essential loads connected in the back-up side won't be disturbed, the company added.
Sunways also emphasized that the hybrid inverter offers multiple connections with a maximum of 10 units in parallel to expand the AC output power and battery capacity to make it usable in commercial projects. “If the power export limitation function in the STH hybrid inverter is on, the inverter will output power according to the load consumption in each phase,” the manufacturer explained. “If there’s surplus power trying to export to the grid, the inverter will charge the battery before derating the power inputted from PV to balance the input and the output power.”
*The article was amended on June 28 to reflect that the inverter is available in six power classes and not five, as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/india-could-add-13-75-gw-of-pv-module-capacity-by-late-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 25, 2021",India could add 13.75 GW of PV module capacity by late 2022,"From pv magazine India
JMK Research says in a newly published report that India could create 13.75 GW of solar module production capacity and 6.9 GW of cell output over the next 18 months.
Module manufacturers with 1 GW+ capacity have proposed cumulative capacity additions of 9 GW of modules and 6.4 GW of cells. This also includes Vikram Solar’s plan to set up a 3 GW fab for modules, cells and wafers in Tamil Nadu over the next four to five years.
Two key manufacturers have already achieved a certain degree of expansion recently. In April, Tata Power Solar expanded its cell manufacturing capacity. Earlier this month, Premier Energies also expanded its module manufacturing capacity from 500 MW to 1.25 GW with the addition of 750 MW of cell capacity. 
JMK Research said Indian manufacturers are upgrading their capabilities to meet domestic and foreign demand for higher-efficiency modules. Mono-PERC tech is rapidly gaining prominence over multicrystalline modules, with the domestic utility-scale solar market expected to entirely shift to mono-PERC by December of this year.
Wafers are also becoming bigger. This is already being felt in the domestic rooftop solar segment, which is moving toward bigger and bifacial modules.
“M6 wafer-based modules are expected to become mainstream in new domestic rooftop solar capacity additions soon. Also, domestic manufacturing capacity for bifacial modules is expanding as manufacturers foresee high growth potential in demand for these modules, especially from the residential rooftop market,” said JMK. 
The new capacity announcements follow the government's introduction of the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) and a Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to reduce solar import dependence and scale domestic manufacturing capabilities. India meets more than 80% of its solar module demand through imports from other Asian countries such as China, Vietnam, and Malaysia. In 2020, the nation imported $1,527 million worth of solar cells and modules. 
India’s ambitious installation target of an additional 280 GW of solar by 2030, along with its high dependence on solar imports, calls for the rapid development of the domestic PV manufacturing industry, which currently has 16 GW of cumulative module capacity. The manufacturing capacity for polysilicon, ingots, and wafers is non-existent, primarily due to high production costs. However, the lack of scale and integration of PV manufacturing has been a critical barrier to India’s solar program.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/lead-halide-perovskite-cell-based-on-benzodithiophene-cation-achieves-14-7-efficiency/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 25, 2021",Lead halide perovskite cell based on benzodithiophene cation achieves 14.7% efficiency,"Researchers at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) have built a lead halide perovskite solar cell incorporating an organic cation based on benzodithiophene (BDT), a polymer that shows notable electron donor properties due to its electron-rich π-conjugation system.
“Given that the bandgap energy of the quasi-layered based cells is tunable, we can imagine these devices for use in a wide variety of applications, such as for indoor use and as top cells in tandem devices,” research co-author Kevin Sivula told pv magazine. “Our devices have production costs very similar to the standard lead halide perovskites solar cells and the cost of the benzodithiophene would be negligible with respect to the full device.”
BDT was combined with layered and quasi-layered lead iodide thin films based on Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskite, which is a kind of perovskite that is known for its excellent stability, and methylammonium (MA). “Benzodithiophene (BDT) is a widely successful planar conjugated building block in the field of organic semiconductors due to its excellent semiconducting properties and its ease of synthesis and functionalization,” the scientists explained, noting that it's the first time BDT is used as an alternative to phenylethylammonium (PEA) in cations for perovskite cells.

By preparing the BDT-based cations with different alkane linkers, the academics found that their length is crucial for the combination with layered lead halide perovskites (LLHPs). The cations were integrated with a standard cell with an n-i-p layout fabricated with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on mesoporous titanium oxide (TiO2), a hole transporting layer (HTL) made of Spiro-OMeTAD, and a top electrode based on gold (Au).
The performance of the cell was compared to that of a similar cell having PEA instead of BDT in the cation and the latter exhibited a power conversion efficiency that was 1.0% higher at 14.7%. This improvement was attributed by the scientists to improved short-circuit current and a slight increase of the fill factor. “Interestingly, despite the identical processing conditions, we observed a significantly different morphology of the active layer with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showing a considerably smaller grain size for the BDT-containing QLLHP active layers compared to PEA,” they emphasized.
Furthermore, the BDT-based device retained 64% of its original efficiency after 130 hours and the PEA-based cell only 31%. “The enhanced stability of the MBDT device is reasonably ascribed to an improved ability of the bulkier pi-conjugated BDT cation to suppress MA leakage from the main perovskite domains in the active layer,” the Swiss group stated.
The solar cell is presented in the paper “Benzodithiophene-Based Spacers for Layered and Quasi-Layered Lead Halide Perovskite Solar Cells,” published in Chemistry Europe.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/canberra-moves-forward-with-new-pv-module-recycling-rules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 25, 2021",Canberra moves forward with new PV module recycling rules,"From pv magazine Australia
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government has decided to investigate new recycling options and a product stewardship scheme for solar PV modules, inverters and batteries, after a motion was passed in the nation's legislative assembly earlier this week.
The motion calls for the ACT government to explore new recycling options for a range of electrical appliances, including solar PV modules, inverters and large batteries. The government will also be expected to produce a report outlining options and a timeline by February 2022.
Figures provided by the federal government show that 2,700 tons of solar PV waste was generated in Australia in 2018 as the earliest modules reached their end of life. By 2050, it is expected that figure will climb to 1,532,000 tons of PV waste per year.
The ACT government’s announcement came just hours after federal environment minister Sussan Ley told the solar industry that it needs to design and present a finalized industry-led product stewardship scheme by June 2022. She said waste from solar systems looms as an environmental disaster, and has said that the nationwide scheme must be operational by June 2023.
The program will also include an approach to deal with legacy panels. Ley said previous submissions from sections of the industry to set up a scheme have lacked a cohesive, coordinated and sustainable approach that looked beyond initial support from the government.
“Solar panels have languished on the government’s priority list for six years now. It is time for the industry to step up and address the issue of waste either stockpiling or ending up in landfill, and today I have given them a deadline of mid-2022 to do that,” she said.
Ley’s announcement triggered a swift response from the Clean Energy Council (CEC), which said it is “frustrated” with the federal government’s approach to solar module waste.
CEC Chief Executive Kane Thornton said that the peak body has worked to develop a plan to address this issue over the past year. But the federal government has walked away from coordinating a national approach to solar PV waste, he claimed. Another proposal put forward by the CEC to establish an industry-led and self-funded product stewardship program was also rejected, he added.
“Industry is prepared to lead and coordinate this initiative, but it also requires coordination and leadership from government given the significant regulatory interactions between the three tiers of government on environment and waste policy,” Thornton said. “We would welcome a joint approach from the federal government and we remain ready, willing and able to work in partnership with them on this significant issue.”
Industry has already made moves to address the issue, as the number of decommissioned modules mounts up. Victoria-based Lotus Energy, for example, has commenced recycling operations at its facility in Melbourne. And Sydney-based PV Industries has also started recycling solar modules and processing material.
In addition, the New South Wales government has made moves to address the challenge, allocating AUD 10 million ($7.6 million) for a two-stage grant funding scheme designed to keep end-of-life solar systems out of landfill.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/25/solar-101-the-brains-behind-the-beauty-of-your-solar-power-system/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 25, 2021",Solar 101: The brains behind the beauty of your solar power system,"From pv magazine USA
Even though solar panels get all the attention due to their good looks, it’s the inverters that hold all the brains behind your system. Our Solar 101 series offers everything you need to know.
Solar panels generate an electric current by collecting photons from sunlight to excite electrons, pushing them into a circuit. The inverter then converts the electric field from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) so that the electricity is compatible with your appliances and the electric grid.
Besides this basic function, residential inverters these days perform a few additional functions. Recent innovations allow inverters to maximize electricity generation in complex sunlight installations. And now, inverters can even tell you how each individual solar panel is performing.

The other function required of inverters in the United States – found in Article 690 of the National Electric Code – is “rapid shutdown.” This function guarantees that your solar panels are no longer exporting electricity when the inverter detects that the solar panel system has been shut down for any reason.
This protocol was put in place after a fire in New Jersey was allowed to burn because firefighters were unable to determine whether or not the solar panels on the warehouse were still live.
Two solar inverter manufacturers, Enphase and SolarEdge, now dominate the residential solar market, in part due to this rapid shutdown requirement.
While rapid shutdown technology is offered by other manufacturers, such as SMA, Tigo and newcomer Generac, they make up a smaller part of the market at 10-15% cumulatively.
The two dominant companies have very different inverter approaches – microinverters and optimizers – that meet the rapid shutdown requirements.
As mentioned earlier, the key feature of module-level power electronics – optimizers and microinverters – is that they maximize electricity generation on strings of solar panels that may receive different amounts of sunlight due to shade or because of the angle of the roof. These modules give your installation company significantly more flexibility when it comes to laying out your system.
Enphase offers microinverters, which are placed behind every solar panel on your rooftop. These units connect to other Enphase hardware to create a family of components that power your home.
Placing inverters behind your solar panels means that the electricity is immediately converted from DC into AC on your roof.
SolarEdge’s approach connects multiple panels to a central inverter with smart modules called “optimizers.” Instead of converting the electricity from DC to AC, these units constantly monitor and adjust for the maximum power point of each panel, keeping them at a consistent DC voltage while varying the current.
Solar panels are generally wired on a string in series. That means each panel depends on its neighbor to work.
Both micro-inverters and optimizers are designed to keep the solar system running even in the event of a panel failure. Before these “smart modules” were introduced, a single failure in a series of panels would knock out an entire string of 10 or more panels.
Enphase’s ability to keep a system running even after massive amounts of damage during a hurricane caught the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
One downside to this new technology, however, is that it adds an additional piece of electronics to every solar module.
A second issue is that additional modules require additional connections between your rooftop gear. Connections are typically where solar issues arise, whether between the solar panels and racking system (as noted in the linked hurricane article above), or among the electrical gear, as occurred when Tesla was sued by Walmart.

Inevitably, these electronic components have to do their job in harsh, hot, full sunlight conditions for decades on end. Thermal cycling and stress contributes to equipment failures, and can also loosen connections and mounts.
While microinverters and optimizers may cost a little more, they seem to pay for themselves. The extra components roughly double the price of a standard residential solar inverter. The increased price has been offset by broadly declining solar prices and increasing efficiencies of solar panels. Generally speaking, there is still a net premium for a microinverter system.

Because these components are still new to the market, their true long-term life cycle is unknown. Both manufacturers, SolarEdge and Enphase, offer 25-year warranties for their hardware. Both companies were founded in 2006, meaning their first modules are no more than 15 years old now.
Eventually, solar inverters on your home and business might run the power grid. So, take your time to research what works best for you, and your roof.
pv magazine USA’s favorite operations and maintenance contributor has sounded the alarm: paying close attention to these connections is imperative.
In a subsequent Solar 101 article, we focus on system operations and maintenance, and will talk about how to keep these connections safe over the decades they need to run.

It has revealed that it will invest around $10 billion over 15 years in a new solar PV cell and module manufacturing hub in Malaysia.
It said on Thursday that it will now build a new 3 GW manufacturing facility in Kedah, in northwestern Malaysia. It has previously revealed plans to establish a 2 GW renewable energy portfolio in Australia.
Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali, Malaysia’s minister of international trade and industry, said that Risen Energy had secured a manufacturer’s license under the country’s national economic recovery plan. This enables it to design, develop and manufacture high-efficiency solar PV cells and modules.
“The facility’s construction at the Kulim Hi-Tech Park will be completed by the end of this year, while commercial activities are expected to begin in Q1 2022,” Azmin said. “This new facility will contribute an annual production capacity of 3 GW for the first five years.”
Risen Energy President Xie Jian said the new manufacturing hub would provide the company with a strategic location in the heart of Southeast Asia. It also has plans to establish a significant portfolio in Australia. It signed a deal with South Australia-based Green Gold Energy (GGE) earlier this year to jointly develop and construct 16 solar PV projects of approximately 4.95 MW each within the next two years.
Six of the projects have already reached the settlement phase. The total project capacity will be 80 MW and will help Risen Energy to achieve its goal of establishing a 2 GW renewable energy portfolio in Australia.
Xie said the new manufacturing hub would allow Risen Energy to increase its production capacity. He also noted that Malaysia’s investment environment offers good economic growth prospects.
“Malaysia has abundant raw materials, high quality of human resources and harmonious ethnic relations whereby people get along well. Most importantly, the strong support and service from the state and local governments,” he said.
Malaysia is already home to production bases for some of the world’s largest PV producers including JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Hanwha Q Cell and First Solar.
