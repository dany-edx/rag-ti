The newly launched Bila Solar has announced plans to open a solar module factory in Indianapolis, Indiana. It said it will produce 1 GW of glassless, frameless solar modules per year.
Bila Solar plans to renovate a facility spanning an area of 150,000 square feet (13,935 square meters) and expects to employ 240 people once the plant is fully operational. It said it will begin production in the summer of 2024.
“We’re bringing to the US market ultralight modules that go where traditional solar panels can’t go,” said Mick McDaniel, vice president and US general manager of Bila Solar. “In Indianapolis, we found a central urban location, a diverse workforce and an entrepreneurial spirit – ideal for our out-of-the-box approach to making clean energy attainable for all.”
The technology behind the modules was developed in collaboration with the advanced materials industry. McDaniel told pv magazine USA that replacing glass with specially formulated composites was inspired by the windows in airplanes, which are not made from glass, and are lightweight, transparent, strong, flexible, durable, and UV resistant.
“These same characteristics are excellent for solar panels, so why haven’t we used them yet?  The aerospace industry has figured out how and so our task was how to apply that to the PV industry in a cost effective way that met the needs of solar customers.” said McDaniel.
Bila Solar plans to produce 520 W 144 half-cell monocrystalline modules, with an efficiency of 19.3%. The modules measure 88.4 inches by 47.1 inches by 0.08 inches. Made of an aerospace polymer composite, the modules reportedly weighs 17 lbs (7.7 kg), which the company says is nearly 70% lighter than conventional glass-framed modules.

The light weight and thinness of the modules enable them to be deployed in various applications, including low load-bearing commercial and industrial roofs, waterproof membrane roofs, integration into vehicles for solar power, off-grid use and even on curved surfaces, the company said.
McDaniel said the Bila Solar modules pass the same durability tests as conventional glass panels, including IEC 61215:2016, IEC61730:2016, UL61730 (USA), PID, and salt mist “level 8” tests. He added that the modules have also undergone wind tunnel testing, damp heat, adhesion pull tests, flexibility stress tests and more. The modules come with a 12-year  product warranty and a 25-year linear power warranty.
Bila is far from alone in setting up solar manufacturing facilities in the United States. Earlier this month, the Solar Energy Industries Association reported that an additional 85 GW of module manufacturing was coming to the US, following passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes onshoring manufacturing across the solar supply chain. Site Selection Group assisted Bila Solar with procuring state and local incentives for this exciting project.
“Indiana’s entrepreneurial ecosystem is strong, and we’re excited to welcome Bila Solar to our growing network of innovators advancing products that power the world,” said Governor Eric J. Holcomb. “With Bila’s new Indianapolis manufacturing operation, Indiana’s skilled workforce will be making solar energy more accessible and powering our growing clean energy sector to new heights.”
With its factory planned for Indianapolis, Bila has also designated the city as the location for its US headquarters.

The site adjacent to Stanwell Power Station on Queensland’s mid-coast is now home to 10 iron flow batteries, with another 10 to follow suit shortly,* as the state government-owned energy company Stanwell Corp. prepares to transform its soon-to-be retiring coal plant to a AUD 100 million ($64 million) hub for renewable commercialisation testing, research, development and training.
The iron flow batteries use the technology of US-based Energy Storage Solutions, better known as ESS. Inc, for which local company Energy Storage Industries owns the Asia-Pacific licence. The pilot batteries are each 12 meters long and have a combined capacity of 1 MW/10 MWh. In its announcement, the Queensland government said the installation marks Australia’s first iron flow battery and the largest such installation in the world.
Energy Storage Industries (ESI) Managing Director Stuart Parry told pv magazine Australia the battery project is expected to be operational by September 2024. Once fully commissioned, Stanwell will acquire the flow battery, saying that it is aiming deliver service and maintenance on the pilot.
The iron flow battery deal is just one element of the transformation of Stanwell Power Station into the Stanwell Clean Energy Hub. This will include a AUD 100 million Future Energy and Innovation Training Hub (FEITH), described as a mall-sized “sandbox” for new technologies in wind, solar, hydrogen and battery storage.
Stanwell is also partnering with hydrogen electrolyzer technology company Hysata, a spinoff from research conducted at the University of Wollongong, which claims to have the world’s most efficient electrolysis cell. Stanwell’s Rockhampton hub will host 5 MW pilot project with Hysata’s electrolyzer technology to validate its commercialisation potential and technical performance. To that end, Stanwell will provide AUD 3 million and supply the site and facilities for the field deployment of the electrolyser at the site.
While news of the Stanwell coal plant’s transformation was only made Monday, work seems to have already began in the form of the battery delivery, and the government noted it will establish common infrastructure and civil works “in late 2023.”
The Stanwell hub is to be realised in stages, with the announcement flagging the AUD 100 million investment will be deployed over the next five years.
In early August, the Queensland government committed AUD 24 million to further evaluate and assess the capacity of flow battery technology to help the state meet its renewable energy targets. Of that funding, AUD 12 million went towards an iron flow battery from ESI.

When it comes to wildfire response, speed is important. German-headquartered Dryad Networks has released its Silvanet Wildfire Sensor to help detect wildfires within minutes, alerting first responders so they can take action to mitigate damage.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “wildfires and volcanic activities” affected 6.2 million people between 1998 and 2017, with 2,400 attributable deaths throughout the world from suffocation, injuries, and burns.
A recent University College London study showed that California’s 2018 wildfires alone cost the US economy $148.5 billion. Capital losses and health costs within California hit $59.9 billion, while indirect losses through economic disruption to 80 industry sectors within the state reached $42.7 billion. Power transmission was affected, as well as road and rail freight transport, pipelines, and other infrastructure-dependent sectors.
“Wildfires are responsible for up to 20% of global CO2 emissions,” said Carsten Brinkschulte, chief executive officer of Dryad Networks. “Unless the increasingly severe wildfires we experience every year – and which wreak havoc on our health and our economies – are given sufficient attention and investment, global temperatures will rise by more than 1.5 C.”
The sensors are small, off-grid plastic devices with a solar cell built into the surface as a power source. The device measures temperature, humidity and air pressure, and contains a low-power air quality sensor with a gas sensing mode. 
It can detect hydrogen, carbon monoxide and other gases that occur during early stages of pyrolysis at the at the ppm level. The sensors are typically mounted on trees at heights of 3 meters. Each device measures 19 cm by 8.2 cm and has a 6 cm by 6 cm solar panel on the surface. The enclosure is IP 67 rated and is weather and UV-proof.
The device is pre-built with artificial intelligence to reliably detect fire and avoid false positive alerts. The sensors connect to a gateway, and each gateway hosts about 100 sensors, depending on topography. LoRaWan wireless data transmission send data from the device to first responders.
Dryad Networks said the device can run maintenance-free for up to 15 years, requiring no batteries and avoiding the use of lithium and other toxic or rare materials. Energy is instead stored in supercapacitors.
The emissions caused by wildfires create a vicious cycle of a hotter, dryer climate in some regions, leading to more wildfires. Data from the UN Environment Program show that burned areas will increase by 62% if global temperatures increase by 2 degrees Celsius, and if the world heats three degrees, that figure rises to 97%.
What’s more, emissions from wildfires are often inaccurately reported or omitted altogether from nations’ carbon reports, written off as natural phenomena.
“With 80% of wildfires caused by humans, added to the fact that carbon neutrality is reliant on forest regrowth – which can take over 100 years – this means that omitting wildfire emissions from global CO2 inventories is inaccurate, and worse, it’s cynical,” said Brinkschulte.
Dryad estimates that deploying 120 million of its sensors worldwide by 2030 could save up to 3.9 million hectares of forest from burning and prevent 1.7 billion tons of CO2 emissions.

Ten scientists have projected the innovation pathways for the major PV cell technologies over the next five years, in an open-access article in Cell.
Although installed PV capacity worldwide exceeds 1 terawatt (1,000 GW), solar’s contribution to worldwide electricity generation remains small, the researchers said, at 5% to 6%. Given an “urgent need” to deploy PV at multi-terawatt scale over the next two decades to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, “PV device innovation takes on new urgency and impact.”
Continued research that leads to “even relatively small advances” in efficiency, reliability and manufacturing efficiency “will have major future impacts at multi-TW scale,” the researchers said, noting these factors combine to make “the increasingly compelling value proposition” for PV power generation.
While crystalline silicon PV had a 95% market share in 2022, in a “terawatt-scale future” with “PV everywhere,” multiple technologies may be complementary, or combined, they said.
The silicon PV technology known as TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivating contact), with a market share of 23%, will “overcome” production of PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) PV by 2025 and “is likely to become the technology of choice for new-cell manufacturing in the US,” the article predicts.
Crystalline silicon PV cells are approaching the single-junction theoretical maximum efficiency of 29.4%, they said.
Research is still needed, they note, to develop high-temperature, selective area passivating contacts on both sides of the PV cell (“advanced TOPCon”), to improve the transparency and conductivity of heterojunction technology (HJT) contacts (“advanced HJT”), and to combine the latest HJT or TOPCon technologies with an interdigitated back contact (IBC) structure, “which could reach an ultimate practical efficiency of 28% possibly as soon as 2025.”
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
Yet as the theoretical limit is approached, “several new modes of degradation, called carrier-induced degradation, and metastable defects are unveiled,” the reseachers said.
The industry “is working to reduce or eliminate” the use of scarce materials such as silver for the formation of grid lines and indium used in transparent conductive oxides, the authors say. Several PV companies and research laboratories have announced HJT PV cell design with reduced indium consumption “or even indium-free” HJT cells.

The latter is a recursive technique that is commonly utilized to extract the maximum power from the PV system. It works by breaking down the nonlinear control problem into a series of simpler subsystems. “IBC is a form of non-linear control system, which is modified using integral action to handle different real-life variations in PV arrays better,” the scientists explained.
The novel technique is also said to perform control of the voltage of the PV system's DC link voltage loop, as well as that of the grid's active/reactive power loops of the microgrid. It can also control the compensation of the harmonic currents of the network, the injection of the power of the battery into the grid, and the loop of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT).
Via the Matlab software, the scientists applied the novel approach to a microgrid-connected PV system equipped with battery energy storage and a three-phase multi-functional two-level voltage source inverter (MVSI). The MVSI is controlled by a non-linear direct power control (DPC) strategy, which is generally utilized for grid-connected voltage source converters, and space vector modulation (SVM), which is a common technique in field-oriented control for induction motors and permanent magnet synchronous motors.
They conducted a series of simulations over seven scenarios of micro-grid operation and compared the results achieved by the IBC technique with those achieved by classic BC control and the proportional-integral (PI) approach, which consists of a controller formed by combining proportional and integral control action.
They found that the IBC method was the most accurate in tracking the performance of the DC bus voltage. It also had better results regarding reactive power testing, dynamic response, and charge current ripples. Finally, it also performed better in reducing total harmonic distortion (THD) and fundamental amplitude values under specific scenarios.
“The numerical results reveal the better characteristic of the proposed system in terms of current quality for different conditions,” the researchers said. “At all levels, the IBC controller remains comparatively better than the BC and PI controllers.”
They introduced the new technique in the paper “Robust integral backstepping control microgrid connected photovoltaic System with battery energy storage through multifunctional voltage source inverter using direct power control SVM strategies,” published in Energy Reports. The research group comprises academics from the Brothers Mentouri University and the University of Bejaia in Algeria, as well as from the Nisantasi University in Turkey, and the University of the Antilles.

“The proposed solar panel cleaning system can be effortlessly integrated into both residential and commercial solar PV installations,” the research's lead author, Adeel Waqas, told pv magazine. “Designed to function autonomously, the system uses a microcontroller to manage the cleaning process, eliminating the need for manual intervention.”
The cleaning system consists of a 76.2 cm long bar of steel that is attached to the upper side of the solar module. It has eight flat-fan nozzles that provide a uniform flow of water through the panel's front side via a convex spray pattern. The fan nozzles are placed at a distance of 14 cm from each other and can achieve a water flow of 0.49 L/m. A 36 W DC water pump is used to bring water into the bar.
“After cleaning, the used water is collected and filtered using a Whatman filter,” Waqas explained. “This process allows for a water recovery efficiency of 85%, with the filtered water being recycled back into the system's tank. The water recovery feature makes this system especially beneficial for regions facing water scarcity.”
The scientists tested their new technique at an experimental setup at the NUST in Islamabad, Pakistan, during the months of January and February for three PV system tilt angles of 23, 33, and 43 degrees, respectively. “The electrical and temperature parameters were constantly monitored over 24 h, with 1 min intervals between each set of values,” they specified, noting that the performance of the system was compared to that of a reference setup without the cleaning tech.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the cleaned PV panel achieved up to 13.74% higher current at the set tilt angles compared to the reference panel. They also found that the water flowing onto the module was able to reduce its operating temperature by up to 0.8 C compared to the benchmark setup. “The automated cleaning system, operating for 5 min daily with pressured water through flat fan nozzles, recovers power loss due to soiling up to 80%,” they added.
According to Waqas, the cost of the Solar PV module with the cleaning system is $65.48, while that of the module without the system is around $35. “After performing the economic analysis, the cost recovered from additional power after cleaning is $0.0332 per day, resulting in a payback period of 2.51 years in Islamabad for additional cleaning system costs,” he further explained. “The operating cost of the system is negligible since it is automatically operated using an Arduino board; also, the economic feasibility of the proposed system is relatively viable since the cost of the system is recovered in a short time.”
The new technique was presented in the study “A building integrated solar PV surface-cleaning setup to optimize the electricity output of PV modules in a polluted atmosphere,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/29/arizona-approves-cut-to-compensation-rates-for-rooftop-pv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ARIZONA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 29, 2023",Arizona approves cut to compensation rates for rooftop PV,"From pv magazine USA
The Arizona Corporation Commission has voted to cut the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP), a metric that is used to determine the market value of exporting rooftop solar production to the grid. The commission voted to reduce the RCP by 10%, in line with a 2017 rule that capped value reductions at that level.
While the 10% reduction in exported solar harms rooftop solar customers, things may have ended up much worse. Arizona Corporation Commissioner Nick Myers filed an amendment that would cut net energy metering (NEM) rates to $0.053 per kWh, a reduction of 37%, which would have taken effect suddenly in September.
“The stability provided by the RCP is the fundamental reason solar has continued to thrive in Arizona. Stable, predictable rates give solar companies and consumers certainty about the future and the confidence to invest in their homes and businesses,” said Kate Bowman, interior west regulatory director for Vote Solar.
Vote Solar, a nonprofit advocating for equitable access to solar energy, filed comments on the RCP, emphasizing the need for a gradual approach to changes to let the market adapt. It said that utilities have not filed transparent, publicly available data to support their RCP ratemaking calculations.
The use of non-transparent internal utility data as the guideline for ratemaking is a problem that has been highlighted nationwide in similar such rulemaking battles. Investor-owned utilities appear to be digging moats around their business by squeezing out rooftop solar.
Vote Solar said Arizona’s RCP values put forth by utilities for 2023 have not undergone transparent scrutiny, potentially leading to unfavorable customer outcomes.
“Arizona families and businesses are facing rising energy prices, inflation, and high electricity bills following a summer of record-breaking heat,” said Bowman. “Rooftop solar is a solution that can help consumers take control of their energy costs, and any reductions to the RCP undermine the affordability of solar energy and hinder the expansion of solar adoption in the state.”
The proposed cuts to solar compensation rates are justified based on “cost-shift issues,” a utility-backed argument that non-solar customers were cross-subsidizing rooftop solar customers by increasing utility system costs. Utility Arizona Public Service (APS) provided data to the Corporation Commission claiming, “the magnitude of cost shift within the residential ratepayer class is within the range of $800 to $1000 per year.” This would amount to an $18 million cross-subsidization.
However, numerous studies by national labs and state groups have debunked utility claims of such a significant cost-shift. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that at current levels of rooftop solar adoption, the cost shift is negligible. At solar adoption rates of 10% of electricity generation mix or more, the cost shift was found to be a miniscule $0.005 per kWh.
While rooftop solar comes with many system-level benefits to efficiency and resource use, environmental footprint benefits, and social gain, the Arizona Corporation Commission has shown that these metrics are unimportant when evaluating the value of a good or service.
The Arizona Corporation Commission wrote it did not support “inclusion of societal and environmental factors and other externalities in valuing solar DG exports, which are speculative and inappropriate for ratemaking purposes.”
The adherence to a 10% reduction was a temporary win for rooftop solar, but the Arizona Corporation Commission stated it has interest in revisiting the foundations of Arizona’s solar compensation structures entirely. It is taking public input on the RCP prior to its October 11 meeting.
“Consumers and businesses rely on Commission decisions to make important decisions about their budgets and future investments, and dismantling the measured transition approach that the Commission initially championed creates destabilizing uncertainty,” said Vote Solar.

“The high temperatures achieved make the Amicus Altus especially useful as a direct low carbon replacement for gas boilers in buildings with high hot water demands without the need for a substantial remodeling of the heating and/or hot water systems,” the manufacturer said.
The Amicus Altus heat pump is fully cascadable, with outputs from 88 kW to 880 kW. It features a hot water storage capacity of 455 liters and uses propane (R290) as the refrigerant. Its total power input is 22 kW.
The manufacturer claims the new product has a coefficient of performance (COP) of up to 5.5 and a seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) of up to 3.95. The system can also operate in heating mode down to -20 C external air temperatures.
The heat pump measures 2,450 mm x 2,560 mm x 1,100 mm and weighs 835 kg.
“Air-to-water heat pumps are generally highly energy efficient, but the Altus also delivers hot water temperatures comparable to those end users are used to with conventional gas boilers,” said Product Engineer Steven Hunt. “Air-to-water heat pumps can be integrated into a variety of heating systems, which makes them a flexible option for different types of buildings and installations.”

The system will store renewable energy coming from unspecified wind and solar plants, the company said, noting that it will have a storage capacity of 2.5 MWh.
“The batteries supplied have been taken from prototype and engineering test vehicles, and JLR aims to supply enough batteries to store a total of 7.5 MWh of energy – enough to power 750 homes for a day – by the end of 2023,” the company said.  “After this point, more containers can be created to house additional second-life batteries removed from used production vehicles in the future.”
The I-PACE battery, developed in collaboration with Switzerland-based Pramac, has a storage capacity of 90.2 kWh. Weighing 610 kg and measuring 2,280 mm x 1474 mm x 300 mm, the battery has retained 70% to 80% of its original capacity, according to Jaguar Land Rover. The company emphasized that no extra manufacturing processes or battery module removal is necessary.
The company said that that every battery is linked to an inverter to optimize energy production.
“Its advanced engineering makes the I-PACE battery perfect for second-life, and even third-life, applications in low-energy situations once battery health falls below the stringent requirements of an electric vehicle,” Jaguar Land Rover stated. “Once the battery does finally come to the end of its usable life, it is 95% recyclable.”
