Working from that theory, researchers from the University of Oklahoma, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the University of North Texas examined techniques to test how conventional solar cells perform in space. They aimed to discover whether the same process would be appropriate for putting perovskite devices through their paces.
Not only did they discover the testing processes used for non-perovskite devices would not hold up with the alternative technology, they also found, in the words of one of the academics, that “the community in general is not testing them properly.”
In developing a set of perovskite-specific testing protocols for space use – published in the April 11 issue of Joule – the researchers found the perovskite cells lived up to their expectation of being able to withstand the sort of fierce radiation exposure they would face outside Earth's atmosphere. “But not for the reasons many believed,” according to University of Oklahoma physicist Ian Sellers, a co-author of the paper.
Rather than exposing the devices to high-energy particles, Sellers and his colleagues used lower-energy protons, which are prevalent in space and which could be halted in different parts of the perovskite cells.
The academics found perovskite devices are indeed “radiation hard” because they are soft and not very dense. While the radiation particles caused the cells to become disordered and damaged, the devices “will also very quickly settle, or heal, and go back to normal,” according to Sellers, who compared the process to water which has been disturbed returning to a still state.
The protocols developed by the academics, reported on EurekAlert this week, could pave the way for perovskite solar devices to be used in permanent installations on the moon, or even to be manufactured there. In addition, they could be deployed in intense radiation environments, such as Jupiter, and to power satellites in high-radiation polar orbits.
The research was led by Joseph Luther, senior scientist for chemical materials and nanoscience at NREL, in cooperation with former University of Oklahoma post-doctoral researcher Brandon Durant, now of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. They worked with NREL postdoc Ahmad Kirmani, NASA Glenn Research Center engineer Lyndsey McMillon-Brown, and Bibhudutta Rout, an associate professor in the department of physics at the University of North Texas at Denton.

“Our cell could be used in thin-film modules with potential applications in either ground-mounted and rooftop PV projects,” the research's corresponding author, Aadnan Hossain, told pv magazine. “SnS is earth-abundant, toxic-free, thermally stable, and cost-effective, and it has a suitable bandgap of around 1.3 eV and a high absorption coefficient of over 104 cm-1.”
The solar cell was designed with a molybdenum (Mo) layer, a hole transport layer (HTL) based on copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), a tin sulfide absorber, a buffer made of cadmium sulfide (CdS), a transparent conducting window layer made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and an aluminum (Al) back contact. In this cell configuration, the HTL is attached at the back of the SnS layer.
The proposed SnS-based PV device structure was analyzed via SCAPS-1D, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium.
“All the values were calculated and verified for different layers to make the cell stable and realistic commercially,” Hossain explained. “Moreover, thickness and doping density were kept low at the SnS absorber layer which reduces the fabrication and production cost.”
The scientists found that thicknesses of 0.1 μm, 1 μm, 0.05 μm, and 0.05 μm should be achieved for the Cu2O HTL, the SnS absorber, the CdS buffer, and FTO TCO, respectively. With these parameters, the cell should be able to reach a power conversion efficiency of 29.68%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.01 V, a short-circuit current of 34.19 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 85.74%.
“These results suggest that the p-type Cu2O material can be employed as a potential HTL in the SnS-based heterojunction solar cell,” the scientists said.
They presented their findings in “Performance analysis of SnS solar cell with a hole transport layer based on experimentally extracted device parameters,” which was recently published in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds.
“The cell we designed and proposed does not require highly sophisticated equipment but a simple solution process which makes the reliable commercial production at a higher rate,” Hossain concluded.

France's energy regulator, the Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie (CRE), has released the feed-in tariffs (FITs) for rooftop PV installations up to 500 kW in size for the second quarter of 2022.
The new tariff levels were published by French renewable energy association Enerplan.
The FITs are usually lowered quarter by quarter, according to the new capacity for which connection requests were received in the previous three-month period. This quarter, however, the tariffs were increased for all PV system categories, ranging from €181.40 ($190.90)/MWh for installations not exceeding 3 kW in size to €96.90/MWh for arrays ranging in capacity from 36 kW to 100 kW.
 
 
Different tariffs are applied depending on project size and location.  The new tariffs went into force on May 1. The tariffs were indexed to inflation. It is possible that the rates could be increased in the coming weeks.
*The article was updated on April 6 to reflect that the new tariff levels were published by French renewable energy association Enerplan.

A slide show presentation published by the German market research business to promote the 14th edition of its “Global PV InstallerMonitor” report appears to indicate strong positions for JA Solar and Chinese peer Longi among the product ranges offered to customers by Polish installers in 2021. It said 24.5% of Dutch professionals bought from JA Solar, the third-highest proportion.
Satisfaction ratings
The top brand among installers in the Netherlands in 2021 was LG, from whom 27.4% of professionals bought, ahead of Chinese brand DMEGC, with 25.5%. The Korean products also topped satisfaction ratings among French installers in 2021.
Other insights from the glimpse given into the report included the fact Chinese brand Trina Solar was dominant in more than 20% of installer portfolios in Austria and Switzerland in 2021. Israeli brand SolarEdge and French peer Schneider Electric topped the popularity stakes for inverters among Italian installers, while domestic mounting system manufacturer Schletter was carried by 38% of German installers, ahead of second-placed compatriot IBC Solar, whose products were stocked by 17% of German professionals.
The report, which skews toward residential installation data, was compiled from telephone questionnaires completed by more than 1,500 installers in 12 nations, plus the state of California. It asked interviewees about mounting systems for the first time and included 100 respondents from South Africa, in another first for 2022.
Without specifying brands, EUPD Research reported 34 of the South African respondents stocked only one type of mounting system; 19 offered only one storage product brand; 18 had module ranges exclusively supplied by one company; and 15 only had one type of inverter.
Interestingly, it estimated South Africa reached around 4 GW of cumulative solar generation capacity in 2021, a much lower figure than the 5.72 GW estimated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) in its most recent set of global statistics.
By contrast, EUPD Research estimated South Africa added 741 MW of solar during 2021, compared with the 231 MW figure supplied by Irena, which shows the nation passed the 4 GW mark for total solar capacity in 2018.

The Murchison Hydrogen Renewables project, under development near the Western Australian coastal town of Kalbarri, will use 5.2 GW of wind and solar to produce renewable hydrogen. That will then be converted to an estimated 2 million tons of green ammonia per annum, for domestic use and export.
The ambitious project was first proposed by Hydrogen Renewables Australia in 2019. The project is now being led by investment firm Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners via its Murchison Hydrogen Renewables (MHR) offshoot. While no specific details about the ambitious project were previously available, a referral filed this week with the state’s Environment Protection Authority (EPA) reveals the true scale of the project.
The submission shows that MHR plans to install about 1.5 GW of solar PV and an estimated 700 onshore wind turbines with a combined capacity of about 3.7 GW. A Power-to-X (PtX) plant will be constructed on site to convert the renewable energy into green hydrogen, which will be converted into an estimated 2 million tons of green ammonia per year.
The facility will be equipped with about 3 GW of electrolyzers while a purpose-built water treatment and desalination plant will generate about 6 giga-liters of “demineralised water” a year for use in the production process. The PtX plant will be coupled with 250 MW to 350 MW of battery storage with a two-hour duration that will be used to regulate the renewable energy prior to distribution to the electrolysers.
The proposal also includes hydrogen storage which will be used as an intermediary between electricity and ammonia. It is anticipated that up to 200 hydrogen storage vessels, each with a capacity of up to 680 tons, will be installed.
The green ammonia produced at the site is to be exported to emerging green energy markets with a pipeline to link the PtX plant and storage facility to a marine export facility. The submission also highlights the potential for local, domestic offtake as hydrogen or ammonia.
Hydrogen Renewables Australia has already secured a long-term agreement with the pastoral lessees of the Murchison House Station and announced Siemens as the proposed plant’s technology partner.
The project is expected to be developed in three stages. The first stage would comprise a demonstration phase producing hydrogen for transport fuels, to be followed by an expansion to blend with natural gas into the nearby Dampier to Bunbury pipeline. The third and final phase would include an expansion to produce hydrogen for export to Asian markets.
Hydrogen Renewables Australia has previously indicated the potential for the proposed project to scale up over a six-year period, reaching full capacity toward the end of this decade. The referral to the EPA is currently open to public comment until May 8.

The Japanese unit of French floating PV specialist Ciel & Terre is installing a floating solar plant at Hirakawa Elementary School in Japan's Kagoshima Prefecture, on the southern island of Kyushu.
The French company provided the floating solution. This project is the first of its kind, but it will be repeated in other Japanese municipalities with the support of ELM, an EPC and local developer.
In Japan, some schools and deteriorated outdoor swimming pools are no longer used. The deployment of floating solar would be an interesting new use for such infrastructure, said the companies.

Nearly 6,000 Japanese schools could be eligible to host a floating solar power plant. Ciel & Terre Japan said in a statement that the main challenge for these small PV installations will be to minimize system and transport costs.
“The advantage of installing floating solar panels on a swimming pool is that we can reuse existing pool facilities such as the fences around the pool and the changing room for the storage area. There is also no need to excavate the land due to the concrete poolside,” said Saori McMahon, developer and project manager at Ciel & Terre.

The US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has released a top 10 list of observations on co-located wind or solar-plus-storage (hybrid) projects.
LBNL is covering the topic due to rising deployment and interest in such hybrid facilities. Assuming that future project queues can be used to predict the number of actual hybrid power projects that will get built, hybrid systems already make up 42% of the future US potential for 675 GW of solar generation capacity. California’s solar queue, for all intents and purposes, is a solar-plus-storage queue, with its 95% coupling rate.

As of the end of 2021, 5.9 GW of solar was coupled with energy storage, along with 750 MW of wind-plus-solar-plus-storage. LBNL noted the exponential growth of this type of capacity, which is up 133% since the end of 2020.
The fundamental reason that solar-plus-storage works is that the price of batteries has come down to a point where it now makes financial sense. Battery pricing has declined by roughly 25%, from $40/MWh to $95/MWh of PV in 2017, to $30/MWh to $75/MWh of PV in 2021.
Second, and more importantly, LBNL modeled the revenues versus the costs of adding batteries to solar. They found that the value gained by adding energy storage to solar and wind exceeds the costs.
Taking into account the battery inverter versus solar plant inverter size, LBNL found that adding four hours of energy storage to a power purchase agreement (PPA) increased the price of that agreement pretty linearly. Considering the most popular ratio of solar vs. battery inverter capacities – 1 MW solar to 0.5 MW batteries providing four hours of storage – the addition of energy storage increases PPAs by $0.01/kWh.
LBNL also sees that there are financial penalties associated with the current techniques of coupling solar with energy storage. For instance, if the solar power is fully using the site’s interconnection at any point, the batteries cannot. Also, if the batteries must fully charge from the onsite solar to meet incentive requirements, that can be a penalty for hybrid systems, resulting in a slightly less financially efficient system.
In terms of financial incentives, the Federal Investment Tax Credit seems to be motivating hybridization. Without this incentive, it is believed that there would be more standalone energy storage.
Since California dominates the volumes of hybrid solar plants in the queues, it also heavily influences the averages. Leaving California’s four-hour heavy market (which is at least partially driven by an evening peak period that lasts four to five hours), the researchers found that California’s batteries tend to have shorter durations in most other markets.
The chart above models the value of energy being delivered by hybrid systems as more battery duration – from two to eight hours – is added to a facility in various power grid regions around the nation.
There is still a lot of learning going on with these technologies. For instance, a 100 MW solar farm plus a 50 MW battery does not equal a 150 MW power plant in terms of capability. Having an intermittent, highly predictable solar generation resource, coupled with an instantly dispatchable multi-talented re-generation battery resource means that sometimes interconnection must be shared – and it’s usually the battery that takes a backseat to the solar facility during generation periods.
This is the hybrid penalization referenced earlier. Asset owners and markets are still learning how to maximize the utilization of these resources.
The document notes that the ancillary service markets provide valuable revenue streams to this young battery market, but that this service market quickly sells out. These large scale markets of independent system operators – where wholesale electricity rates and ancillary services exist – are not where most batteries are earning their revenue these days.
LBNL said that by the end of 2020, most operating hybrids earned revenue via incentive programs or capacity and transmission demand charge markets, instead of wholesale market price signals.
For instance, a battery used for peak shaving behind the meter at a business, or to maximize onsite solar utilization, does little for the broader wholesale market – although they do offer some general peak demand reduction. A battery at a home only running during power outages offers far less than a peak shaving solution; however, some VPPs are beginning to step into this space to monetize these underutilized resources.
We’re also observing a separation of attachment rates, as residential solar-plus-storage is growing faster than small business, commercial, and industrial. LBNL has also observed that residential energy storage solutions are getting larger.
This split – where residential storage is surpassing commercial and industrial storage – is mirrored by residential solar as well, as it outpaces business, commercial, and industrial solar in terms of capacity deployed annually.

The system consists of a controller, pumps, and a battery and is embedded into a portable unit weighing 9.25 kg and measuring 42 cm × 33.5 cm × 19 cm. It can produce 0.33 liters per hour and can be controlled by a smartphone.
The researchers used artificial intelligence to improve the device's ion concentration polarization (ICP) technique, which in the proposed system applies an electrical field to membranes placed above and below a channel of water.
“The membranes repel positively or negatively charged particles – including salt molecules, bacteria, and viruses – as they flow past,” they explained. “The charged particles are funneled into a second stream of water that is eventually discharged.”

They said this improvement removes both dissolved and suspended solids and enables the system to require lower energy consumption, as it only needs a low-pressure pump. They also used electrodialysis, which is a process for the separation of ions in saline solutions, to remove the remaining salt ions that the ICP process is unable to eliminate.
“The optimal setup includes a two-stage ICP process, with water flowing through six modules in the first stage then through three in the second stage, followed by a single electrodialysis process,” they said.
The academics tested the device at Boston’s Carson Beach, using water with different salinity and turbidity levels. They found it is able to desalinate brackish water and seawater into drinkable water.
“In addition, the process can also reduce suspended solids by at least a factor of 10 from the source water, resulting in crystal clear water (<1 NTU) even from the source water with turbidity higher than 30 NTU,” they said.
The prototype only requires 20 W of power per liter. “Right now, we are pushing our research to scale up that production rate,” said the MIT researchers. They presented the device in “Portable Seawater Desalination System for Generating Drinkable Water in Remote Locations,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.
