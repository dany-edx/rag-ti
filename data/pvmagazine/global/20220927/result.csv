German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar this week, accompanied by a German business delegation. He acknowledged the region's critical role in oil, liquefied natural gas, and low-carbon hydrogen. German companies were expected to sign contracts for LNG and hydrogen power on the sidelines of the visit, but few contracts have materialized thus far. However, restored ties could open the doors for new deals in the coming months.  
ICIS has launched Europe's first market-linked renewable hydrogen assessments. “The ICIS European renewable hydrogen assessments are the first market-based assessments that are structured to be compliant with European Union and UK government standards for producing renewable hydrogen (Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin),” wrote the London-based market intelligence company. It said power purchase agreements will be the primary means of supplying renewable power to produce electrolytic hydrogen. The European renewable hydrogen assessments have shown that Spain's renewable hydrogen production costs are among the lowest in Europe, at €5.28 ($5.08)/kg from solar and €4.85/kg from onshore wind.
Japan has launched an initiative to increase hydrogen production, signed by more than 20 countries, including the United States, Australia, and Germany. The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry has set a target of 90 million tons per year of low-carbon hydrogen production by 2030. The Japanese authorities met with several international political figures who visited Japan this week to attend the state funeral of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Prime Capital has entered into two agreements to acquire and construct new hydrogen-related renewable energy projects in Finland and Sweden, with a total new generating capacity of more than 1 GW. It signed a joint venture with CPC Finland to develop a green hydrogen/e-methane plant with a capacity of up to 200 MW close to Kristinestad, Finland, with construction scheduled to start in 2024. CPC Finland will provide 600 MW of renewable energy projects to the venture. “Secondly, a cluster of three wind farms with a total capacity of 290MW in the municipality of Lycksele, Sweden, has been acquired from RES,” said the German company. “Commissioning is scheduled for 2025.

The African Development Bank (AfDB) said last week that the Covid-19 Recovery Platform (CRP) would receive the cheap loans, with $13 million coming from the US-based Global Environment Facility and $7 million from the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa. The latter donor is funded by the governments of Denmark, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
The AfDB said the loans will be paid into the CRP blended finance vehicle and used to attract a further $70 million from private investors to back off-grid solar.
The money will be disbursed by the Off-Grid Energy Access Fund which is managed by London-based Lion's Head Global Partners, Amsterdam's Triple Jump, and New York-based Social Investment Managers and Advisors. The Off-Grid Energy Access Fund is part of the Facility for Energy Inclusion, which is financed by the state-owned development institutions of Norway, Germany, Austria, the EU, and the multilateral Clean Technology Fund.
The AfDB said the CRP blended finance vehicle had already distributed more than $50 million in cheap loans to a dozen off-grid energy companies operating across Africa.
“The Off-Grid Energy Access Fund was able to offer affordable financing solutions in markets such as Malawi and Sierra Leone that helped companies to reduce the impact of increased currency volatility and rising logistics costs,” said Alix Graham, fund lead for the Off-Grid Energy Access Fund, in a press release issued by the AfDB.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/27/made-in-brazil-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BRAZIL",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022",‘Made in Brazil’ solar,"Sengi Solar. a PV module manufacturer, said in early September that it plans to invest BRL 440 million ($85 million) to set up two solar panel factories in Brazil. The two sites will have an annual production capacity of around 1 GW of modules.
The first unit, in Cascavel (Paraná), is already in operation. The second unit, in Ipojuca (Pernambuco), is scheduled to start operations in the first half of 2023.  The Brazilian company told pv magazine that it plans to open a third factory in 2024, to reach of 1.5 GW of annual production.
At the moment, the factories are focusing on module assembly, with cells imported from China.
“When we reach the third factory in 2024, we believe that a Brazilian cell factory will be feasible, due to the volume of other module manufacturers, and our 1.5 GW,” said Everton Fardin, director of operations and engineering at Sengi Solar. “We already entered the feasibility process, including studies on the environmental impact of bringing a cell factory to Brazil.”
The company says it wants “100% autonomy” in the potential cell factory. It has pointed to the mining of quartz in Brazilian states such as Minas Gerais as a way to eventually stop buying wafers from China.
“Who knows? Maybe in 10 years we will have the whole supply chain, from quartz, silicon metal, solar silicon, ingots, wafers and cells here in Brazil,” said Murilo Bonetto, R&D manager at Sengi Solar. “What we are seeing is a cyclical process of re-industrialization in Brazil, in which we invest in photovoltaic module manufacturing, this increases the output volume, which in turn makes raw material factories viable, which then increase the volume of module manufacturing.”
The company is also investing heavily in R&D.
“We estimate to invest BRL 70 million in R&D by 2023 alone, and this will enable us to develop a technological hub where one of the main research areas will be in module tropicalization,” Bonetto said.
Sengi Solar is also developing modules with TOPCon n-type cells produced by Jolywood and Tongwei. It is targeting January 2023 as its goal to surpass the 700 MW barrier and enter the market with high-power modules.
Its plant in Cascavel is producing bifacial and double glass PERC modules ranging from 440 W to 670 W. The company sees TOPCon as a transition technology between PERC and heterojunction (HTJ).
“Studying the cell supply chain, we find that TOPCon will be the next step after PERC because the investment that cell factories will have to make is much smaller than for HTJ. We are studying HTJ, but we are betting on TOPCon n-type for the next modules,” said Bonetto.
Sengi Solar decided to set up domestic module production after the Brazilian authorities added the remaining inputs for PV manufacturing to the PADIS industrial program in January. The government incentive helps to level out the price of domestically produced PV modules with imported ones, but Brazilian panels are still 15% to 20% more expensive, according to Sengi Solar.  International convergence on the 182 mm and 210 mm wafer sizes was another reason that gave the company decided to invest now.
The first module was produced in the factory just nine months after Sengi Solar was established. When the two factories are working at full capacity, they are expected to employ 300 to 350 employees each, according to the company. “The entire product development and project process was done by Brazilians,” said Fardin.

In a recent paper in Nature, the scientists describe how they overcame thermal and chemical-mechanical instabilities of cathodes composed substantially of nickel by mixing in several other metallic elements. “Through a technique we refer to as ‘high-entropy doping,’ we were able to successfully fabricate a cobalt-free layered cathode with extremely high heat tolerance and stability over repeated charge and discharge cycles,” said researcher Huolin Xin. “This achievement resolves long-standing safety and stability concerns around high-nickel battery materials, paving the way for broad-based commercial applications.” High-nickel cathodes come with their own challenges, such as poor heat tolerance, which can lead to the oxidization of battery materials, thermal runaway, and even explosion.Although high-nickel cathodes accommodate larger capacities, volume strain from repeated expansion and cont raction can result in poor stability and safety concerns. The researchers sought to address these issues through compositionally complex high-entropy doping using HE-LMNO, an amalgamation of transition metals magnesium, titanium, manganese, molybdenum, and niobium in the structure’s interior, with a subset of these minerals used on its surface and interface with other battery materials. Xin and his colleagues employed an array of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and 3D nanotomography instruments to determine that their zero-cobalt cathode exhibited an unprecedented volumetric change of zero during repeated use. The highly stable structure is capable of withstanding more than 1,000 cycles and high temperatures, which makes it comparable to cathodes with much lower nickel content.
Ford has broken ground on a $5.6 billion complex for electric vehicles and batteries at BlueOval City in Stanton, Tennessee. The company’s largest and most advanced auto production complex, which is a joint venture with Korean SK Innovation's SK On, is planned to lay the foundation for Ford to achieve a 2 million EV annual run rate throughout the world by late 2026. “Structural steel is erected less than one year after Ford and SK On announced their $5.6 billion investment to build a revolutionary all-new electric truck and advanced batteries for future Ford and Lincoln vehicles in West Tennessee,” the company said. The nearly 6-square-mile campus will create approximately 6,000 new jobs when production begins in 2025.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that EV sales are on course to hit an all-time high this year, lifting them to 13% of global light duty vehicle sales. It said that EV sales doubled worldwide last year to account for almost 9% of the total car market. It also noted that EVs and lighting are the only two components still fully on track for their 2030 milestones in the IEA’s “Net Zero by 2050” scenario. Despite the outlook for EVs, the IEA said they are “not yet a global phenomenon. Sales in developing and emerging countries have been slow due to higher purchase costs and a lack of charging infrastructure availability.”
LG Energy Solution (LGES) has reinforced its cobalt and lithium supply chain in North America by forging comprehensive collaborations with key suppliers in Canada. The latest arrangements are in line with the South Korean battery maker’s mid- to long-term strategy focusing on the fast-growing North American EV market, as well as the recently adopted Inflation Reduction Act. They envisage that EVs will need to have 80% of critical materials sourced domestically or from a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement in order to access a $7,500 tax credit. LGES signed a binding term sheet with Electra, securing the supply of 7,000 tonnes of cobalt sulphate for three years from 2023. In addition, it signed two non-binding agreements with Avalon and Snow Lake to secure a stable supply of lithium. Under the terms of the deals, Avalon will initially supply LGES with lithium hydroxide (11,000 tons per year) for five years, starting in 2025. LGES will also be provided with Snow Lake’s lithium hydroxide (20,000 tons per year) for 10 years once production starts in 2025.
Elli, a Volkswagen subsidiary that manages the group’s charging and energy-related activities in Europe, electricity grid operator Elia Group, and its startup, re.alto, have signed an agreement to accelerate the integration of EVs into the electricity grid. Over the next few years, the signatories will identify possible barriers to EV integration and explore how to showcase its benefits, for example by developing demonstrators. The memorandum of understanding includes four pillars of exploration: price signals/incentives, market design, trusted data, and data security and safe connectivity. “Using the electric vehicle battery as a mobile power bank delivers a triple benefit: Firstly, the climate benefits as renewable energy can be stored and therefore be used more efficiently. Secondly, the electric grid benefits, as the car can contribute toward grid stability, and thirdly, the customer can earn additional revenue with vehicle-to-grid services,” said Elli CEO Elke Temme. “To explore the benefits of this consumer-centric approach, this cooperation with Elia Group is crucial for us.”
Sunwoda plans to build a new battery production facility in Yiwu, in China's Zhejiang province, with an annual capacity of 50 GWh. According to a stock exchange statement, the battery maker will invest around €3 billion ($2.9 billion) in the new factory to produce cells, modules, packs, and complete battery systems. Construction will be carried out in two phases, with an initial annual capacity of 30 GWh and a further 20 GWh at a later date. The initial investment will be around €1.8 billion, followed by another €1.2 billion for the second phase.
Nio has shipped its first battery swapping station from Hungary to Germany. The Chinese EV manufacturer announced its plant in Hungary in July, as part of its efforts to build 1,000 battery exchange stations outside of China by 2025. The Hungarian plant will serve as the manufacturing, service, and R&D center for Nio’s power products in Europe.
The Climate Group has launched a new zero-emission road transport leadership commitment, EV100+. Five globally recognized businesses – IKEA, Unilever, JSW Steel Limited, A.P. Moller-Maersk, and GeoPost/DPDgroup – are the founding members of the initiative, which aims to get rid of the heaviest, most polluting vehicles currently on roads. Together they have committed to transition their fleet of vehicles over 7.5 tones, known as medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs), to zero emission by 2040 in OECD markets, China and India. The new EV100+ complements the EV100 initiative founded by the Climate Group in 2017, in which more than 120 businesses worldwide have committed to convert their fleets with more than over 5.5 million vehicles to electric by 2030.

“We showed the potential of our model to study the influence of the cell design on its real operating performance, thus giving a new opportunity for silicon solar cell optimization,” researcher Jérémy Dumoulin told pv magazine. “For instance, the doping level is found to impact both the operating temperature and the temperature coefficient, showing that two cells with the same efficiency in standard test conditions can have a very different efficiency under real operating conditions.”
The scientists used Comsol Multiphysics software, which purportedly solves the complete Maxwell equations, as well as the carrier transport equations, while also offering a detailed thermal model including all the main self-heating processes occurring in a solar cell.
“Detailed input sets are used for all physical modules, such as a temperature-dependent complex refractive index of c-Si which is found to be crucial for accurate simulation results,” they said. “Radiative and convective cooling are also implemented.”
The research team compared different coupling scenarios on a benchmark crystallin silicon cell.
“These two steps are repeated until the absolute temperature difference between two iterations is smaller than a target value (0.05 ∘C in this work),” the group said. “In the first iteration, a constant temperature distribution is used for the optical calculation.”
The model showed that two solar cells with the same power conversion efficiency rate under standard illumination conditions can achieve different efficiencies under real operating conditions, depending on the doping level of the cells.
“The underlying reason was found to be twofold: (1) Different cell temperatures due to different thermal emissivities; (2) Different temperature coefficients attributed to the increase in open-circuit voltage with the doping level,” the scientists said. “Secondly, our study shed light on the dependence of the temperature coefficient on the solar spectrum.”
They presented the new model in “A fully coupled opto-electro-thermal model to investigate silicon solar cells under real operating conditions,” which was recently published in EPJ Photovoltaics.
“This work opens the way to more reliable outdoor prediction,” Dumoulin said.
In another report published last year, the same research group proposed the use pf radiative sky cooling (RSC) at the research level as a potential passive cooling technique for buildings and solar modules. The group claimed the method could improve performance by more than 5 W per square meter.

Madrid-based gas provider Madrileña Red de Gas (MRG) and Spanish real estate company Pryconsa have launched a green hydrogen project for residential use in Valdemoro, Madrid.
The project is designed to replace gas supplies with renewable hydrogen for 100 homes.
“Our goal is to demonstrate that hydrogen is capable of providing 100% of the energy needs for heating and domestic hot waters in our homes,” a Pryconsa spokesperson told pv magazine. “Construction on the facility should start in May 2023 and first shipments of hydrogen should be made in the last quarter of 2025.”
The companies affirm that they are currently studying the technical and economic model that best suits the hydrogen project, mainly by evaluating mainly two options.
“Our preferred option is the on-site generation of hydrogen through an electrolyzer located in the residential area,” said the spokesperson. “This electrolyzer will be powered by a solar plant via a power purchase agreement (PPA).”
The alternative choice is to obtain hydrogen from a solar-powered electrolyzer that Madrileña Red de Gas is currently developing.
“The associated solar plant will be the Inspira Madrid project in Villanueva del Pardillo, with a power of 10 MW,” the spokesperson said. “For the generation of hydrogen, we will use a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer that will allow us to combine the needs of hydrogen generation with the occupation of space that the installation of the electrolysis equipment entails.”
The estimated annual consumption per household is approximately 250 kg of hydrogen, which means the facility will have to generate at least 24.5 tons of hydrogen per year. The companies told pv magazine that “given the pioneering nature of the project, MRG has agreed to assume the extra cost that the use of hydrogen will entail instead of natural gas.
“The families that inhabit the dwellings will not notice a difference in cost with respect to using natural gas, MRG assuming this difference,” the spokesperson said. “We want to promote and demonstrate that hydrogen is a valid option on a day-to-day basis, and for this reason our company is committed to facilitating this type of project as much as possible.”

China's Trina Solar has introduced two new series of products featuring an N-TOPCon configuration.
It designed the Vertex N line commercial, industrial, and utility-scale applications, and the Vertex S+ line for residential rooftop PV systems. The two products were recently introduced at the RE+ conference in Anaheim, California.
Trina Solar Marketing Manager Melissa Cavanagh told pv magazine that it will soon exclusively produce TOPcon modules. The company said it is also mulling the potential to set up manufacturing capacity in the United States now that the Inflation Reduction Act has been passed. The act packs in numerous incentives for solar manufacturing at every leg of the module supply chain, as well as balance-of-system components.
The Vertex N is a 210Rmm N-TOPCon module with a maximum output of 595 W. It has a bifaciality factor of 80%, up from the 70% that traditional polysilicon solar cells produce.
The Vertex S+ is a 430 W module designed for residential rooftop applications. It has a max efficiency of 21.9%. The module features a lightweight dual-glass design for enhanced safety, lifespan, and durability.
The product is backed by a 25-year product warranty and a maximum annual degradation of 0.4%. S+ includes all Vertex series technologies such as 210 mm multi-busbar triple-cut cells, non-destructive cell cutting and high-density interconnection for low voltage and maximum string power.
TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contacts) solar modules are a focus for Trina as they provide higher efficiency, lower degradation, and a better temperature coefficient when compared to conventional modules.
“TOPCon is not new to Trina, we built our first pilot project four years ago – a 400 MW solar plant under China’s Top Runner program,” Helena Li, president of the company’s global cell and module business, told pv magazine Smarter E event in Munich, Germany. “We utilized our own n-type TOPCon technology in that project, but when we built that customers were not ready to buy these products, as prices were too high, although we had a production line of a certain size. However, we built on this experience for our current approach.”

The Puma series includes seven different versions with power ratings ranging from 645 W to 675 W, and efficiencies ranging from 20.8% to 21.7%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 46.6 to 47.2 V and the short-circuit current from 17.74 to 18.36 A.
The panels measure 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm  35 mm and weigh in at 38.5 kg. The doubled-glass bifacial panel features a junction box with an IP 68 rating and an anodized aluminum alloy frame.
Its front and back sides are both covered with 2.0 mm tempered and low iron glass. Its operating temperature is between -40 C and 85 C, while the open-circuit voltage operating temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius.
The panels can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V. The manufacturer offers a 30-year power output guarantee for 84.95% of the initial yield.
“Shingled technology eliminates traditional ribbon connection with shingles connected in series,” the manufacturer said. “By removing the soldered ribbons, the active area of the module is improved and thermal stresses are reduced, resulting in exceptional efficiency and reliability over standard interconnections.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/27/china-dominated-global-solar-job-market-in-2021/,"EMPLOYMENT,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",MAX HALL,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022",China dominated global solar jobs market in 2021,"The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) have produced their latest snapshot of the world's clean energy employment market.
Photovoltaics has been the world's biggest renewables employer every year since 2016, accounting for 4.29 million of the world's 12.7 million clean energy jobs in 2021. Labor costs, which account for just 8% of the total cost of manufacturing solar panels in China, saw the world's solar superpower host almost 2.7 million solar jobs in 2021, up from 2.3 million in 2020.
The IRENA-ILO report estimates that 1.6 million Chinese solar jobs are in the manufacturing segment, while 1 million are related to construction and PV deployment. Around 100,000 are devoted to operation and maintenance (O&M).
The United States, where labor costs make up around 22% of panel costs, had the next biggest solar jobs market, with around 250,000 positions in 2021, up 9% year on year. Two-thirds of those jobs were in installation and deployment, 13% in manufacturing, 11% in trade and distribution, and 5% in O&M and other roles.
India, which imported 75% of its solar panels last year, had around 137,000 grid-connected solar jobs, up 47% from 2020. Another 80,000 jobs are supported by off-grid installations, according to IRENA. Those figures came despite Indian factories operating only 57% of their 7.2 GW annual solar cell manufacturing capacity and only 38% of their 4.5 GW of module production lines.
Japan had the world's fourth-biggest solar workforce in 2021, with 152,000 roles.
Germany's 51,300-strong solar workforce in 2021 helped to push European Union member states to 235,000 solar jobs, with the help of 31,500 roles in Spain. If one includes nations such as Turkey, which had 21,000 solar jobs in 2021, the total European figure rises to 292,000.
The dearth of solar jobs in Africa – excepting the 63,291 construction jobs supported by South Africa's national solar program in the third quarter of last year – was represented by the fact that the IRENA-ILO number-crunchers broke down roles by pan-African pay-as-you-go solar companies, rather than by country. Nairobi-based M-Kopa employed more than 1,000 people to sell its products last year, plus more than 7,000 more working on commission. London-based Bboxx had a workforce of more than 1,000. And in Nigeria, around 49,600 people worked in the small-scale clean energy sector in 2021, the study added.
