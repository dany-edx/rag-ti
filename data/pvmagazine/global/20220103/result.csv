Enphase Energy Inc has completed the previously announced acquisition of ClipperCreek, a California-based specialist in electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions for residential and commercial customers in the U.S. ClipperCreek has been a pioneer in the EV charging market since 2006 and has sold more than 110,000 Level 2 AC charging stations since its inception.
Home EV charging stations have wide implications for home energy management as households not only consume significantly more power with an EV, but the charging units have a large battery that can be used for both backup and grid services.
This acquisition accelerates the Enphase roadmap to enable bi-directional charging capability for vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid applications. Enphase has also established a domestic manufacturing footprint with the move, as ClipperCreek has manufacturing facilities in Auburn, CA.
“EV adoption is quickly gaining momentum with sales expected to grow more than 40% annually in the U.S. over the next five years. We look forward to working with the talented team from ClipperCreek to develop smart EV charging solutions and integrating them into our home energy systems,” said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO of Enphase Energy.

Shunfeng said trading in its stock has been paused since Friday morning because of the latest planned asset sell-off and is set to resume tomorrow morning in Hong Kong.
The latest mooted deal would see Shunfeng project companies sell their stakes in four solar farms to state-owned entity State Power Investment Group Xinjiang Energy & Chemical Co Ltd, in a deal which would raise RMB890 million (US$140 million), if approved by shareholders and the authorities.
Urban transportation is key to modern civilization. But it has come at a cost, contributing to a dangerous carbon footprint, high levels of smog, a growing inequality gap, and the destruction of some of our most fragile environments. Thus, in the first quarter of this year, pv magazine’s UP Initiative will focus on the rise of e-mobility and how it can complement the renewable energy transition. Read our coverage here.
With details of the required shareholder vote promised by Shunfeng by January 28, the developer said one of the target solar farms would need to be freed from a court-imposed freeze on the developer's 95% holding. That was granted by the Zhejiang Provincial High People's Court until the Shunfeng business concerned hands over an unspecified amount owed to state-owned engineering, procurement and construction services provider Hunan Province Industrial Equipment Installation Co Ltd.
In relation to another of the target projects, Shunfeng will first have to complete an agreement signed in December 2019 which will see its Shanghai Shunneng unit pay RMB10,000 (US$1,570) to acquire the 10% of the solar farm held by a third party.
The developer said RMB810 million (US$127 million) of the anticipated RMB890 million to be generated by the sales would be spent on a short-term debt pile which has reduced from that reported by the company on Tuesday, and by pv magazine this morning.
Investor Sino Alliance, the only backer specified by Shunfeng as a recipient of the latest project sell-off, is now listed as having been owed HK$661 million (US$84.8 million) since December 2020, down from the previous HK$1.15 billion (US$147 million), some of which had dated back to the end of 2019. The RMB62.8 million (US$9.87 million) previously listed as owed to Chongqing International Trust Co Ltd – and being part paid by a forced project sale – had this afternoon been removed from the list of outstanding commitments.
Shunfeng today said it still owes a combined HK$1 billion (US$128 million) plus RMB585 million (US$92 million) in overdue payments dating back as far as November 2019, and will have to find HK$65.6 million (US$8.41 million) by the end of March for the Hong Kong branch of China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/03/pv-powered-heat-pump-system-for-commercial-swimming-pool-heating/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JORDAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 3, 2022",PV-powered heat pump system for commercial swimming pool heating,"A group of scientists from Mutah University, in Jordan, and Amman-based Golden Energy Company has assessed the energy and economic performance of a PV-powered heat pump system used for heating the swimming pools of a hotel building in the coastal city of Aqaba.
Their simulation considered the hotel had annual average electricity consumption of about 6.5MWh and a total electricity cost of JOD591,000 ($834,000) per year. They assumed deployment of a 408.2kW PV system on the hotel's rooftops, with a tilt angle of five degrees. The PV system cost was estimated at JOD244,920, or JOD600 ($846.20) per kilowatt installed. The overall cost of the solar-powered heat pump system was valued at JOD360,920.
The hotel has a family pool, with a 310m2 surface; the main pool, with a 515m2 surface; and a spa pool with a 380m2 surface. A significant quantity of heat is required to keep both indoor and outdoor swimming pools warm between October and March. A heat transfer model was used to estimate the performance of the swimming pool heating system.
The model takes into account evaporation and convection heat losses as well as conduction losses, radiative losses and refilling-water heat losses. “The pool's ability to dissipate or absorb heat is entirely determined by its location, environmental condition, and time of day or night,” the scientists explained. “The heat transfer balance is also impacted by the location of pool installation, whether it is indoor or outdoor.”
Evaporation heat losses were found to have the most significant impact in all swimming pools and the thermal energy produced by the PV-powered heat pump, which is able to provide hot water with temperatures ranging from 35 to 60 degrees Celsius, is mainly used to recover those losses. The effect of other losses, by contrast, was found to be minimal.
According to the scientists, the electricity provided by the heat pump system was able to reduce considerably the energy demand for electric heaters for all operation months for the family and main pools. As for the spa pool, which can also be heated through a steam boiler operated with liquid petroleum gas, savings were also significant. For the family and main pools, annual savings were estimated at JOD26,506 and JOD43,891, respectively, and for the spa pool these were indicated at JOD17,328.
“The yearly hotel electricity requirement will be 6,500MWh with a total cost of JOD591,000 per year compared with the proposed PV system, that generates about 786MWh per year. It can be calculated the net electricity consumption would be 5,714MWh per year, with a total cost of JOD514,000, that … mean[s] the proposed system will save about JOD185,850 yearly from the total electricity bill,” the Jordan group emphasized. “The cash flow value becomes positive by the end of the second year and remains positive during the whole evaluation period of ten years. The reason for this is that the system's overall energy production is large while the initial cost is relatively modest.”
The proposed heat pump system was found to have a payback time of only 1.94 years and total profits after ten years of operations were reportedly JOD1,338,931 ($1.89 million). “A cursory examination of the solar project's economic factors leads to the conclusion that it is economically justified,” the academics concluded.
The system design was described in the paper Energy performance and economics assessments of a photovoltaic-heat pump system, published in Results in Engineering.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/03/eu-to-gut-the-principle-of-sustainable-taxonomy-with-inclusion-of-nuclear-and-gas/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",,"JANUARY 3, 2022",EU to gut the principle of sustainable taxonomy with inclusion of nuclear and gas,"The EU Sustainable Taxonomy was designed to provide a classification framework for investors, to ensure a clear and consistent understanding of investments that could be considered ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’. Launched in conjunction with the EU’s climate target of 55% emissions reduction by 2030, it is in effect a sustainability label aligned with European Green Deal plans to facilitate at least a trillion euros in investment in the coming decade.
The debate about what to include in the Taxonomy is about money: while economic activities outside the Taxonomy will not be banned, they will be excluded from easy access to flows of sustainable and climate finance, green deal funds, and possibly even Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) fund flows. Labels have a purpose as they provide an easy way to gauge suitability for different types of investment – so muddying the waters of what that means is counterproductive.
A sustainable Taxonomy should not only give investors confidence that their investment fits sustainability criteria under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) but also provide a shared market shorthand enabling the rapid scale-up and deployment of green finance. By providing a tool driving the realignment of capital, the Taxonomy could be an enabler of the US$3-5 trillion that has been estimated as necessary to meeting global climate goals.
The solar sector could be a major beneficiary of a sustainable taxonomy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that new renewable generation capacity hit almost 280GW in 2020, up 45% on 2019, the highest year-on-year increase since 1999. More than every third power plant installed in 2020 was solar-powered and solar PV is expected to add an average of over 125GW of capacity per year from 2021-2025. There is a major economic and transition opportunity as well, as SolarPowerEurope projects that the solar sector could create 4 million jobs by 2050.
Scaling up will require finance, not simply for the energy industry but also for the deployment of solar technologies across industries, from construction, heating, agriculture, and more. The advent of transparent sustainability labeling could enable investors to determine exactly which companies, portfolios, and funds are compliant with the Taxonomy and therefore accelerate the deployment of funds to those opportunities that meet the criteria. If capital investment could be directed to replicate the cost curve seen in solar PV over the last decade, the next decade could prove transformational.
Yet lobbying for the established energy industry, and fossil fuels have been widespread amongst states. Politicians appear focused on shoring up the status quo, rather than taking an opportunity for transformational economic growth provided by the energy transition. Instead of focusing on renewable energy, storage, efficiency, and new energy system models, and despite concerns about path dependency, the carbon budget, and the short time frame for effective climate action, the Commission has decided to include gas and nuclear within the Taxonomy.
The challenge in the development of the EU’s Sustainable Taxonomy has been driven by two things: a concern that solar and wind will not be able to provide sufficient low carbon power within Europe in the short to medium term; and the concern of Member States about their own energy industries and economies. As Harald Heubaum, Deputy Director and Co-Founder of the Centre for Sustainable Finance at SOAS, University of London says, “France, Germany and other member states have so far played politics with the taxonomy rather than committing to a purely science-based approach. This does not inspire confidence in the taxonomy as a ‘gold standard’. We have two blocs, one pro-nuclear and one pro-gas. Neither side has been willing to budge. Germany’s new traffic light coalition had initially voiced its opposition to nuclear and gas to be included in the taxonomy but has since toned down its rhetoric.”
The first elements of the EU’s Sustainable Taxonomy came into force on Jan. 1, 2022, covering criteria for how renewable energy, car manufacturing, shipping, forestry, and bioenergy can be considered ‘sustainable’. It included the notion of “transitional activities”, such as shipping for example, which will see tighter decarbonization criteria from 2026, as well as a “technology-neutral” benchmark for new energy investments of 100g of CO2 per kWh.  Many Member States objected to the new rules, even though the most controversial elements regarding gas and nuclear were removed from the debate.
How these should now be categorized is the topic of the proposal released quietly on New Year’s Day. Unlike the first part of the Delegate Act, this is not open to public consultation but responses from the Platform on Sustainable Finance and the Member States Expert Group on Sustainable Finance are due by Jan. 12. If successful, the proposal would enable nuclear and gas investments to count as “sustainable”, undermining the goal to realign capital investment towards a more sustainable future. In its proposal, the Commission states, “It is necessary to recognise that the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union's economy.” While this may be true, the outstanding question is whether that recognition should be enshrined within a sustainability classification.
Looking at nuclear and gas as long-term energy options doesn’t appear to make sense, as low (or lower) carbon isn’t necessarily the same as sustainable. Nuclear energy has historically suffered from high capital costs and budget overruns and has a major issue with fuel waste. While there is a lot of excitement about the potential in small modular reactors, and even nuclear fusion, they are still a long way from commercialization. Sean Kidney, chief executive of the Climate Bonds Initiative says that while nuclear is undoubtedly low carbon, using existing nuclear technology doesn’t make sense from a risk perspective, not least of which is financial.
Natural gas faces its own challenges, not least of which is that new investments today will result in infrastructure in place in 30 years. Given that 2020 saw gas power plants overtake lignite power plants to become the single largest contributor to power sector emissions in the EU Emissions Trading System, that is a significant concern. Kidney says, “The real existential threat we face is from fossil fuels, and with gas we have a huge problem in that the transitional reductions we could achieve are not enough – and methane leakage is now so vast that it largely negates the benefits.”
Despite the ‘technology neutral’ threshold of new energy investments of 100g of CO2 per kWh, to qualify as sustainable under the proposal, new natural gas investments must only emit less than 270g of CO2 per kW and replace other fossil fuels. It’s not simply the disconnect between two different sets of energy emissions criteria that’s a problem, but also the fact that such a move fails to line up with the EU’s own climate targets or the goals of the Paris Agreement. Any power plant that emits more than 270g CO2 e/kWh complicates reaching the Paris Agreement targets enormously and will require other sectors to deliver deeper emissions reductions.
Obviously, emissions abatement is expected to contribute significantly to the natural gas sector in the future, but there are also major challenges with this. Carbon capture and storage has yet to be fully commercialized despite decades of investment. Expectations are high that green hydrogen will be blended into the gas mix but as over 95% of hydrogen today is generated from fossil fuels, this seems counterproductive. Significant investment is going into the development of green, low-cost hydrogen, usually in conjunction with renewables, but the latest Taxonomy proposal is non-specific on these terms. Once again, support for the status quo is delaying action by relying on some future “silver bullet” which will solve our problems.
The IEA said that 2021 needed to mark the end of investment in new fossil fuel supplies if we are to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming limited to 1.5 degrees. Despite a 2009 G20 commitment to addressing fossil fuel subsidies, the market continues to be distorted. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported that 2020 saw $423 billion spent on direct subsidies alone, through tax breaks and price caps. Including the cost of externalities, from sickness and early deaths to environmental impacts, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated that the cost rises to $5.9 trillion, or 6.8% of global GDP.
At the same time, the inclusion of natural gas, and nuclear in the Sustainable Taxonomy ignores growing risks around legal liability, carbon price, as well as consumer and market concern about externalities and impact. Sandrine Dixson-Declève, co-president of the Club of Rome and member of the European Commission advisory Platform on Sustainable Finance said, “Natural gas should not be classified as ‘green' and should not be included in the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act. The moves to label natural gas as a transitional activity … is completely misleading, may lead to a serious mis-selling of risk, and will undermine the EU’s efforts to transform its economy.”
There are those who believe that gas and nuclear must be part of the energy mix moving forward – but that doesn’t mean that they should be labeled as sustainable. The realignment of capital is a major task, especially when you consider the weight of capital already invested in the fossil fuel sector.
Few would argue that EU Member States face a variety of energy challenges and that support will be needed for the energy transition. But labeling nuclear and gas as sustainable undercuts the very purpose of the Sustainable Taxonomy. With capital requirements in the trillions of dollars annually, it is vital that investors are provided with clear signals about what constitutes environmentally and socially positive investment.
The EU’s Sustainable Taxonomy provided an opportunity to provide global leadership and align with calls for action from the private sector – confusing sustainable with transitional in the Taxonomy complicates its goals, weakens its utility, increases the risk of stranded assets, and opens up the investment process to further accusations of greenwashing. It appears like nothing more than a politically driven excuse to delay concrete action and a missed opportunity for effective investment engagement with climate change.

Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
Shunfeng, which owes almost US$294 million to creditors in overdue debts and will have to find a further HK$65.6 million (US$8.41 million) within three months, raised RMB14.4 million (US$2.26 million) towards easing that debt burden on Tuesday when it sold off a 50MW solar farm to state-owned entity Anhui Power Wanneng Energy Exchange Co Ltd.
That sale went through despite technical problems at the site amounting to “overheat[ing] of the connector of the combiner box, insufficient thickness of the galvanized bracket, the hot spots identified in certain components through the electroluminescent testing, and soil erosion at the edge of the photovoltaic array,” the developer said.
The project was sold at a discount of RMB1.55 million (US$244,000) agreed between the two parties and Shunfeng added, if the sale had gone through at the end of June, it would have booked a RMB46.8 million (US$7.36 million) loss on the value of the facility.
Explaining the reasons for its latest project sale, Shunfeng said it had a net cash position of RMB6.47 billion (US$1.02 billion) at the end of June, thanks in part to being owed RMB632 million (US$99.4 million) in overdue state subsidies, and had cash at that point of RMB16 million (US$2.52 million) versus borrowings of RMB5.35 billion (US$841 million), convertible bonds commitments of RMB545 million (US$85.7 million) and bonds payable of RMB585 million (US$92 million).
Shunfeng has owed True Blue Global Ltd HK$172 million (US$22 million) since November 2019; Sino Alliance HK$351 million (US$45 million) since the end of 2019 and HK$800 million (US$103 million) since the end of 2020; the holders of a corporate bond issued in 2015 RMB330 million (US$51.9 million) since March 2020; Chongqing International Trust Co Ltd RMB62.8 million (US$9.87 million) since September 2020, although that is partly being paid down by a recent forced solar project sale; investors in a 2016 corporate bond RMB255 million (US$40 million) since Oct. 25; and Rainbow Fort Investments Ltd HK$175 million (US$22.4 million) since Nov. 30. Some HK$65.6 million owed to China Minsheng Banking Corp will fall due for payment at the end of March.

New Delhi-based, NYSE-listed renewables developer Azure Power today announced the commissioning of a 600MW grid-connected solar project awarded to it by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
The project, in the Bikaner district of Rajasthan, is the largest single-location solar plant in India owned and operated by a developer.
Azure Power commissioned the project in phases, with the last 100MW going online since Saturday. 
The power generated by the project will be supplied to SECI for 25 years at a tariff of INR2.53/kWh.
Azure Power said the latest project has taken it to 2.51GW of high-performing operational solar assets in India.
“It is an incredible way to start the new year,” said Azure managing director and chief executive officer, Ranjit Gupta. “Since this project was initiated, [at] around the onset of Covid-19 in India, we [have] faced several challenges amid lockdowns and safety concerns. Despite the challenges, and while prioritizing the health and safety of all our employees and communities, we have managed to deliver high performing assets and are extremely proud of achieving yet another milestone in our journey towards a more resilient and sustainable future.”

Germany deployed around 409.8MW of new PV capacity in November, according to the latest figures from federal network agency the Bundesnetzagentur.
This compares to 411.9MW in October, and 480MW in November 2020.
In the first 11 months of 2021, developers connected over 4.84GW of solar to the grid, compared to 4.4GW in the same period a year earlier. The country's cumulative solar capacity topped 57.3GW at the end of November.
The German PV market keeps being driven by the segments for installations not exceeding 750kW in size, which last month achieved a newly-installed PV capacity of 316.8MW. Of this capacity, around 310MW comes from rooftop PV arrays while the remaining share is represented by small-sized solar parks.
The Bundesnetzagentur also published new feed-in tariffs which will begin this month. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4% while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0683/kWh and €0.0519/kWh, depending on system size.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/03/solar-for-polytunnel-greenhouses/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ISRAEL",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 3, 2022",Solar for polytunnel greenhouses,"Israeli scientists have combined solar power with crop growth in polytunnel greenhouses by developing an organic PV (OPV) solution.
Polytunnel greenhouses are typically covered with polyethylene. They are used to grow large amounts of fruits and vegetables that require more heat during the winter months. They are harder to shade than those covered with glass.
“OPV properties are more suitable than conventional silicon for polytunnel greenhouse applications,” researcher Esther Magadaley told pv magazine. “They are lightweight, flexible and the polyethylene encapsulation material of the OPVs is similar to the polyethylene cover material of a greenhouse.”
Magadaley said OPV solutions can be semitransparent, come in different colors with different spectral transmittance properties, and transmit as much of the light spectrum needed for plant growth, while using the other parts of the light spectrum for electricity production.
“This way, we can produce electricity without affecting crop growth,” she explained.
In their experiment, the scientists used solar modules based on organic cells relying on a donor material known as PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8. Each panel has a power conversion efficiency of 3.3%, a nominal power of 14 W, a site of 800 mm x 1,000 mm x 0.6 mm, and an active area of 655 x 855 mm. Due to its low light transmittance of the panel, which is around 23%, only 37% of the greenhouse's roof area was covered with the modules.

The performance of this east-west oriented PV system was tested over a six-month period and compared to that of conventional solar modules deployed on a similar greenhouse. Efficiencies for the organic array peaked at different times of day, depending on their position on the roof, and peak efficiencies occurred at times when they were not in direct incident irradiance.
“When considering the combined effect of the modules across the curved roof, their typical combined output and average PCE were 105Wh and 0.65% on a sunny day and 81Wh and 0.86% on a cloudy day,” the researchers said.
The organic panels were also found to have lower module temperatures compared to their crystalline silicon counterparts, which resulted in lower degradation rates. However, some of the organic modules also suffered from accelerated degradation, which was due to the mechanical stress caused by movements of the tunnel sheeting due to wind.
Efficiencies of the OPV modules used in this study peaked at around 3%, which was relatively low in comparison to laboratory-scale cell efficiencies of over 17% that were recently reported. Utilizing more efficient modules would improve their economic viability, with increased production of renewable electricity,” the academics explained.
When asked about commercial viability, Magadaley said that current OPV prices do not reflect their lower potential costs compared to silicon technologies, because they are still manufactured on a small scale. “There are other studies that estimate OPV costs on a mass production scale, which would make OPV an economically viable option,” she added.
The researchers presented their proposed approach in “Integrating organic photovoltaics (OPVs) into greenhouses: electrical performance and lifetimes of OPVs,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Sustainable Energy. The research group includes scientists from Israel's Institute of Agricultural Engineering, the Agricultural Research Organization, and the Triangle Research and Development Center.

On Sunday, the ministry and the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (SATBA) signed a memorandum of understanding with unspecified private investors to implement the plan and announced their intention to allocate around IRR30 trillion ($71.4 million) in the next budget law to move forward with the first projects.
According to SATBA, there are currently more than 80GW of renewable energy projects that have been submitted by private investors for review.
Iran has an installed renewable energy power generation capacity of around 900MW, of which about 414MW is represented by solar installations. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country installed around 50MW of new PV power in 2020 and around 90MW in 2019.
Despite a feed-in-tariff scheme for large scale PV and a net metering mechanism for rooftop PV, Iran’s solar energy development has remained below expectations since the real market inception, in 2016. Solar developers active in the country had to deal with two main issues: difficult access to financing and re-imposed sanctions by former U.S. President Donald Trump.
Last week, however, Tehran-headquartered company Mana Energy Pak commissioned the country's first solar cell factory. The 150MW facility is located close to the city of Khomeini in western Iran. The company’s website states that it has, additionally, purchased a factory able to produce 1.2GW of multi- and monocrystalline wafers per year, without mentioning the location of this factory. It also states that it has operated a 250MW production line for PV modules at the site near Khomeini since early 2020. According to SATBA, further phases already under construction will increase the factory’s PV module capacity to 1.5GW by the end of 2023.

The storage system will be used by the Israeli company for two projects it secured in recent tenders held by the Israel Public Utility Authority for Electricity. 
“We are excited to announce our first strategic procurement agreement in the energy storage arena via the selection of Sungrow's New ESS Li-ion Solution,” said Enlight CEO Gilad Yavetz. “We believe that the combination of Sungrow's product leadership and CATL's cell technology will provide us with the superior solution we need for our advanced solar-plus-battery projects, driving best-in-class plant performance.”
“Sungrow will supply 430MWh of its latest four-hour, liquid-cooled ESS, a combination of a contracted 230MWh for stage one and a locked 200MWh battery for stage two, which enables profitability, flexibility and safety,” Sungrow said in a statement, without revealing more details. “The contract is the largest ESS agreement signed to date in Israel, bolstering the country's energy transition and marking a massive scale-up in installations for the newly launched system.”
According to Enlight's annual report for 2020, which was published in March, the Israeli company secured 48MWac of storage capacity in a tender held in July 2020 and another 82MWac in a second procurement exercise held in December 2020. The projects selected in this solar-plus-storage tender were awarded a final price of ILS0.1745/kWh ($0.0562) and will have to begin delivering power to the Israeli grid by July 2023.

They claim the new cell is the most efficient PV device ever to be built based on antimony.
They said the cell is the first serious candidate to approach commercial production among all thin-film solar cells relying on the earth-abundant and stable material.  Sb2(S,Se)3 has a tunable bandgap in the range of 1.1-1.7 eV, which is optimal for harvesting sunlight, and a thickness of about 500 nanometers, which helps to increase light irradiation absorption.
The scientists achieved a 10.7% efficiency rating by using alkali metal fluorides as additives in the deposition of the Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films.
“Our mechanistic investigations show that the considerably enhanced film morphology and crystallinity, along with passivated and reduced defects, are responsible for the performance improvement,” the scientists said. “This approach is able to manipulate the S/Se gradient in the films and creates favorable energy alignment which facilitates the carrier transport.”
They fabricated the device with a buffer layer based on zinc sulfide oxide (Zn(O,S)) and cadmium sulfide (CdS). They synthesized the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layer with the hydrothermal deposition method and used Spiro-OMeTAD for the hole transport layer. They then assembled the cell with a gold (Au) layer deposited through thermal evaporation.
The cell showed an open-circuit voltage of 0.673 V, a short-circuit current of 23.7 mA per cm2, and a fill factor of 66.8%. The scientists said it retained around 93% of its initial efficiency after 30 days of storage.
As a comparison, they built a reference cell without alkali metal fluorides as additives. It exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 9.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.663 V, a short-circuit current of 22.2 mA per cm2, and a fill factor of 62.6%. It was also able to retain around 89% of its initial efficiency.
“This investigation establishes a novel and highly efficient post-treatment approach for Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells and would benefit the fabrication of other kinds of metal chalcogenide solar cells,” the academics said.
A complete description of the cell can be found in “Regulating Energy Band Alignment via Alkaline Metal Fluoride Assisted Solution Post-Treatment Enabling Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells with 10.7% Efficiency,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.

It deployed the floating array on a reservoir near Huaneng Power's 2.65 GW Dezhou thermal power station.
It built the solar plant in two phases with capacities of 200 MW and 120 MW, respectively. The first phase, which included the deployment of 8 MWh of storage capacity, was completed in 2020, while the second phase was finished between mid-September and the end of December. The facility is expected to generate around 550 million kWh of electricity per year, the company said, without disclosing additional technical details.

In mid-December, the company also commissioned a 130 MW solar plant in an intertidal zone near Yuhuan, Zhejiang province. It described the Qinggang Photovoltaic Power Station as China's first intertidal PV project, with 242,000 solar modules deployed across an area spanning 1.2 million square meters.
The project is expected to produce around 150 million kWh per year. It will be resistant to typhoons and water corrosion, among other harsh environmental factors, said the company.
Huaneng Power also plans to build a 2 GW solar plant in Fengcheng, Jiangxi province. The experimental array will include floating PV, agrivoltaics and solar parks on fishponds. The first 320 MW unit will be completed this year, with the rest of the capacity to be installed by 2026.

NASA launched the Webb Space Telescope on Christmas Day. Thirty minutes later, it deployed and activated Webb’s fold-out solar array.
The world’s most powerful telescope, which is set to study phenomena like the formation of planets, uses less power than one might think. In fact, only 1 kilowatt, equivalent to the power use of microwaving your lunch, is needed to power the device.
Webb will stay energy-efficient more than 1 million miles from Earth, said NASA.
The 20-foot solar array is attached to the main observatory of the craft. It will act as the “powerhouse” for the telescope, supplying energy to all of its scientific instruments, communications, and propulsion systems. The telescope only needs 1 kW to perform, but the array generates twice that much to factor in the degradation caused by the harsh conditions of space.
The array consists of five panels that are connected by hinges for folding into the launch vehicle, the Ariane 5 rocket. The telescope’s onboard battery was designed to only last a few hours, so the unfolding and activation of the array was considered one of the most critical early steps of the telescope’s voyage.
