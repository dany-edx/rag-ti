This week, Plug Power completed the acquisition of Applied Cryo Technologies, a provider of technology, equipment and services for the transportation, storage and distribution of liquefied hydrogen and other cryogenic gases. Last month, the American company signed a memorandum of understanding with French renewable hydrogen startup Lhyfe to jointly develop green hydrogen generation plants in Europe.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency(ARENA) yesterday announced it will play a key role in the development of the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator known as HyGate. ARENA is already working on funding, together with Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, or BMBF). “ARENA and BMBF aim to open the funding initiative in the first quarter of 2022,” wrote the Australian public body today. HyGate is expected to support pilot, trial, demonstration, and research projects along the hydrogen supply chain. The aim is to progress renewable hydrogen towards commercialization. Australia and Germany have committed up to AU$50 million (€32.2 million) and €50 million, respectively, for new renewable hydrogen projects.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights.

Melbourne-based renewables company Patriot Hydrogen has signed a memorandum of understanding with Western Australia’s Kimberley Clean Energy (KCE) to supply 75 of Patriot’s P2H (power-to-hydrogen) modular power generation units. “These units will support KCE’s plans to develop baseload renewable energy, green hydrogen and fertilizer, to support a cleaner future for the Kimberley region,” Patriot Hydrogen said this month.
Western Australia’s lands minister, Tony Buti, has proposed changes to the Land Administration Act to introduce a new, more flexible form of land tenure for unallocated crown and pastoral land. “The changes mean WA [Western Australia] will be better placed to leverage opportunities in the rapidly-growing renewable energy sector which requires large areas of land for operations like carbon farming, wind farms, solar energy and hydrogen production,” the government of Western Australia wrote last week.
Business leaders and officials from Europe and Africa have been meeting online for the Accelerating Green Hydrogen Economy, Production & Exports in Africa event. According to social media updates, the focus is currently on South African energy company Sasol and the export potential of Namibia, which a German official has reportedly forecast will become the cheapest place in the world to produce green hydrogen – at an estimated €1.50-2/kg). Presentations have also focused on the role of North Africa with collaboration between Morocco and Mauritania for the production of fertilizers and raw materials cited as an example of possible hydrogen usage in the continent.
The Centrale Electrique de l’Ouest Guyanais (CEOG) multi-megawatt scale power plant in French Guiana has selected Spain’s Jema Energy to supply two 2 MW converters. “For this, the same topology as the IBX6 PV/battery inverter has been used,” wrote the Basque company, referring to one of its products. “However, all the DC protections have been modified to adapt it to the behavior of a hydrogen battery. In addition, the IBX6 inverter is adapted to the grid code requirements of the Enedis off-grid zones, allowing it to operate at very low frequencies, such as 44 Hz,” added Jema, with reference to French state-controlled electric utility Enedis, formerly ERDF. According to Jema, the CEOG project is “the largest renewable hydrogen power plant project in the world.”
The Communauté de Communes Les Sorgues du Comtat and Monteux-based renewable electricity and hydrogen business Hynoé have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a territorial initiative to produce and distribute renewable hydrogen in the Avignon urban area. “The hydrogen produced will be used for the local decarbonization of collective mobility [and] household waste collection and will offer a clean fuel solution to the numerous transport [and] logistics companies present in the area,” Hynoé wrote yesterday. The project will be developed in several phases, to produce at least 400kg of hydrogen per day by the end of 2024.
The U.K. government has awarded £9.4 million (€11.2 million) for a hydrogen project at ScottishPower’s Whitelee Windfarm, near Glasgow. Whitelee is the U.K.'s largest onshore wind farm. “The £9.4 million cash boost will see the Whitelee green hydrogen project develop the U.K.’s largest electrolyzer,” wrote the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy yesterday. The project is being developed by Sheffield-based energy storage and clean fuel company ITM Power and Anglo-Irish-owned, Surrey-based industrial gas business BOC, in conjunction with the hydrogen division of Spanish-owned utility ScottishPower. The facility is expected to be able to produce 2.5-4 tons of hydrogen per day.
Italian heating and gas metering company SIT, via subsidiary Metersit, has secured EU certification for a fully hydrogen-compatible residential meter, a world first, according to the Padova-based business. “The certification, issued by the notified body, NMi Certin B.V., is valid in Europe and the U.K., as well as other, non-EU countries, and guarantees the accuracy and reliability of the measuring instrument (the meter),” SIT said yesterday. Chief executive Federico de’ Stefani said: “After the satisfaction of seeing our products installed in … hydrogen houses in the U.K. and exhibited at [climate change summit] COP26, we are proud to obtain this certification for our 100% hydrogen meter, which allows us to move from a test phase to a production phase. In the hydrogen supply chain, residential use is, in fact, the only one ready to be employed. In this sense, SIT is ready with certified products which, once the generation and transport of hydrogen become available, will make it possible to use this alternative gas in full compliance with our corporate and sustainability mission.”

The board of polysilicon maker Xinte Energy yesterday approved a proposal to extend its financial services agreement with TBEA Group Finance Co Ltd despite a shareholder rebellion which saw the holders of 22% of company stock vote against the idea at an extraordinary general meeting. Xinte is controlled by Chinese electricals company TBEA. Manufacturer China Glass experienced similar dissent to two internal purchasing arrangements at a special general meeting today, with almost 19% opposition to extending both proposals.
Module maker Longi has announced it has secured a wafer supply deal from Zhejiang-based TOPCon module manufactuer Dal Solar. Under the terms of the agreement, Longi will sell 1.15 billion wafers to Dal Solar over the 2022-2023 period. The value of the contract is estimated at around RMB7.04 billion (US$1.1 billion).
Independent shareholders in state-controlled glassmaker Irico New Energy will vote at an EGM next month in Xianyang, in Shaanxi province, on whether to carry out an initial public offering (IPO) on the ChiNext board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange which could raise up to RMB2 billion (US$313 million) for new photovoltaic glass production lines. The exercise would devote the initial RMB1.5 billion (US$235 million) raised to the first phase of an ultra-thin and high-transmissivity photovoltaic glass project upon which construction started in September, in Shangrao City, Jiangxi province. Irico, which is controlled by the state-owned China Electronics Co, wants to build three 1,000-ton-per-day glass melting furnaces and 15 process production lines for PV glass, with the project set to be finished in 2023, the company said on Friday. Up to RMB500 million extra raised by the float would be used for working capital. The vote, which will also propose removing the construction and operation of solar projects from the company’s articles of association, is due to be held on December 15.

“It is an investment to expand our reach in the international market, for the enhancement of our sustainable solutions, especially in the
solar sector and for new hires,” said ChemiTek CEO César Martins.
The company specializes in the production of a detergent product for cleaning and antistatic protection for photovoltaic modules, solar tiles and solar thermal panels. “Solar Wash Protect is applied by the installers of photovoltaic plants, by solar panel cleaning companies, and solar parks with their own maintenance teams,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “In the case of private individuals, the liquid is purchased by the PV system provider.”
According to the manufacturer, the detergent removes all kinds of organic dirt, such as bird droppings, sand, dust, pollen, and resin from the modules and, at the same time, thanks to its antistatic properties, it reduces the adhesion of dust to the glass, keeping panels cleaner between cleaning cycles. “It also reduces water consumption by about 50% and increases energy production by up to 5%,” the spokesperson went on to say. “The first reason that caught the attention of our researchers who created the product was that a dirty solar panel loses energy production capacity and that if you wash it with just water or with conventional products, the energy production is not as great as with our SWP.”
The product must be mixed with water and has to be applied to the modules using a brush or a mop to remove or loosen the dirt. Then the module must be rinsed with water to remove any dispersed dirt or excess of product left on the panels. The remaining water can be left to dry or be removed with a squeegee.
The detergent is available in two versions: the SWP50, with a mixing ratio of 1kg of concentrated product to 50 liters of water; and the SWP300, with a mixing ratio of 1kg of concentrated product to 300 liters of water.
The product was recently certified by the German laboratory TÜV Sud, according to the EN 61215 standard and is also claimed, by the company, to have letters of conformity from 12 of the world’s 15 largest panel manufacturers.
“ChemiTek allows not only to increase the output of solar panels, maximizing the generation of renewable energy, but also to reduce the need for cleaning and maintenance interventions in solar parks, which will be fundamental for us to accelerate the introduction of solar energy in our networks,” said Luís Manuel, executive director of EDP Ventures.

On the final day of the event in Cape Town – organized by industry body the African Energy Chamber – Sara Vakhshouri, of SVB Energy International, told the conference each African nation has its own unique energy needs and that a ‘mixed basket' of energy sources would be the best approach for nations to secure energy security.
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
Vakhshouri is founder and president of the Washington-based consultant, which lists ‘major national and international oil companies' as its biggest client type. She told the event: “Energy transition doesn’t mean we only need solar and wind. We are not sure that the energy transition to renewables with the current technology is sustainable and viable yet. The high energy prices, increase in population, and lower efficiency of solar and wind make us see a different scenario.”
Mohammed Amin Adam, deputy energy minister of Ghana, called upon international investors to devote as much attention to developing renewables in Africa as they do in other markets, such as Europe and Asia.
“What we need is partnerships from the world,” said the politician. “Financial institutions, governments and the private sector need to work with us to harness this potential. From 2015, investment in renewables in Africa moved from US$70 billion, according to IRENA [the International Renewable Energy Agency] to over US$320 billion today.” Nevertheless, he added: “This amount is small compared to global investment in the renewable energy sector.”
But the Ghanaian cabinet member also said renewables investment must go arm in arm with continued fossil fuel spending. He said: “An example is, through petrochemicals we can produce [solar] panels and battery cells in our continent, but if we stop producing oil and gas, how do we generate the petrochems that are required to do the battery cells and panels?”
Taonna Kokera, of Paris-headquartered financial services company Mazars, offered a dissenting view by pitching for Africa to fulfill its potential to be a global leader in the scaling up of clean energy generation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/23/simulation-tool-to-measure-effect-of-waves-on-offshore-floating-solar/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,MALTA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 23, 2021",Simulation tool to measure effect of waves on offshore floating solar,"Scientists at Malta's Institute for Sustainable Energy have developed a simulation tool to assess the effect of wave response motion in offshore floating PV installations.
“The simulation tool is applicable to any offshore project as long as the characteristic equations representing the response of the raft to incoming waves are known,” professor Luciano Mule'Stagno told pv magazine.
The researchers stressed the importance of the solar module tilt angle in the planning of floating PV projects. “Tilt angles for floating installations are governed by other facts than optimal power generation, including esthetic impact, wind loading and available space,” they explained, noting that offshore systems may not always be in line with the designed tilt angle and orientation, due to the response of the floating structure to incoming waves. Three different movements were identified for a floating solar array and these were categorized by the scientists as pitch, yaw, and roll movements.
They initially used both isotropic and anisotropic models to predict the total radiation on the modules' inclined surface. The first assumes an isotropic combination of diffuse radiation from the sky and ground-reflected radiation and the second calculates in detail all the components of diffuse radiation and also includes horizon brightening. The anisotropic method was chosen to predict the loss or gain in yield in a floating installation due to movements in pitch, yaw and roll.

Two algorithms developed by the U.S.' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were used to derive the global irradiance on a plane with a fixed tilt and orientation, and to vary the tilt and orientation based on the response equation inputted by the user.
The Maltese group conducted a series of simulations assuming a pure sinusoidal wave for all movements and two floating systems with a fixed tilt of 30 and 5 degrees. “The days chosen were close to the 21st of each month in order to include equinoxes and solstices,” it stated. “However, care was taken to choose days with the same sky clarity.” Pyranometers were used to obtain irradiation data.
The measurements showed that, for the PV system with a tilt angle of 30 degrees, the highest yield losses for both tilted angles of 30 and 5 degrees were caused by pitch movements. “This is because pitch movements directly affect the actual tilt of the installation,” the scientists emphasized. “Moreover, this effect on an installation with a designed fixed tilt of 30 degrees is more predominant in December than in June. This is because the center of oscillations is closer to the optimal installation tilt angle in June than in December.” Pitch movements were observed to have the highest negative effect in December and the lowest negative effect in June.
Yaw movements were found to have a minimal impact on low-tilt-angle installations, as the effect of orientation on such systems is very low. Roll movements, by contrast, were found to have a significant effect on the insolation on an offshore solar array, as they change both the actual tilt and orientation of the solar panels.
The simulation tool is described in the paper The effect of wave response motion on the insolation on offshore photovoltaic installations, published in Solar Energy Advances.
The same research group recently developed floating structures for offshore solar plants that are claimed to be robust enough to withstand central Mediterranean weather and cheap enough to be competitive with ground-mounted solar parks on small islands or in large coastal cities.

Queequeg, based in Brentford, West London, said it has formed a joint venture with Milan-based private equity investor Energy Transition Partners for the PV portfolio, which will consist of projects with generation capacities ranging from 10 MW to 50 MW plus an unspecified volume of associated energy storage facilities.
Queequeg did not specify how ownership of the ETP-QQR Energy Ltd entity would be split between the two investors, nor how much would be invested in developing the projects but did state the first 200 MW of solar capacity was “expected to enter planning shortly,” with the balance expected next year.
Although a press release issued on behalf of the British developer this morning stated backing had been secured for the full 500 MW figure, it also said the joint venture would fully fund a portfolio of “up to” 500 MW.
The London-based business announced plans, three weeks back, for 1.3 GW of bifacial, single-axis tracker solar in the U.K., with some associated storage, plus a further 2 GWh of standalone grid scale storage facilities, to enter the planning system “in the months ahead.”

The power plant, in the Mongla borough, or upazila, of the Bagerhat district in southwestern Bangladesh, will start supplying electricity to the grid next month.
Energon Renewables (BD) Ltd, a subsidiary of Bangladeshi industrial conglomerate Orion Group, has set up the 280-acre project at a cost of $143 million.
Some 250,000 Longi Solar Hi-MO5 modules were used in the project, according to MM Ahsan Huda, country manager of the Chinese PV manufacturer. Project manager Mehedi Islam Aneek said Switzerland-based ABB supplied all the other electrical equipment, including an automated monitoring and control system, weather monitoring station, transformers, ring main units, and a 33/132 kV substation.
Aneek said the project will be connected to the grid within a week and grid-connection testing will then begin. “The commercial operation of the power plant will be started in December,” he added.
Energon constructed the project on a build, own, operate basis and it will supply electricity to the Bangladesh Power Development Board under a 20-year power purchase agreement. No details of the price to be paid for the solar electricity have been announced.
Bangladesh hosts 776.37 MW of renewable energy generation capacity and expects to reach 1 GW next month. The nation has committed to having 4.1 GW of clean power capacity this decade under the terms of a more ambitious ‘nationally-determined contribution' which was put forward at the recent COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.

New Delhi-based renewable power producer Azure Power has announced it has closed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for the electricity to be generated by 600 MW of the 4 GW of solar generation capacity Azure secured in a manufacturing-linked project tender.
Under the terms of the 600 MW deal, Azure will receive INR2.54/kWh ($0.034) from the state-owned Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) over a 25-year period.
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The grid-connected solar projects concerned will be built in Rajasthan, the state which boasts India's highest level of solar radiation. Grid connection has been approved and the land is under acquisition with the projects set to be commissioned by December 2023.
Azure had secured an initial 2 GW of solar capacity in the SECI tender by committing to establish new solar cell and module production lines able to produce 500 MW per year of solar products. The developer was then granted a further 2 GW of solar project capacity under what has been termed a ‘green shoe‘ arrangement, in reference to the stock market practice of having the option of selling extra stock at a company float to exploit unexpected demand.
SECI had previously guaranteed a purchase price of INR2.92/kWh ($0.039) for the electricity to be generated by the Azure capacity but reduced the terms after subsequent solar tenders attracted a lower price for solar power.
Ranjit Gupta, managing director and CEO of Azure Power welcomed the power purchase deal, saying: “This is a significant milestone, given the long wait. With things now falling into place, we are on our way to see our 4 GW pipeline turn into contracted capacity and help us realize significant value accretion for our stakeholders. We understand SECI is progressing to tie up power sale agreements (PSAs) for further capacity in the tender and we expect to sign PPAs when the corresponding PSAs are in place.”
Azure recently announced it had received the letter of award from SECI for its first, 150 MW, grid-connected, solar and wind hybrid power project. That facility will benefit from a 25-year PPA at a fixed tariff of INR2.35/kWh ($0.032). The hybrid plant – which will feature 100 MW of solar capacity and 50 MW of wind turbines – is part of a 1,200 MW mixed technology tender carried out by SECI. The project will have to be commissioned within 18 months of signing the power supply agreement.
This copy was amended on 23/11/21 to explain why SECI reduced the tariff it had previously guaranteed for Azure's solar electricity.

The new company will comprise all group's business for the development of renewable energy, the sale of energy solutions, and the creation of a widespread EV charging network.
“Eni will retain a majority stake in Plenitude and will continue to support the new vehicle with proprietary technologies, engineering and project management expertise,” the company's CEO, Claudio Descalzi, said in a statement. “Through the IPO we are seeking to free more resources to deliver higher returns to our shareholders and additional capital for the energy transition.”
The Italian energy giant is currently planning to offer decarbonized products to its customers by 2040 and reach carbon neutrality by 2050.
It recently acquired Italy's second-largest EV charging stations operator Be Power S.p.A. In March, Italian sovereign wealth fund Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Equity (CDP Equity), which is administered by government-run Italian investment bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), joined forces with Eni and created a joint venture to invest in the renewable energy sector in Italy.

As the U.S. and global solar markets rapidly recover from disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a vision of optimal, resilient solar PV solutions to speed decarbonization and tackle the existential climate challenge was shared. Through a total of six hours of curated sessions that were moderated by Senior U.S. Editor David Wagman, U.S. Editor Tim Sylvia, global Editor in Chief Jonathan Gifford, and Associate Editor Ryan Kennedy, equipment manufacturers, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders shared their view of how to accelerate deployment in pursuit of national and global goals.
Session two focuses on strategies to deploy solar rapidly under a changing landscape. Watch here:
Garrett Nilsen, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office opened the second session, outlining the Biden Administration's clean energy goals with a focus on solar energy, and the related initiatives DOE is pursuing.
Next, a panel of four led a talk titled “Lead, follow, or get out of the way: What solar needs to expand.” Panel members who were interviewed by David Wagman and Tim Sylvia included Suzanne Leta, head of policy and strategy for SunPower; Dean Solon founder of Shoals Technologies Group; Elizabeth Sanderson, executive director of  Solar Energy International; and Paul Wormser, vice president of technology for Clean Energy Associates.
The group covered a range of subjects, including highlights of the DOE-backed SolarAPP+, an automated permitting app that is slashing residential solar permit wait times. A call for greater diversity in the solar workforce was shared, as only 30% of the workforce are women, and only 8% are Black. It also weighed in on how the U.S. may be able to expand its solar manufacturing base and over what period of time.
Michael Parr, director of the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance, spoke in a one-on-one interview with David Wagman and addressed the environmental footprint of solar. He shared that about 70-90% of global solar manufacturing is located in China, where solar has near double the carbon emission intensity in its production process. He advocated for a more dispersed and geographically diverse manufacturing supply chain. He said that market forces will continue to be the strongest driver in decarbonizing solar products and that buyers must actively select low-carbon module sourcing.
Following this interview, heterojunction module maker Recom offered a video presentation featuring Hamlet Tunyan, CEO, and Vartan Oskanian, advisor to the CEO. The company combines silicon and thin-film technologies in its modules and offers extra levels of transparency in its supply chain origination. Recom module whitepapers trace the location the materials were sourced from and track the total carbon emission output for each component in the module.
Moving from modules to energy storage, the Roundtables covered the emergence of the alkaline battery as a low-cost, safe alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Joining Tim Sylvia in the discussion were Ann Marie Augustus, co-founder and VP of operations at Urban Electric Power, and George Schulz VP of clean energy at Ariel Re.
Schulz said that project insurance underwriting has come under pressure from issues like a thermal runway of batteries, and new technologies are difficult to accurately underwrite. Safety of energy storage, in particular, will continue to be an important issue, and data transparency will be important in limiting risks for all.
The Roundtables then turned to the future and solar cleantech innovations in the drive to a decarbonized future. Taking part in this panel were Massoud Amin of the University of Minnesota, solar energy leader Karl Rabago, Chris Gordon, project development manager at EDF Renewables North America, and Marlene Motyka, the U.S. and global renewable energy leader at Deloitte.
As nations reach higher levels of renewable energy penetration on the grid, power distribution will become increasingly important. The panel pointed out that generation should be located near load centers for greater efficiency and reliability, but this comes with a set of high-land cost and zoning issues and NIMBYism. It was concluded that a blend of utility-scale projects and distributed solar would be both the lowest-cost and fastest way to deploy at scale while keeping resiliency and flexibility in mind.

The product also tracks power data via the company’s app, including available power, charging rate, temperature, and charging mode. Meanwhile, a series of social functions, such as a leaderboard sharing function, allows you to compare how sustainable you are compared to other users; and provides data to track environmental impact footprints.

The app displays the conversion of solar energy in KWh, while carbon emissions are expressed in tons and tree planting equivalents thanks to the partnership of Mango Power Union with One Tree Planted. The app further estimates how much you’re saving by utilizing solar power, in comparison to just using the grid.
“It’s a two-in-one solution. You don’t need to pay twice to get a home and a portable energy system. Its capacity remarkably exceeds that of other solutions in the market, ensuring a robust and long-lasting energy coverage. Finally, it has the world’s-first built-in dual PV inverter, which promises some of the fastest charging speeds in the market, either through AC wall outlet or solar panels,” says Steve Wang, CEO of Mango Power.
The product will be available for end consumers from November 23 on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo – where entrepreneurs debut their new hardware products – for US$2,799. Wholesalers, distributors, and installers should contact the company directly with their inquiries.
Mango Power has a further three new products in the pipeline: the Power Move, Power Home, and Power Home mInverter.
The Power Move, comprises a smaller module and boasts 2,000 watts of power and 2,300-watt hours of capacity. It is designed to be carried wherever you might need power. “When attached to the heavy-duty “Power Home” base module, they form the Mango Power Union and are stronger than any portable power station you can find on the market today. The Power Union also impressively integrate the backup gateway and dual PV inverter in the device,” says Mango Power
It continues, “When the family is out of power, you can use the main module alone or attach the power move to bring 4,000W/6,900WH emergency power to the family, enabling devices such as refrigerators, kitchens, heating or aircon to work as usual.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/23/energy-crisis-and-the-energy-transition/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 23, 2021",Energy crisis and the energy transition,"From pv magazine 11/2021
The crisis, felt to different degrees across Europe, is a consequence of several unrelated factors happening simultaneously. Global demand for gas has increased rapidly, while some gas and power facilities are offline, gas storage levels were lower than normal, and weather conditions hampered renewables.
Inevitably, the focus has been on the high energy prices for customers and, in some cases, energy retailers’ inability to pass these prices on due to regulated tariffs and price caps. This short-term focus is understandable, as is the need to protect vulnerable customers. But what are the consequences for the energy transition?
Our analysis encapsulates our customer-centric thinking and a distributed, joined-up energy system, not to mention the increased urgency required if we are to meet 2030 carbon goals and have a just, rapid and effective energy transition.
Retail energy markets are not fit for a decentralized, highly efficient, low carbon future. Markets today focus on supplying energy up to the meter. They need to integrate energy supply, self-generation, and efficient consumption for customers. They must align propositions, business models, and market structures around customers and their ultimate needs. In short, they should focus on providing services to customers in the most efficient, clean way.
The current market is built around the “old world” of wholly centralized generation, the energy system ending at the meter, and passive customers. Change requires a focus on outcomes and bills, not only on commodity prices. Energy efficiency and efficient consumption remain critical.
High-efficiency, low-carbon assets like heating systems can be provided together with energy to power them, giving lower lifecycle costs for customers. Flexibility, generating your own energy and consuming it yourself needs to be bundled together with energy retail into simple propositions for customers.
These types of propositions can be just as effective for vulnerable and fuel poor customers as they can be for those able to afford higher-cost new technologies.
Transforming customer engagement applies not only to energy retailers, but product manufacturers and more besides. It requires transparency and trust, personalized insights and advice, empowering customers to have more control and make well-informed decisions. The first phase of the energy transition didn’t hugely involve customers – the next phase will.
The energy sector has not done a good job of engaging with customers on their terms. But it has done an excellent job of minimizing interactions and relationships with said customers, meaning most have very little understanding of how they use energy, how they could use it more efficiently, and how they can better contribute to fighting climate change and the spikes in their energy bill.
We need customers to be a part of the energy transition. Now, the data, tools, techniques, and technology exist to transform customer engagement, but the energy sector, including manufacturers and providers, needs to embrace them.
We can start by empowering smart energy communities – local, green generation integrated with the provision of supply and services. These can even be partly, or wholly community-owned and led, building more resilience from inevitable future global commodity price shocks.
Matching generation and demand on a more local basis, from cities down to the household level, and exploiting locally available renewable energy resources to provide resilience against fossil fuel price shocks will be vital steps. Customers need to be engaged in a more bottom-up, decentralized energy system. Energy providers should be establishing partnerships with communities, providing the expertise, competence, and other resources which consumers lack; because we urgently need more demand management and flexibility.
The new energy system has different challenges to the old one – including integrating renewables with variable output. Reducing peaks in demand, and increased flexibility to better match generation and demand (in time and in space) will be critical to a successful transition. Solutions lie in demand reduction, reducing peak heating demand, smarter tariffs to incentivize a reduction in peak demand, and demand-side flexibility – as well as some traditional “peaking plants.”
Dynamic time-of-use tariffs have come into the spotlight too, with some continually high prices feeding through to customers. These can have a continued role with customer segments attracted to such tariffs, however, the risks customers take must be commensurate with the rewards and their ability to manage the risks.
We need the flexibility that plays into all parts of the energy value chain – bringing flexibility to wholesale energy markets as well as networks. What’s more, we need to capture the huge potential of flexibility from customers – both industrial and commercial customers and residential customers – and from a wide range of assets including existing and new assets.
The current crisis shows the need for long-duration flexibility, typically provided by large-scale natural gas storage. But hydrogen could play this role in the future, with green hydrogen able to soak up excess renewables as well.
Urgency and speed are key. We need to be making much, much faster progress to hit our 2030 and longer-term carbon targets and goals.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/23/australia-removes-much-criticized-dc-isolator-mandate/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 23, 2021",Australia removes much-criticized DC isolator mandate,"From pv magazine Australia
The Australian solar installation standard AS/NZS 5033 has now been updated, removing the mandate for DC isolators to be installed on household solar systems if other safety measures are followed. The changes will come into effect in six months.
The update comes after much lobbying from various corners of industry who claim DC isolators, intended as a safety measure to disconnect solar system’s panels in case of a fault or emergency, actually made systems more vulnerable to fires and faults. Committee El-042, the group responsible for the rule change, received more than 680 submissions during the public comment stage of the rule change after it closed in June.
DC isolators were mandated in Australia in 2012 through the Australian Standard for PV installations, AS/NZS 5033. This made Australia the only country in the world requiring rooftop DC isolators. Since then, they have been proven by inspection data to be the largest single source of conventional DC solar system failures. DC isolators have also been criticized for making the solar system’s installation process more complex.
While AS/NZS 5033 recommends owners have their PV system inspected regularly and annually for system components like DC isolators, regular inspections were not required under state and territory electrical safety laws. Another disadvantage of isolator components is that they can degrade from environmental exposure due to specific installation methods and product type, increasing the likelihood of water ingress and ultraviolet radiation damage and, as a result, DC isolators may need to be replaced within the life of the panels of a PV system.
Sandy Atkins, who co-chaired the rule change committee, said the decision was made to remove the DC isolator mandate in Australia though because technological changes meant the standard was now limiting for installers. “At the time the 2014 standard was written, solar panels were at most 250W per panel, but technology is quickly changing, and it’s not unusual for panels to be greater than 400W,” Atkins said.
“If you still want to use DC isolators then you can, but if you don’t, the standard allows for other solutions such as disconnection points,” Atkins said.
The committee arrived at its decision after comparing different requirements around the world. In addition to the DC isolator change, it updated several other rule components, including requirements for microinverter installations and DC conditioning units, which it says will enable greater use of technology across larger panels and support better safety outcomes. It also lifted the 600V limit for panels on houses to align with the international standard of 1000V.
Proud as Australia might be about breaking residential solar records year on year, the rise in installations has coincided with an increase in fires. According to statistics from Fire and Rescue NSW, solar PV related fires have increased five-fold in the past five years. Isolation switches have been blamed for causing almost half of solar module fires.

Maxeon, the international spin-off of SunPower, said it plans to launch its Air series of panels in Europe. The company’s chief revenue officer Mark Babcock recently spoke with pv magazine to talk about the Air series as well as Maxeon’s vision for U.S. manufacturing.
Among the company’s production line are two classes of solar PV modules, the Performance series, shingled bifacial panels with applications in utility scale and large commercial projects, and a line of interdigitated back contact (IBC) panels, of which Maxeon Air is just one.
The Air series, to launch in Europe, is a pencil-thin IBC module that lessens weight load on roofs.
The company selected Europe to launch the panel given the number of low-load commercial and industrial roofs on older buildings throughout the region, said Babcock.
The adhesive back-contact eliminates the need for racking and other balance-of-system (BOS) components to be placed on the roof. This opens the door for many roofs that would otherwise lack proper structural support to adopt PV, as the panels have a load of 6 kg per square meter.
Babcock said that unlike most panels, the module can bend and crack without experiencing significant degradation and without creating hotspots, allowing for more flexible applications. Babcock said he sees possibility in integrating the IBC panels in transportation and off-grid solutions, but, for now anyway, the focus will be on commercial rooftops.
Babcock said that thermal runaway and hotspots are curbed through the modules’ ability to share load with neighboring panels. The Air panels also mitigate installation defects that cause fires, like installing wires on the sharp edges of a rack or mount.
While Maxeon has no firm plans of launching Air in the U.S. just yet, its performance series panels are already operating under the SunPower brand. The Primergy and Quinbrook Infrastructure-backed 690 MW Gemini solar and storage project of Nevada will be powered by Maxeon performance 5 and 6 series panels, which are manufactured in Malaysia, assembled in Mexico.
Babcock said future expansion into U.S. manufacturing is being explored, but plans hinge on federal policy. He said a 3 GW cell manufacturing facility in the U.S. is waiting on a loan from the U.S. Department of Energy; it also may depend on the success of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. Babcock said that adoption of the bill would make U.S. expansion a more attractive prospect to Maxeon, and likely would draw in other industry players, as well.
Pending the DOE loan and the Ossoff bill, Maxeon said it may begin producing cells in the U.S. as soon as 2023.
Babcock also said that the Biden administration’s Build Back Better bill that was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives has language for direct incentives for both cell and module manufacturing. He said that the inclusion of an incentive for both would go a long way towards making the case for siting manufacturing in the U.S.
In October, Maxeon said it planned to convert its production facility in Mexicali, Mexico to manufacture shingled modules exclusively for the U.S. market.
The two facilities should reach a capacity of around 2.6 GW, Babcock told pv magazine in a separate interview during the Intersolar event in Munich, Germany. He said at the time that the facility in Ensenada was ramping up to 800 MW with the one in Mexicali planned for 1.8 GW of capacity.
Both facilities will manufacture only products based on the company’s mono PERC shingled technology.
Production should start at the two facilities late in the first quarter of 2022.
