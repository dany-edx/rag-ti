The three technologies will be integrated into a battery storage system which will be coupled with the Science and Engineering Facilities Council’s on-site solar array at the campus, with no further details on these systems specified.
The testbed will demonstrate AMTE's sodium-ion battery module using Brill Power’s battery intelligence technology to ensure optimal battery usage, lifetime, performance, and safety and Starke Energy's energy management system, which links stored energy into the electricity grid and markets. This is the first time that these technologies are being deployed in a commercially relevant project.
The energy storage system at Harwell is expected to be in operation from March this year and will run for a minimum of 12 months. In the project’s first phase AMTE Power will deploy lithium-ion cells before switching to use the company’s Ultra Safe sodium-ion cell technology in the second demonstration phase of the project.
“The ability to test our new products in a commercial operating environment is invaluable. Having access to the Hardwell site will accelerate the time to market for our new energy products incorporating our Ultra Safe cells” said John Fox, director of business development at AMTE Power.
Ultra Safe
Last year, AMTE Power entered into a licensing deal with Sheffield-based Na-ion battery specialist Faradion, which was recently acquired by India-headquartered multinational Reliance Industries. Under the collaboration deal between the two U.K.-based companies, AMTE Power was given a license for defined fields of use and geographies to manufacture and sell sodium-ion cell for stationary energy storage systems.
The idea behind the partnership was to use Faradion’s patented technology and leverage AMTE Power’s existing lithium-ion manufacturing facilities in Thurso, Scotland. AMTE Power has branded its sodium-ion product Ultra Safe due to improved safety and enhanced thermal stability, whereas Faradion’s patented zero-volt tech has enabled the Ultra Safe product to offer safer transportation and maintenance options for customers and users.
Faradion’s technology is said to provide similar performance to ubiquitous li-ion chemistry, while being more sustainable and affordable. Its technology is highly scalable and applicable in various fields, such as transportation, storage, backup power, and energy in remote locations. Set up in 2010, the company has developed an extensive IP portfolio to cover numerous aspects of Na-ion technology, focusing on three key areas: cell materials, cell infrastructure and safety and transportation.
Faradion says its Na-ion cells can be made on existing commercial Li-ion manufacturing lines. The operating temperature range is -30 to +60 degrees. “Our cell chemistry provides world-leading cell-specific energy of 150-160 Wh/kg for sodium-ion,” Faradion CEO James Quinn told pv magazine last year.
The project will also feature Oxford University spin-out Brill Power’s battery intelligence technology, which is supported by its proprietary battery monitoring and analytics software platform and said to be capable of improving all aspects of advanced battery systems, including performance, cost of ownership, reliability and safety. “This testbed will enable us to integrate our technology with other cutting-edge battery innovations and collect real-world data on a commercially relevant site,” said Brill Power CEO and co-founder Christoph Birkl.
Starke Energy’s energy management system will integrate the battery system with the local energy network at Harwell. The system, using artificial intelligence, learns how much energy is being produced by renewable sources, and how much is being used to optimize the storage and release of energy across a network of connected intelligent batteries.
The Harwell project is part of the Interreg North-West Europe STEPS program, which is providing financial backing and supporting small and medium-sized businesses to accelerate their market readiness. Under the program, AMTE, Brill and Starke have benefited from expert support provided by UK STEPS partners Cambridge Cleantech and the Faraday Institution. This has included tailored testing, introductions to potential end-users and market knowledge to strengthen the competitiveness of their products.
The Harwell testbed is one of 20 testbeds being developed throughout North-West Europe by a variety of SMEs, including a second in the UK at Allia’s Future Business Centre in Cambridge. It will use a battery system from English manufacturer Aceleron, which claims to offer world's most sustainable lithium-ion batteries.

Membranes are then used to extract hydrogen from these natural gas streams at the point of consumption. The resulting hydrogen has a concentration level of up to 90 percent,” the company wrote on Thursday.
French multinational utility company Engie and UAE government-owned renewable energy company Masdar signed a collaboration agreement with Fertiglobe, the joint venture between OCI N.V. and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. “Under the agreement, the companies will look to co-develop a globally cost-competitive green hydrogen facility in the UAE, with a capacity of as much as 200 megawatts (MW), to support the production of green ammonia,” OCI N.V. said Wednesday. The three companies will study the development, financing, procurement, construction, operation, and maintenance of the industrial-scale green hydrogen facility in Al Ruwais, Abu Dhabi, expected to be operational in 2025. Fertiglobe is the sole long-term off-taker. “The project marks another milestone for Fertiglobe's green ammonia portfolio and follows the announcement last month of our new 100 MW electrolyzer in Egypt,” Fertiglobe CEO Ahmed El-Hoshy commented. In December 2021, Engie and Masdar signed a $5 billion strategic alliance agreement to explore the co-development of a UAE-based green hydrogen hub. Masdar also announced that TotalEnergies took part in a Masdar-led initiative focused on green hydrogen to produce sustainable aviation fuel. “Senior executives from Masdar, Siemens Energy and TotalEnergies today signed a collaboration agreement on the sidelines of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) 2022, to act as co-developers for a demonstrator plant project, which will be established at Masdar City, Abu Dhabi’s flagship sustainable urban development,” Masdar wrote on Wednesday. The partners in the initiative have completed a range of evaluations. They aim to proceed to the front-end engineering design stage later this year.
Sweden’s nuclear power company OKG signed its first contract with an external buyer to enter the hydrogen market as a producer and supplier. “According to the contract, the first delivery of hydrogen produced with fossil-free nuclear electricity will take place in early 2022,” the company wrote on Thursday, not mentioning the buyer. Nuclear-focused trade publications wrote that the other signatory was Linde Gas. OKG has long operated a hydrogen facility adjacent to the plant site in Oskarshamn. The hydrogen produced is used to cool the generator at Oskarshamn 3, the only unit in operation after the company closed the other two in December 2016 and June 2017 for economic reasons. “This means that there is an overcapacity of hydrogen, which is now being used for other purposes.” According to OKG CEO Johan Lundberg, the volumes are relatively small, but will grow over time. “The demand for hydrogen will gradually increase, and we have received strong support from our owners Uniper and Fortum to develop this business opportunity,” he commented. Oskarshamn 3, which started operating in 1985 and should continue until 2045, delivered a record 11 million MWh (11 TWh) of electricity in 2021, according to Nucnet.
Hydrogen will prompt one of the largest shakedowns in energy history, said analyst group Rethink Energy in its latest report. “As more taxation is applied to carbon emissions, the rise in hydrogen production capacity will see it become the most cost-effective means of energy supply to sectors in all corners of demand,” wrote Harry Morgan, Rethink lead analyst. The emission taxation, together with investment levels, is the key variable to understand hydrogen’s future. In particular, the report suggests that green hydrogen will be cheaper than grey hydrogen in just two years. “By the middle of the century, total investment of $10 trillion will have seen the cost of hydrogen fall by over 95% from levels seen in 2020, spurring a 10-fold increase in global demand. In total, 771 million tons of hydrogen will be required per year as the world heads towards net zero emissions on this timeline,” Morgan wrote.
Cement producer Buzzi Unicem and Italy’s gas distributor Italgas signed an agreement to study the feasibility of power-to-gas systems in combination with carbon capture systems at production plants. “The study will assess the possibility of producing and using, in the most suitable Buzzi Unicem plants, synthetic methane obtained from the combination of green hydrogen produced by the power-to-gas plants with part of the CO2 released in the production processes,” wrote Buzzi in a note, without mentioning timelines or investment levels.
The European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative has announced the start of the third round of work on a vision for a pan-European hydrogen network. “The circle of participants now includes 29 gas TSOs from 27 countries across Europe. The work on the common European vision for hydrogen infrastructure will be carried out in the first half of 2022 and will include analyses of future hydrogen supply corridors for Europe and an update of the EHB map for a possible future hydrogen network in Europe,” wrote Danish gas company EnergiNet on Wednesday. According to the press release, new EHB maps will be published this spring. They will include the new pipeline routes submitted by new participants. The focus is now on supply corridors. Danish institutions and companies want a hydrogen infrastructure in the country before 2030. The first focus is on a connection between Esbjerg or Holstebro in Denmark and Hamburg in Germany. This week, EHB announced six additional members: Amber Grid (Lithuania), Bulgartransgaz (Bulgaria), Conexus Baltic Grid (Latvia), Gassco (Norway), Plinacro (Croatia), and REN (Portugal). “By broadening its base, this initiative has now reached 29 energy infrastructure operators covering 27 European countries,” wrote Gas for Climate.
Germany's Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW) and Ecoclean announced that their EcoLyzer BW project started in January. In the future, Ecoclean is to manufacture around 80 systems per year at the Dettingen site, which will then be made available for the international market. Production of the first systems is scheduled to begin in 2023, ZSW announced Wednesday. It would be the first series production of electrolysis systems in Baden-Württemberg. The state environment ministry is funding the EcoLyzer project with €2.1 million until 2024. The ZSW has been working for 10 years on the development of the technological basis for the system technology for alkaline water electrolysis (AEM) in the 1-megawatt power class. The electrolyzer will be equipped with two blocks each with a capacity of 0.5 megawatts. According to the ZSW, with an efficiency of around 70 percent, about 20 kilograms of hydrogen per hour could be produced at a pressure level of 16 bar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/21/optimal-topology-for-agrivoltaics-based-on-bifacial-pv-modules/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 21, 2022",Optimal topology for agrivoltaics based on bifacial PV modules,"Researchers at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands have developed an optimized array topology for medium-to-large-scale agrivoltaic projects based on bifacial solar modules.
“Bifacial modules are not recommended for all agrivoltaic projects worldwide,” researcher Odysseas Alexandros Katsikogiannis told pv magazine. “The benefits of bifacial PV arrays are most prominent in stilt mounted projects, where modules are elevated considerably off the ground at over 2 m, thus allowing plenty of light to be absorbed by the rear PV side as well. Moreover, when light demanding crops are cultivated, the amount of irradiance incident on the ground should be abundant which synergizes well with bifacial PV.”
For shade-tolerant crop species such as mushrooms, monofacial panels are preferable as intense shading is required, he added. Furthermore, as installations move closer to the equator the advantages of bifacial agrivoltaic projects diminish, especially for crops that can tolerate shade.
In the paper “Integration of bifacial photovoltaics in agrivoltaic systems: A synergistic design approach,” published in Applied Energy, Katsikogiannis and his colleagues simulated three different topologies of fixed bifacial agrivoltaic arrays, which were labeled as S-N facing, E-W wings, and E-W vertical, with the first one being south-oriented and the other two having an east-west configuration. “Based on our simulations, we can claim that E-W facing APV arrays offer a more homogeneous light distribution on the ground, which in turn allows uniform growth conditions for crops,” the scientists explained. “On the other hand, south-facing topologies are recommended for cultivation during summer as they cast thick shadows and are associated with an increased electricity generation.”
He also explained that the E-W orientation in combination with extended translucent covers may be a better option for high-value crops, like berries, and organic farming as it can provide protection from harmful weather conditions such as hail. In this way, the added cost associated with the extended covers could be offset by the increased revenue provided by these crops.
The researchers simulated the performance of each project topology and they found the S-N facing bifacial array was able to produce 39% more electricity than its monofacial counterpart, while the bifacial E-W wings and E-W vertical arrays had a higher yield of 18 and 13%, respectively. “E-W vertical is more appropriate for permanent crop species, while S-N facing necessitates the cultivation of shade-tolerant crops during summer as electricity generation is prioritized,” the paper reads. “The E-W wings topology combines the best of both; light is distributed homogeneously, and crops are effectively shaded at noon.”
“The E-W wings topology, however, is not applicable to all kinds of agrivoltaic projects,” Katsikogiannis further explained. “Lastly, by adjusting the cell spacing and subsequently module transparency the rate of photosynthesis under shade increased significantly, consequently promoting crop growth even under the climate of Boston, in the United States. Ultimately, this customized topology will outshine the rest when permanent, high-value crops are cultivated, especially in climates with low light conditions and/or harmful weather events.”
The scientist also highlighted that the calculation of albedo can be complex, particularly for agrivoltaics. “Normally, the albedo is altered by the optical properties of the surrounding landscape and the PV configuration adopted,” the research group stated. “However, in agrivoltaics, ground albedo will also be crop-specific, thus intensifying seasonal variation.” According to its findings, the reflectance of plants is higher than that of soil, thus we expect an increase of the overall albedo depending on crop species, crop phenological stage, and planting density. “In addition, crop architecture — canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and leaf arrangement — will greatly influence the amount of light reflected off the ground,” it also emphasized. LAI indicates the density of leaves in the plant's canopy, and it is thus directly relevant to the amount of light intercepted by the crop and subsequently reflected back.

Of this capacity, around 29 GW comes from distributed generation projects, with large scale solar plants accounting for the remaining share. Furthermore, the agency revealed that around 21.5 GW of the total capacity is represented by residential solar arrays. The country's cumulative solar capacity reached 306 GW at the end of December and 107.5 GW of this installed power is from distributed solar.
Solar module manufacturer Eging said its largest shareholder, Shenzhen Qinchengda Investment Co., Ltd., has raised its stake in the company from 21.65% to 30% through a non-public offering. Through the raised funds, whose amount was not disclosed, Eging will move forward with its capacity expansion plans.
State-owned solar panel glassmaker Luoyang Glass will take over management of two rivals as it performs due diligence of the businesses ahead of a planned acquisition of controlling stakes in them. Luoyang, which is controlled by the China National Building Materials Group, will take over management of subsidiary units of Anhui Shengshi New Energy Technology Co Ltd and Shuyang Xinda New Material Co Ltd until they are reorganized ahead of their planned acquisition, the glassmaker said on Wednesday. Louyang will receive 10% of the net profits of each company during that time, with a minimum monthly management fee of RMB50,000 (US$7,870) due from each business.
Solar developer China Shuifa Singyes and fellow state-owned entity HECIC Huineng on Monday announced plans to jointly capitalize a RMB360 million (US$56.7 million), seven-year fund to invest in clean power projects including solar, wind, hydrogen, energy storage and smart energy facilities.
Slippers-to-solar manufacturer Golden Solar has identified state-owned power company China Three Gorges Corporation as a partner in the project to develop a National Engineering and Research Center for High Efficiency Solar Cell Equipment and Technology. The heterojunction (HJT) solar cell market new entrant on Monday said Three Gorges would also work with Golden Solar to develop an HJT cell production line which would manufacture cells based on Golden Solar’s cast mono silicon wafers. Golden Solar and its “strategic partner,” fellow solar manufacturer Gold Stone Energy Co Ltd, were in November identified by China’s National Development and Reform Commission as two of three planned partners to develop the national engineering center.
Polysilicon manufacturer Xinte Energy says it expects a profit attributable to shareholders of RMB5 billion (US$787 million) from last year’s trading, up from RMB695 million (US$109 million) in 2020, thanks to bigger poly shipments which fetched markedly higher prices, as well as increased electricity generation from the company’s solar and wind projects. The unaudited 2021 figures include a RMB380 million (US$59.8 million) hit on the non-recoverable book value of polysilicon production equipment retired as part of a technical upgrade.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/21/australia-to-make-worlds-first-liquefied-hydrogen-shipment-to-japan/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 21, 2022",Australia to make world’s-first liquefied hydrogen shipment to Japan,"Australia is set to become the world's first exporter of liquefied hydrogen (LH2) after the Suiso Frontier docked at Victoria's Port of Hastings this week to carry 1,250 cubic metres of super-cooled (-253°C) liquid hydrogen from the Latrobe Valley to Kobe, Japan. 
The arrival of the Suiso Frontier marks the next phase of the $500 million Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) pilot project, which will see the specially-built carrier transport liquified hydrogen generated from brown coal, and is led by a consortium including Japan's J-Power and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, along with Shell, AGL and with the support of the Japanese, Australian and Victorian governments.
Despite the product's anachronistic fossil-fuelled origins, the physical transport of liquified hydrogen is a landmark day in the evolving hydrogen market. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the HESC project was a world-first that would make Australia a global leader, aiming to produce 225,000 tonnes of clean hydrogen each year in the Latrobe Valley. 
Of course, by “clean”, Morrison is referring to the project's carbon capture and storage (CCS) element, which will see the carbon dioxide produced from the use of brown coal captured and stored in the CarbonNet project's offshore reservoir in Gippsland. This “clean” hydrogen is therefore key to Japan's plans to reach “net-zero” emissions by 2050. 
“A successful Australian hydrogen industry means lower emissions, greater energy production and more local jobs,” said Morrison. “The HESC project is key to both Australia and Japan and our hydrogen industries… Last year, our countries affirmed our mutual ambitions and desire to work together to advance the development of low emissions technologies when we agreed the Japan-Australia Partnership on Decarbonisation through Technology.” 
“The HESC project puts Australia at the forefront of the global energy transition to lower emissions through clean hydrogen,” continued Morrison, “which is a fuel of the future.” On Friday the Morrison Government announced $7.5 million to support the next $184 million pre-commercialisation phase of the HESC, and $20 million for the next stage of the CarbonNet project. Although this funding is contingent on the Japanese and Victorian governments, as well as the HESC partners, providing funding as well. 
Australian Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said the arrival of the Suiso Frontier was an important milestone for Australia's “technology-led” approach to reducing emissions.” 
Taylor's Assistant Minister, Tim Wilson, added: “The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects hydrogen demand to double by 2030, and today's arrival of the liquefied hydrogen carrier ushers in a new era of clean energy exports to create new jobs and opportunity for Australians.” 

Of course, as the above IEA graph clearly shows, the demand for genuinely “clean” hydrogen produced with renewables via electrolysis will far outstrip the demand for hydrogen generated by fossil fuels and using CCS. And yet the Australian Government is not as keen to support green hydrogen as it is to make misleading statements based on IEA data. 
Of course, Australian mining magnate and Fortescue Metals Group Chairman Andrew Forrest remain adamant that green hydrogen is the only “clean” hydrogen. Talking to CNBC Forrest said that energy and climate ministers from all over the world approached him at COP26 to ask him to “tone down” his rhetoric on “grey hydrogen”. Forrest reiterated that he could not tone down his language on grey nor blue hydrogen because their emissions mitigation techniques are “not proven” and we have more than enough renewables to forget fossil fuels entirely. 
Indeed, the world's biggest CCS project is Chevron's Gorgon Gas Plant in Western Australia, whiwas last year revealed to have failed to meet its environmental target of capturing 80% of its emissions. According to a report by the ABC the project didn't even get close to its target, with one estimate suggesting the project only managed to capture 30% of the emissions they had promised would be stored. 
The Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton also maintains that the only thing CCS has proven to be is “very expensive and challenging to integrate into Australia's ageing coal-fired generation fleet.” 
“Australian taxpayers have very little to show for over $1 billion spent so far in support of CCS, and it would be a far better outcome to channel this funding into driving down the coast of renewable hydrogen,” he also said.
Climate Council senior researcher Tim Baxter said the revelations from Chevron's failed CCS project “highlights once again that CCS in the fossil fuel sector is an expensive failure… The result is no surprise. After decades of CCS research and billions of dollars of investment, there is little to show for it. Over the past decade, the costs of renewable energy like wind and solar have plummeted. Over the same period, CCS has remained extremely expensive.”
“There are still no projects operating anywhere in the world that have delivered CCS on time, on budget, or in the quantities promised,” continued Baxter. “CCS is simply an attempt to prolong the life of polluting fossil fuels which are driving climate change. We need to transition away from burning coal, oil and gas and instead power our economy with renewables and storage.” 
Fiona Beck, an Australian National University (ANU) Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions engineer, told The Guardian that while the physical transport of LH2 is an engineering milestone, the academic pointed to a recent co-authored peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of Cleaner Production which examined the emissions to be produced by the “clean” Japanese-Australia LH2 supply chain, and found that if the generating LH2 with fossil fuels continued Australia would simply be absorbing Japan's emissions. And that only a fully renewable process reduces emissions for both nations. 
Nevertheless, the Morrison Government believes that 225,000 tonnes of its “clean” LH2 will help reduce emissions by approximately 1.8 million tonnes annually.

In 2021, by contrast, Chinese manufacturers saw capacity expansion for wafers reach a total of only 340 GW.
“To illustrate, just in Q4, more than 80 GW of new wafer production capacities were stated by largely new entrants,” the consultancy explained, adding that there would not be sufficient demand for this additional capacity in the near future. “During the past decade there wasn’t hardly any period where the industry wasn’t facing over-capacities,” it stated. “The latter is rather the norm than the exception.”
Furthermore, AECEA revealed that, at the end of 2021, China's polysilicon industry reached an aggregate capacity of 530,000 MT, to which another 300,000 MT under construction may be added during the first half of this year. “Polysilicon prices shall stay elevated at around RMB 200/kg till summer and possibly fall to RMB 170/kg by year end. Starting Q1/2023, prices are expected to fall more rapidly and possibly sooner than later, prices again will hit previous historical levels of RMB 56/kg,” the analyst added, noting that solar module prices should reach a price level of up to RMB 1.75 ($0.28)/W by the second half of the year, which would be slightly down from up to RMB 1.9/W currently.
The analyst also provided some figures outlining the growth of the Chinese PV market in 2021, which showed around 53 GW of new PV systems were connected to the country's grid. “Knowing 2021 will be the final year able to benefit from central government subsidies, it is not surprising why residential PV systems grew 113% YoY (21,59 GW),” AECEA said. Distributed generation including another 7.5 GW of commercial and industrial PV systems accounted for more than 50% of the market share last year. The country's cumulative PV capacity reached 306 GW at the end of December, of which 107.5 GW is coming from distributed solar.
“Overall, C&I solar PV systems are expected to benefit most from higher electricity tariffs,” the AECEA further explained. “Whether the same logic applies to ground-mounted, utility-scale projects remains to be seen, given that land use fees in particular have significantly increased in certain provinces by a few hundred percent, thus offsetting potential gains from higher electricity tariffs.”
Looking forward, the consultancy said 2022 showed interesting signs of growth, with an unprecedented number of module procurement tenders being announced in the past weeks.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/21/four-terminal-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cell-with-15-5-efficiency/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 21, 2022",Four-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with 15.5% efficiency,"Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai have fabricated a four-terminal (4T) perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell that relies on a large-area semi-transparent perovskite cell with a metal contact based on copper instead of expensive gold for both the 4T device's top and bottom cells.
“Copper has been used with the aim of reducing the cell's overall cost,” researcher Manas Ranjan Samantaray told pv magazine. “A sandwich structure of gold-copper-gold is also being investigated to reduce cost without compromising the stability.”
The cm2 cell used for the top and bottom cells were presented by the same research group in September and is fabricated via a two-step spin-coating technique with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate; a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite layer sandwiched between a titanium oxide (TiO2) electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL) made of Spiro-OMeTA; and a copper conducting electrode. “Our semi-transparent top cell allows the passage of light above 750 nm and it is suitable for use with poly and mono-Si PV cells and modules,” Ranjan Samantaray added.

4T solar cells with different configurations were developed by the Indian scientists. One was built with the above-mentioned large-area semi-transparent perovskite solar cells with active areas of 1 cm2 and 2 cm2, which showed a power conversion efficiency of 5.07% and 4.10%, respectively, and a carrier selective contact (CSC)-based silicon solar cell with an efficiency of 3.42%. Another device was fabricated with the same top and bottom cells and a commercial crystalline silicon cell with an efficiency of 14.11%.
The first solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 7.31%, which is higher than individual cell efficiencies, and the second reached 15.15%, which is a value that the researchers described as comparable to existing devices utilizing costlier materials like gold and indium tin oxide (ITO). “In the future, we will demonstrate the stability of the devices, and a further few studies are required to step forward for large area module design,” Ranjan Samantaray stated.
The 4T tandem solar cell was described in the paper “Four-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells based on large-area perovskite solar cells utilizing low-cost copper semi-transparent electrode,” published in Applied Physics A.

As for the PV unit, its power conversion efficiency spans from 17.8 to 21.3% and its temperature coefficient is -0.39% per degree Celsius. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 47.5 to 49.6 V and the short-circuit current is between 9.22 and 13.22 A. The module can be used with a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V. The thermal unit has a thermal efficiency of 70% and an internal liquid capacity of 1.8 to 2.3 L. The maximum permissible pressure is 10 bar.
The module is fabricated with 3.2 mm front tempered glass, a frame made of 6005-T5 aluminum alloy, and rated for up to 298 kg/m2 snow loading.
“The solar thermal part can connect with a working station combining a pump and controller and a pressurized water tank to become a complete pressurized solar hot water system,” the manufacturer stated, noting that an extra gas boiler or heat pump can also be added as the backup heating system to continue to heat the hot water from the water tank in case the weather is not good or during a cold winter.

One of the biggest challenges for non-AI experts is the terminology. Artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and computer vision (CV) are frequently discussed, but people outside of data science fields often do not know what they mean. Fortunately, it is not that complex: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision all generally refer to the same thing, just with more specificity.
For example, if you are running a computer vision algorithm to identify solar panel defects, you are engaging in AI, ML, and CV. In contrast, if you are translating words from English to Spanish using an algorithm, that is more likely to be AI or ML, not CV.
Most AI inspection projects in the solar panel industry are typically CV initiatives. This means that an algorithm uses images to identify solar panel defects.
AI-powered inspection
The use of AI and CV in solar panel inspection is relatively novel. Traditionally, solar farm operators would use a team of workers to manually inspect solar panels for defects. This process is slow, expensive, and not very accurate. Every solar farm operator knows that maintenance visits are extremely expensive, and are simply not feasible to perform daily for an entire solar deployment.
To speed up the inspection process and improve accuracy, solar farm operators are turning to AI-powered inspection. This involves the use of algorithms that can automatically detect solar panel defects from images.
This process is much faster and more accurate than manual inspection. Additionally, solar farm operators can use AI-powered inspection to identify defective panels before they are installed on the solar farm, and after they are already operational.
There are a few different ways that solar farms can deploy AI-powered inspection. The most common way is through the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone. UAVs provide a non-contact way for solar farm operators to perform quality control of their solar panels using aerial imagery.
Images collected by a UAV over a solar farm can be processed by an algorithm either in the cloud or on-device. The results of the AI algorithm will tell the quality controller which PV panels have visible signs of defective equipment.
By using automatic defect classification AI, quality controllers can reduce costs by surveying their entire facility in a few hours rather than hiring someone for days to conduct maintenance. Moreover, automatic identification of defective panels can speed up inspection time with location-based tagging, thus improving efficiency.
The most common algorithm type used in solar panel inspection is a deep learning algorithm. Deep learning algorithms are a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a neural network to learn how to solve a task. Neural networks are composed of interconnected layers that can learn how to recognize solar panel defects from images.
These deep learning networks require training data, which are large datasets of labeled images. In many cases, the solar farm operator can provide these labeled images to the deep learning algorithm. Alternatively, an AI vendor can provide these labeled images off the shelf.
For the in-house approach, this is done by creating a training dataset that consists of images containing solar panel defects, and also images without solar panel defects. The solar farm operator will label each image as either defective or non-defective so that the neural network learns how to identify both types of panels.
Once the deep learning algorithm has been trained, it can be used to inspect solar panels in images collected from a solar farm. The neural network will identify any solar panel defects in the image and provide a classification (defective or non-defective).
AI challenges
While AI-powered inspection offers several advantages for solar panel inspection, there are some challenges that need to be overcome.
The first is the availability of training data. In order for a deep learning algorithm to learn how to detect solar panel defects, it needs a large dataset of labeled images. This means that the solar farm operator needs to provide a set of solar panel images that contain solar panel defects and a set of solar panel images without defects.
The second challenge is the lack of standardization in solar panels. Solar farms can install hundreds or even thousands of different types and models of solar panels – each with its own unique characteristics such as size, shape and color. Since solar panel characteristics can vary between solar farms, this could affect how well a single deep learning algorithm works across multiple solar facilities.
The final challenge is in the model accuracy of inspection results. Algorithms trained to detect solar panel defects will not be 100% accurate. This means that a small number of solar panels may be incorrectly classified as defective. However, by using multiple deep learning models (trained on different datasets), the chances of incorrect classification can be minimized.
Overall, AI is a very powerful tool for solar farm operators and should be incorporated into their maintenance routine. While there are some challenges, solar panel inspection using AI will increase efficiency and reduce costs.

It is an Innovation Action project funded by the Horizon 2020 program under the European Commission.  It brings together 15 partners from seven European countries to develop and demonstrate business solutions for a circular economy in the solar power sector. The CIRCUSOL project started in June 2018 and will end in November 2022.
CIRCUSOL aims to deliver circular PSS (Product-service systems) business models with real environmental benefits and economic feasibility, validated in five real-life commercial demonstrators.
One of the demonstrators is the Cloverleaf PV plant in Heusden-Zolder (Belgium). Next to the 2MW PV plant, the site includes a shopping mall with a restaurant, a fuel station, a covered parking for acclimatized Trucks that can connect when parked, and a charging spot for electrical vehicles.
Circular manufacturing (https://www.pv-magazine.com/q3-2020-circular-manufacturing/) was the focus of the UP Initiative’s (https://www.pv-magazine.com/features/pv-magazine-up-initiative/) Q3 2020 quarterly theme. We looked at if adopting circular approaches can create competitive edges and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. The work CIRCUSOL has achieved to date was also featured. Read our coverage
At the start of the CIRCUSOL project, Futech was already (since 2011) into an ‘energy-as-a-service’ agreement with the facility owner for the energy produced in the PV plant. Under this agreement, as being the investor, Futech remains the owner of the PV plant and is also responsible for its maintenance. The facility owner, for their part, contributes a monthly fee for the electricity consumed that is significantly lower than the grid electricity prices.
One of the objectives at the start of the CIRCUSOL project was to increase the self-consumption level at the Cloverleaf site from 22.8% to at least 50%. The increased self-consumption level was expected to be attractive for the facility owner since the tariff is lower than grid tariffs. The facility owner agreed to integrate the storage component and a new Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) was negotiated.
To determine the optimal battery size, Futech analyzed the evolution of the consumption level at the Cloverleaf site. Since the installation (in June 2017) of a charging spot for electric vehicles, consisting of 12 superchargers, the consumption level significantly increased as is shown in the graph below. Mind that the decrease in consumption in 2020 was caused by the closure of the restaurant during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Due to the integration of the EV charging station, the direct consumption level at the Cloverleaf site increased from 22.8% to 45.4%. Because of its favorable location nearby the E313 and E314 motorways, plans are currently being made for installing additional DC fast-charging stations at the Cloverleaf site which will for sure influence the self-consumption level positively.
This is why Futech decided to implement, at first instance, a relatively small second-life battery system totaling 84kWh. Such a system meets the minimum threshold of 300 battery cycles per year in contrast to, for example, a 200kWh system. Depending on the evolution of future consumption at the Cloverleaf site, the battery capacity can still be extended in the coming years.
After an intensive consultation round with Futech on its requirements, the 84kWh second-life battery system, originating from the automotive industry, was supplied by the French company SNAM. First, a battery rack of 21kWh (360V) was intensively tested in the Futech lab. Minor issues on the Battery Management System and the State of Charge were resolved relatively smoothly.

Originally it was the intention to integrate the second-life battery system on the DC side of the PV plant, according to the principle diagram below.

   Image 4b – Principe diagram after integration 2nd life DC- battery
Unfortunately, after consultation with the local grid operator, permission was not granted for DC integration because some new components were at that given moment not yet technically certified. A few months after commissioning, the certification issue was resolved. In case of any future expansion of the second-life battery storage system, Futech would opt for the implementation of DC technology because of its higher round trip efficiency.
During the month of August 2021, Futech successfully integrated and commissioned the second-life battery at the Cloverleaf demonstrator. Parameters like the number of cycles of the battery along with its health status are permanently monitored in order to get an indication of the expected lifespan of the second-life system. The first findings appear to be very promising.

An increase in self-consumption level, caused on the one hand by installing EV chargers and on the other hand by the integration of a second-life battery, allows the facility owner to purchase a fairly high amount of electricity from Futech at a rate that is approximately 30% lower than buying it from the grid. Futech in turn benefits from the fact that a larger share of the PV production can be offered to the facility owner at a significantly higher rate than when it would be injected into the grid, where prices are typically very uncertain (high volatility).
A crucial factor for the economic feasibility of integrating a second-life battery in a PPA with a commercial end-user is the investment cost of the battery system as it determines the rate at which Futech (the investor) can offer electricity to the facility owner. This cost is relatively high compared to new battery systems. Nevertheless, an acceptable payback time of 8.5 years was achieved for the Cloverleaf project. In addition, the facility owner could immediately benefit from cost savings and additionally engage in peak shaving (reducing peak consumption).

Fluence and ReNew Power, India’s leading renewable energy developer, have joined hands to tap the energy storage market in India. The two companies will form a 50:50 joint venture company to meet the energy storage needs of customers across India. The venture is expected to start operations within the first half of this year.
India’s Central Electricity Authority expects the Indian energy storage market to reach 27 GW/108 GWh by 2030, from just a few MWh today. The Fluence and ReNew Power joint venture, managed and operated by an independent management team and board, will cater to Indian customers by localizing and integrating Fluence’s energy storage products and packages in India.
The Fluence-ReNew Power venture will kick off with ReNew as the first customer of its energy storage products. ReNew will deploy the venture's 150 MWh energy storage solution for its 300 MW peak power project in the Indian state of Karnataka. 
Energy storage will be a key enabler for grid integration of large-scale variable renewables, as India is targeting 500 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030. ReNew, which has a renewable energy portfolio of more than 10 GW, has a head-start in India’s stationary energy storage space, with an intelligent energy solution portfolio comprising the 300 MW peak power project and a 400 MW round-the-clock (RTC) power project.
“India’s energy transition and its ambition to achieve net-zero by 2070 calls for strong and rapid storage integration with the grid,” said Sumant Sinha, chairman and CEO of ReNew Power.

Brisbane-based Endura, which plans to build modular hydrogen power banks using new electrolysis technology developed by Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), is among 22 businesses that will share more than AUD 12.2 million ($8.8 million) in funding to commercialize their ideas.
The grants are part of a government program to help Australian companies grow, commercialize innovations, and gain further investments to enter new domestic and international markets.
Endua has received a grant of AUD 998,269 to commercialize its hydrogen-powered energy storage solution designed to deliver sustainable, reliable and affordable power for the off-grid market. It plans to manufacture clean power generation and storage in a modular power bank that can drive power loads of up to 150 kW in a single pack.
The company will use CSIRO electrolysis technology to produce hydrogen in its device, which will store and deliver renewable energy. Batteries serve as backup, but Endua’s goal is to deliver clean energy that can be stored in large quantities, enabling off-grid infrastructure and communities to have self-sustaining power sources.
Endua Chief Executive Paul Sernia, the founder of EV charger maker Tritium, said the hydrogen-based technology will make it possible for regional communities, towns and industries like mines and remote infrastructure to become self-sustaining from the grid, using only renewables.
“Hydrogen electrolysis technology has been around for quite some time but it still has a long way to go to meet the expectations of commercial markets and be cost-effective when compared to existing energy sources,” he said. “The technology we’ve developed with CSIRO enables us to make the cost more affordable compared to fossil fuel sources, more reliable and easily maintained in remote communities.”
Sales of Endua’s power bank technology will initially focus on the off-grid diesel generator market, which accounts for $1.5 billion of diesel and 200,000 tons of carbon emissions per annum.
