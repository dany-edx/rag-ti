Vikram Solar, India’s largest PV module manufacturer with a production capacity of 2.5GW, has unveiled its module series 10 using 144 half-cut cells based on M10 (182mm) wafer sizes. 
The monofacial Somera series 10 modules have a claimed peak power output of up to 550W and a maximum power conversion efficiency of 21.33%. The bifacial Prexos series 10 modules provide a peak power output of up to 545W with a maximum efficiency of 21.13%. 
Both the Somera and Prexos series 10 modules are built using multi-busbar, mono-crystalline PERC cells. These feature a temperature coefficient (of open-circuit voltage) of -0.27% per degree Celsius.
The modules are designed for all types of PV installations, including residential, commercial and industrial, and utility-scale projects. 
Vikram Solar claims its Series 10 modules can deliver high performance even in partial shadow environments. Implementation of bypass diodes in split junction box series-parallel connections enables the modules to perform in partial shadow conditions. A higher number of busbars makes the PV modules less prone to loss in efficiency and increases tolerance to micro cracks. Multiple contact points on the cell lower the cell stress during module fabrication, leading to improved field reliability of the module.
The Somera series 10 monofacial modules have dimensions of 2,274 × 1,134 × 35 mm (89.53 × 44.65 × 1.38 inches) and weigh 28.2 kg (62.17 lbs). The Prexos series 10 bifacial modules measure 2,274 × 1,134 × 35 mm (89.53 × 44.65 × 1.38 inches) and weigh 33.4 kg (73.63 lbs).

The south-oriented project has been under development since 2019 and is set to occupy a total surface of 10 hectares across two plots. It will provide power to the municipalities of Bunnik, Odijk, and Werkhoven. The facility is expected to generate around 14.6GWh per year.
The approval process for the solar facility should be finalized by mid-2022 and the project is expected to be financed with the support of crowdfunding from local communities.
The project adds to the list of several solar parks being developed or constructed along Dutch highways. The latest four were announced by the Rijkswaterstaat – the water management agency of the Netherlands, under the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management – in June. These plants are being developed close to on-ramps and off-ramps of the A7 highway, which connects Zaandam, in the province of North Holland, to the German border.
The agency also plans to build a large-scale solar plant along Highway 35 in the northeastern Netherlands, and a solar park along the A37 in Drenthe province. Shell further plans to install 48MW of solar capacity near Rijksweg 59, a highway that spans the provinces of Zeeland, South Holland, and North Brabant.
The potential for Dutch highways to host solar has been highlighted since October 2017, when construction contractor Heijmans announced plans to install noise barrier-integrated bifacial solar modules along several major roads. Its first project, finalized in February 2020, was a 400-meter stretch of the A50 near the town of Uden.

The price of M10, 182-247 mm wafers has raised 5.1% to RMB6.15 per piece (US$0.96). Longi had begun to reduce its wafers prices in May last year and this is the first time prices have increased again.
Polysilicon supplier and solar cell maker Tongwei has agreed to buy 104,800,000 wafers with a size of 182-210mm from solar wafer manufacturer Shuangliang Eco-Energy. The products will be delivered between January 2022 and December 2024. The value of the supply agreement is estimated at around RMB6.3 billion ($984 million).
Solar manufacturer Yingli said this week its aggregate PV module capacity in Tianjin, Hengshui and Lixian has reached 8GW. In a statement to pv magazine, the company said 6.8GW of this capacity is already operational and the remaining capacity will come online by the end of March. Furthermore, another 7GW of capacity is currently under construction, 4GW of which is expected to be operational by the end of this year, while the other 3GW should be online by the end of next year.
Polysilicon maker and inverter company TBEA released its financial outlook for 2021 on Monday. The conglomerate expects net profits to be in the range of RMB6.8bn to RMB7.3bn, which would respresent a YoY increase of 173% to 194%. TBEA said the excellent performance is majorly due to the increase in both polysilicon price and sales volume in the past year.

Phase 1 involves the construction of an initial 290-megawatt (MW) facility, producing up to 90 tonnes per day (tpd) of liquid hydrogen through electrolysis, targeting the heavy transport sector. The location offers the capacity for expansion up to 550MW and 180tpd,” Woodside wrote on Tuesday. Woodside is reportedly targeting a final investment decision on H2OK in the second half of 2022, and first liquid hydrogen production in 2025.
Australian iron ore company Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and Germany-based supplier of high-tech polymer materials Covestro intend to enter into a long-term agreement for the supply of green hydrogen and its derivatives, including green ammonia. “According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), FFI and Covestro will formalise an agreement under which FFI will supply Covestro with the equivalent of up to 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen (GH2) per year,” FFI wrote on Monday. The deliveries to Asia, North America, and Europe could commence by 2024. According to Fortescue's chairman, the non-binding MoU is the “first step towards a broader strategic partnership to accelerate the green energy transition, particularly in energy-intensive industry.”
India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) signed a strategic partnership agreement. “IRENA will facilitate knowledge sharing from India on scaling-up renewable energy and clean energy technologies as well as support India’s efforts to advance cost-effective decarbonisation through the development of domestic green hydrogen,” the Abu Dhabi-based agency wrote last week. IRENA already underlined that many countries will need technology transfers. In its latest report about hydrogen’s geopolitical consequences, the agency also cautioned about investments in blue hydrogen. “Blue hydrogen is sometimes portrayed as a safe bet, because it allows producer countries to monetise natural gas resources and pipelines that might otherwise become stranded. But the expected cost reduction in green hydrogen coupled with stricter climate mitigation policies means that investments in supply chains based on fossil fuels (blue or grey) – especially assets expected to be in operation for many years – may end up stranded,” reads the 118-page report published earlier this week.
The Chilean Minister of Energy together with ProChile, the government agency responsible for the international promotion of the country, organized the H2V Commercial Mission to analyze multiple hydrogen projects from Chile to the Port of Rotterdam. The program will include meetings and visits to the main pilot projects, ProChile wrote on Monday. Several European companies, including Engie, Total, Enel, Siemens, Rwe, and Linde will take part in the events, which will take place over the entire week. “The Dutch National Hydrogen Strategy covers imports, so we are developing the necessary infrastructure to receive and distribute clean energy throughout Europe. But we also want to partner with key players in the sector and build alliances to promote production-focused projects that support our future suppliers,” Nico Van Dooren, Director of New Business at the Port of Rotterdam, commented in a press release published last week by ProChile.
Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE), the intermediate holding company for Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) Group‘s shipbuilding operations, expects to have the technology to transport hydrogen by ship by 2025, Reuters wrote last week. The company has reportedly developed a concept ship with an initial capacity of 20,000 cubic meters, which will grow in time as the technology matures. Also last week, the European Commission has prohibited, under the EU Merger Regulation, the acquisition of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) by Hyundai Heavy Industries. “The merger between the two South Korean shipbuilders would have created a dominant position by the new merged company and reduced competition in the worldwide market for the construction of large liquefied gas carriers,” wrote the Commission last week. KSOE is betting on the transportation and the use of hydrogen, LNG, and methane, announcing international deals and investments in different technologies over the last months. In March last year, HHI unveiled its Hydrogen Dream Roadmap 2030. One of HHI’s clients, Danish shipping company Maersk, reportedly ordered a dozen methanol-fuelled container vessels. The methanol could also be produced from green hydrogen. Several other vessels manufacturers, including Japan’s Yanmar, are developing hydrogen fuel cell systems.
Danish technology provider Haldor Topsøe has signed a €45 million loan agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to support its R&D investments in new technologies to support a wide range of energy-intensive industries in their transition towards a low-carbon future. “This funding will support our research into innovative hydrogen technologies that will ultimately enable our customers to produce low-carbon products for society,” commented Roeland Baan, CEO of Haldor Topsøe.
Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock talked with Ukrainian leaders about initiatives for the sustainable modernization of the country’s energy sector, including the development of the green hydrogen market. “After my talks in Europe and the US since I took office, my message today is the same: solidarity. In this difficult situation we don't talk about Ukraine without Ukraine,” wrote Baerbock after the visit in Kyiv. According to an article by Ukrinform, Germany will soon open a hydrogen diplomacy bureau in Kyiv to launch concrete projects “as soon as possible.”

French investment firm Eurazeo has agreed to acquire an 80% stake in Belgian solar installer Ikaros Solar from Omnes Capital and the company's founders.
The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Eurazeo said, however, that the deal is its first investment in the energy and digital transition sector for the decarbonization of the economy, a segment in which it plans to invest up to €45 million.
Ikaros Solar develops, builds, owns, and operates rooftop and ground-mounted solar PV power plants in Benelux, France, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. The company has already installed more than 200MW and has a pipeline of some 300MW of additional projects in development.
“In collaboration with Eurazeo SE, we will strengthen our development activity in order to deliver the pipeline in the years to come,” said Ikaros Solar CEO, Yves Devis. “The synergy with our expertise in PV system construction enables optimal value creation.”
Eurazeo wants to make Ikaros Solar a major player on a European scale by providing it with growth capital. The development of its pipeline and projects will be accompanied by targeted acquisitions, led by Eurazeo, which will give it access “to a vast network of companies as well as internal project structuring and financing capacities.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/18/best-fire-safety-practices-for-rooftop-pv-system-installations/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 18, 2022",Best fire safety practices for rooftop PV systems,"Researchers from the Universiti Putra Malaysia have defined a series of fire safety practices that solar installers should follow in the deployment of residential rooftop PV systems.
“Improper installation practices have been identified as a common factor contributing to PV fire hazards,” the research's corresponding author, Mohd Zahirasri Mohd Tohir, told pv magazine. “This human error may be due to an unintentional action or indeed a deliberate violation of procedure. The first, mainly due to inexperienced installers or simply slippery actions by experienced workers. While the latter, due to time pressure and their ignorance of the consequences of fire safety. Regardless of the reason, both can be attributed to a lack of fire safety knowledge.”
According to Tohir, the annual fire incident frequency for PV installations is 0.029 fires per MW. “While the figure does not seem alarming, however, with the surge in global demand of PV systems as a green technology, if the issue is neglected and not curbed, the failure rate is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” he said. “That is why our work is seen as important in developing safe practices and knowledge sharing on fire safety management during PV system installation as a lack of understanding of the associated PV fire risks can lead to severe long-term consequences.”
The academics systematically reviewed the fire safety practices described in 40 PV installation guidelines that are publicly accessible. These include publications from PV manufacturers together and installation guidelines, as well as best practices handbooks. “It is worth mentioning that more than half of the selected installation guidelines reviewed are from the national agencies, regulatory bodies, and national associations and mostly are from the United States,” said the research team.
The proposed fire safety practices were categorized into 10 groups considering different factors: general practices to ensure the PV system is designed by qualified contractors only; site survey including size, shade management, accessway, tilt, orientation and location; roof structure and material; marking systems for all PV equipment including PV input and output, conduit, cabling, inverter, enclosures, combiner, box, and isolator switches; roof waterproofing and flashing; electrical cabling and grounding system; array mounting, ventilation and PV panels; combiner box and connectors; DC/AC inverter; and DC isolator and other protection devices.
“Prior to PV system installation, it is important to conduct a site evaluation to avoid the shading effect and determine the best orientation for maximum PV system output,” the scientists said. “Besides, good ventilation and airflow around the PV modules may prevent the phenomenon of a hot spot.” According to them, many fire accidents originated from DC isolators due to the water penetration into the enclosure caused by ignorant practices during installation. “However, the number of publications highlighting the installation of DC isolators, such as the dos and don'ts, is relatively small,” they also highlighted.
The best practices were presented in the paper Development of fire safety best practices for rooftops grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems installation using systematic review methodology, published in Sustainable Cities and Society.

The 3 kW pilot noise barrier in Gyeryong, South Korea, went into operation in December. It integrates PV modules, solar-thermal collectors and airflow within the system to ensure that excess heat from the PV panels is conveyed to the solar collectors, reducing the PV system's operating temperature.
In the proposed configuration, the PV modules are responsible for power generation. The sound-absorbing material embedded in the system collects heat and absorbs sounds, while the thermal collectors recover heat and provide structural strength.
The system has a sound absorption performance of 0.83, which compares to 0.7 in standard noise barriers. Its sound insulation performance at 1000 Hz was found to be 37.1 decibels (dB), which compares to around 30 dB in conventional systems.
The sound insulation performance was based on the KS F ISO 10140-2 standard and the sound absorption performance on the KS F 2805 standard.

Due to an operating temperature that was 15 C lower than that of a reference system without the airflow technology, the PV system was found able to produce around 6% more electricity. The heat produced by the solar thermal modules was able to produce 400Wt perm². According to the researchers, this heat could be used for heating, ventilation, and preheating of hot water in public places such as waiting rooms, public toilets and restrooms.
“The total installation length of noise barriers in Korea is about 3,200 km,” said KIER researcher Eun-Cheol Kang. “The multifunctional PVT noise barrier system market is expected to be applicable to more than 1,000 km even considering the shading among them. I think our soundproof wall technology can be a good alternative.”
The research institute said it has already secured a patent for the new tech, with three more pending. The concept was developed with the support of South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport.

An Indian Ministry of Heavy Industries tender to develop 50 GWh of advance-chemistry battery cell manufacturing units in India under its production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme has secured bids for 130 GWh of capacity.
Bids were received from a total of 10 companies, including Reliance New Energy Solar, Hyundai Global Motors, Ola Electric Mobility, Lucas-TVS, Mahindra & Mahindra, Amara Raja Batteries, Exide Industries, Rajesh Exports, Larsen & Toubro, and India Power.
Under the scheme, the selected bidders will have to set up manufacturing facilities within two years from the appointed date. The incentive will be disbursed thereafter over a period of five years on the sale of batteries manufactured in India.
The PLI scheme for battery storage is designed to ensure greater domestic value addition, while at the same time making sure that the levelized cost of battery manufacturing in India is globally competitive.
“This is great news and a major milestone for the Indian energy storage and e-mobility industry,” said Rahul Walawalkar, founder and president, India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA). “IESA was anticipating two to three bids of 15-20GWh, three bids of 10GWh+, and another three to four bids of 5GWH to 10GWh totaling 100GWh+ capacity to be bid in the ACC PLI.”
IESA estimates the annual demand for ACC batteries in India will grow from less than 10GWh currently to more than 50GWh by 2025 and over 150GWh by 2030. Thus, the ACC PLI scheme will be seen as the foundation stone on which India builds a global hub for R&D and the production of advanced energy storage technologies, Walawalkar said.
“ACC PLI program also will kick start investments in the supply chain as the program has a mandate of minimum 60% domestic value addition for receiving the government incentive,” said Debi Prasad Dash, executive director of the India Energy Storage Alliance.
India imports millions of dollars of battery storage equipment per year. If advanced battery storage technologies can be manufactured domestically, the country will be able to significantly reduce its reliance on imports and become a key supplier for advanced storage technologies.

The package includes a 103MW solar plant in Troia, in the province of Foggia, and a 17.5MW PV facility located in the province of Bari.
Originally intended to sell power under a power purchase agreement, the solar park in Troia began selling electricity to the Italian spot market in June 2020, when it was completed to comply with a deadline set by the Regional Administrative Court of Apulia, which responded to a petition by the developer to reinstate approval for the project.
“The solar park in Troia is still selling power to the spot market,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. European Energy acquired the ASI Troia FV1, a special purpose company that owns the Troia project, in February 2019. The plant had been approved by Apulia’s regional government in 2011 when the Conto Energia feed-in tariff program was still running.
European Energy and Iren also announced that they have signed a partnership agreement to develop and build another 437.5MW of PV projects in the Italian regions of Lazio, Apulia, and Sicily over the coming years.

The active cooling system, which consists of a water tank and a spraying unit made with flexible PVC tubes with appropriate holes for water flow, is designed to spray water onto the module front surface.
The system is activated by a temperature sensor fixed on the back of the solar module that is connected to a microcontroller producing a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. This signal, in turn, triggers a Mosfet acting as a switch between the system's solenoid valve, which is placed between the water tank and the spraying unit, and the power supply.
The system was tested on a 36 W solar module and its performance was compared to that of a reference panel without the cooling technique. “This PV module has already completed a lifetime of 10 years,” the scientists specified. “It is tested with and without water spraying throughout the day at regular time intervals.”

The experiment showed that the module's voltage and current values varied with respect to solar radiation after water spraying. “The voltage increases with the increase in solar radiation unless the temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius,” the academics emphasized. “The current increases gradually with a rise in solar radiation, and there are small changes with the increase in temperature, which is negligible when compared with the voltage variation.”
According to them, spraying water over the panels increased the voltage at higher temperatures, while the current dropped slightly. The voltage increase was between 1.5 V to 2.0 V and the current varied from 0.01 A to 0.03 A.
Through the cooling system, the scientists achieved a maximum module temperature decrease of 20 degrees Celsius and an average temperature decrease of 10 degrees Celsius. They also reported an average increase of 0.5% for the panel's power yield and a maximum increase of 1.0%.
The research group sprayed around 15.6 liters/day of water over the modules at temperatures beyond 45 degrees Celsius, which in turn raised the water temperature to an average of 30 degrees Celsius. “The water with increased temperature is fed into the solar water heating system, which improves the water heating system performance,” they emphasized. “In the future, the proposed methodology can be used for the domestic PV power system with an integrated water heating system.”
The system was presented in the paper Design and Implementation of Automatic Water Spraying System for Solar Photovoltaic Module, published in Mathematical Problems in Engineering.

A major player in Australia’s clean energy landscape, Neoen, has secured the go-ahead for the first stage of its Goyder Renewables Zone.
The project now has development approval for 1.2GW of wind, 600 MW of solar, and 900 MW of battery storage capacity, making it South Australia’s largest renewables project.
Neoen CEO Xavier Barbaro described it as the most ambitious project in Neoen’s portfolio. “Boosted by now having 5.4GW of assets in operation or under construction, we are more confident than ever in our ability to achieve our target of 10GW in 2025,” said Barbaro.
However, Neoen is still a while off from realizing the full scale of its Goyder Renewables Zone vision, as it only just commenced construction on the initial 412 MW Goyder South Stage 1 wind farm. The project is set to be completed by 2024 and will connect to the Robertstown substation.
The future stages of the project will only be “unlocked” with the new 800 MW transmission interconnector linking South Australia with New South Wales. Project EnergyConnect is scheduled for commissioning in 2023 and will hopefully be completed by 2025.
The transmission interconnector will allow South Australia become a serious renewable energy exporter, with the state likely to be running on 100% renewables long before its target of 2030. In December, the state ran for a week on renewables which were significantly curtailed, indicating that the region already has surplus clean energy with nowhere to go.
The Australian Capital Territory’s (ACT) government has signed a contract with Neoen to source electricity from the Goyder wind farm. This will allow Canberra’s electricity supply to continue to be sourced from 100% renewable electricity in the coming years.
“This will allow us to accommodate a growing population, support renewable energy initiatives such as electric vehicles and transition our economy off fossil gas,” said ACT Minister for Sustainability Shane Rattenbury.
Neoen is developing the biggest pipeline of utility-scale batteries in Australia by a long shot. The company officially switched on its 300MW/450MWh Victorian big battery in Geelong in December. On the very same day, it announced plans for an 800MWh battery in Blyth, north of Adelaide.

pv magazine recently met with Discover Battery at Intersolar North America in Long Beach, California, to view the unveiling of Helios ESS, a lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery with use cases in off-grid solar, tiny homes, and RVs. The battery comes in 24V or 48V designs, with 60Ah and 30Ah-rated capacities, respectively. It has a nominal energy rating of 1.54 kWh.
Up to 20 Helios batteries can be linked in series and controlled by Discover’s Lynk II Gateway, a battery management system (BMS) that can dynamically manage charges and perform remote troubleshooting when connected with the internet. The Lynk II can be integrated with major inverters from Schneider, Victron, Sol-Ark, SMA, Studer, and more. The BMS is located in a cabin at the top of the battery unit for ease of access. When charged in a closed-loop managed by proprietary BMS, the batteries can be charged 25% faster, said Discover Battery.
Discover Battery said the battery case is designed in house, making the devices stable, especially when used in mobile applications. In remote, cold climates, the Helios battery employs its integrated self-heating layer for optimal performance. The battery also has an on/off switch for flexibility and energy conservation. It is now available globally, with shipments starting in February.
LFP batteries have a significantly lower risk of thermal runway compared to their conventional lithium counterparts, as they remove the key culprit, cobalt, from the battery chemistry. Helios is UL 1971 certified.
Discover Battery has been making batteries since 1949, and primarily works in the lead-acid space. The team brings 100+ years of combined solar industry experience, using that expertise to create a product that is sensitive to the needs of solar installers and service teams. Remote management via BMS means less truck rolls, and a removable BMS that does not require moving cells prevents the need for shipping lithium when repairs are needed.
Coming down the line for Discover this summer is its Element battery, a 5 kW LFP battery that can also be placed in a series of 20 and managed by Lynk II. This device joins Discover Battery’s workhorse, the AES battery, a 3.0kWh and 7.4kWh, 48V unit.
