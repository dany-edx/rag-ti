Under the Green Houses Program, project developers are entitled to one-time payments covering up to 50% of the costs of buying and installing renewable energy systems or heat pumps. Rebates can reach a maximum of €3,400 ($3,465) for heat pumps, €1,500 for PV panels and biomass systems, and €1,750 for solar collectors.
According to SIEA, the scheme will have a budget of €30 million for this year. In the previous phases of the scheme, which was launched in 2015, the SEIA awarded around €80 million of rebates to more than 41,000 installations.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had around 585 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2021 – the same amount it had at the end of the previous year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/20/considerations-for-solar-projects-during-heat-waves/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",,"JULY 20, 2022",Considerations for solar projects during heat waves,"As heat waves become increasingly frequent, people are starting to ask whether PV systems can cope with such high temperatures.
Extremely hot weather can affect different components of PV systems. Inverters can fail, the efficiency of PV modules can decline, and existing cell damage can become worse. High temperatures also require project owners to clean the modules more frequently.
However, investors, planners, and operators can adjust to heat waves. The key is to follow a number of guidelines to determine the relevance of heat damage in operational PV systems.
Andreas Kern, a technical consultant for meteocontrol GmbH, provided data for this study. Those figures have been coupled with analysis from the meteocontrol monitoring system data pool, which is connected to more than 55,000 PV systems throughout the world.
If an inverter becomes too hot, it usually switches itself off or reduces its power to such an extent that the higher ambient temperature does not harm it. This is known as temperature derating.
An example from the data pool starts one step before. It considers a specific warning message from certain string inverters, from a pool of 23,000 inverters across Germany, paired with around 1,300 PV systems. This table shows the average number of inverters per day, out of 23,000 inverters, that have reported issues with overheating.

Overheating warnings become more frequent as the average temperature increases. However, it remains uncertain whether this is a statistically significant relationship. In June 2022, the number of overheating warnings was 0.038 % of the inverters connected. But the percentage of actual failures was lower. There could be several reasons for overheating – ventilation faults, poorly ventilated sites, and high ambient temperatures.
The number of possible causes further reduces the percentage of weather-related factors. Analyzing the data pool confirms the empirical value that inverters can generally withstand periods of heat, if the installation site is suitable. Further proof of the heat resistance of inverters is the fact that PV systems operate successfully in southern Europe and even in desert regions. However, overheating reports should nonetheless be taken seriously to ensure that yield is not lost and that the life of the equipment is not shortened.
Does the module efficiency drop significantly during heat waves? A temperature rise of 3 C lowers the efficiency of PV modules by an average of 1%. As a result, the efficiency of the modules is several percent lower during the summer than in wintertime, although solar radiation is times higher in the summer. Accordingly, the losses from reduced efficiency are more than offset by the additional yield. Sunny heat waves are positive on the yield side.
A suitable installation site for the inverter needs to be found when planning PV projects. Smaller PV systems in the private sector are more likely to have less-considered installation sites. For instance, an inverter fitted to a south-facing wall or a battery storage unit with no shading will inevitably lead to overheating. But planning mistakes can also occur with commercial photovoltaic systems when inverters are mounted on roofs or at the edge of a row of modules without shading, and are thus at least temporarily exposed to direct sunlight.
There needs to be some shading to ensure that the inverter is installed in a cool place and the manufacturer's requirements and corresponding standards must be implemented. This includes distances from walls and between multiple units. When investing in a PV system, it needs to be checked whether the inverters have been installed in accordance with good professional practice when reviewing the planning documents and, at the latest, during handover by PV experts.
Adequate rear ventilation of the PV modules also must be ensured during the planning phase. Rear ventilation of the modules is very good on open-field systems and with raised-panel roof systems. By contrast, rear ventilation is generally more difficult on flat roof surfaces.
When selecting modules, dust-resistant coatings can also be taken into account, if appropriate modules are available. Theoretically, you could also consider the temperature coefficient when selecting modules. This figure is specified on the module data sheets. In practice, the differences between the temperature coefficients are minimal, as crystalline
Silicon PV modules are almost exclusively installed. In the past, there was greater freedom in terms of module selection when there was significant widespread use of other types of cells, such as cadmium telluride. Given the current material supply bottlenecks, minor adjustment of module parameters is hardly feasible in any case, as customers essentially have to take what is available.
If an inverter fails due to heat, first check the ventilation on site. For instance, provision will have to be made for shading if an inspection determines that an inverter has no shading.
Power losses due to temperature derating are more difficult to detect if the inverter reduces its power due to the heat. Lower performance is harder to determine by monitoring if the yield is below the target level. Temperature derating can be clearly diagnosed by analysing output characteristics.
Existing damage to the cells of PV modules is exacerbated at high temperatures. Accordingly, preventative measures become more relevant as the temperature increases, as they could prevent shading due to growth on the surface or dirty modules at an early stage. Thermal imaging is able to detect spot shading, hot spots or micro-fractures.
Heat waves are associated with drought. This creates more dust at some sites, which can then accumulate on the modules. Module self-cleaning also decreases with the absence of rain. The need to clean modules could increase in Germany to the current level in Spain. Some 2% to 3% of energy is lost due to dirt, which is why operators clean their modules once or twice a year. In most cases, natural rain is still enough to clean modules in Germany, as only about 1% of the energy is lost.
PV systems can still be operated reliably, even amid heat waves, with careful system planning, proper installation, and professional maintenance. Inspection monitoring processes should include heat-related sources of failure. However, if heat-related failures occur, the cause needs to be quickly identified and rectified to avoid lower yields, as well as technical damage.

The case claimed that BEIS had failed to comply with requirements laid out in climate change legislation (Climate Change Act 2008), and had only shown quantifiable policies to meet 95% of the legally binding target to reduce carbon emissions by 78% from 1990 levels by 2035. It said that the existence of the 5% shortfall or information about how it would be made was not included in reporting, keeping required information from both parliament and the public.
In his judgment, the judge found that BEIS did not take into account the quantitative effect on emissions of individual policies, and did not include qualitative analysis of which policies were relied upon to make up the 5%, both of which are required under the Climate Change Act 2008.
“The defendant had been unable to take into account and to decide for himself how much weight to give to the quantitative assessment or his department’s approach to making up the 5% shortfall, or to the contributions which individual policies are expected to make to reducing future GHG emissions and the risk of statutory targets not being delivered,” explains a summary of the judgement published by the High Court. “Consequently, he did not discharge his duty under s.13 [of the 2008 Act].”
The judgement also finds that the UK Net Zero Strategy (NZS) does not include sufficient quantitative assessments of the impact of individual policies on reducing emissions, and that this is necessary both to enable parliament to properly scrutinize BEIS policy, and for the public to understand how the government is moving meet the legally binding climate change targets.
Here, the judgment summary states that “the NZS lacked any quantitative assessment of the contributions expected to be made by individual policies to reductions in GHG emissions,” and that “the report did not reveal that the quantitative analysis put before the Minister left a shortfall against the reductions required by CB6, or how that shortfall was expected to be met.” CB6 refers to the sixth carbon budget, a report published by the Climate Change Committee which advises the government on the volume of greenhouse gases the UK can emit from 2033-2037.
The High Court has ordered that BEIS lay a new report including full quantitative analysis of individual policies before the end of March 2023. BEIS will also be required to pay the claimants costs, and has refused an application from BEIS to appeal the decision.
The judgement strengthens the role of the Climate Change Committee – an independent statutory group, stating that their advice should be given “considerable weight”, and the new report will have to stand up to its scrutiny, as well as that of parliament and the public.
“We’re proud to have worked on this historic case. Taking strong action to cut carbon emissions is a win-win. Not only is it essential to preventing climate breakdown, but we can also tackle the cost of living crisis with cheap, renewable energy, said Katie de Kauwe, a lawyer for Friends of the Earth. ““This landmark ruling is a huge victory for climate justice and government transparency. It shows that the Climate Change Act is a piece of legislation which has teeth, and can, if necessary, be enforced through our court system if the government does not comply with its legal duties.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/20/novel-busbar-free-cell-design-for-shingled-solar-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 20, 2022",Novel busbar-free cell design for shingled solar modules,"Scientists at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea have developed a busbar-free solar cell design for shingled solar modules to reduce silver (Ag) paste consumption. They designed the cell with a busbar-free electrode pattern, with the electrodes consisting of Ag fingers and busbars on the front side and aluminum (Al) electrodes and Ag busbars on the rear side.
“The new electrode pattern is expected to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of high-density shingled photovoltaic modules,” researcher Jaehyeong Lee told pv magazine.
The fingers collect the current from the front side of the solar cell and the current flows to the busbar, where it can flow to the outside circuitry. On the cell's rear side, the Al electrode moves the current to the silver pad, and the current can then flow through the soldered metal ribbon. The cell measures 156.75 mm × 156.75 mm and relies on 100 fingers, each with a width of 50 μm.
“The conventional electrode pattern has five front and rear busbars, each with a 1 mm width, while the cost-efficient design has no busbar,” the researchers said.
They used laser scribing and mechanical breaking to assemble the cells in cell strips and an electrically conductive adhesive from German manufacturer Henkel to bond the cells in strings, with each string containing 15 cell strips.
“The cell strips at both edges of the string have a pattern with busbars since the shingled string should be interconnected to manufacture a PV module,” they said, noting that the shingled strings were connected to each other via a tabbing and busing process. “The manufacturing method is the same as that of the conventional module, except for the laser scribing and ECA bonding processes to produce a shingled string.”
The research team assembled the strings in an experimental laminated and framed shingled PV module. After a series of measurements, they found that its performance was almost the same as that of a reference shingled panel built with a conventional cell design.
“The difference in the output power between the two types of modules is only 0.5 W, which could be negligible given the measurement error range,” they said, adding that the main advantage of the busbar-free cell is a 61.33% reduction in silver consumption.
The South Korean group described the cell design in “Busbar-free electrode patterns of crystalline silicon solar cells for high density shingled photovoltaic module,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. “The most important advantage of the busbar-free electrode pattern presented in this work is the cost reduction,” they said.

The company conducted the tests between February 2021 and February 2022. The results were confirmed by Germany's TÜV Nord. The testing location has an annual average temperature of 8 C and an annual average solar radiation of 2,800 to 3,000 hours with a solar spectrum very close to the standard illumination conditions (AM1.5).
The testing field comprised a 6 kW unit equipped with n-type panels and a 6 kW unit relying on p-type products, with an inverter of 20 kW being connected to both sets. The panels were installed on fixed structures with a tilt angle of 40 degrees and at a height of 1 meter above the ground.
The company measured the performance of the array via an environmental monitoring system, a double-sided irradiance meter, a high-precision DC meter, and a temperature sensor. It exclusively used data from the DC meter for the assessment.
JA Solar found that the daily average energy yield of the n-type and p-type panels was 5.03 kWh/kW and 4.84 kWh/kW, respectively, which means n-type modules had a 3.9% higher energy yield compared to their counterparts.
“While both types of modules are based on half-cut bifacial solar cells, the energy yield difference is mainly due to cell technology performance,” said the manufacturer.
The company said the n-type modules operated at an average temperature that was 1 C lower than that of the p-type panels, by virtue of their lower temperature coefficient of -0.3% per degree Celsius, which compares to -0.35% per degree Celsius for the p-type products.
“The n-type module has 80% bifaciality which is much higher than the 70% of PERC modules,” the company said. “Assuming irradiance under the rear side is 100 W/m2 to 150 W/m2 condition, the 10% bifaciality difference can bring n-type module energy gain 1%~1.5%, when the albedo is 20%~30%. The PVsyst simulation shows 0.8%~1.2% more power generation can be seen due to this factor.”
JA Solar released its first line of solar modules based on n-type wafers in May.

Octopus Australia’s two new funds, one for institutional investors and the other for wholesale investors, will provide money for a multibillion-dollar Australian renewable energy portfolio. It says it currently has a secured portfolio of AUD 3 billion ($2 billion) across wind, solar and storage, with a visible pipeline for an additional AUD 5 billion.
The platform for institutional investors, named the Octopus Australia Sustainable Investments (OASIS) Fund, has already secured a AUD 75 million commitment from the Commonwealth government’s Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC), as well as from superannuation fund Hostplus and Octopus Renewables’ Sky Fund, backed by European institutional investors.
Alongside the second fund for wholesale investors, named Octopus Renewable Energy Opportunities (OREO), the platforms are set up to manage Australia’s energy transition and will finance the entire renewable energy life cycle, says Octopus Australia.

Ohio-based Roll-A-Rack announced it has developed a roll-forming solar racking system that captures rainfall on solar panels. Harvested rainwater can be used for irrigation. The product is designed for flat roofs or ground-mounted systems. 
The compact system requires only 11 inches between rows of panels, significantly cutting down the amount of space that is normally required for erosion control by planting vegetation. The company said the solution requires half the land to produce the same amount of energy as conventional racking systems.
The product is currently under development and was launched by a Small Business Innovation Grant from the US Department of Energy Solar Technologies Office. Don Scipione, the president of Roll-A-Rack, will introduce the innovation in a presentation on Aug. 24 in Columbus, Ohio.
The rain-harvesting feature of the rack is part of Roll-A-Rack’s innovative design. The design has direct implications for membrane flat roofs, which are generally unable to house solar arrays.
To avoid damaging the structural integrity of a membrane roof, the company installs a 12-inch metal channel rack that is distributed across existing roof ballast, while securing the solar panels. The rack can be as thin as 22-gauge, and roll-formed.
Roll-A-Rack said its solution reduces the racking and installation costs of traditional systems by 30%. It said the material costs are 50% less than conventional racking systems, and that installation times and labor costs are reduced by 65%. 
The company is currently taking applications for beta testers of the product, with applications ending in July. The first 100 kW of racking will be provided for free, and staff will be trained at no cost. The test site will become a case study for the company, and the facility may be used for marketing purposes.

The cell has a p-i-n structure and relies on nickel-plated steel coated with a polyamide-imide (PAI) planarization layer, which serves as an insulating layer. The researchers used an opaque titanium electrode covered with a thin sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) layer to enable the binding of the phosphonic acid anchoring groups of the monolayer based on a perovskite known as 2PACz, which serves as a hole-collecting electrode.

They also used buckminsterfullerene, a molecule which is also known as C60, for the fabrication of the ETL. They also added a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, via atomic layer deposition (ALD), to prevent damage to the underlying stack during sputter deposition of the transparent ITO top electrode.
The performance of the solar cell was compared under standard illumination conditions to that of two reference devices built on a glass substrate and a glass superstructure, respectively. The latter showed a power conversion efficiency of 19.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.13 V, a short-circuit current of 20.8 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 0.81.
The cell on the steel substrate reached an efficiency of 16.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V, a short-circuit current of 19.9 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 0.75. The device based on the glass substrate exhibited an efficiency of 15.8%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V, a short-circuit current of 19.8 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 0.72.
“This demonstrates that substrate-configuration cells fabricated on the Ni-plated steel substrate can reach similar performance levels as those made on glass,” the scientists said. “Strategies to further increase the PCE of substrate-configuration cells can therefore focus on reducing the optical losses in the ETL, enhancing the reflection of the bottom electrode, and using a less resistive transparent top contact.”
They presented their findings in “p–i–n Perovskite Solar Cells on Steel Substrates,” which was recently published in ACS Publications. The group includes researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), and Indian steel manufacturer Tata Steel.
