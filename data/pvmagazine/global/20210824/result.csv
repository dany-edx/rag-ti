The strategy has set an installation target of 57 GW for solar and an overall renewables target of 90 GW during that time. China National Energy Administration (NEA) statistics indicate the province had 22 GW of solar at the end of 2020.
Module manufacturer JA Solar shipped 10 GW of modules in the first six months of the year, to raise RMB5 billion (US$770 million) for new production facilities. The company posted revenue of RMB16.2 billion (US$2.5 billion), for a year-on-year increase of 48.8%. Net profit was RMB710 million (US$109 million), only 1.78% more than in the same period of last year. The company said it shipped 4.46 GW of modules in the first quarter and 5.66 GW in April-to-June. Of those, around 63% went overseas. JA Solar also announced RMB5 billion plans for a non-public offering of stock to finance 20 GW of solar ingot and wafer production capacity in Qujing city, Yunan province and an R&D center in Yangzhou city, Jiangsu.
Solar developer Shunfeng International yesterday announced it expects a loss of up to RMB42 million (US$6.47 million) from the first six months of the year, down from the RMB469 million (US$72.3 million) shed in the same period a year earlier. While first-half finance costs came down from the RMB453 million posted in January-to-June last year, to RMB290 million (US$44.7 million), the company recorded impairments and losses on disposal totalling RMB246 million (US$37.9 million) on the sale of 17 solar projects which affected the latest six-month figures.
State-owned energy company China Resources Power Holdings said on Friday it had filed papers with energy authorities for a record 16.7 GW of solar projects during the first half of the year. The company said 241 MW of solar capacity had entered commercial operation in the same period, as its operational solar fleet reached 803 MW. The utility, which has 32.13 GW of thermal power plants, wants to have renewables make up more than half of its energy mix by the end of 2025 and is planning to add 40 GW of clean energy capacity before that point.

Last month, the Sansepolcro-Sulmona hydrogen railroad project passed a pre-selection phase held by the European Commission.
Ukrainian energy company NJSC Naftogaz and German energy trader RWE Supply & Trading have agreed to explore cooperation in the green hydrogen industry and derivatives such as ammonia, produced in Ukraine. “This includes the development of green hydrogen and ammonia production and storage in Ukraine and its import to Germany,” said a note issued by RWE on Sunday. “This focus is particularly relevant in the context of the H2Global initiative launched by the German government for green hydrogen imports produced outside the EU.” Naftogaz and RWE intend to explore commercial opportunities to sell Ukrainian green hydrogen in Europe. “Ukraine has great potential for the development of the hydrogen economy in cooperation with Germany,” said Naftogaz CEO Yuriy Vitrenko. “As a national company, Naftogaz is ready to be a pillar of this development. We consider green hydrogen as our strategic priority and we are happy to work on it with RWE, our reliable partner in trade and natural gas supplies.”
The Port of Tallinn wants to be the hub of Baltic Sea green infrastructure in Estonia and is betting on a green energy ecosystem in the industrial parks of Muuga Harbour and Paldiski South Harbour. “The plan of building a hydrogen terminal could be attractive for the industries that do not produce energy themselves but would like to take part in the green revolution and rebuild their production,” said Margus Vihman, the port's chief commercial officer, on Monday. “We are developing an attractive value proposition for both local and international investors.” The Port of Tallinn will seek EU backing while collaborating with hydrogen players such as the Netherlands and the Port of Hamburg.
The Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) has presented a 63-point hydrogen strategy to develop regional hydrogen hubs where production and demand will be co-located. The plan also includes financial support, especially for research, and focuses on heavy-duty transport powered by green hydrogen as well as the blue form of the gas generated by natural gas equipped with carbon capture and storage tech. “Unlike most other jurisdictions, BC has the resources to produce both green and blue hydrogen with low carbon intensity,” stated the strategy document. “More than 98% of BC's electricity is renewable, allowing us to leverage our clean electricity to produce green hydrogen via electrolysis. BC also has low-cost natural gas reserves, significant geological storage capacity and expertise in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.”
Anglo-Australian metals and mining major Rio Tinto and Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo Corporation have announced a partnership to study the construction of a hydrogen pilot plant at the former's Yarwun alumina refinery in Gladstone, in the Australian state of Queensland, and to explore the use of hydrogen at the refinery. “Reducing the carbon intensity of our alumina production will be key to meeting our 2030 and 2050 climate targets,” Rio Tinto Australia chief executive Kellie Parker said today. “There is clearly more work to be done but partnerships and projects like this are an important part of helping us get there.” The miner said the partnership complements a recently announced feasibility study into using hydrogen to replace natural gas for alumina refining at Yarwun. “Gladstone's world-class deep water port, water security through Awoonga Dam, and industry attraction via the local state development area, have set Gladstone up to become the hydrogen capital of Australia,” said Queensland's minister for regional development and manufacturing and minister for water, Glenn Butcher.
German hydrogen fuel cell developer Proton Motor has teamed up with automated production line maker Aumann to expand series production of hydrogen fuel cells. “The so-called ‘stack robot' is to expand the production capacity to up to 2,500 fuel cell units per year,” the companies said in a statement yesterday. “In the Proton Motor system, graphite bipolar plate stacks are embedded in a module as the core.” Under the arrangement, Aumann will convert the Fit-4-AMandA machine prototype into an automatic fuel cell stack production plant.
Indian renewables company ACME Group has signed a land agreement to construct one of the world's largest green ammonia projects at the special economic zone at the Port of Duqm, in Oman. The deal was signed with an Omani government authority, it was announced yesterday. “We plan to start the construction at Oman as soon we commission our first green hydrogen and green ammonia plant at Bikaner in India,” said ACME founder and chairman Manoj Upadhyay. “The plant in Oman would be developed in phases and the first phase is likely to be commissioned by [the] end of 2022.” The Oman Company for the Development of the Special Economic Zone at Duqm (Tatweer) and ACME in March agreed to develop a large-scale facility to produce renewable hydrogen and ammonia. “The plant will be an integrated facility using 3 GWp of solar and 0.5 GWp of wind energy to produce 2,400 TPD [tons per day] of green ammonia, with an annual production of approx[imately] 0.9 million tons,” stated the project partners. “This would be the first facility of this scale to be operational by 2022. The facility is being built to export green ammonia to demand centers like Europe and Asia, with an investment of approx[imately] $3.5 billion.”

With the consultancy having recorded $210 million of venture capital and private equity backing across 14 solar deals in the first half of last year, the figure leapt up to $1.6 billion and 26 deals in the first six months of this year, with 14 arrangements worth a total $1 billion arriving in the January-to-March window.
That private backing was part of total corporate funding of $13.5 billion for solar from January to the end of June, up from $4.6 billion a year earlier, according to Mercom, with $8.1 billion committed in the first three months of the year.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The Austin-based consultant said Californian firms accounted for three of the five largest venture capital and private equity deals signed in the first half, with residential solar finance business Loanpal – now GoodLeap – having secured $800 million, and San Fran-based small-scale PV design software company Aurora Solar receiving $250 million. Oregon-headquartered zero-carbon power business Intersect Power banked $127 million, Indian distributed-solar company Fourth Partner Energy raised $125 million, and concentrated solar power entity Heliogen was the third Californian firm on the list, after receiving $108 million, according to Mercom.
Public stock market investors were equally keen on solar's prospects, according to the report, with the $758 million raised in six public deals in the first half of last year rocketing to $3.7 billion across 13 transactions this time around, with eight of them – worth $2.8 billion – coming in the first three months of the year.
Solar lending rose from $3.7 billion, in 13 credit lines, during the first half of 2020, to $8.2 billion across 32 loans in January-to-June this year, with $4.3 billion lent in 14 first-quarter arrangements.
Merger and acquisition activity is hotting up in the sector, according to Mercom, which observed 54 transactions in the first half of this year – 34 of them in the April-to-June window – up from 25 in the first half of 2020.
And 135 large scale solar projects changed hands in the first half, with 14.6 GW of generation capacity bought in the first quarter and more than 24 GW in the last three-month period. Those figures compared with a Mercom total of 91 deals in the first six months of 2020, as 14.7 GW of capacity was sold.
In terms of fund announcements, Mercom reported $15.1 billion worth of new renewables-focused cash piles in the second quarter alone, and said two new residential and commercial solar funds were launched in the last quarter, after the first three months of the year had passed without any announcements.

France's National Commission for Public Debate (CNDP) validated on July 28 the project management report of the Horizeo mega-solar-plus-storage project in Saucats, in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France.
Under development by French energy giant Engie and Paris-based independent power producer Neoen, the €1 billion unsubsidized project comprises a green hydrogen production unit, an agrivoltaic plant, and a data center.
The CNDP said that the public debate on the project will be kicked off on September 9 and will be finalized on January 9. Within this time frame, six major public meetings will be held in Gironde. The commission will also set up around 20 “contact points” on an ad hoc basis in the public space such as markets, squares, shopping centers, sports and cultural facilities. In addition, several thematic workshops will take place to discuss the economic and social impacts of the project or even allow “skeptical and critical citizens” to make alternative proposals.
According to information provided by the CNDP, the 1 GW PV plant will represent the largest part of the investment — €650 million — and could be the largest in Europe in terms of installed capacity and surface area, covering more than 900 hectares. It is planned to be located a few kilometers from the current largest photovoltaic park in France, the 300 MW Cestas project.
The electricity produced by the huge complex would be sold to final industrial clients through power purchase agreements. According to the French authorities, its sizing “would make it possible to produce abundant and competitive electricity and also constitute a lever for the development of other future technologies.”
The data center, which represents 20% of the investment, will be managed by Engie and provide digital services to businesses. Located near the photovoltaic park on an area of 2.5 hectares, it could be supplied 100% with renewable energies, of which at least 20% could be supplied directly by the PV plant.
The project will also rely on a 40 MW Li-ion battery storage unit managed by Neoen, which, according to the owner, would contribute to the stability and regulation of the electricity network. The investment is estimated at €20 million.
The project also comprises a green hydrogen production unit with a capacity of around 10 MW, managed by Engie. The marketing model for the hydrogen produced is not defined at this stage; contacts with communities likely to be interested have not yet been made. The investment is estimated at €40 million.
Finally, an area of 10 to 25 hectares would be dedicated to agricultural production under photovoltaic panels. This production would aim to supply school restaurants in the town of Saucats (or even beyond) with fruit and vegetables in short circuits.The investment is estimated at €10 million.
Environmental associations claim that the Horizeo project will require authorization to clear a 1,000-hectare wooded plot reserved for forestry. The project leaders have justified the location because of its proximity to a nearby substation in Saucats that has a higher availability of electricity injection at 1 GW, “which is exceptional on a national scale.”
No doubt this controversial point will be one of the most discussed during the debates.

Spanish solar tracker provider Soltec and Germany’s TÜV Rheinland have published a technical report stating that Soltec's TeamTrack system and Diffuse Booster algorithm can increase the yield of a photovoltaic solar plant by up to 5.3% on regular Mediterranean latitude land.
The objective of the Soltec Diffuse Booster algorithm is to increase the production of PV plants on cloudy days, that is, when there is more diffuse than direct irradiation. The algorithm, which uses both sensors and weather forecasts, moves the trackers to the optimal position in order to capture the maximum solar irradiation.
TÜV Rheinland has observed that activating this algorithm increases Basic TeamTrack's energy performance by 5.3% at Mediterranean and equatorial sites, achieving a gain of 6.9% at northern latitudes. The Diffuse Booster is also claimed to optimize performance during totally cloudy days, with increases in power generation of up to 12.4% for a single day.
In the Mediterranean, Equatorial and Northern regions the gains compared to standard trackers are 2.5%, 1.3% and 3.8%, respectively. Specifically, taking into account the different climates and energy prices, the implementation of TeamTrack in a 100 MWp photovoltaic plant should mean an increase in annual income of about €1.8 million in Spain, where the price of the energy is €32/MWh; and €668,000 in Brazil, with an energy price of €30/MWh. In northern latitudes, such as Germany, where the price of energy is €48.8/MWh, these revenues can reach more than €2 million, Soltec said in a statement.

According to the researchers, directly integrating batteries in these systems without adding power management electronics would help smoothen PV power fluctuation and, simultaneously, stabilize the performance of the EC components. “This combination can be considered as a basic unit of a PV-driven power source with both short-term and long-term energy storage functions,” they stated.
In the proposed system configuration, the PV cell is connected in parallel to the EC unit and the battery. The latter can shift working point towards lower working point voltage, which the German group describes as having high relevance for solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. “We can see that battery can improve coupling in otherwise mismatched PV-EC system, which is a particular case of matching PV to a load with aid of a battery,” it explained.
The device's PV unit was built with a triple‐junction silicon solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 11.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.25 V, a short-circuit current of 7.4 mA/cm2,, and a fill factor of 67.9%. The electrochemical cell was made of polyether ether ketone (PPEK) filled with a potassium hydroxide solution and nickel catalyst pair. The lithium-ion battery was built with a commercial lithium ferrophosphate (LFP) cathode, a lithium titanate (LTO) anode, and a separator based on a glass fiber membrane soaked with commercial electrolyte LP30. Each of the three components is of small scale with areas of 1 cm2 and below.
The scientists explained that when sunlight hits the solar cell during the daytime, the PV unit provides a voltage of approximately 2.0 V across the EC cell and the battery while supplying a current of 3.8 mA flow through the EC and 0.6 mA through the battery. When the full state of charge is reached, the battery current is about zero for almost 40 minutes and the EC cell receives all the current from the PV cell. “Once the light is turned off and solar cell is disconnected the discharge phase begins,” they further explained.
The performance of the system was compared with that of an identical device operating without the battery and the scientists found that their novel configuration can not only smoothen out the PV power fluctuations and facilitate power coupling, but also improve solar to hydrogen efficiency.
“Simple parallel connection of PV, EC, and battery in PV-EC-B system is sufficient to provide partial storage of the PV energy and its further utilization for water splitting when PV is idle at night times,” the scientists stated, noting that the battery open-circuit voltage is a key parameter to maximize solar-to-hydrogen efficiency under a given duty cycle. “High battery capacities and duty cycles with short light periods followed by long dark periods are beneficial for solar-to-hydrogen efficiency in PV-EC-B system allowing utilization of battery charge at lower current and hence lower overpotential in the EC cell.”
All the details on the system configuration can be found in the paper “Storage batteries in photovoltaic–electrochemical device for solar hydrogen production,” published in the Journal of Power Sources.
The same research group unveiled in June 2020 an integrated PV-EC device with an active area of 0.5 cm2 developed with solar panels based on triple‐junction thin‐film silicon solar cells with an efficiency rating of 10.8% and an electro-deposited bifunctional nickel iron molybdenum water‐splitting catalyst.

The Renewable Energy Investment Tracker report produced by U.S.-based analyst BloombergNEF this month has tracked a first-half record of $174 billion of investment in clean power, with bumper equity investments more than compensating for a reduction of finance for wind projects, following a bumper period for that technology in 2020.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they are changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
The $28 billion raised by renewables companies cashing in on the share price peaks reached at the start of the year, by issuing new stock, marked a 509% rise on the equity investment drummed up in January-to-June last year, according to BloombergNEF. The analyst noted this year has also posted a six-month record of $5.7 billion worth of venture capital and private equity backing in the first half.
While the $85 billion invested in wind power projects during the first six months of last year fell back to $58 billion this time around, the BloombergNEF report stated solar parks banked a record $78.9 billion in the first half.
That finance included $4.9 billion in the second quarter alone in China, following a $2.8 billion investment in January to March. In the U.S., the report stated, investment of $5.3 billion into solar projects in the first quarter rose to $6.4 billion in April to June.
BloombergNEF head of analysis Albert Cheung sounded a cautionary note in a statement issued by the company to publicize the report, however, writing: “A 1.8% year-on-year increase is nothing to write home about. An immediate acceleration in funding is needed if we are to get on track for global net zero.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/24/mini-perovskite-solar-module-with-19-2-efficiency-via-new-additive/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 24, 2021",Mini perovskite solar module with 19.2% efficiency via new additive,"A group of scientists from the University of North Carolina has developed a mini perovskite solar module with a power conversion efficiency of up to 19.3% efficiency by applying a novel approach for interface engineering.
“These panels are designed for general purpose, which means all applications for which a regular PV panel would be applied,” UNC researcher Jinsong Huang told pv magazine.
The device was built with a new technique aimed at stabilizing the embedded perovskite-substrate interfaces in the solar cells used. The common approaches, the researchers explained, had previously focused on stabilizing perovskite-metal electrode interfaces through surface passivation or post-fabrication treatment. “Degradation of perovskite solar cells starts from the interfaces, including both perovskite-metal
electrodes and perovskites-substrates, where defects enrich,” they stated in the paper Stabilizing perovskite-substrate interfaces for high-performance perovskite modules, published in Science. “Stabilizing the embedded bottom interfaces is as important as that of [the] top interface.”
The U.S. group discovered that a high density of voids is concentrated around these interfaces and that the perovskite around these voids is subject to faster degradation. Their formation is attributed to the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is a non-volatile solvent that is commonly used to improve perovskite film morphology near the bottom of perovskite films.
The solvent was replaced with a solid-state, lead-coordinating additive of carbohydrazide (CBH), which the scientists claim was able to reduce the formation of the voids and, at the same time, to act as an effective reductant agent for the detrimental iodine formed in the perovskite material. “CBH barely evaporated during thermal annealing and thus remained within the perovskite films,” the academics explained.
According to them, the new additive enabled the fabrication of perovskite solar cells with a stabilized efficiency of 23.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.17 V, a short-circuit current density of 24.1 mA/cm-2, and a fill factor of 0.842. The perovskite films used for the cells were prepared with a room-temperature blade-coating method.
These cells were then used by the scientists to produce mini modules with efficiencies of 19.3 and 19.2%, with aperture areas of 18.1 and 50cm2, respectively. These results were certified by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which tested 112 mini panels sent by the UNC research team. More than half of the devices exhibited efficiencies of over 19% and around 77% of them over 18.5%.  “Furthermore, the long-term operational stability of the highly efficient perovskite mini-modules was also tested with the statistical results,” they further explained. “Five mini modules retained 85% of initial power conversion efficiencies after 1,000 hours of light-soaking under simulated 1-sun illumination at 50 degrees Celsius.”

Indian solar developer Acme Group has signed a land agreement to set up a $3.5 billion renewables-powered green hydrogen and green ammonia facility in Oman. The integrated plant, said to be one of the world’s largest green ammonia projects, will be located in the Special Economic Zone at Port of Duqm. The land agreement was signed with Oman's Public Authority for Special Economic Zones and Free Zones.
The integrated facility will be powered by 3 GWp of solar and 0.5 GWp of wind energy to produce 2,400 tonnes of green ammonia daily and approximately 900,000 tons annually. 
The facility is expected to become operational by 2022. When operational, it will export green ammonia to demand centers like Europe and Asia.
The Oman facility will be Acme’s second such project after the green hydrogen and green ammonia plant in the Bikaner district of the Indian state of Rajasthan. Green hydrogen at the Bikaner plant will be produced using 5 MWp from a solar plant scalable to 10 MW, which is an integral part of the project. The green ammonia plant, once commissioned, will produce 5 tons per day of green ammonia with an annual output of 1,750-1,800 tons of green fuel. 
Acme plans to start the construction of the Oman plant soon after commissioning its first green hydrogen and green ammonia plant at Bikaner, said Manoj K Upadhyay, Acme Group's founder and chairman.
“The signing of land reservation agreement will allow us to kick start pre-construction activities,” Upadhyay added. “We have hired environmental consultants and owner’s engineers Black & Veatch. … The plant in Oman would be developed in phases and the first phase is likely to be commissioned by end of 2022.”
Acme Group has built a solar portfolio of 6 GWp in India. Of this, the company currently holds a portfolio of 5.25 GWp that includes 2.2 GWp of operational capacity and another 3.05 GWp under construction. These projects are spread across 12 states in India.

McDonald’s and eBay have both reached agreements with Lightsource bp to purchase power from what is planned to be Louisiana’s largest solar project, located 30 miles northwest of Baton Rouge in Pointe Coupee Parish.
The installation in question is the 345 MW Ventress Solar project, set to start construction by the end of this year and slated for completion in 2023. Lightsource bp is developing the project and acting as owner-operator. The project’s 15-18 month construction window is expected to create around 400 jobs, while Ventress’ lifetime operations are estimated to generate a $30 million dollar boost to Pointe Coupee Parish and $200 million in indirect economic impact.
Beyond being a boon for the local community, Ventress is an installation entirely unprecedented in scope for the state of Louisiana. Once completed, project would represent a nearly 200% increase in the state’s total installed solar capacity, which currently sits at roughly 190 MW, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Successfully building a project of this capacity in a state with relatively little historical development could prove monumental in spurring Louisiana’s solar market, as SEIA expects the state to install just 507 MW over the next 5 years, less capacity than all but 12 states in that timespan.
As for McDonald’s and eBay, the project is expected to help both companies make significant progress toward their emission reduction goals. McDonald’s aims for a 31% reduction in emissions intensity per metric ton of food and packaging across its supply chain by 2030 from 2015 levels. eBay, on the other hand, is working towards achieving 100% renewable energy-powered operations by 2025.
The project is also expected to be dual-use in nature, with plans underway to include habitat creation and co-located agriculture at the project’s site.

The roofs of two adjacent office buildings in Sydney’s Barangaroo precinct have provided researchers a rare glimpse at the real-world effects of green roofs on solar arrays. The findings are substantial – in comparison to the conventional roof, the solar array fitted above beds of plants had an average daily power output 39 kW, or 13.1%, greater.
The study was led by Peter Irga from the University of Technology Sydney and funded by the City of Sydney Council, with research carried out on International House’s conventional array and Daramu House’s green roof array, known as a bisolar roof.
Both roofs generated substantial quantities of solar energy over the eight months they were studied, with the conventional roof yielding 59.5 MWh, while the green roof produced 69 MWh.
“Despite the similarities in build and location, the effect of urban geometry on solar irradiance on each rooftop is made evident outside of the hours during which the sun is near/at its solar peak… During these hours, the green roof produced an average energy output that was greater than the conventional roof by ~ 6 %. Prior to, and after these hours, the influence of urban geometry confounds the reportable efficiencies (-3.6 to 16 %)” the study read.
After correcting for these differences, the panels on the green roof were found to be, on average, 3.63% more efficient on any given day. Following on from that, over the eight-month study period the green roof produced an additional 9.5 MWh of green electricity, corresponding to a retail market value of $2,595.
This efficiency boost is thought to stem from the fact the green roof remained far cooler than the traditional concrete one during the day, meaning the panels did not overheat and therefore underperform. In some instances, the green roof was as much as 20°C cooler, with its temperatures also fluctuating far less in the evening.
 
While increasingly popular, there is currently a lack of research confirming the benefits of green roofs. Furthermore, “there is very little research that compares similar buildings which are exposed to similar environmental conditions by virtue of close proximity,” the study noted.
In addition, the significant increases in its solar array’s output, the green roof was also found to have a nine-fold increase in insect species diversity, as well as a four-fold increase in avian species diversity. It also saw reductions in some air pollutants, improved stormwater management, improved building insulation.
“For the size of the positive impacts generated relative to the costs, green infrastructure is perhaps the easiest and most efficient initiative we can make to help make our cities sustainable,” the study read.
The study’s authors described their findings as “substantial,” though they noted just two roofs were monitored.
