The online platform shows that Israeli developers installed around 703 MW of new rooftop PV systems last year, up considerably from 2021, when new installs reached 537 MW. All systems were deployed under the country's feed-in tariff scheme.
The index also shows that current cumulative rooftop PV capacity represents just 19% of Israel's technical potential, which is estimated at around 12 GW. The national capital, Jerusalem, has a utilization rate of just 5%, corresponding to 19 MW of operational rooftop PV out of a potential of 419 MW. Tel-Aviv is not doing much better, with a utilization rate of 3%, corresponding to 9 MW out of 272 MW of potential.
Central Arava Regional Council, bordering Jordan, leads in utilization at 114%. It has surpassed the 43 MW of potential that was estimated by the regulator in 2020, and reached 49 MW by the end of last year.

Ademe, France’s environmental agency, has launched a tender for large-solar thermal installations and heat pumps to produce hot water.
The agency has opened the procurement exercise to include: solar thermal power plants operating independently or integrated with a heating network, capable of achieving hot water temperatures up to 110°C; combined solar thermal systems in collective housing or commercial buildings, with collector areas ranging from 250 m² to 500 m²; and solar-assisted heat pumps designed for heat and domestic hot water production.
“Inter-seasonal storage solutions are eligible under this framework. However, the project developer is asked to provide an analysis of the relevance and efficiency of this type of storage, and to propose a comparison with other storage solutions,” Ademe said, in reference to heat pumps.
In the tender document, the institution emphasizes that France's existing energy strategy aims to reach 38% renewable heat in French final consumption by 2030. To meet this goal, it seeks to specifically promote the growth of large-scale solar thermal installations, driven by considerations of profitability and the inclusion of robust monitoring systems ensuring production and averting possible malfunctions.
Developers can submit their proposals until Oct. 15.
“Industrial uses that consume hot water are ideal targets for solar technologies, as are heating networks where solar production can be injected in addition to biomass or geothermal energy to maximize their renewable energy rate,” explained the agency.

Firefighters in the Italian province of Treviso responded to a fire in a poultry farm shed this week in the municipality of Volpago del Montello.
“The flames that probably broke out from the photovoltaic system burned the insulating cover of the structure of over 1,500 square meters which produced a considerable amount of smoke that asphyxiated the tens of thousands of laying hens present in the shed,” the local fire department said in a press release.
Firefighters from three nearby municipalities – Montebelluna, Castelfranco, and Treviso – helped at the scene. They used three fire trucks and had 16 operators to extinguish the fire. The cause of the blaze has yet to be determined. Local sources report that more than 20,000 hens were killed by the smoke.
On July 8, another incident occurred in Vétroz, a municipality in the canton of Valais, Switzerland. An industrial building with a PV system was completely destroyed by fire.

Initially, Sunlit Sea provided training to Rixen on the installation of a prefabricated 60 kW system for a waveboarding leisure park in Mannheim, Germany.
“In the Rixen case, we provided training during the first installation,” Christoffer Isdahl, marketing manager, Sunlit Sea told pv magazine. “However, we also offer our consultancy during installation, particularly when it's a one-off.”
“This is the first deal in a partnership where Rixen will use its position for us to supply other park owners with the technology,” Isdahl said, adding that Rixen provides boat-free waterskiing and waveboarding cable systems since the 1960s.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/09/hail-prone-areas-may-require-solar-modules-with-4-mm-thick-front-glass/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,HONG KONG,INDIA",LIOR KAHANA,"AUGUST 9, 2023",Hail-prone areas may require solar modules with 4 mm-thick front glass,"Recent hailstorms in Europe and North America have damaged several PV installations and heated up the debate on how solar power generators can be protected by these unpredictable events. A study conducted by Dutch scientists in 2019 showed that damages to solar panels are primarily caused by hailstones measuring at least 3 cm in size.
A new study from India claims now that the typical front glass used for solar panels, with a thickness of up to 3.2 mm, may not be sufficient to protect the modules in hail-prone areas. According to the scientists, although the PV industry mainly uses panels with that thickness, a front glass of at least 4 mm should be used. 
“Hail with a diameter of 20 mm to 30 mm is very critical to solar PV,” corresponding author Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar told pv magazine. “Damage is mainly related to the structure, resulting in a reduction of overall power generation, and in some cases also a drop in the operational lifespan.” 
Published in Renewable Energy, “Analysis of the hail impacts on the performance of commercially available photovoltaic modules of varying front glass thickness” suggests that standardized IEC durability tests for hail might not be sufficient, as testing of ice balls greater than 25 mm is only optional.
The group compared three PV modules with different thicknesses to their front glass – 2.8 mm, 3.2 mm, and 4 mm – under various hail sizes, weights, and velocities.
The analysis showed that, after being hit with a 45 mm ice ball, the module with the thinnest glass lost 21.8% of its power output, and the 3.2 mm module lost 11.74%. The thickest module tested lost only 0.81% after being hit with the same size of hail, and when tested against 55 mm hail lost 1.13%. Larger size ice balls were not tested, the scientists said, as they are relatively rare.
The loss of output was due to cracks. “Cracks are frequently imperceptible to the naked eye,” the researchers noted. “They might result in electrically disconnected cell areas, resulting in a linear drop in short-circuit current and increased series resistance, lowering the module’s power output.”
 With the 45 mm ball, very severe cracks were visible on the 2.8 mm and the 3.2 mm panels. In the case of the thickest panel, however, only microcracks were found when it was hit with the same-sized ball. “Microcracks can cause an electrical separation, rendering a portion of a cell inactive,” the research team explained. 
The academics also ascertained that all three panels experienced wet leakage current resistance – that is, a reduction in their ability to withstand moist and the wet – after being hit with 45 mm hail. The thickest panel lost 27.23% of its resistance, while the medium one lost 46.81%, and the thinnest lost 55.25%.
“The relationship between hail and damage to near-zero emissions measures is fascinating, especially with the likelihood of increased hailstorms owing to climate change in most parts of Europe,” they emphasized. “Because insurers are vigorously offsetting their exposure and module suppliers do not provide a warranty against hail damage, project owners and investors are left to bear the risk.”

Tata Power has signed a deal with the government of Maharashtra to develop two large pumped hydro storage projects with a combined capacity of 2.8 GW in the state. 
Tata Power will develop the projects at Shirawta, Pune (1.8 GW), and Bhivpuri, Raigad (1 GW), with an estimated investment of $1.57 billion. 
Tata Power said the projects will use the kinetic energy of water to create a stable and reliable power supply. During times of excess energy, water will be pumped from a lower reservoir to a higher reservoir, and during peak demand, the stored water will power turbines to generate electricity.
This initiative will significantly enhance energy security in the state by providing peaking and continuous power supply along with other renewables such as solar and wind. 
Tata Power Renewable Energy, a unit of Tata Power, recently secured power purchase agreements for 200 MW and 150 MW solar projects located in Maharashtra. It has signed power purchase agreements with MSEDCL.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/09/control-system-to-allow-users-take-control-of-air-source-heat-pumps/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 9, 2023",Control system to allow users take control of air-source heat pumps,"Scientists at the Pusan National University in South Korea have developed a control system for air-source heat pumps (ASHP) which they claim allows users to take complete control of their devices.
They explained that ASHP manufacturers are traditionally reluctant in giving users control of their products and noted that ASHPs using renewable energy as an auxiliary heat source require a high level of technology for control optimization of variable-speed compressors.
The researchers described the proposed innovation as an artificial neural network (ANN)-based optimum control logic (OCL) system that is able to control the set temperature and operate without changing the main components of existing systems and increasing costs. The ANN is based on backpropagation, which is an algorithm designed to test for errors working back from output nodes to input nodes.
“The ANN model was developed to prevent overfitting errors, by constructing a training dataset in the form of synthetic time-series load data,” the scientists noted. “It was developed based on Python and connected to TRNSYS through MATLAB.”
Their numerical modeling was applied to an ASHP equipped with a heat storage tank (HST) system that stores heat when the coefficient of performance (COP) is high and releases it at a later stage when the heat pump is at a high load. They assumed the ASHP-HST system to be installed in an office building in Busan with a floor area of 120 m2, a height of 2.7 m, and a window-to-wall ratio of 15%.
The heat pump is assumed to have a rated capacity of 9 kW in the heating mode and 8 kW in the cooling mode.
In the proposed system configuration, a fan coil unit (FCU) is switched on when the room temperature drops under 21 C and the HST temperature exceeds 43 C. Conversely, heating is switched off when the room temperature surpasses 23 C and HST temperature drops under 43 C. The ASHP stores heat when the HST temperature is lower than 43 C, with the storage process being interrupted when the temperature exceeds 47 C.
“For indoor cooling, the FCU is activated when the room temperature exceeds 24 C and the HST temperature is less than 12 C,” the research team explained, noting that the FCU is turned off when the room temperature drops below 22 C or the HST temperature rises above 12 C. “ASHP is used for HST cold storage when the HST temperature is higher than 12 C, and cooling is switched off when the HST temperature falls below 8 C.”
These mechanisms, according to the researchers, enable users to “correctly” select the flow rate of the water pump, even under severe weather conditions. Furthermore, they help increase the ASHP COP by 0.88% when the flow rate is maintained low during times when less heat rejection or absorption was required and by 6.23% when the use of a variable-speed water pump through dynamic simulation is assumed. “ANN-based OCL works well when the secondary side refrigerant of the heat pump is water,” the scientists said.
They described the system in the study “Performance improvement of air-source heat pump via optimum control based on artificial neural network,” published in Energy Reports. “In future research, we plan to develop the FCU-side water pump flow control logic that considers the standard effective temperature and predicted mean vote-based human body comfort,” they concluded.

Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, said the Digital Infrastructure Energy Flexibility (DIEF) pilot project will use software technology to intelligently control the power usage of up to 200 buildings in New South Wales, providing access to devices that consume more than 5 MW of power from the grid.
The buildings will be connected to the CSIRO’s Data Clearing House (DCH) software platform, allowing the power usage of the devices to be coordinated to match up with periods of high renewable generation. The CSIRO said the AUD 11 million ($7.19 million) DIEF project brings together a consortium of private companies, and education and government institutions to drive the development of new technologies to support flexible demand for energy.
Flexible demand is the coordinated orchestration of electrical load in response to generation, network, or market signals and offers a way to lighten the load on the grid during busy periods, provide consumers with more control over their electricity usage, and lower peak demand.
“Flexible demand is critical because it ensures grid stability, reduces costs, supports increasing renewable energy integration, and enables a more sustainable and efficient energy system,” said CSIRO Energy Director Dietmar Tourbier.
“This project has the potential to create a new ecosystem of technologies and solutions that will give consumers more control over their energy bills and emissions.”
While flexible demand offers an alternative to the traditionally rigid energy network infrastructure, the CSIRO said the approach is still nascent and requires new technologies, market processes and ways of engaging with energy users.
“The DIEF pilot project will address these issues, bringing together a consortium of project sponsors responsible for funding, research outcomes, coordinating artificial intelligence competitions and onboarding buildings onto the digital platform,” the agency said.
Stephen White, chief research consultant for energy at the CSIRO, said the DIEF project will allow property owners within the pilot to share data and identify opportunities for energy flexibility and productivity improvements.
“This technology will not only allow people to get data out of their buildings and make it accessible to their service providers, but they will also be able to receive data from external providers such as the electricity market and the Bureau of Meteorology,” he said.
“When people process all this data, they can discover cost trends and plan accordingly.”
The data collected during the trial will be used to inform the government on the creation of a flexible demand policy and asset register.
Members of the DIEF consortium include electricity retailer Amber Electric, digital tech companies DNA Energy and Nube iO, electric vehicle charging specialist EVSE Australia, and energy technology company Wattwatchers. The consortium also includes Property and Development New South Wales, research collaborative RACE for 2030 CRC, the University of New South Wales, the University of Wollongong, and the New South Wales government.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/09/us-community-solar-to-exceed-6-gw-in-2023/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 9, 2023",US community solar to exceed 6 GW in 2023,"From pv magazine USA
Community solar took a downturn last year, which continued into the first quarter of 2023. But it won’t stay down for long, according to a report by Wood Mackenzie in conjunction with the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA). Despite the downturn, community solar capacity is expected to exceed 6 GW this year.
Community solar is especially applicable for customers who aren’t a good fit for rooftop solar. In a community solar project, customers subscribe to a portion of the facility’s generation in exchange for utility bill credits. The concept is taking off in the United States.
According to the report, installations declined by 6% year-over-year in 2022 and were down 13% in the first quarter of 2023. Reasons cited include supply chain uncertainty of the past year, along with interconnection and siting issues. The siting issues were noted as hindering growth in Massachusetts and Maine, both key markets.
Starting in 2024, however, community solar is expected to begin on an upward path that will see it grow at an annual clip of 8% with nearly 14 GW of cumulative capacity installed by 2028. Potential new programs could result in additional uplift, according to the report.

“Near-term growth is driven by the continued success of programs in New York and Illinois as well as positive policy updates in Maryland, Minnesota, and New Jersey. In addition, California’s newly proposed program has the potential to represent 20% of Wood Mackenzie’s national outlook between 2024 and 2028,” said Caitlin Connelly, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a 30% investment tax credit for the cost of developing renewable energy resources, provided developers meet labor requirements. Three 10% adders can be applied to projects that serve, however, the report notes that qualifying for more than one adder will be difficult, and that community solar developers are likely to see the low-income adder first.
The $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) also provides new opportunities for community solar and will be implemented via three grant competitions: the $14 billion National Clean Investment Fund, the $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator.
It also includes the $7 billion Solar for All competition in which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will award up to 60 grants to states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits to expand residential solar access for low-income and disadvantaged communities. Wood Mackenzie said the U.S. EPA’s Solar for All fund within the GGRF will be particularly beneficial for community solar, granting up to $7 billion in funds to support the creation and expansion of community solar programs with an emphasis on supporting low-income communities.
“These projections don’t factor in new states passing community solar laws and the billions of dollars of federal grants that we expect will go to states to expand access to community solar. Needless to say, we’re just scratching the surface on how many people in America can get the benefits of community solar access by the end of the decade if regulators and legislators keep their foot on the gas,” said Matt Hargarten, vice president of campaigns at CCSA.
Keeping in mind some of the factors affecting the market, Wood Mackenzie and CSSA developed alternative forecasts – the bull and bear forecasts. These take into supply chain dynamics, retail rate changes and state and federal policy updates. In the bull case scenario, the national 5-year forecast increases by 13%, while I the bear case, the national outlook decreases by 24%.
To date, 23 states and the District of Columbia have established community solar platforms from pilot stage to statewide implementation. Most recently, Maryland passed community solar legislation HB 908, making it the 23rd community solar market.  Additional states that currently have community solar bills that could become law include New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Ohio’s bill, HB-197, was studied at the Ohio University, which found that a community solar program could contribute nearly $3.49 billion in gross state product, and earn $409.5 million in local tax revenue over its lifetime.
“With the introduction last week of HB 197, which contains many of the provisions of the bill evaluated in this study, state policymakers have a new opportunity to drive long-term prosperity by empowering more Ohioans with the choice to access local, reliable, and affordable clean energy,” said Carlo Cavallaro, regional director at the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA), which commissioned the Ohio University study.
In addition to looking at possible growth scenarios, the WoodMac/CCSA study also revealed the growth in the market for subscriber management companies such as Arcadia, Perch Energy and Ampion. The report notes that this market now manages more than half the total community solar market.
“Developers continue to rely on third parties to outsource subscription acquisition and management services especially as state-level subscriber requirements continue to become stricter and more burdensome. Successful subscriber management companies have been seen to utilize software tools which lowers subscriber acquisition costs and have business models oriented toward successfully targeting low-income populations,” Connelly concluded.

The Nomad mobile energy storage system from Vermont-based Nomad Transportable Power Systems is a lithium-ion-based battery energy storage system (BESS) developed by Kore Power. The energy system, called the Traveler, provides 1 MW (AC) with 2 MWh of storage capacity and can be connected to the grid or powered by renewables, adding to its portability. The system comes in a BESS trailer and includes a standardized docking platform capable of interconnection with any distribution or transmission utility, according to Nomad.
Green Mountain Power (GMP) , a utility in Vermont that provides electricity that’s 100% carbon free and 78% renewable, reports that it received the first Nomad BESS manufactured by the Vermont company. GMP recently deployed the BESS to keep Twincraft Skincare’s manufacturing facility from going down during routine power system maintenance. GMP estimates that the scheduled maintenance would have otherwise required a 6-hour outage for line crew safety.
“This is an incredible advancement in technology for GMP customers, and we are very excited to be part of its first commercial deployment here at Twincraft Skincare,” said David Speed, vice president of engineering at Twincraft. “We recognize that disruptions are a normal course of business, but they are just that, disruptions, and to avoid them in the future by using clean energy stored in the NOMAD mobile battery storage system will absolutely help us stay competitive in the market with greater reliability of operations and will keep our employees on the job.”
Like many utilities, GMP schedules outages for maintenance and upgrades, and they usually choose times that will have the least impact for customers. However, with manufacturing running 24 hours a day at Twincraft, a low-impact time was not an option.
Prior to the installation, GMP engineers calculated the electrical load needed to keep Twincraft powered by the BESS for the duration of the outage. The Nomad Traveler then backfed a transformer nearby to re-energize a small section of the power distribution system that was powering the facility.
“The Nomad is a great new tool for strategic deployment across the state, and there are several scenarios where we can now provide even greater reliability for customers both residential and commercial,” said Mari McClure, president and CEO of GMP. “From powering a fire department during a storm, to operating a ski lift, to keeping a cluster of homes powered-up, to supporting local businesses like Twincraft, there are so many opportunities to enhance safety, support commerce, and protect customers.”
With a $9.5 million grant from the US Department of Energy, GMP and Nomad plan to expand this clean-technology even more by bringing long-duration energy storage to five communities in rural Vermont. The funding is part of the US Department of Energy’s Long-Duration Energy Storage (LDES) Demonstration Grant Program, supported by the 2020 Energy Act. The program intends to provide up to $350 million for emerging LDES demonstration projects, both lithium and non-lithium-based, capable of delivering electricity for 10 to 24 hours or longer. DOE will provide financial assistance through cooperative agreements to fund up to 50% of the cost of each project.
The grant funding will help support the roll out of Nomad energy storage systems, part of GMP’s Resiliency Zone program, to Panton, Brattleboro, Grafton and Rochester. The intention is to use the energy storage systems to help lower costs for customers by using the stored energy in the battery system during peak power use times such as during heatwaves, rather than pulling in more energy from the grid.
“We are so excited to continue rapidly growing battery storage in Vermont to keep everyone powered up through extreme weather,” said Mari McClure, GMP’s president and CEO. “The Nomad is a flexible mobile tool that keeps communities connected, while also cutting carbon and costs for all.”
For the community resilience projects, Nomad will build a new, mobile, long-duration energy storage solution using Kore Power’s next-gen modules. Nomad expects each unit to be capable of providing power to about 50 homes for 10 hours. The new units will also incorporate electric vehicle (EV) charging capabilities so that electric vehicles in outage-stricken communities will have access to power.

Compared to the prevalent method of mooring with elastic cables, the novel method is said to reduce mooring costs for a system of 195 kW by 24%, from $62,200 to $47,160 over its service life. “Elastic mooring cables need to be tightened periodically because the creepage of rubber can lead to the loss of tension resulting in the increase in maintenance cost over time,” the scientists said referring to one of the possible issues in using this technology.
In the paper “An Adaptive Barrier-Mooring System for Coastal Floating Solar Farms,” which was published in Applied Energy, the scientists explained that the cost reduction is due to the cheaper material cost and fewer requirements for maintenance in the new system. “The cost comparison is only indicative as there is significant uncertainty in the various costs,” they emphasized. “In addition, the cost estimations only include the mooring system. Other related costs, such as transportation, have not been considered.”
Dubbed adaptive barrier mooring system (ABMS), the new system consists of perimeter pontoons, barriers, clump weights, mooring lines and anchors.

“The barrier is hinged to the pontoon at the top and tied to the clump weight at the bottom, while the mooring lines connect the clump weight with the anchors fixed at the seabed,” the researchers explained, referring to the functions of the system’s different parts. “The pontoon provides the buoyancy, while the barrier tensioned by the clump weight mitigates the wave action with the mooring lines holding the platform in place.”
In their analysis, the scientists used models scaled at 1:30, with the parameters of the various configurations carefully considered to be realistic compared to field deployment. They compared the performance of a floating array based on a conventional elastic system with that of a floating farm where the sea-facing front is supported by ABMS and the coast-facing rear is supported by a variation of this ABMS-based system where the barrier is replaced by mooring lines.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
The researchers found that the system using the new mooing tech is 40% more vertically stable in short wave periods. In addition, the ABMS-based system proved to handle changes in water depth of up to 36%, which is highly relevant under tidal fluctuations, without introducing slack in the mooring cables. “Slack may produce sudden jerks and damage the mooring points,” the researchers explained.
The research team included scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the Dalian University of Technology in China. “We hope that the development of ABMS can further aid the development of coastal floating solar farms in the future,” the team concluded. “At present, floating solar farms have already been installed in freshwater bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. However, very few coastal floating solar farms have been installed so far despite the wider availability in sea space, due to the challenges of more complex environmental conditions in the coastal environment.”
