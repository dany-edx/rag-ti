The deal will see bp capture and evaluate solar and wind data from 8,000km2 of land. The data will in turn support the Omani Government in approving the future developments of renewable energy hubs at most suitable locations.
The renewable energy resources within this area could also be harnessed for the development of green hydrogen projects, targeting both domestic and global export markets.
Mohammed Al Rumhy, Oman’s minister of energy and minerals, said the partnership is a significant step towards delivering the country’s 2040 Vision, which includes an ambition to increase the penetration of renewables up to 39%, with an interim goal of 20% by 2030.
“Today’s agreement signals the next step in our energy journey – unlocking the potential for Oman as a low-carbon energy hub,” he said.
Under the new partnership, bp and Oman will also consider ways to collaborate in areas such as a renewables strategy, regulation, the establishment of a renewable energy hub, and the development and reskilling of the local workforce.
“These projects will build on our gas business, and bring wind, solar and green hydrogen together in a distinctive and integrated way supporting Oman’s low carbon energy goals,” said bp CEO Bernard Looney.
The partnership represents a significant evolution of bp’s business in Oman, where it operates Block 61, which produces a third of the country’s gas demand. Last year, bp showed its eagerness to take early positions in the Omani hydrogen sector, joining the country’s national hydrogen alliance, Hy-Fly, and establishing a net-zero task force to help develop a “roadmap” for bp in Oman.
But bp is not the only interested party in Oman’s green hydrogen potential. Last year, Munich-headquartered management consultancy Roland Berger wrote that Oman is one of the most competitive locations globally to produce and export green hydrogen and derivatives. With that said, there has been a long list of massive projects announced in the country in recent years.
An international consortium led by Omani oil company OQ unveiled plans last year for a green hydrogen facility to be powered by 25GW of solar and wind. In the works since 2019, the plan envisages the production of “millions of tons” of green hydrogen, which could be consumed on-site, exported, or converted into green ammonia for international export.
Last year, Indian solar developer Acme Group signed a land agreement to set up a US$3.5 billion renewables-powered green hydrogen and green ammonia facility in Oman. Slated to become operational in 2022, the integrated facility will be powered by 3GWp of solar and 500MWp of wind energy to produce 900,000 tons of green hydrogen annually.
Another high-profile project is Hyport Duqm – a partnership between OQ, Germany’s Uniper, and Belgium’s DEME – which aims to build a green hydrogen and ammonia facility at Duqm, powered by 1.3GW of renewable energy.
Further, the 400MW SalalaH2 green hydrogen and ammonia project was announced in October for the coastal city of Salalah by co-developers OQ, industrial gases company Linde and the Dubai Transport Company, powered by about 1GW of wind and solar.
A year before, Oman's Sohar Port and Freezone, a deep-sea port and adjacent free zone located in the homonymous coastal city, announced a plan to host a large-scale green hydrogen generation hub powered by solar power plants. This plan envisages the deployment of around 3.5 GW of PV capacity, which is equivalent to the port's total electricity consumption.

The list includes 62 solar projects totaling 1,312.9MW, 36 hydropower facilities equaling 412.8MW, 36 biomass schemes with an aggregate capacity of 264.8MW, seven wind farms with a total power of 409.9MW, and six geothermal power plants totaling 218.5MW.
As for the solar source, the selected projects range in size from 0.21 to 100.6MW. According to the document, some plants have already been operating under the country's FIT scheme, while others were planned to operate under the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) or a bilateral power purchase agreement (PPA).
According to the DOE Secretary, Alfonso Cusi, around 8.5GW of renewable energy projects participated in the selection process.
The minimum level of electricity contracted from renewable energy (RE) developers under the RPS scheme is currently 1% but the DoE is now considering raising it to 2.52% starting from 2023.
Recent statistics released by the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.04GW under the country's renewable energy law at the end of 2020. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.
The government of the Philippines also launched a 2GW renewables auction last June. Overall, it plans to install 15GW of renewables capacity by 2030.

North American manufacturer Ecoflow has brought what it claims to be the fastest charging residential battery in the world, to Europe.
At its launch last summer, Ecoflow swept the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform with its Delta Pro portable power solution. The start-up raised the equivalent of €10.6 million in the two-month campaign.
“Delta Pro's successful Kickstarter campaign demonstrates that there is an overwhelming desire from consumers for clean, portable energy storage and delivery solutions,” said Thomas Chan, EcoFlow's R&D director. “Reliable access to energy is a priority for consumers, as the rise in extreme weather events and power outages highlights the need for better preparedness and sustainable energy sources.”
The portable battery solution can be combined with solar panels and has a capacity of 3.6 to 25kWh. The product is now available in 35 countries and regions across Europe, supported by a network of more than 300 local retailers. According to the manufacturer, the entire system has enough power – on a single charge – to meet the emergency power use of an average family for about a week.
“The basic price of Delta Pro is €3,799,” an Ecoflow spokeswoman told pv magazine Germany. Delivery includes a Delta Pro Power Station, an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, a solar charging cable, a DC5521 to DC5525 cable, an adapter for the smart generator and a warranty card.
For the portable version, Ecoflow recommends combining the battery with a 400Wp solar panel, so the battery can be fully charged in 12 to 24 hours. The charging time is shortened as more photovoltaic energy is coupled to the battery system. With the maximum possible 1.6kW of PV power, the charging time is 2.8 to 5.6 hours for the 3.6kWh battery. Ecoflow also offers matching foldable solar modules that can be coupled with the storage system.
The battery can also be connected to a house's power system, a gas generator, or a car charger. The weight of the battery in the basic version is 45kg and its size is 63.5×28.5×41.6 cm, according to the datasheet. AC charging is possible with up to 2,900W. At 3,500 cycles, at least 80% capacity should be reached.
For outdoor use, the Delta Pro is enough to charge a camera 210 times or power a coffee pot for 3.3 hours. When used at home, the capacity is enough to run the refrigerator for 24 or 48 hours, among other things.

Already today, over 30 countries and regions are planning for active commerce heralding a considerable growth in cross-border hydrogen trade.
The agency estimates that over 30% of hydrogen could be traded across borders by 2050, a higher share than natural gas today. According to its latest analysis Geopolitics of the Energy Transformation: The Hydrogen Factor, hydrogen is set to change the geography of energy trade and regionalize energy relations, with the emergence of new centers of geopolitical influence built on the production and use of hydrogen, as traditional oil and gas trade declines.
Net energy importers such as Chile, Morocco, and Namibia are emerging as green hydrogen exporters while fossil fuel exporters, such as Australia, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, are increasingly considering clean hydrogen to diversify their economies. Some countries that expect to be importers are already deploying dedicated hydrogen diplomacy such as Japan and Germany.
“As more players and new classes of net importers and exporters emerge on the world stage, hydrogen trade is unlikely to become weaponized and cartelized, in contrast to the geopolitical influence of oil and gas,” IRENA says. However, the hydrogen business will be more competitive and less lucrative than oil and gas.
According to IRENA, hydrogen is set to cover up to 12% of global energy use by 2050, driven by the climate urgency and countries’ commitments to net zero. “Hydrogen is clearly riding on the renewable energy revolution with green hydrogen emerging as a game changer for achieving climate neutrality without compromising industrial growth and social development,” says Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA. “But hydrogen is not a new oil. And the transition is not a fuel replacement but a shift to a new system with political, technical, environmental, and economic disruptions.”
In terms of the supply-demand ratio, the technical potential for hydrogen production significantly exceeds the estimated global demand. Therefore, realizing the potential of regions like Africa, the Americas, the Middle East, and Oceania could limit the risk of export concentration, but many countries will need technology transfers, infrastructure, and investment at scale, IRENA says.
The report sees the 2020s as a big race for technology leadership, as costs are likely to fall sharply with learning and scaling-up of needed infrastructure. But demand is expected to only take off in the mid-2030s. By that time, green hydrogen will cost-compete with fossil-fuel hydrogen globally, according to IRENA, and this is poised to happen even earlier in countries like China, Brazil, and India. Green hydrogen was already affordable in Europe during the 2021 spike in natural gas prices.
Further, the manufacturing of equipment like electrolyzers and fuel cells could drive business in the coming years. In fact, estimates point to a $50-60 billion market potential for electrolyzers and a $21-25 billion market for fuel cells by the middle of the century. China, Japan and Europe have already developed a head start in the production, IRENA notes, but innovation and emerging technologies will shape the current manufacturing landscape further.

Switzerland-based Varo Energy Group and Groupe E have announced the construction of the largest photovoltaic ground-mounted system in the country to date.
The facility will have a capacity of 7.7MW and will rely on 19,000 solar modules of the latest generation from the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM).
The photovoltaic power plant is being built in the immediate vicinity of the refinery operated by Varo in an industrial area in Cressier. The solar power will be fed directly into the refinery's medium-voltage grid.
The estimated annual generation is 8.4GWh, which is expected to cover more than 60% of the refinery's electricity requirements. The completion of the photovoltaic system is scheduled for November 2022. According to the companies, the investment costs amount to around 6.5 million CHF (US$7.1 million).
Upon completion of the plant, the area will be accessible to wildlife. In addition, further measures to preserve biodiversity are planned, which are intended to protect birds and mammals. Due to the existing high hedges and trees, the solar park is then hardly visible.

This kind of passivation layer has been often used with success for chalcogenide solar cells as well as in copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS) devices. According to the scientists, it may help reduce zinc-copper (Cu/Zn) cation-related disorders in kesterite cells.
“The passivation layer provides a beneficial passivation effect, that is, chemical passivation or field-effect passivation,” they said. “Chemical passivation decreases the total number of electrically active defects and results in a decrease in the surface recombination velocity, whereas field-effect passivation drives minority carriers from the high-recombination region to the spacecharge region via the built-in electric field created by the high density of fixed charges in the dielectric layer.”
The research group built the cell with Al2O3-incorporated CZTSSe absorbers using aqueous spray pyrolysis in ambient air. This process is generally used for temperature decomposition of organic materials in the absence of oxygen and is known to provide excellent rate capability and high cycling stability.

The cell was fabricated on a glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo) with ith Al2O3-incorporated CZTSSe absorber, a buffer layer based on cadmium sulfide (CdS), an un-doped layer of zinc-oxide (i-ZnO), and an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer. The effects of CZTSSe absorbers were evaluated through Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), while defect passivation was measured through admittance spectroscopy (AS).
According to the scientists, the Al2O3 incorporation had a noticeable effect on the crystallization process through post selenization of the kesterite absorber and did not change the lattice parameters of the selenized kesterite, which is key to lower defect levels and defect densities. The solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 11.76%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.469 V, a short-circuit current of 36.96 mA cm2 and a fill factor of 67.25%. A reference solar cell without the Al2O3 incorporation obtained a 9.87% efficiency, an open-circuit voltage of 0.456 V, a short-circuit current of 34.22 mA cm2 and a fill factor of 56.93%.
The passivation technique and the solar cell are described in full in the paper Defect Passivation for Kesterite CZTSSe Solar Cells via In Situ Al2O3 Incorporation into the Bulk CZTSSe Absorber, published in RRL Solar. “In conclusion, the in situ Al2O3 incorporation enables defect passivation for kesterite solar cells and suggests its further application to other chalcogenide-based solar cells,” the research group said.
In late 2020, other researchers at the Incheon National University built a kesterite solar cell based on a zinc tin oxide (ZTO) buffer layer.
The world record for such cells is 12.6%, achieved by Japanese thin-film producer Solar Frontier in 2013.
Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber material candidates for potential use in lower-cost thin-film solar cells. Kesterites are comprised of common elements, such as copper, tin, zinc, and selenium. And unlike GIGS compounds, there are no supply bottlenecks expected in the future. However, kesterite is still less efficient than CIGS in mass production.

Australian solar glass developer ClearVue Technologies has revealed the results of modeling to demonstrate the energy and thermal improvements of integrating PV products into inner-city buildings. Its findings are striking.
Integrating concentrator photovoltaics products such as solar windows into high-rise structures massively reduces carbon emissions by generating clean electricity and relying on thermal-insulative properties, which significantly reduce heating and cooling loads.
“The Archetype demonstrates the potential effectiveness of ClearVue products to reduce the carbon emissions by over 90%,” ClearVue Technologies Executive Chairman Victor Rosenberg told pv magazine Australia.
The “archetype” Rosenberg refers to is the name given to the modelled building – a computer simulation and detailed thermal model of a six storey, 15,000 m² office building in Toronto, Canada. The modeling was delivered by Canada's Footprint, with ClearVue noting that if the work had been completed for a climate like Australia’s, the performance may have even been better.
Nonetheless, the modeled building was found to be in the top 1% of Canadian office buildings for energy performance, scoring 99 out of 100 points in the North American building Energy Star Rating System.
“By using the [solar] windows we can bring the building closer to the emissions standards that people are demanding or expecting,” Rosenberg said.
Solar windows are still a burgeoning technology, but they’ve figured in our collective imagination for decades. ClearVue commissioned the newly published modeling, in part, to help it quantify specifically how the technology will enable the ‘net zero’ buildings, perhaps even cities, of the future. This is obviously particularly important as new building standards are rolled out globally to improve sustainability.
Currently, the construction of buildings and their operations account for well over one-third of global CO2 emissions annually, with building operations responsible for the lions share at 28%.
One of the most compelling features of the Archetype building model, Rosenberg said, is that it was able to maintain a high level of glass to wall ratio. Historically windows are the weak link in a building’s thermal performance, so low carbon buildings tend to reduced window to hit energy use and carbon emission targets. The modeling compared the building to standards in Canada, the United States, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. The results indicated that the Archetype model ranks in the top tier of each.
Energy-producing windows
In a separate development, US-based Ubiquitous Energy, a commercial windows manufacturer that specializes in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), has announced the closing of a $30 million Series B funding round. The company said it raised $70 million to scale up its transparent, energy-producing windows. The funding round was led by new and existing investors, including Andersen Corporation, ENEOS, Safar Partners, Hostplus, Red Cedar Ventures, and Riverhouse Investments.
Ubiquitous Energy claims that its technology is the only patented transparent PV glass coating that produces energy, while retaining the same look as a traditional window. The company has started site selection process for its U.S. manufacturing line, which will produce the UE Power window coating for sale to the windows industry. The company said that broad adoption of its UE Power windows could offset up to an estimated 10% of global carbon emissions, significantly reducing the 40% of global emissions that are sourced from buildings.
More than 20 billion square feet of windows are installed every year, creating an opening for the company to integrate its technology. This year, the company installed transparent solar windows at an NSG facility in Japan, a commercial office building in Colorado, and Michigan State University campus buildings.
“We are thrilled to bring on new and existing investors as partners, including ENEOS, a leader in the renewable energy sector, and Andersen, America’s premier window manufacturer,” said Susan Stone, Ubiquitous Energy’s CEO.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has expanded the scope of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) to open access and net-metering projects from April 1, 2022. Accordingly, only the models and manufacturers included in the ALMM list will be eligible for use in government projects, government-assisted projects, projects under government schemes and programs, open access, and net-metering projects.
These include projects set up to sell electricity to the government under the guidelines issued by the central government under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and projects under Component A of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) program.
The MNRE, in its drive to reduce India’s dependence on solar imports and achieve self-reliance, has made it mandatory for solar module manufacturers to get registered under the ALMM to be eligible for a wide range of government-backed projects. The decision on expanding the ALMM scope has been lauded by representatives from the North India Module Manufacturers Association (NIMMA), the Indian Solar Manufacturers Association (ISMA), the All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), and industry leaders.
“We are thankful to the government for taking this step which will help consumers to get better quality and reliable supplier, lenders and investors will have more confidence on their investment as modules are a major and most important component of solar power projects,” said Hitesh Doshi, the president of All India Solar Industries Association. “Domestic industry is suffering for a long time due to almost 90% of imports of solar modules. Local manufacturing capacity in India, which is more than our requirement, now will have some business.
Bharat Bhut, cofounder and director, Goldi Solar, a Gujarat-based solar manufacturer praised the decision. “The ALMM policy amendment by MNRE is a significant announcement in the interest of all stakeholders. The announcement has come at an appropriate time, just when BCD [basic customs duty] will be implemented;” said Bhut. “The combined effect of both these policies will be massive, and I am sure India will grow to become a solar manufacturing hub in the coming years.”

“The battery can also be used with solar power generation,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The new 20Ah-HP cell is particularly suitable for charging and discharging at high currents, such as when used in conjunction with renewable energy sources, which have large output fluctuations. For this reason, we believe it is suitable for applications that require response to large output fluctuations and high frequency charging and discharging, such as when frequency control and peak shift/peak cut are used together.”
The new 20Ah-HP SCiB product has a rated capacity of 20Ah, a nominal voltage of 2.3V, and an input power of 1,900W. It measures 116 mm x 22 mm x 106 mm and weighs 545 grams.
Toshiba said the new product eliminates the cost of battery replacement. It claimed the offering is superior to other batteries in terms of total cost of ownership (TCO) over the entire product life cycle.
“In general, when solar power generation systems are combined with storage batteries, the issue is that the storage batteries have a shorter lifespan than the solar power generation system, so the storage batteries need to be replaced in the middle of the solar system's useful life,” the company explained. “The new product has even better lifetime performance than the existing product, eliminating the need to replace batteries as their capacity deteriorates.”
It said the battery cell was designed for heavy-load applications where high power input and output are crucial, where battery cells must suppress heat and operate without interruptions to facilitate the rapid charging of commercial vehicles, regenerative power systems for rolling stock, and industrial equipment.
“The cell is the same size as Toshiba’s current 20Ah product, allowing current customers to easily upgrade to the improved input and output power with the same module pack,” Toshiba said. “Compared to Toshiba’s current 20Ah cell, the new 20Ah-HP cell delivers 1.7 time higher input and 1.6 times higher output, realized by an approximately 40% reduction of resistance in the cell.”
