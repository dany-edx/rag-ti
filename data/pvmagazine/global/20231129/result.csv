“This decision has been taken as a result of Qcells’ efforts to optimize module production capabilities, and in response to a stagnant domestic solar market in Korea,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The total volume of solar installations in Korea has been decreasing over the past three years, from 4.7 GW in 2020, to 3.4 GW in 2022, and a further decline is expected in 2023.”
The company said it will continue to invest in its flagship manufacturing facility in Jincheon, South Korea, where it still produces TOPCon products and operates a perovskite tandem pilot line.
“The shutdown of Eumseong will have a minimal impact on Qcells’ global module supply capabilities,” the spokesperson said. “The company’s manufacturing capacity has expanded a great deal, and current module production capability is large enough to cover our global markets.”
Hanwha Qcells said it offered voluntary redundancy packages to its employees.
“The company has not set a target number on this,” the spokesperson said. “Those staff that wish to remain in Qcells’ employ will be absorbed into the Jincheon operation, where the additional manpower will boost TOPCon and Tandem line operations.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/29/industry-pushes-for-agricentricity-at-agrivoltaics2023/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,FRANCE,GERMANY,ITALY,SPAIN",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"NOVEMBER 29, 2023",Industry pushes for ‘agricentricity’ at Agrivoltaics2023,"Solar developers, research centers, and other stakeholders say that agrivoltaic projects have to grant a central role for agricultural production in agrivoltaic configurations. This is the main takeaway from the first day of the Agrivoltaics2023 conference, which is taking place this week in Strasbourg, France.
“We have to work on sustainable business cases: we are at a very early age, and there is a lot to work on that, but we cannot question the centrality of agricultural production,” said Emilien Simonot, head of agrivoltaics EMEA & APAC at Lightsource bp.
Panelists such as Max Trommsdorff, head of group agrivoltaics at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE), echoed similar sentiments.
“We need a mindset change, from optimising energy production to accommodating the needs of farmers,” said Guillaume Biree, head of sales for France and Benelux at Schletter Group.
Celeste Mellone, a lawyer at Green Horse Advisory, said energy companies need to have viable business cases and projects must be financially sound. Green Horse Advisory is the co-founder of AIAS, the Italian association for sustainable agriculture. AIAS signed an agreement with France Agrivoltaïsme, and Germany’s VnAP at the conference this week. They plan to collaborate and pull together their members.
“By combining our strengths and expertise, we aim to amplify our impact, bringing about positive change and innovation in the agrivoltaics landscape across Italy, France, and Germany,” they said in a joint statement.
The agricultural world, aligned with the energy sector at the European level, issued a warning about the need to consider biodiversity. Industry figures noted potential discord at the national level in various EU member states.
Theresa Kärtner, a renewable energy adviser at the German Farmers Association (DBV), said that energy production is a third priority for some agrivoltaic projects.
“In this case, the priority should be given to agricultural production, then to biodiversity, and finally to energy,” said Kärtner.
The second most sensitive topic in agrivoltaic projects, following electricity production, revolves around limitations and constraints, potentially at the national level. These constraints may involve a maximum land utilization rate or minimum agricultural productivity.
Advocates argue that constraints can drive innovation, while opponents believe they could impede progress toward 2030 and 2050 targets. SolarPower Europe said that agrivoltaics play a crucial role in achieving ambitious energy and climate goals.
“In Germany, we have to install 20 GW every year, of which 10 GW are on rooftops and 10 GW on land. Of these, in the future, 3 GW will be dual-use land, with agricultural activity,” said Stephan Schindele, head of product management agriPV at BayWa r.e. “The integration will be even more important.”
Schindele said “agrivoltaics” is a relatively new term and needs cross-sectorial coordination.
“We are in the learning process. AgriPV is feasible,” he said. “The challenges are mostly related to the communication. It is not a production challenge; it is rather a legal one.”
The communication challenge requires better coordination between farmers and electricity producers, particularly in arable agriculture. Germany sets an example, as the DBV agricultural association works on a document to outline the required legal measures for implementing biodiversity PV.

The European Green Deal, approved July 2021, includes climate goals such as no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050.
The European Commission's list of projects will “now” be submitted to the European Parliament and the European Council, according to the press release. The bodies will accept or reject the list in full by March 2024 latest.
The projects will be eligible for EU financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Over half of the projects are reliant on electricity, offshore and “smart electricity” grid technology, according to the announcement. The European Commission said it expects to commission “many” of these projects between 2027 and 2030.
Up to 65 hydrogen and electrolyzer projects are included, as well as 14 CO2 network projects.
PCIs are projects based in the EU and PMIs are projects based in other countries but connected to the EU. The EuroAsia Interconnector – an example of a PCI-approved project – aims to link Greece, Cyprus and Israel's power grids.

The France-based petroleum supplier now has a minority stake in the project, which also has 5 GW/20 GWh of storage, according to the release.
The facility – located in Guelmim Oued Noun, the country’s south – will provide 3.6 GW of energy for an average of 20 or more hours a day to Wales and England through 3,800 kilometers of high-voltage direct-current subsea cables, said Xlinks. The company plans to sell the power to the UK grid under a contract-for-difference scheme.
TotalEnergies joins government-controlled energy holding company Abu Dhabi National Energy Company and UK investment firm Octopus Energy as investors in the project. Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. invested GBP 25 million while Octopus Energy invested £5 million.
In April 2021, Xlinks’ CEO Simon Morrish told pv magazine the company plans to invest GBP 18 billion in the project.
The project is considered one of the world’s most ambitious and was recently mulled by the UK government for its potential merits.

Their approach combines architectural research practices with software object rendering and a choice protocol that involves different stakeholders. It also involves different fields of knowledge and the participation of heritage authorities, designers, and PV companies.
“The approach we have outlined is a technical workflow, making it applicable in all contexts, as it lacks references to specific countries,” researcher Rosa Agliata told pv magazine. “To apply this workflow in other locations than Italy, it is only necessary to refer to local regulations when establishing heritage-compatibility criteria.”
The research group described its findings in “HBIM-based workflow for the integration of advanced photovoltaic systems in historical buildings,” which was recently published in the Journal of Cultural Heritage. They outlined a new method based on Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM), which is the process of creating digital representations of the building.
Historical research and on-site surveys form the initial step, exploring the building's concept and cultural significance, while field investigations gather contemporary data and precise measurements through methods like laser scans and visual analyses.
The next stage involves implementing the HBIM model using Building Information Modeling (BIM) software, adhering to Italy's regulations requiring a Level of Development (LOD) not lower than F, representing an “as-built” model.
The third and most extensive step involves selecting heritage-compatible PV interventions and components. The building is classified into elements, and potential PV interventions are categorized for evaluation: specifically considered, not allowed, and technically unfeasible.
As part of the third step, the evaluation of different commercial products for each intervention involves considering risks and benefits. Information on risks and benefits, among other sources, should stem from discussions with the energy and electrical engineers of the PV producers.
Finally, in the last step, the workflow selects PV components and integrates them into the computer model. The academics say they should be modeled with LOD E – the highest possible level in the design phase.
“For an improved accuracy, in addition to datasheets, consultation with the PV producers can be exploited to create the layouts specific for the PV interventions,” the researchers said. “The incorporation of realistic visualization allows for a pre-emptive evaluation of the aesthetic impact of the BIPV intervention. This enables early assessment and adjustment to maintain the building’s original values and appearances while minimizing any visual disruptions.”
Applying the designed workflow, academics conducted a case study on “Palazzo della Cultura,” a 16th-century courtyard building in the historic Italian town of Marcianise.
“The selection of the case study aims at having a typical and replicable example of a historical European building, which is located within an old town center and characterized by architectural elements and heritage values,” said the scientists.
Demonstrating the novel workflow in this case study, the research group highlighted its “positive implications in various aspects, including decision-making (e.g., promoting collaboration and interoperability), modeling (e.g., preemptive evaluation and reduction of impacts, PV component customization, and optimization), and data and process management (e.g., creating an all-in-one model for future assessments and operations).”
“Our  next research might focus on the reversibility and disassembly aspects of flexible PV components,” said Agliata.

Solar roofs in cars currently generate limited output due to space constraints, typically adding only a few kilometers of extra range.
Imec researchers designed glass solar modules with a proprietary ‘multi-wire' connection technology, utilizing silicon heterojunction-based solar cells and a low-temperature process up to 180 C. This innovative architecture provides flexibility in the electrical design, maximizing space usage with minimal additional materials and lower costs.
The Imec researchers used a multi-wire configuration, connecting solar cell circuits in parallel to maximize energy production on curved surfaces. This innovative interconnection, along with optical coatings, increased efficiency and minimized heating of solar cells and vehicle cabins.
In addition, they automated the previously manual production process of the multi-wire connecting films, enabling the cost-effective transfer of innovations to glass solar modules.
“Further upscaling is absolutely necessary,” said Jonathan Govaerts, project coordinator and lead researcher at Imec. “But what makes this project so unique is its proof of concept for a wide range of applications. The flexibility of the multi-wire connection for integrating solar cells on different surfaces and in different configurations is impressive.”

Record-breaking demand for rooftop PV systems in Austria this year quickly depleted available funding. The available funding for the individual rounds was quickly exhausted and in total, more than 2 GW of PV systems will be built.
The auction scheme for utility-scale PV in Austria has seen only 35% of the 2023 budget allocated in the first four rounds, assigning just 248 MW out of the tendered 700 MW. PV Austria is urging adjustments for the next year, proposing an increase in tender ceiling prices and the rollover of unused funding from this year.
The association said that the undersubscription of tenders is due to reasons such as the unjustified 25% discount for ground-mounted systems, elevated investment costs, and the lack of approvals from states and municipalities.
“It remains to be seen whether the selected projects will actually be built – because in practice there are other hurdles than securing the auction's incentive,” said PV Austria Managing Director Vera Immitzer. “We also need strong networks, clarity in network access and a modern e-commerce law in order to be able to use the diversity of technology.”
Austria surpassed 1 GW of annual PV installations for the first time in 2022. PV Austria said that developers installed 1,009 MW of solar, surpassing 740 MW in 2021, 341 MW in 2020, and 247 MW in 2019. By the end of 2022, the country's cumulative PV capacity had reached 3.79 GW, accounting for 6.6% of the nation's electricity demand last year.

In the week of Nov. 20 most main European electricity markets registered an increase in solar energy production compared to the previous week. The Portuguese, Spanish and French markets registered increases of 16%, 8.9% and 3.1%, respectively. On the other hand, production declined in the Italian and German markets. The Italian market registered the largest drop, with a 24% decline, while the German market fell by 11%.
On Nov. 24 Spain produced 88 GWh of PV energy, which is the highest value since Oct. 21 when it was 89 GWh. That day’s production exceeded the 84 GWh produced on Nov. 19, making it the highest for a November in history. In Portugal, on Nov. 24, there was also the production record for a November month, with 10 GWh of solar photovoltaic energy production.
Production figures will decrease in Spain, Germany and Italy in the week of Nov. 27, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s solar energy production forecasts.

 

During the week of Nov. 20, wind energy production increased in the Iberian Peninsula compared to the previous week. In the Portuguese market it rose by 115%, while in the Spanish market it increased by 74%. On the other hand, the French, Italian and German markets registered decreases in wind energy generation of 37%, 14% and 3.3% respectively.
Despite the week‑on‑week drop, on Nov. 23, the German market generated 989 GWh using wind energy, the highest value since the second half of February and an all‑time record for daily wind energy production for the month of November in this market. In the case of the Italian market, on Nov. 25, the production using this technology was 168 GWh, the highest since the first fortnight of January and the second highest for the month of November, after the one reached on November 22, 2022, of 176 GWh.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts, there will be an increase in production using this technology in the Iberian Peninsula and Italy in the week of Nov. 27, while it will decrease in the markets of France and Germany.

Electricity demand
In the week of Nov. 20, electricity demand increased in the main analyzed European markets with respect to the previous week. The French market registered the highest growth, with an increase of 9.4%. The German market registered the smallest increase, 1.5%. In the remaining markets, demand rose, ranging from 2.0% in Italy and the Netherlands to 3.4% in Spain.
During the week of November 20, all analyzed markets registered decreases in average temperatures compared to the previous week. Spain had the largest drop, 4.1 C, while the Netherlands had the smallest decrease, 1.9 C. Elsewhere, temperatures fell between 3.8 C of Portugal and 2.1 C of Great Britain.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts, there will be an increase in electricity demand in all analyzed markets during the last week of November.

European electricity markets
From Nov. 23 to Nov. 25, daily prices were below €100/MWh in almost all major European electricity markets, influenced by high levels of wind energy production. However, higher prices on the remaining days of the fourth week of November resulted in weekly averages higher than those of the previous week in most of the markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting. The exceptions were the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries, with a price decline of 17%, and the MIBEL market of Portugal and Spain, with declines of 17% and 18%, respectively. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices increased between 3.8% in the IPEX market of Italy and 19% in the EPEX SPOT market of France.
In the fourth week of November, weekly averages were below €105/MWh in most of the analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the N2EX market of the United Kingdom and the Italian market, where prices were €110.50/MWh and €131.61/MWh, respectively. In contrast, the Portuguese and Spanish markets registered the lowest averages, €69.78/MWh and €69.83/MWh, respectively. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €76.24/MWh in the Nordic market to €103.97/MWh in the Dutch market.
Between Nov. 20 and Nov. 22, the MIBEL market had the lowest daily prices compared to the rest of the main European markets. Since Oc. 26, this has been the case for 20 days.
In the case of the Portuguese market, despite registering the lowest weekly average, on Sunday, Nov. 26, from 18:00 to 19:00, it reached its highest hourly price since October 23, €156.68/MWh. On the other hand, the German, Belgian, French and Dutch markets registered hourly prices below €2/MWh on Friday, Nov. 24. The German market reached the lowest hourly price, €0.10/MWh.
During the week of Nov. 20, the 3.6% increase in the average gas spot price compared to the previous week and the general increase in electricity demand exerted an upward influence on prices in European markets. In addition, the weekly average of wind energy production also declined in most markets. In the MIBEL market, the significant increase in wind energy production on the Iberian Peninsula, together with the increase in solar energy production, led to lower prices.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the last week of November, prices in European electricity markets might continue to rise, influenced by increased demand. In addition, in some markets such as Germany and France, wind energy production might decline, contributing to this behavior.

Brent, fuels and CO2                                                                       
In the first sessions of the fourth week of November, Brent oil futures prices for the Front‑Month in the ICE market increased. These futures registered their weekly maximum settlement price, $82.45/bbl, on Tuesday, Nov. 21. However, on the remaining days of the fourth week of Nov., prices declined to reach the weekly minimum settlement price, $80.58/bbl, on Friday, Nov. 24. This price was virtually unchanged from the previous Friday’s price, $80.61/bbl.
On Wednesday, Nov. 22, OPEC+ announced that it postponed its next meeting until Thursday, Nov. 30. This exerted its downward influence on Brent oil futures prices. On the other hand, high production levels, the lifting of sanctions on Venezuela and the increase in U.S. reserves also contributed to the decline in prices. As a result, despite the increases registered in the first sessions of the fourth week of Nov., in the last session of the week the settlement price was slightly lower than on Friday, Nov. 17.
As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, they registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €44.06/MWh, on Tuesday, Nov. 21. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was the lowest since the first half of October. On the other hand, after a 5.0% increase from the previous day, TTF gas futures reached the weekly maximum settlement price, €46.83/MWh, on Thursday, Nov. 23.
During the fourth week of November, forecasts of low temperatures in Europe exerted an upward influence on prices. But high levels of European reserves and abundant supply caused these futures to reach the lowest price since October.
As for settlement prices of CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, in the fourth week of November, they were below €77/t. These futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €75.19/t, on Wednesday, Nov. 22. This price was the lowest since that registered on Nov. 22, 2022 for the reference contract of December 2022. In the last sessions of the fourth week of November, prices increased again. The settlement price of Friday, Nov. 24, €76.60/t, coincided with the settlement price of Monday, Nov.20. This settlement price was the highest in the fourth week of November.

Engie has started the construction of a 400 MW solar plant in Gujarat, India, secured through competitive bidding in a 750 MW auction by Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL).
With an estimated investment of $200 million, the project has a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with GUVNL, aiming to generate 907 GWh of electricity and offset 774,112 tons of carbon emissions annually.
Engie expects to commission the project by the second quarter of 2024, expanding its total renewable energy portfolio in India to 1.5 GW across 18 projects in seven states. This marks Engie's third renewable project in Gujarat.
“The project is presently in the construction phase, with the Final Investment Decision (FID) already made,” said Engie. “This successful FID decision is a significant milestone for ENGIE and showcases our potential to accelerate the development of our renewable energy portfolio and achieve our global target of adding 4 GW of capacity per year by 2025, taking our global installed capacity to 50  GW.” 
The decision to reach a financial investment decision (FID) is a pivotal step in project development, signifying the commitment of funds by a project sponsor or investor before the initiation of construction or implementation, according to Engie.
Engie plans to further expand its energy storage capabilities and provide innovative energy solutions to its customers in India.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/29/are-europes-major-solar-associations-divided-again/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,EUROPE",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 29, 2023","Are Europe’s major solar associations divided, again?","A news story published in the French daily Le Monde on Friday was the kindling that kicked off a media firestorm between two of Europe’s most prominent PV lobby groups – SolarPower Europe and the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC).
According to Le Monde, Brussels-based SolarPower Europe is allegedly trying to weaken draft European Union (EU) legislation relating to the ban of imported products made partially or wholly with forced labor. Brussels-based SolarPower Europe denied these claims in the news article and to pv magazine.
SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger told pv magazine that the 300-member strong association – consisting of 13% businesses headquartered in China – is not trying to water down EU legislation. “Our goal is, and has consistently been, to ensure legislation can do what it intends – that is to stop the import of products made with forced labor into the EU,” she said.
The Le Monde article said two leaked internal documents and an email show that SolarPower Europe is also opposed to the principle of reversing the burden of proof, and instead is opting for its 2021-founded Solar Stewardship Initiative (SSI) program. Hemetsberger refuted this.
“We have never suggested that the SSI should act as a replacement to the Forced Labor Ban or related sustainability efforts,” she said. “The SSI will serve to accelerate the goals and implementation of the Forced Labor Ban, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and other legislation.”
Hemetsberger said that SolarPower Europe agreed with the European Commission’s position on companies maintaining a burden of proof. The European Commission legislation, amended by Members of the Parliament, calls for the Commission to make a list of geographical areas and economic sectors at “high risk” of using forced labor, with the burden of proof falling on companies to prove that they do not use forced labor.
Once the story broke, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESCM) released its own press release. The Brussels-based organization’s sustainability policy director Jens Holm said that weakening legislation is “extremely destructive” and incongruous with the industry’s social responsibility. “At ESMC, we are disheartened to learn that such values are associated with our industry,” he said. “We expect our colleagues from SolarPower Europe to make their position clear; don’t you want a robust ban on all forced labor products?”
What is clear is that a fissure is widening between the trade bodies. But division in the European solar industry is not new. The association EU ProSun was founded in 2012 with the aim of defending the European PV supply chain against the looming might of the Chinese module manufacturing industry.
The entity campaigned to introduce anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties against Chinese solar products, which led the European Commission to develop a minimum-price threshold on Chinese PV panels in 2013. EU Prosun became inactive in 2018 after several years of struggling with the hegemon association, which was not in favor of introducing Chinese module restriction measures.
ESCM and SolarPower Europe have also recently expressed opposing views on the European Parliament’s recently supported EU Net-Zero Industry Act. SolarPower Europe policy director Dries Acke warned that the Act's requirements – of limiting tendered projects that use technology sourced outside the EU – may be a “red flag” for the solar sector and “for those committed to the EU’s energy security and climate goals.” But ESMC policy director Žygimantas Vaičiūnas took a different route and said the Act aligns “perfectly” with European industry interests.
Questioned whether these fresh divisions are beneficial for the solar sector, SolarPower Europe’s Hemetsberger said that any ostensible disunity – or what she refers to as “nuances in positioning” – is “regrettable” as it weakens the overall voice of the solar industry. “[The] challenge of our time requires a united sector representation,” she said.
ESMC's Holm told pv magazine that his association strongly favors European PV manufacturers and the overall industry, and SolarPower Europe “could” align itself with these values. At the end of the day, though, he said both organizations have one common enemy – the fossil fuel industry. But the climate transition, reliant on phasing out of fossil fuels and the phasing in of PV, “must not” be tainted with human rights violations, he said.
“We hope that we can agree to a common position that human rights violations, forced labor in particular, should be a no-go zone for the European solar sector,” Holm said.

France's INES, a division of the CEA, is developing TOPCon solar cells for space missions. The group said it has produced TOPCon devices with M2 wafers and a thickness of just 60 micrometers.
The CEA said the cells exhibit post-irradiation conversion efficiencies that are comparable to conventional p-type PERC cells in the same irradiation conditions.
However, this involves a device with approximately three times less mass for alternative flexible TOPCon cells, said the agency. It noted that the results were obtained using commercial industry-available equipment.
The TOPCon devices are built on passivating contacts based on polysilicon and silicon monoxide (SiOx) to limit optical losses, with type n layers on the front side and an emitter on the front face due to gallium-doped substrates.
The researchers noted the solar cell's potential for a simplified manufacturing process suitable for thin wafers. They said that these developments are part of the CARLAH2 project, supported by the ESA.

The group said that the China National Institute of Metrology has certified the result. When it was first unveiled in March, the module had an efficiency of 16.02%. “We are currently planning to raise the efficiency of the panel to over 18%,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine at the time, noting that the module was being made on a pilot production line.
The 320 W panel presented in May had a size of 2,005 mm x 1,005 mm x 35 mm and a weight of 34.5 kg. It uses an encapsulant film based on polyolefin elastomer (POE) and 3.2 mm semi-tempered glass.
The group's unit GCL-Perovskite switched on a 100 MW production line for these panels in September 2021. Ever since, however, there has been limited progress in scaling up production to the GW scale. To support its expansion plans, the company secured funds in December 2022 and is currently preparing for another funding round. In addition to GCL Group, Sequoia Capital China and Temasek Holdings are among the recent investors.
“The construction of a GW scale production line for mass production of perovskite modules is imminent,” GCL-Perovskite CEO, Fan Bin, told pv magazine. “The first phase of this program is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, with an annual production capacity of 500 MW.”
He noted that perovskite cells manufactured at the factory will be 30% cheaper than crystalline silicon solar cells.
GCL-Perovskite is also aiming to achieve a power conversion efficiency of over 26% for perovskite-silicon tandem solar modules by the end of next year.
In the solar perovskite business, the manufacturer operates through its subsidiaries Kunshan GCL Photoelectric Materials Co., Ltd. and Suzhou GCL Nano Technology Co., Ltd.

BloombergNEF has released its updated solar market outlook for 2023, projecting that 413 GW of module capacity will be installed this year. This capacity will mostly be driven by China’s contribution of 240 GW, along with strong growth in many other global regions.
The quarterly update was provided via Bloomberg’s podcast “Switched On” in the episode, “Solar supply glut crushes margins but buildout booming.”

If the world does install 413 GW of solar, we will have witnessed a growth of over 58% from the 260 GW installed in 2022, which itself marked an almost 42% increase from the 183 GW installed in 2021. During this two year period, the world will have experienced 125% growth, indicating that a doubling of deployed annual capacity occurred in around one and a half years.
This capacity growth will be driven by several factors. Foremost is China, which has driven the price of solar modules toward $0.10/W.
