The Renewable Energy and Jobs Annual Review 2021, published jointly with the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated solar employed 3.98 million people last year, up from 3.8 million in 2019.
The latest edition of the annual report included some eye-catching nuggets of information such as the claim made by the Mini Grids Partnership of UN partner organization Sustainable Energy for All, that only 13% of the $2.07 billion pledged from 2012 to March last year, by development finance institutions to foster mini-grid deployment, has actually been disbursed.
pv magazine’s  UP Initiative spent the second quarter of the year looking at what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to the workers, often far removed, involved in the production of their products and services.
The report also cited a U.S. study which estimated 43% of the workforce employed in coal-fired power plants could be redeployed on solar plants without any additional training, and the authors of the study suggested the large proportion of renewables employees who would need only on-the-job training for a clean energy role offered a no-brainer for governments around the world to achieve employment targets via Covid-recovery spending plans.
That ties in with the paragraph on page 90 of the report which hints at a possible pivot away from the idea the private sector is best equipped to drive the energy transition. While the report's authors state private companies have steered maturity in renewables technology, as well as significant price falls, they add: “But this will no longer suffice,” as interventionist government measures will be required to ensure the jobs windfall from the clean energy revolution is targeted towards those affected by fossil fuel job losses; that employment benefits are shared equitably across society, and geographically; and to ensure the good quality of renewables industry positions.
This year's study also estimated labor costs supply around 17% of the development costs of large scale solar projects, and around 32% of operations and maintenance expenses. According to the report, labor costs account for only around 6-7% of polysilicon prices, and 10-11% of solar cell and module costs but make up 27-31% of wafer price tags.
In terms of solar job numbers, the IRENA-ILO study said China‘s PV workforce rose from 2.2 million to 2.3 million last year and numbers were also up in Germany, where they rose by 5,800 to 43,900 in 2019, in the latest available statistics; and in the Philippines, from 33,700 to 41,035. IRENA has estimated the German figure could have risen to 51,000 last year, as part of 239,000 solar jobs across Europe, around 194,000 of which were in EU member states.
Photovoltaic industry job numbers fell, though, in the U.S., from 240,000 to 231,000; in Japan (241,000 to 220,000); in India (a 15% year-on-year reverse to 163,500); and in the U.K. (to 7,500 in 2019-20). The initial 1 GW of mini grid generation capacity targeted in India could help create 800-877,000 new positions, according to the report.
Elsewhere, the report estimated Brazil had 68,000 solar jobs in 2020 and Malaysia 54,900 in the latest available figures, which refer to 2019. South Korea hosted 19,300 solar roles in 2019 and Vietnam 126,300 last year, although the report's authors expect the numbers to slow there because of grid congestion constraints on new PV development.
The report noted the 500 MW Kalyon solar factory built in Turkey added 1,500 jobs last year and said Canada had around 3,000 solar posts, with Jordan boasting “more than 2,000.” The South African government estimated it had 21,451 solar jobs in 2020.
As far as off-grid solar employment was concerned, the report's authors admitted it was much more difficult to be certain about the numbers. Based on a belief many off-grid companies managed to retain staff despite only 250 MW of generation capacity being deployed, IRENA-ILO said 342,000 such jobs may have been maintained last year, with around 191,400 of them in South Asia and 150,000 in east, west and central Africa.

Dubbed GEH2, the hydrogen system has a size of 1,150×2,200x3350mm and weighs in at 3.5 tons. It features IP43 ingress protection and is able to operate at temperatures between -5 and 45 degrees Celsius. Its output voltage is between 230 and 400 V. 
The generator has a power of 110 kVA and its lifetime is guaranteed for two years or 15,000 hours. Its autonomy at 50% of prime running power is around eight hours. It can be started instantaneously and also features a double adduction system that allows continuous operation.
The system is equipped with fuel cells provided by Japanese automotive giant Toyota, which became EODev's largest shareholder in April. The heat dissipated by the fuel cell can also be used for cogeneration, the manufacturer said.
The GEH2 is produced by EODev in Montlhéry, in the Essonne department in Île-de-France, northern France, on the site of its industrial partner Eneria, which is a subsidiary of the Monnoyeur Group.
EODev recently announced it will provide GL events, a France-based global player in the event industry, with four GEH2 generators. The systems should be delivered in mid-2022.

The battery is designed as a “safe” plug-and-play solution, as it is equipped with a non-flammable electrolyte. Its total rated active power at 25 degrees Celsius is 1 MW and the storage capacity ranges from 4 to 12 MWh. The device's discharge duration is between 4 and 12 hours and DC-DC round-trip efficiency ranges from 70 to 75%.
The manufacturer claims the battery can operate for over 20,000 cycles and at operating temperatures between -10 and 50 degrees Celsius. “The battery is designed with recyclable components and does not degrade over time,” it said in a statement. “It maintains system performance, providing a reliable and cost-efficient system for 20 years.”
The novel battery technology will be tested by U.S. utility Duke Energy at its Emerging Technology and Innovation Center in Mount Holl, in North Carolina, where a 400 kWh device will be installed.
Honeywell said the battery solution may also be used in combination with its system for process, business and asset management – Experion PKS – and its remote monitoring solution Honeywell Forge, without providing more technical details on the battery technology.
“By partnering with Duke, we can implement this [innovative] energy storage technology at scale and bring to market a revolutionary flow battery to meet growing energy storage demands while assisting companies in meeting their carbon-neutral goals,” said Honeywell vice president Ben Owens.

Colombia‘s Ministry of Mines and Energy has announced the results of the country's second auction for large scale renewable energy projects.
In the procurement exercise, the National Mining and Energy Planning Unit allocated 796 MW of large scale solar at an average price of COP155/kWh ($0.041).
The capacity comes from 11 projects, under development by French utility EDF, Chinese-Canadian manufacturer Canadian Solar, Spanish solar companies Solarpack and Genersol, Italy's Enel, U.K.-based TWSolar, and Colombian developers Empresas públicas de Medellín, Celsia, EPM, Urrá and Fotovoltaica Arrayanes.
Projects selected in the auction are entitled to a 15-year PPA and must come into operation by January 1, 2023.
The Colombian authorities allocated 2.2 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity in the country’s first renewable energy auction, which was finalized in October 2019. That exercise’s final average price was COP95/kWh ($0.025), and the highest bid reached only COP110 ($0.029).
Projects selected in that first auction were entitled to a 15-year PPA and must come into operation by January 1, 2022. Contracts are linked to the Colombian peso and updated based on a producer price index certified by Colombia’s National Administrative Department of Statistics.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Colombia had an operational installed PV capacity of around 107 MW at the end of 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/27/module-and-shipping-cost-inflation-could-cost-the-world-50-gw-of-solar-next-year/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RACKING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MAX HALL,"OCTOBER 27, 2021",Module and shipping cost inflation could cost the world 50 GW of solar next year,"Norwegian business intelligence firm Rystad Energy has predicted rising solar module and shipping costs could prompt the delay or cancellation of as much as 56% of the solar generation capacity currently planned worldwide next year.
With the average price of solar modules having risen from $0.20 per Watt-peak last year to $0.26-0.28 since July, up to 50 GW of the 90 GW of solar generation capacity planned for 2022 could be threatened by inflation, according to the Oslo-based consultant.
Modules and shipping costs typically make up between a quarter and a third of solar project capital costs, according to Rystad, and both input costs have soared on the back of a shortage of shipping containers, exacerbated by the Covid crisis; and rising prices for solar panel raw materials polysilicon, silver, copper, aluminum, and glass.
The polysilicon price alone has almost quadrupled in recent months and the shipping costs for solar panels have risen almost sixfold, from $0.005/Wp, in September 2019, to around $0.03 this month.
With Rystad senior renewables analyst David Dixon stating the supply bottlenecks are unlikely to ease within 12 months, the company has calculated the levelized cost of energy from solar projects is likely to have risen 10-15% from the average figure posted last year.
That will leave solar project developers with a stark choice of either reducing their margins, passing on the costs in the form of more expensive solar electricity, or postponing or cancelling solar plants.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/27/taxes-set-to-push-up-solar-energy-tariffs-in-india/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 27, 2021",Taxes set to push up solar energy tariffs in India,"From pv magazine India
Indian solar tariffs may rise to INR2.60-2.70/kWh ($0.035-0.036) in the next fiscal year, due to the recent increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) applied to PV cells and panels, and a planned customs duty for imported solar modules, according to U.S.-owned Indian analyst Crisil Ratings.
Solar energy prices touched a low of INR2/kWh ($0.027) in a 1.07 GW solar auction held by the Solar Energy Corporation of India in November and then dipped further, to INR1.99 in a 500 MW auction in Gujarat.
However, the recent increase in GST on solar cells and modules, from 5% to 12%, which took effect on October 1, has increased the total taxation on solar projects from 8-9% to 12-13%. That figure will more than double to 30% when customs duty of 40% on imported solar modules kicks in from April 1, according to Crisil Ratings analysts.
Pick up your copy of the latest edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
Recent increases in module prices have added to the cost burden on project developers. Prices for monocrystalline modules stood at $0.23-0.24 per watt in the April to September period, compared to an average $0.21/W in the previous fiscal year. That has been primarily due to a significant rise in the price of polysilicon, a key material in solar cells, because of disruptions at the manufacturing facilities of Chinese manufacturers.
Crisil Ratings director Ankit Hakhu said: “High module prices, taxes and duties are likely to result in project cost inflation for solar developers. Compared to fiscal [year] 2021, we expect the project cost to increase by 15-20% (INR60-70 lakh [$79,900-93,200] per megawatt), on average, to INR4.2-4.3 crore [$559-573,000] per megawatt next fiscal [year], from [the] INR3.6-3.7 crore/MW [$479-493,000] seen during the last few [fiscal years]. This might make future solar bids expensive, at INR2.60-2.70/kWh, compared with the lows of INR2-2.20/kWh seen during fiscal [year] 2021, for developers to maintain returns of 11-12%.”
On the other hand, developers of already bid-out projects are expected to pass on the impact of taxes and duties under ‘change-in-law' contract clauses.
The tariff calculation suggested by Crisil considers an anticipated reduction in solar module prices to $0.20-0.21 per watt in the next fiscal year, based on an expectation of a leveling of silicon prices following the ramp-up of operation in planned and existing production capacities. In the absence of such a price correction, tariffs could further increase, by INR0.15-0.20 [$0.002-0.003] per kilowatt-hour, to maintain desired developer returns, according to Crisil Ratings analysts.
Electricity distribution utilities have been reluctant to sign power purchase agreements at tariffs above INR2.50/kWh ($0.033). For instance, the projects allocated in a 12 GW manufacturing-linked tender in January 2020 – which yielded an INR2.90/kWh ($0.039) tariff – remained unsigned by the power off-takers until the second quarter of the current fiscal year, when the contracts received partial acceptance at a lower tariff of INR2.50/kWh.
Crisil director Aditya Jhaver said: “An increase in tariffs envisaged in future bids may scare away state distribution companies and add to an already large capacity, of 20 GW, that has been bid-out but [which] haven’t found a buyer for the electricity. On the other hand, if developers resort to aggressive bidding in a competitive market, it will likely increase the credit risk on new projects, as the cashflow cushion may be thinner.”
Thus, added the analyst, “the ability to take suitable tariff hikes, and approvals, under the change in law clause, remain key drivers for [the] credit quality of future projects. Further, while the custom duty will support the cost competitiveness of domestic module manufacturers vis-à-vis imports, no notable module price correction is envisaged from these players over the medium term as it will take some time for the domestic players to ramp-up the capacities along the entire value chain and lower their operating cost.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/27/italy-can-be-a-laboratory-for-agrivoltaics/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EVENTS,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"OCTOBER 27, 2021",‘Italy can be a laboratory for agrivoltaics’,"Italy's solar industry has turned out in force in Rimini this week, at the Key Energy renewables event which is a traditional draw for the PV sector, and which is held as part of the Ecomondo circular economy show.
Agrivoltaics were the subject of presentations on yesterday's opening day of the show, with experts in the field suggesting Italy could become a world leader in the technology, despite the difficulties solar developers are encountering in the nation.
“Italy can be a living laboratory,” said Alessandra Scognamiglio, coordinator of the task force on sustainable agrivoltaics at Italian research agency ENEA, formerly the Energia Nucleare ed Energie Alternative. Scognamiglio told pv magazine Italy has ambitious energy objectives but is constrained by two factors: having the world's highest concentration of UNESCO sites, and globally popular agricultural production.
Solar PV could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. pv magazine’s UP initiative this year shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
“We know that there is significant interest from entrepreneurs,” she said. “However, at the moment, the authorization process is confused and obliges entrepreneurs to invest significant time and resources.”
The relatively novel technology of agrivoltaics is developing faster than legislation in Italy, said Scognamiglio, who added: “Globally, agrivoltaic projects are of limited size but it is now a matter of making a leap from the current 200 kW plants to plants covering up to 100 hectares. Defining criteria and suitable areas is complex because of the limited experience and experimentation globally.”
A cross-disciplinary approach is needed to guide agrivoltaic legislation, said the researcher, because the current permitting process involves several layers of assessment. “This is the second complexity. That's why a trans-disciplinary approach is important,” said Scognamiglio, adding she feels Italy is moving in the right direction.
The Italian government has committed to devote €1.1 billion to establishing 2 GW of new agrivoltaic generation capacity this decade as part of its EU-funded post-Covid National Recovery and Resilience Plan. “Italy is the only EU country that included funds for agrivoltaic projects in its recovery plans,” said Scognamiglio.
ENEA is a key player in the recently funded National Network for Sustainable Agrivoltaics. “The platform allows a wide range of actors to confront and understand each other, allowing them to team up and come up with a trans-disciplinary approach that reflects complexity,” said Scognamiglio. “We are promoting a way of proceeding with PV installations which is quite different and new.”
The state body worked on the organization with ETA Florence, a communications firm dedicated to accelerating the green transition, and the network’s website went live in an updated version this month.
ETA Florence project manager Giulio Poggiaroni told pv magazine: “The network was launched in April but we started the activities in September. The goal is to become the point of reference, and meeting point, for the agrivoltaic community in Italy, [to] provide clarifications [and] updates, [and to] give space to companies and innovative solutions.”
The need for a cross-cutting approach to the deployment of solar-based agricultural installations was endorsed by consultant Fabrizio Cembalo Sambiase, who told pv magazine: “I believe that the completion of the work entrusted by the Italian government to ENEA and, in several respects, to the GSE [state renewables and energy efficiency body the Gestore dei servizi energetici], could be a reasonable approach.”
Cembalo Sambiase added, a one-size-fits-all approach is of little help for agrivoltaics, as projects must be suited to their individual sites and territories. “The plants must not be thought of as technological structures to be superimposed on an undifferentiated territory, but as opportunities to rethink man's relationship with his environment and the activities that take place there,” he added, stating the experience to be accumulated during the deployment of new systems would help change the planning approach, and cultural ideas about solar in the landscape. His position resembles ENEA’s attempts. The research agency has worked since 2010 to prove agrivoltaic systems must be seen as landscape-integrated photovoltaic facilities.

The two patents cover Solaria's shingled solar module technology. “The judge’s initial determination unequivocally demonstrates that Canadian Solar utilized Solaria’s innovations and technology without permission and in violation of U.S. patent law,” Solaria said in a statement. “In so finding, the judge ruled against Canadian Solar’s claims that the patents were invalid and not infringed.”
Solaria added that, if those claims will be ascertained, the ITC may halt shingled module imports in the U.S. market from the Chinese-Canadian manufacturer. “Solaria is open to cooperating with companies that recognize the value of Solaria’s IP [intellectual property]; we’ve licensed Solaria’s technology to other companies in the industry,” Solaria CEO Tony Alvarez affirmed. “However, when foreign companies such as Canadian Solar ignore American patents and violate our core IP, Solaria will actively defend our IP against any infringers, and protect our technology for ourselves and our valued partners.”
Solaria had lodged a patent infringement claim for two patents in the U.S. District Court for the northern district of California in March 2020. Six months later, it brought the legal dispute to the ITC, adding a third patent – 10,763,388 – which concerns the technology in shingled modules that have a plurality of strings formed by overlapping PV strips.
At that time, Canadian Solar had defined the patent lawsuit as “flawed.” “Asserting the same family of patents against the same limited number of products (HiDM and HiDM5) in a different forum does not make Solaria's claims any less flawed,” Canadian Solar stated.
Solaria said it gave Canadian Solar information about its shingling process in 2014, ahead of a proposed licensing deal between the two companies, with a non-disclosure agreement signed in June 2015.

“Building thinner devices is beneficial for reducing the material costs,” the research's main author, Hitoshi Sai, told pv magazine. “There are several issues to be tackled for the commercial production of very thin c-Si cells, but our results encourage [progression] to thinner wafers, with a size of 120μm, from the current industry standard of 160μm.”
The solar cell has an area of 4cm2 and was fabricated with an n-type Czochralski (CZ)-grown monocrystalline silicon wafer with a thickness of only 56.2μm. The scientists decided to replace the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer that is commonly used in this kind of cell with a hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) layer, which is said to show improved surface passivation, lower parasitic absorption, and higher external quantum efficiency. The layer was grown through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).
An anti-reflecting coating based on silicon oxide (SiOx) was also applied on the cell surface to reduce primary reflection loss. The device was tested under standard illumination conditions and was found to exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 23.27%. It also showed an open-circuit voltage of 754 mV, a short-circuit current of 37.85 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 81.5%.
“To our knowledge, the open-circuit voltage of 754 mV is the highest value independently confirmed under standard test conditions among any c-Si solar cells reported so far, even though the size of our SHJ [silicon heterojunction] cell is small,” the researchers stated, noting that 23.27% efficiency is also the highest value for c-Si solar cells with a thickness of less than 60μm.
According to the Japanese group, the device's high open-circuit voltage is beneficial for its power yield, as it helps mitigate performance
degradation at elevated temperatures, which makes the cell particularly suitable for hot and sunny climate regions. “Needless to say, the mass production of very thin c-Si cells and modules with a sufficient yield and a high throughput, remains a challenging issue,” they also acknowledged.
The scientists concluded that their new cell demonstrates that the heterojunction architecture can be successfully used also with ultra-thin solar cells, and that this configuration offers the advantage of superior surface passivation combined with a manufacturing process which can be carried out at lower temperature.
The device was described in the study Very Thin (56 μm) Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells with an Efficiency of 23.3% and an Open-Circuit Voltage of 754 mV, which was recently published in RRL Solar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/27/large-format-modules-present-a-new-set-of-challenges/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"OCTOBER 27, 2021",Large format modules present a new set of challenges,"From pv magazine USA
In the last two years, the 210mm wafer has emerged as the clear frontrunner in cell size innovation. It has displaced the previous 156.75mm standard that represented more than 90% of the monocrystalline market, and offers advantages in power output that have allowed module power ratings to exceed 600 W from a 60-cell PERC module.
In an industry where cost is everything, the increase in production capacity brought about by large-size products–reducing the cost of labor, depreciation, and operating, management and financial expenses per unit of output–has promised to significantly cut balance of system costs and the levelized cost of electricity.
Yet, as modules change in size and form factor, ripple effects are felt across the entire solar industry, requiring tweaks, modifications, and outright changes to longstanding project development and construction practices.
Perhaps nowhere are these adjustments more impactful than in the module mounting world, especially with regards to trackers. Manufacturers have to take into account and adjust for new size dimensions, weights, and environmental and operational variables presented by a newly dominant module size.
(The 2021 Roundtables USA virtual event November 9 takes on the topic of large-format modules with a panel made up of Longi Solar, Arctech, and Solar Innovations. Register here for this free event.)
To better understand the challenges that larger modules present to tracker manufacturers in both engineering and installation, pv magazine spoke with experts at two of the industry’s leading companies: Cody Norman, director of applications engineering at Array Technologies, and Nick Mattison, product line manager for NEXTracker’s NX Horizon smart solar tracker.
“Larger PV modules result in higher loads,” Norman said. “These loads are primarily on the module support components, but it’s also on the tracker structure and the foundation.”
Increased load on the tracker presents two distinct challenges: dead weight load across an installed row and dynamic weight in severe wind and weather events. Dead weight has an effect on the tracker by limiting how many modules can be supported by the tracker in a row.
“With modules that are significantly longer, significantly heavier, we might not be able to achieve a full 100-meter row length,” said Norman. “There’s some mechanical limitations of having that much mass supported along the tracker.”
Row-length limitation has been an issue for NEXTracker, one that the company is still working to conquer, said Mattison.
Both said that the majority of mechanical changes have been pushed by the incident pressures of wind and snow on the module.
Larger modules take wind and snow pressures and turn them into higher forces applied against the module and the tracker structure. This factor has required additional analysis that both companies have had to consider during the design process.
“The modules themselves effectively create a sail,” said Mattison “When you increase the size of that sail, that translates to a lot of extra load.”
To accommodate those forces, Norman said that Array has looked to increase the extent, size, and depth of foundations across the tracker row. It also has turned to using purlins and mounting clamps with more material and more reach.
Wind load is most significant on modules at the end of a row, said Norman. Modules at the exposed end may require additional fasteners to handle the higher wind load forces.
NEXTracker, by contrast, has not added components to bear the static and dynamic loads. Instead, it has opted to “beef up” and reinforce existing hardware, specifically the rails, according to Mattison.
Both said that the tracker drives — the motors which rotate the panels rows to track the sun — were areas of considerable focus. Outside of some adjustments to torque tube layout and position, however, the drives remained essentially unchanged.
As for the installation process, Norman and Mattison both said that it has remained relatively unchanged. The newer, larger modules still require just two workers to install. However, it’s a different story for two-in-portrait (2P) installations where the modules and trackers are higher off the ground.
“You’re managing a module that’s probably five square feet larger and probably 15 pounds heavier, if not more, than what you’re used to working with,” said Norman. “When you’re working well above your head, these heavier, larger modules are kind of challenging to deal with.”
With the exception of 2P installation concerns, Norman downplayed the challenges these tweaks present, framing them instead as a natural evolution of the technology. To him, the biggest challenge was how quickly 210mm wafer modules became standard across the industry.
It’s not as if either Array or NEXTracker was caught off guard by the new module sizes, far from it. Both Norman and Mattison highlighted how closely their companies collaborate with leading manufacturers.
The issue was that any new standardized form factor needs to go through extensive usage testing, extreme weather resilience testing, and project-level consideration to ensure that the trackers and their hardware are compatible with the new modules in every usage case. Having to accelerate these verification processes was an issue that both companies faced but handled well, according to Mattison and Norman.
Mattison said that NEXTracker has had to test compliance for more than 100 modules that make use of the 210mm cell size.
Large format modules have stolen the show recently, but there is plenty more going in pv module technology besides this! Join pv magazine on November 2nd, when we'll be discussing progress and large scale production of n-type TOPCon cell technology with two experts: JinkoSolar's Mohamed Saady and Radovan Kopecek of ISC Konstanz.
One future issue is standardization. Some in the industry are concerned that module sizes will just keep growing and changing as new innovations become financially viable. The worry is that there is a breaking point in terms of size, as having to add a third installer per module would throw a wrench into labor costs and installation times.
Concerns over size variances are real enough that eight prominent module manufacturers, Risen Energy, Zhonghuan Semiconductor, Tongwei, Trina Solar, Huansheng Photovoltaic, Runyang New Energy Technology, Canadian Solar, and Wuxi Shangji Automation, are pushing to standardize 210mm silicon wafers and modules.
“The 600 W+ sizes that we’re seeing, where they’re 2.4 meters long, 1.3 meters wide, 38 kilos, if we start moving past 40 kilos or 1.5 or larger meters wide, it’s just going to be a major sail,” said Norman. “We’re also going to have to start worrying about the mechanical capabilities of the module itself: how much metal is going to be required in the frame to support the load, how much glass is being used and what’s the thickness?”
In late October, Trina Solar said the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) was set to announce a set of standard dimensions for large format modules relying on the 210mm wafer launched by Zhonghuan Semiconductor in 2019.
Having a standard set of dimensions should make thing simpler, and therefore cheaper, for project developers and component suppliers. All of them have to deal with uncertainty over module sizes and electrical characteristics since the switch to larger wafer formats began to play out.
For Mattison, the idea of standardized wafer and module sizes is one that he would support, although he notes that previous standardization efforts have lagged, and that the market tends to settle into a universal size range.
“A year ago, it was all over the place, but it seems to be consolidating down to just a few form factors now,” Mattison said.
Both solar pros predicted that, at least in the short term, innovation in power density will likely shift toward efficiency, as the sector is nearing the apex the size of modules that two workers can install.
“Where we’re at,” Mattison said, “is probably close to where we’re going to be for the next few years.”

Western Australian company Global Energy Ventures (GEV) today announced it will be developing a major green hydrogen project off Australia’s north coast with the backing of the Northern Territory government and traditional landowners. The Tiwi Hydrogen Project, as its called, will be constructed in phased capacity up to 2.8 GW, eventually producing 100,000 tonnes per annum of green hydrogen for export into the Asia-Pacific region.
The initial development will see around 500 MW of solar generation installed on the island, expanding as regional hydrogen markets grow and costs of solar, electrolyzers and shipping reduce. A financial investment decision for the project’s first phase is expected in 2023, with the company saying this would allow its first hydrogen export to begin in 2026, subject to approvals and offtake.
The project seeks to vertically integrate GEV’s hydrogen business, which has largely focussed on designing and making ships to both run on and carry compressed hydrogen. “This project can transition GEV from a midstream service provider to an innovative hydrogen company,” GEV’s managing director and CEO, Martin Carolan, said. “Our compressed shipping solution is highly modular and can therefore scale to match the advancement of electrolyzer technologies and market demand for pure green hydrogen gas, and deliver a competitive cost of hydrogen as the project scales.”

Storing hydrogen as a compressed gas has received far less attention than its denser cousins, liquified hydrogen and ammonia. The Western Australian company, however, is convinced the simplicity of compressed hydrogen makes it both a quicker and more financially feasible way to supply the Asia-Pacific region.
The Tiwi Islands were selected for the project because of their proximity to key future markets like Japan, Korea and China. The project’s location is also near to Port Melville, with GEV saying it will continue working with the port’s owners AusGroup Limited to integrate the project and port facilities.
The company will be developing the Tiwi Hydrogen Project in parallel to its ship engineering and class approval program, which earlier this month cleared a significant approval milestone after being issued its Approval in Principle from the American Bureau of Shipping.
The Northern Territory’s Minister for Renewables and Energy, Eva Lawler, welcomed the news and the company’s work with the Tiwi Land Council and Traditional Owners of the land. GEV’s proposed project is located on the traditional lands of the Munupi people, with the company saying its next steps in developing the project include working with the Tiwi Plantation Corporation, Tiwi Land Council and Munupi Landowners to progress securing a Section 19 Lease/Licence over the proposed solar site.
It is also seeking to finalize community benefits to the Tiwi people, in the form of leasehold payments, employment, and supporting power and water infrastructure.
GEV plans to fast-track the installation of solar monitoring stations at several locations on the island, allowing it to establish bankable solar generation data for the proposed project location. It will then move forward with feasibility studies, gathering further information on the project development schedule, technical partners, project scale, solar monitoring activities and appointment of consultants.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/27/dragon-scale-solar-tiles-installed-on-google-buildings-in-silicon-valley/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 27, 2021",Dragon scale solar tiles installed on Google buildings in Silicon Valley,"From pv magazine USA
One of Google’s newest buildings is using a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) product called Dragonscale, which is manufactured by European solar panel company SunStyle.
And it is gorgeous.
The internet giant, which also is a world-leading clean energy procurement company, has installed around 7 MW of the product on two buildings at its Silicon Valley campus. The 90,000 individual solar panels will generate enough electricity to cover around 40% of the electricity used in the buildings, known as Bay View and Charleston East.
The solar cells are embedded into a sturdy, but flexible, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) layer. Six millimeters of hardened solar glass protects the face of the panels; the back is protected by a layer of fire-resistant Tedlar (polyvinyl fluoride). Because the edges of the tiles are sealed to keep out moisture — much like a glass-glass solar panel — aluminum framing on the panel is not necessary.
The polyvinyl layer is a highly textured “prismatic” surface, which traps photons within the solar panel that would normally escape from traditional flat solar panels. The result is an increase in solar panel generation.

Technically, if we were to only install one of the panels it would have an efficiency of 15%. That is because the standard shingle doesn’t have a solar cell in the top square due to the product’s overlapping nature. But when we take into account the overlapping configuration, the effective efficiency rating is closer to 17%, which is what the company lists on its website.
 
The solar cells are a standard monoPERC (monocrystalline passivated emitter and rear cell) product. The panels connect with a standard MC-4 type connector and use industry-standard solar inverters.
 
The company’s specifications list five separate solar panel types, which fit into the border areas of the roof, taking advantage of the entire roof.

Sunstyle shared a .gif on its website to show how the product is installed. The solar tiles are screwed directly into the sun-roof structure. The substructure can be made of wood or stainless steel.
A wood lattice substructure is the common roofing technique used in Europe. This allows for solar panels to be better used as building material. In the United States, this lattice substructure would be the rafters located under a plywood base.
The warranty covers the product’s ability to generate electricity as well as its integrity as a building material. The shingles are guaranteed to last 30 years. Energy output is guaranteed to remain above 90% of its rated efficiency after 10 years, and above 80% after 25 years.
