The researchers demonstrated a multi-layer silicon nanoparticle (SNP) solar cell based on nanoparticles that are densely stacked inside a dielectric medium.
“We show how this inherently textured architecture acts as a light absorber while having the potential to separate and transport photo-generated carriers,” they said. “We also assume a metallic contact (silver) below, and an anti-reflection coating (ARC) above the absorbers to further resemble a real cell.”
They assumed that the nanoparticles were spherical with a selected radius of 300 nanometers and a refractive index of 1.8, which is in line with values provided by materials such as PEDOT:PSS and spiro-OMeTAD. They compared the absorption spectra of a multi-layer SNP absorber with two and five layers of silicon nanospheres to that of a flat layer and found that these particle-based structures provide improved absorption, at longer wavelengths.
“Increasing the number of SNP layers reduces the advantage of the SNP structure in comparison to a planar one,” they said. “This indicates that the SNP cell is optically preferable only when a few layers are used.”

The research group also found that a dense distribution of SNPs is preferable to sparse ones for solar cell applications.
“This is because SNPs are assumed to be the main absorber in the cell. Thus, any distance between them reduces the absorption of incident photons,” the group said.
They considered different SNP structures and configurations to tailor these particles as a p–n junction cell. They said this kind of cell could achieve a theoretical efficiency of around 11%.
“Moreover, we showed that by including silica nanoparticles of proper size on top of the cell structure, one can enhance the photocurrent up to around 10%,” they said.
They described the novel cell concept in “Design and analysis of multi-layer silicon nanoparticle solar cells,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
“The cell configurations introduced in this study provide improved optical absorption in an inherently textured structure,” they said. “Interestingly, these features even happen for configurations with random distributions of nanoparticles; this issue leads to a simplified way for fabrication of these ultra-thin cells.”
Another recent study at Penn State University shows that nanoparticles boost solar cell efficiency, but not for the reason the researchers expected.
“But this research shows that it doesn’t matter if you put in up-conversion nanoparticles or any other nanoparticles – they will show the boosted efficiency because of the enhance light scattering,” they explained.
They said that by simply changing the shape, size and distribution of nanoparticles within the solar cells, higher efficiencies could be achieved.
“So some optimum shape, distribution or size can actually lead to even more photocurrent enchantment,” the Penn State team said. “That could be the future research direction based on ideas from this research.”

Firefighters in the city of Álava, Spain, have revealed on Twitter that they managed to extinguish a fire that broke out on the morning of Aug. 1 at the transformation center of the Ekian solar park, in the municipality of Ribera Baja.
The fire did not cause significant damage to the facility. The cause of the blaze remains unknown and an investigation is now underway.
The 24 MW Ekian solar park is located in the Arasur Industrial Park and was inaugurated in January 2020 by local utility Ente Vasco de la Energia (EVE). The plant is located on a 55-hectare industrial estate called La Lágrima.
Work began on the facility in April 2019 and took eight months to complete. As the largest Basque solar plant, it has 67,000 355 W solar panels.

The plan will draw on a new €12.9 billion ($13.1 billion) fund that the Irish government has allocated to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), as part of revisions to the country's National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-30.
In a recent study, scientists from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) investigated the potential consequences that this massive plan could have on the country's energy system. They considered costs and determined that the biggest deployments could materialize in areas of high demand for heat, rather than in areas of high renewable electricity supplies.
Their analysis was based on ESRI's Electricity Network and Generation INvEstment (ENGINE) model.
“ENGINE determines the generation and transmission assets required to meet increased electricity demand, a change in the geographic location of energy demands, a given renewable energy target and/or a decarbonization policy,” the scientists explained.
The modeling focused on a heat pump penetration that would allow up to 30% of residential heat demand to be covered by such devices. It included the costs of retrofitting the dwellings.
“The results indicate that the new electricity demand from electrified heat requires a significant investment in generation assets, and a small decrease in transmission assets,” they said. “This suggests that the transmission network can be used more efficiently when electricity demand is more dispersed. The greatest cost increase, however,
comes from the retrofit of dwellings, which is far greater than the electricity system costs.”
The scientists said that optimizing the spatial heat pump rollout in Ireland could lead to a small decrease in total energy system costs. Regions with high demand for heat, such as Dublin, will drive demand more than regions with high availability of renewable energy, such as the west coast, they added.
Recent research from the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA) shows that the Irish market is currently dominated by air and water source heat pumps. Ground-source and air-to-air and air-source heat pumps account for just a small portion of the total market. At the end of 2020, around 44,000 heat pumps were operational in the country.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/04/europe-can-compete-effectively-with-asian-solar-manufacturers-with-innovative-long-term-pv-technology-solutions/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,"AUGUST 4, 2022",Europe can compete effectively with Asian solar manufacturers with innovative long-term PV technology solutions,"Europe's struggle to move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas is threatened by renewable energy dependence on China. Indeed, 80% of the world's solar energy industry is located in China.
Europe's solar power projects would be stalled if solar cells or modules cannot be sourced from China, warns the International Energy Agency. It predicts that up to 95% of the solar industry could be concentrated in China by 2025. But do not forget imports from China could be affected by another wave of coronavirus, logistics disruptions, or by political wrangling, as Lithuania has experienced.
In the first four months of this year, China exported 49 GW of solar modules, half of which, 24.4 GW, were bought by European countries, according to consultancy InfoLink. Exports to Europe are up 144% compared to the same period last year. The Netherlands bought 12.1 GW of Chinese modules. Spain imported 3.3 GW, Poland and Germany 1.9 GW and 1.4 GW, respectively. InfoLink forecasts that European module demand will reach 49-55 GW this year.
In September 2020, Europe launched the Solar Industrial Programme to accelerate the implementation of solar PV component manufacturing projects. In 2021, the “European Solar Initiative” was created, aiming to create 20 GW of solar module production capacity by 2025.
We need to think in great detail about how the EU Solar Strategy will be implemented – the financing of planned measures through the EU Solar PV Alliance and other possible instruments. It is not yet clear to what extent the European Commission (EC) will call on Member States to reallocate funding for PV. We need to understand that PV production in Europe will only recover if there is long-term competitive financing for production
The production of solar cells in Europe, and the supply of raw materials for this production, must play a key role. Over the last five to seven years, cell production in Europe has declined. It will now require much more investment to restore it than would have been needed if funding had been provided to sustain production. Currently, the nine largest Chinese manufacturers account for more than 50% of the global solar cell market.
Studies show that in order to compete with the Chinese, it is necessary to build large-scale capacity with an annual capacity of at least 5 GW. Only then will projects be economically viable. In China, the cost of PV production is 10% lower than in India, 20% lower than in the US, and 20% lower than in Europe, due to differences in energy, labour, and other input prices.
European producers are and will be unable to compete on price with Asian producers, which receive billions in subsidies and use coal to produce cheap silicon. And this is the main difference with Europe, which already uses clean renewable energy in its production
It is no coincidence that the EU has set itself the strategic objective of re-establishing a solar manufacturing industry in Europe, whatever the cost, because it is a matter of strategic economic importance. We hope that this process will gain momentum in the near future. European producers must be ready for a qualitative leap.
China has played a major role in making solar energy cheaper over the past decade, and helping to make it one of the cheapest and apparently most affordable ways of generating electricity worldwide. However, solar energy, which is becoming one of the cornerstones of the world's energy mix, is becoming too important to concentrate the production of solar components in one country, as is the case today.
The International Energy Agency has produced a report on the Global Solar Chain with recommendations to promote the production of solar components around the world and building solar PV component factories in regions where demand for solar energy is particularly high.
Even though the cost of producing a solar power plant in the EU is around 20% higher than in China due to higher energy costs and higher wages, EU policy makers need to find ways to produce solar power plants in Europe. Even if this requires subsidies for the construction of new factories or market defence mechanisms against imports of low quality products.
And manufacturers need to think about sustainable and innovative long-term solutions, because this is the only way we can compete with China, at least in Europe.

Wirsol, a subsidiary of Germany-based renewables group Wircon, said the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) in Australia has approved the Maryvale Solar and Energy Storage project, which will couple a 175 MW solar farm with up to 270 MWh of energy storage.
The Maryvale Solar and Energy Storage project builds upon an original proposal for a 125 MW solar farm. The expanded project will comprise approximately 235 MWp of solar PV capacity “DC-coupled” with 190 MWh to 270 MWh of energy storage.
Wirsol, which acquired a majority stake in the original project late last year from Netherlands-based renewables developer Photon Energy, said the approval brings it a step closer to building what it described as “a market-first hybrid solar and energy storage plant.” The company said the DC-coupling of solar generation and energy storage involves connecting both elements directly into the inverters at the site, allowing it to function as a predictable and dispatchable generation asset.
“This means that solar or grid energy can be efficiently stored for later use when the market requires it,” Wirsol said in a statement. “It also allows what is known as ‘clipped’ energy to be stored, thereby increasing the effective production of the photovoltaic components compared to a traditional solar plant.”
The company said the flexibility afforded by combining renewable energy generation and storage is far better suited to meeting the needs of Australia’s electricity market.
“The pairing means that the plant’s output into the grid is fully controllable, ensuring stability of supply whilst allowing it to bid into markets previously unavailable to variable renewable energy plants,” Wirsol said.
Construction is expected to begin in 2023, with commercial operations to commence in early 2025. Once completed, the project will generate enough clean energy to power the equivalent of approximately 82,000 homes per year. It will deliver at least 3 GW of renewable energy into the grid.

“Agriculture is essential for the growth of [Turkey] and it is important to adopt methodologies and technologies to assist agriculture in providing food that is sufficient for the entire population,” Eren Engur, a board member of the Turkish solar association, Günder, told pv magazine. “We believe that with this new supportive regulation photovoltaic-powered irrigation systems will save labor and fuel cost in rural off-grid areas of the country.”
The new provisions state that both project typologies can be built without the need for construction permits. PV systems for irrigation must be built no more than 150 cm from the ground, with metal mounting structures. The new regulations also state that rooftop PV systems will have to comply with the aesthetic requirements of each building and the surrounding environment.
Turkey reached a cumulative PV capacity of 8.5 GW at the end of June, according to figures recently released by the Turkish grid operator, TEIAS.

Advanced Clean Energy Storage I, LLC recently won a $504.4 million loan guarantee from US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office for the construction of the storage facility. The project will store hydrogen generated by the Intermountain Power Agency’s IPP Renewed Project – an 840 MW hydrogen-capable gas turbine combined cycle power plant located in the area.
“The plant will initially run on a blend of 30% green hydrogen and 70% natural gas starting in 2025 and incrementally expand to 100% green hydrogen by 2045,” Aces Delta said in a statement.
US-based contractor WSP USA has secured an engineering, procurement and construction management contract (EPCM) to build the two underground hydrogen storage caverns, each with a capacity of 150 GWh.
“This stored green hydrogen becomes an energy reserve that can be released to produce fuel for electric power generation at any time,” said WSP USA.
The storage caverns and the power plant will form the Advanced Clean Energy Storage hub, which Aces Delta says will convert renewable energy via 220 MW of electrolyzers to produce up to 100 metric tons of green hydrogen per day. The development of the project began in May 2019.
“Central Utah is the ideal location for this project, and Utah is a business-friendly state for projects like this,” said Craig Broussard, CEO of Magnum. “Magnum’s site adjacent to the Intermountain Power Project is positioned to take full advantage of existing regional electricity grid connections, fully developed transportation infrastructure, ample solar and wind development capacity, a skilled workforce currently transitioning away from coal, and, of course, the unique salt dome opportunity.”
Magnum Development also owns a domal-quality salt formation in the western United States and five operational salt caverns for liquid fuel storage.

First of all, it must be noted that each part of Thailand has different conditions of weather and pollution that would definitely impact electricity generation. Our requirement for the system is actually simple; the performance of each system must be at its optimum at all times where possible. Managing these many systems located in various locations would normally require excessive resources, including cost and manpower, if we did not have a reliable and real-time monitoring system. With Huawei’s Fusion Solar monitoring system, we instantaneously know the condition of each system which allows us to promptly analyze its performance and dispatch our team to the site in a timely manner. Moreover, Huawei has made available a broad variety of functions. Apart from being able to pinpoint performance on the inverter itself, we can even obtain information on PV modules’ health and condition. Therefore, Huawei’s inverters can match our high operating standards and objectives to provide only the highest performance and reliable systems to our customers.
There are many challenges that we have encountered during the development and construction of the project. Selecting Huawei gives us strong stability of electricity generation as the inverter’s technology provides high efficiency, high stability, and durability for the lifetime of the project. These are the main reasons why we generally choose Huawei as our partner in many projects in Thailand as well as our overseas projects. This is also in line with our principle as solar rooftop system providers which is to always provide our customers with the highest reliability.
One of the biggest advantages that we see in Huawei’s inverter is the in-built function for monitoring and I-V curve diagnosis. These functions will be able to efficiently support our operation and maintenance program. More specifically, the data will be used to verify and control installation work while we can also check the I-V curve for all rooftop systems at our headquarters under the supervision of our dedicated team for each rooftop.
Chow Energy has enjoyed great success in developing solar projects both domestically and overseas bringing a cumulative total of more than 100 MW capacity to commercial operation across various types of projects including large-scale ground-mount projects and both commercial and residential rooftop projects. With a pipeline in excess of one Gigawatt across the Asia-Pacific region, we aim to continue our growth, both in our home market of Thailand and internationally, in the renewable energy sector across various renewable sources, though it will be underpinned by our expertise in solar. With projects involving solar storage, agricultural-sharing, or even floating solar projects with fisheries, we are very excited about what the future holds for Chow Energy and the customers that we serve.

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revealed that the United States added 15 GW of generating capacity in the first six months of 2022. The top three technologies were wind (5.2 GW), natural gas (4.3 GW), and solar (4.2 GW), followed by battery energy storage.
By the end of this year, solar will account for the largest share of new capacity additions at 17.8 GW, followed by wind at 11.2 GW, natural gas at 9.2 GW, and battery energy storage at 6.2 GW. This means developers may be busy in the second half of this year, adding 29 GW to the grid nationwide.
More than 40% of the wind capacity that has been activated this year is in Texas, where 2.2 GW of wind was brought online. The largest projects installed and activated this year include the 999 MW Traverse Wind Project in Oklahoma, the 492 MW Maverick Creek Wind in Texas, and the 440 MW solar and battery storage project at Slate Hybrid in California.
The EIA also tracks operable projects larger than 1 MW in size. Nationwide, there are 497 active natural gas plants, 202 coal plants, 138 wind facilities, 95 nuclear plants, 80 conventional hydroelectric dams, and 66 utility-scale solar facilities. New renewable energy projects coming online and retirements in coal fired plants, as well as natural gas and nuclear, are expected to shift these numbers.
A significant amount of capacity, 15.1 GW, is expected to be retired this year. About 8.8 GW of capacity has already been taken offline in 2022. Coal plants, due to their heavy carbon emissions, have represented the largest portion of retirements, and will account for about 76% of all retirements for the year. This is followed by natural gas (12%) and nuclear (9%). A 1.3 GW coal plant was retired in Ohio in May, and a 1.2 GW station in Maryland was retired in June. Additionally, a 769 MW nuclear plant was retired in Michigan in June.

“Our modeling should help policymakers and installers working on future agro-PV projects,” researcher Mohammad Ryyan Khan told pv magazine. “Very limited works have been carried out to date on agrivoltaics with major crops such as rice, wheat, corn, and maize.”
The researchers investigated the economic viability of bifacial agrivoltaic projects for the most common type of rice – Oryza sativa, which is also known as Asian rice. They focused on six locations: An Giang, Vietnam; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Jiangsu province, China; Damietta, Egypt; Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; and Haryana, India. They considered location-specific weather conditions, PV system orientation, panel array row spacing, financing conditions, and the economic advantages of bifacial panels.
“For a given location and bi/monofacial panel array configuration, we find the time-varying irradiance on each point on the cropland and panel surface,” the scientists explained. “Since higher PV density penalizes the crop output of an agrivoltaic farm, we do a parametric analysis to find optimal row spacing to ensure the desired amount of rice production per unit of land area.”
Locations such as Damietta and Haryana are reportedly able to provide additional gains through higher energy yield, due to more favorable solar irradiance. The scientists found that financing conditions are also crucial in ensuring the economic viability of a project. They said that an agrivoltaic project for rice growth should ensure that at least 90% of the land is used for crop cultivation.
“We predict the net profit to be 22 to 115 times higher in AVs (with 90% rice yield constraint) compared to only producing rice in those land,” they explained.
The scientists described their methodology in “Agrivoltaics analysis in a techno-economic framework: Understanding why agrivoltaics on rice will always be profitable,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy.
“We are currently planning to set up a pilot facility and demonstrate its socio-economic impact,” Khan said. “We also want to create awareness and prospects for farmland owners in Bangladesh.”

Tata Power has revealed that its Tata Power Green Energy unit has commissioned a 225 MW hybrid renewable power project in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The project will supply electricity to Tata Power Mumbai Distribution under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA).
It is the first hybrid project developed by Tata Power. It includes a recently commissioned 225 MW solar plant at Noorsar in Rajasthan and 96 MW of existing wind assets in Maharashtra.
Tata Power’s EPC unit, Tata Power Solar Systems, executed the solar component of the project. It commissioned the PV plant within the stipulated timeline, despite challenges such as rugged terrain, harsh temperatures, and rain. The solar plant features 579,488 PV modules and occupies 1,200 acres of land at Noorsar.
“We are excited to commission our first hybrid project of 225 MW in Rajasthan. The project will supply power to our Mumbai [distribution company] and its customers and will substantially enhance its non-carbon commitment. It also reflects our commitment to using non-carbon energy to meet the country’s clean and green energy goals,” said Praveer Sinha, CEO of Tata Power.
Tata Power Mumbai’s non-carbon power supply will now rise to 38%. Its non-carbon electricity supply will hit approximately 2,000 million units (MUs) per year, against an annual requirement of almost 5,200 MUs.

Spain's Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (Miteco) has revealed that it will hold a 3.3 GW renewable energy auction in November.
The Spanish government expects to allocate 1.8 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of wind power. The successful PV projects must be built within two years and will be awarded 12-year power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The auction is the fourth tender in the Régimen Económico de Energías Renovables (REER) procurement scheme. As in the previous renewable energy auctions, successful bidders will have to present a strategic plan, with an estimated impact on local employment and the supply chain. It will be published on the Miteco website.
In the first two auctions, held in January and October 2021, Miteco assigned 2.90 GW of solar and 3.25 GW of wind capacity. The second auction awarded a total of 3.12 GW, or 95% of the 3.3 GW on offer. About 2.258 GW went to wind projects, and 866 MW to solar, at an average price of €30.56 ($31.07)/MWh. The auction marked the first time in history in which solar did not cover all of the offered capacity.
Through the third auction, launched in December, the Spanish authorities aim to allocate 500 MW of renewable energy capacity, including 200 MW of concentrated solar power, 140 MW of distributed solar, 140 MW of biomass, and 20 MW for other minor clean energy technologies.
