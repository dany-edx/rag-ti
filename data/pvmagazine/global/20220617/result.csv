The patent dispute between module manufacturer Hanwha Q-Cells and its various competitors has been waged on several continents since 2019.  The South Korean manufacturer has filed lawsuits against Longi, JinkoSolar and REC in Germany, the United States and Australia.
In the United States, the court case is already much more advanced than the one in Germany. Longi said on Thursday that the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently issued a ruling invalidating Hanwha Q-Cells' US patent US9893215B2.
According to Longi, the judges have upheld a previous decision of the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and have declared the patent invalid. The Chinese PV manufacturer has thus won the legal dispute in the US International Trade Commission (ITC), as well as patent nullity proceedings against Hanwha Q-Cells in the United States.
In Europe, meanwhile, an appeal hearing is still pending in Germany. There are also ongoing proceedings in the Netherlands and France.
Hanwha Q-Cells won in the first instance before a district court in the Netherlands. The judges ruled that the competitors should no longer sell their solar modules based on patented passivation technology. A few months later, the court also ruled that they should recall PV modules that have already been installed.
Dutch dispute
Longi responded to the latest ruling by saying that a favorable decision by a French court on the matter could also reverse the outcome of the legal dispute in the Netherlands.
The Chinese manufacturer told pv magazine that on June 7, a French court ruled that Hanwha's seizures in France in 2021 were illegal and thus invalid. More specifically, Longi said the court ruled that Hanwha had acted in a disloyal manner by withholding crucial information from the French court. That withheld information included an October 2020 opinion issued by the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office (EPO) in favor of the invalidity of its patent.
Longi said the decision of the French court was influenced by the fact that it had been purposely misled by Hanwha. It said the South Korean side wanted to obtain highly confidential, sensitive information from its competitor.
“As a result, the documents as obtained in these French seizures are being recalled and they will be rendered unusable unless the French judgment is appealed and reversed. For the time being, the aforementioned judgement is immediately enforceable,” the company said. “The decision will directly impact the French proceedings, but Longi will also consider its legal options in other related legal proceedings where these documents have been actively used by Hanwha. Since a significant portion of Hanwha’s evidence in the Dutch proceedings were obtained during the French seizures or were only obtained because of the illegally seized documents and information, Longi strongly believes that these developments demonstrate once again that the Dutch court was wrong to decide prematurely in summary proceedings.”
Longi said that its customers were not affected by the Dutch decisions.
“All in all, there hasn't been any finalized infringement decision against Longi in any jurisdiction with regards to the disputes between Hanwha and Longi,” the manufacturer said.
The patent dispute  dates back to spring 2019. In March 2019, Hanwha Q-Cells filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Germany and the United States, and shortly afterward in Australia, against Longi, REC and a third defendant, JinkoSolar. It said its three competitors illegally used its patented technology in their products.
In June 2020, a regional court in Düsseldorf ruled in favor of Hanwha Q-Cells in the first instance. REC and Longi Solar appealed the decision, while Hanwha Q-Cells initiated the preliminary enforcement of it. In Hanwha Q-Cells' view, Longi Solar and REC did not take sufficient measures to comply with the court-ordered recall obligation.

In their study, published in scientific reports, the researchers propose a peer-to-peer system for BEVs to share charge with each other while driving down the road by being matched up with a cloud-based control system. “When multiple electric vehicles are in route, they can actually share charge among themselves while running — they don't have to stop to do this,” said Tamzidul Hoque, assistant professor of electrical engineering & computer science at the University of Kansas School of Engineering. “One car might have abundant charge, and it may not need to go too far, and it can sell its charge to another car — so there’s an economic incentive.” To reduce charging time while in motion, the researchers have developed the concept of a multi-level battery, which technically involves a main lithium-ion battery like the ones used in today’s BEVs, and a second small, fast-charging battery used for on-the-go charging. “Just like in your computer you have fast cache memory — but it's expensive — so you have other types of high-capacity memories that are slower,” Hoque says. In high-density areas, the research team proposes deploying mobile charging stations — huge batteries riding on trucks — that can recharge multiple vehicles at once, something akin to how small military jets can get refueled in midair by a tanker aircraft. Hoque and his co-authors used sophisticated computer modeling software called SUMO to measure the recharging requirements of BEVs as well as changes to the environmental impact of cars in a simulated peer-to-peer system. Hoque said the initial setup of a peer-to-peer charging infrastructure likely would require support from a major manufacturer of BEVs but then could expand organically on the back of the possibility of selling extra charge to earn money.
Charging on the move is already being explored by the industry with the latest demonstration of such capabilities coming from Stellantis, the parent company behind iconic brands like Fiat, Chrysler, Citroen and Peugeot, among others. After months of testing at the Arena del Futuro circuit in Chiari, Italy, Stellantis and its project partners have demonstrated what it calls Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT), a system that relies on coils positioned beneath the road surface to charge the EV. The project uses wireless EV charging technology from Israel’s Electreon, a company that electrified a 1.6 km stretch of road in Sweden. The results showed that DWPT enables a battery electric vehicle like Fiat New 500 to travel at typical highway speeds without consuming the energy stored in its battery.” Tests are showing that the efficiency of the energy flow from the asphalt to the car is comparable to the typical efficiency of fast charging stations, so the driver does not need to stop to recharge. Furthermore, measurements on magnetic field intensity prove that there is no impact on the driver and passengers,” Stellantis said. While large-scale deployment on highways and roads might be still out of reach due to significant cost of installing coils, Stellantis seems to be interested in deploying the tech in combination with other infrastructures like harbors, airports, and parking lots.
But while some car makers are even one step ahead of their industry counterparts, others are still reluctant to accept the inevitable end of sales of gasoline-powered vehicles. Japanese carmaker Toyota pushed back against critics who say it has been slow to embrace EVs, arguing it needed to offer a variety of powertrains to suit different markets and customers. At its annual meeting on Wednesday, the company said it will continue to develop fuel cell vehicles and hybrids instead of going fully electric. Toyota argues that hybrids still make sense in markets where infrastructure is not ready to support a move to EVs and reiterated its belief that different markets will take different paths to decarbonization. Toyota – which sold 10.5 million vehicles in 2021, far outstripping closest rival Volkswagen AG – expects annual sales of EVs to reach only 3.5 million vehicles by the end of the decade, or around a third of current sales.
On Thursday, Japan's Sony and Honda Motor officially agreed to an equally owned joint venture that will start selling electric cars in 2025. Honda, like its bigger rival Toyota, has been slower to shift to EVs compared to other global automakers and has faced pressure from investors to take bolder steps towards electrification of its fleet. Presently, the carmaker offers one EV – Honda e – but has laid out plans to roll out 30 other models and make around 2 million EVs annually by 2030. To the JV, first announced in March and named Sony Honda Mobility, Honda will bring its expertise in building and selling cars and Sony will add its software and technology chops, the companies said. Each company will invest 5 billion yen ($37.52 million) in the JV.
In terms of EV sales, Tesla is global number one, but according to BloombergNEF, this may be about to change. According to the report titled “Battery Electric Vehicles Report – Automakers Race to the Top”, the profit incentive to catch up with Tesla is lacking for most traditional marques in the short term amid rising battery costs and a lack of scale, except for Volkswagen. The German automaker is on track to overtake Tesla’s BEV volume in 2024 as global BEV demand is set to more than double out to 2025. The analysis shows China’s BYD ranking third for BEV sales globally in 2025 followed by a glut of legacy automakers languishing around the one million annual BEV sales mark. It is not until later in the decade that US and Japanese automakers will be serious challengers for a top 3 spot. Battery prices remain critical to the cost competitiveness of BEVs and Volkswagen is investing up to EUR 30 billion in the supply chain, including the opening of six new battery-cell plants in Europe by 2030. But to dethrone Tesla, which is expected to double its sales in 2023 compared to 2021 on new capacity ramping up in Germany and Texas, Volkswagen would need to expand its European dominance to other regions such as China. “China’s carrot-and-stick approach to stoking EV sales could push battery-electrics to account for 25 percent of all passenger vehicle purchases by 2025,” said Steve Man, senior China automotive industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Sales in China have surged since the launch of the country’s new energy vehicle credit program despite erratic component supply.”
By 2030, electric and hybrid models should make up 80% of Ferrari’s sales, the Italian luxury carmaker told investors on Thursday. Fully electric cars will make up 5% of sales in 2025 and 40% in 2030, as stated in the carmaker's long-awaited electrification strategy, and its first electric sports car will be released by 2025. According to CEO Benedetto Vigna, Ferrari will develop its own electric motors, inverters, and battery modules on a new assembly line at its plant in Maranello, Italy, while outsourcing non-core components. Ferrari also confirmed that three out of every five cars it builds will be either hybrid or fully electric by 2026. Specifically, hybrid models should rise to 55% of sales in 2025 from 20% in 2021, followed by pure combustion-powered cars (40%) and EVs (5%). By 2030, the split will change to 40% EVs and 40% hybrids, with just 20% of Ferraris running pure combustion engines.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/17/solar-panels-based-on-biosourced-materials/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"JUNE 17, 2022",Solar panels based on biosourced materials,"From pv magazine France
Researchers at France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – a division of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – are developing solar modules featuring new bio-based materials in the front and rear sides.
“As the carbon footprint and the life cycle analysis have now become essential criteria in the choice of photovoltaic panels, the sourcing of materials will become a crucial element in Europe in the next few years,” said Anis Fouini, the director of CEA-INES, in an interview with pv magazine France.
Aude Derrier, the research project's coordinator, said her colleagues have looked at the various materials that already exist, to find one that could allow module manufacturers to produce panels that improve performance, durability, and cost, while lowering the environmental impact. The first demonstrator consists of heterojunction (HTJ) solar cells integrated into an all-composite material.
“The front side is made of a fiberglass-filled polymer, which provides transparency,” Derrier said. “The rear side is made of composite based on thermoplastics in which a weaving of two fibers, flax and basalt, has been integrated, which will provide mechanical strength, but also better resistance to humidity.”
The flax is sourced from northern France, where the entire industrial ecosystem is already present. The basalt is sourced elsewhere in Europe and is woven by an industrial partner of INES. This reduced the carbon footprint by 75 grams of CO2 per watt, compared to a reference module of the same power. The weight was also optimized and is less than 5 kilograms per square meter.
“This module is aimed at the rooftop PV and building integration,” said Derrier. “The advantage is that it is naturally black in color, without the need for a backsheet. In terms of recycling, thanks to thermoplastics, which can be remelted, the separation of the layers is also technically simpler.”
The module can be made without adapting current processes. Derrier said the idea is to transfer the technology to manufacturers, without additional investment.
“The only imperative is to have freezers to store the material and not to start the resin cross-linking process, but most manufacturers today use prepreg and are already equipped for this,” she said.
The INES scientists also looked into the solar glass supply issues encountered by all photovoltaic players and worked on the reuse of tempered glass.
“We worked on the second life of glass and developed a module made up of reused 2.8 mm glass that comes from an old module,” said Derrier. “We have also used a thermoplastic encapsulant which does not require cross-linking, which will therefore be easy to recycle, and a thermoplastic composite with flax fiber for resistance.”
The basalt-free rear face of the module has a natural linen color, which could be aesthetically interesting for architects in terms of facade integration, for example. In addition, the INES calculation tool showed a 10% reduction in the carbon footprint.
“It is now imperative to question the photovoltaic supply chains,” said Jouini. “With the help of the Rhône-Alpes region within the framework of the International Development Plan, we therefore went looking for players outside the solar sector to find new thermoplastics and new fibers. We also thought about the current lamination process, which is very energy intensive.”
Between the pressurization, the pressing and the cooling phase, the lamination usually lasts between 30 and 35 minutes, with an operating temperature of around 150 C to 160 C.
“But for modules that increasingly incorporate eco-designed materials, it is necessary to transform thermoplastics at around 200 C to 250 C, knowing that HTJ technology is sensitive to heat and must not exceed 200 C,” said Derrier.
The research institute is teaming up with France-based induction thermocompression specialist Roctool, to reduce cycle times and make shapes according to the needs of customers. Together, they have developed a module with a rear face made of polypropylene-type thermoplastic composite, to which recycled carbon fibers have been integrated. The front side is made of thermoplastics and fiberglass.
“Roctool's induction thermocompression process makes it possible to heat the two front and rear plates quickly, without having to reach 200 C at the core of the HTJ cells,” Derrier said.
The company claims the investment is lower and the process could achieve a cycle time of just a few minutes, while using less energy. The technology is aimed at composite manufacturers, to give them the possibility of producing parts of different shapes and sizes, while integrating lighter and more durable materials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/17/amorphous-carbon-nitride-anti-reflection-coating-for-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,IRAQ",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 17, 2022",Amorphous carbon nitride anti-reflection coating for solar cells,"Researchers at the University of Technology-Iraq have developed a novel dual-function anti-reflection coating (ARC). They said it can significantly improve the power conversion efficiency of commercial crystalline silicon solar cells.
The coating is based on an amorphous carbon nitride (CNx) thin film that was synthesized by the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technique. The approach involves alternating the electrical potential of the current in a vacuum environment.
“This technique has an advantage over others in that it allows for precise control of deposition rate and thickness uniformity while using low-cost starting materials and producing no toxic byproducts,” the scientists explained. “We investigated the influence of deposition temperature and time on the properties of amorphous carbon nitride films deposited on glass and silicon substrates.”
They said that CNx films are suitable for applications in solar cells, due to their indirect bandgap, excellent mechanical strength, high thermal stability, low reflectivity, and high transmission. They investigated these properties and their impact on solar cell performance via field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The films were deposited at different temperatures.
Their measurements showed that the films exhibit a high optical transmission in the range of 200 nm to 2500 nm. Films deposited at a lower temperature are much more transparent than films deposited at a higher temperature.
“The transmission of the film prepared at room temperature was 91% at 550 nm. Whereas the optical transmission of the film prepared at 200 C decreased to 81% at 550 nm. The films have a transmission of between 52% to 96% in the visible region (350 nm to 780 nm) and higher than 89% in the near-infra-red (NIR) region,” the group said, noting that the increase in nitrogen content in the film structure results in an increase in the optical energy gap.
The film was then deposited over commercial c-Si solar cells at a deposition time and temperature of 120 minutes and 200 C, respectively, and the performance of the solar devices was measured under standard illumination conditions. Their short circuit current increased from 14.69 to 33.85 mAcm−2 and the efficiency climbed from 5.52% to 13.05%.
“In principle, the effect of the short-circuit current reflects the actual efficiency of the ARC, since it is directly related to the reduction of the surface reflectance and hence increases the photocurrent generated by the photons absorbed in the solar cell,” they said, noting that the open-circuit voltage increased slightly and that its fill factor was almost equal to that of the uncoated cell.
“This study shows that CNx films have promising application potential as an efficient ARC for c-Si solar cells as compared to traditional ARC materials,” the academics concluded, without providing details on the costs of the proposed technology. They introduced the novel coating technology in “Amorphous carbon nitride dual-function anti-reflection coating for crystalline silicon solar cells,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.

China's total cell capacity reached 361 GW at the end of last year, according to the association, and total cell production output for 2021 was 197.9 GW. Chinese manufacturers Tongwei, Longi, JA Solar, Aiko Solar, Trina Solar, Jinko, Runergy, and CSI occupy the first eight positions of the global ranking for solar cell producers, followed by the only non-Chinese company – Hanwha Q Cells – in 9th position and Chinese manufacturer UniePV, which was able to reach 10th position.
Solar cell and polysilicon maker Tongwei announced it will provide wafer manufacturer Gokin Solar with 216,100 MTs of polysilicon. The raw material will be supplied between July 2022 and December 2026 at a price that will be negotiated on a monthly basis.
Shenzhen-listed manufacturer Golden Glass announced on Thursday it will invest CNY 4.2 billion (US$627 million), for a 4.8 GW heterojunction (HJT) solar cell factory in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. The company is currently developing a 1.2 GW HJT cell manufacturing facility in Suzhou.
China's National Energy Administration (NEA) said on Thursday that around 23.71 GW of new PV installations were installed in the country in the first five months of the year, which brought its cumulative installed PV power to 327.9 GW.
Polysilicon maker GCL Technology this week announced it will spend CNY 438 million ($65 million) more on a 100,000-ton annual capacity poly fab being constructed by China Chemical Engineering. The deadline for completion of the works has also been extended, from mid May this year until December 30. GCL said the maximum price of the contract for the granular silicon production line would rise from the previously-agreed CNY 190 million to CNY 428 million and, for the silane gas facilities, from CNY 200 million to CNY 400 million. GCL has other agreements in place in relation to the project which will earn the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor up to CNY 2.6 billion.
Developer C Smarter Energy this week announced the winding up petition lodged against it by investor Nine United has been withdrawn after a settlement was agreed. Nine United lodged the petition in December, claiming it was owed $4.52 million and HKD 5.51 million ($702,000).

They tested GABr in mixed solvents combining isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and toluene (TL), which they said can efficiently passivate interface and grain boundary defects by minimizing the IPA solubility of the perovskite surface. They compared the mixing of IPA with ethyl acetate (EA), chlorobenzene (CB), and toluene (TL) to dissolve GABr, and further optimized the concentration of GABr and the mixing ratio of the two solvents.
“Our experiment discovered that when IPA and TL were mixed at a concentration of 2 mg mL−1 and dissolved at a ratio of 1:1, the mixed solvents assisted treatment may not only minimize perovskite surface solubility, but also efficiently passivate interface and grain boundary defects, reduce non-radiative recombination of the film surface, and avoid poor heterogeneous carrier transmission,” they said.
This passivation strategy was used to build the perovskite cell for the 4T device. The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 90 mV, a short-circuit current density of 24.2 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 80.6%. For comparison, a reference cell was fabricated without the novel passivation technique, and it achieved an efficiency of 20.1% and a fill factor of 77.9%.
By replacing the metallic back electrode with indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent back contact based on molybdenum oxides (MoOx), the scientists built a semitransparent perovskite solar cell with an efficiency of 18.3%. The cell was then combined with a 17.5% CIGS cell in a 4T device with an n-i-p structure.
“Impressively, this is the most efficient 4T perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cell of the n-i-p structure ever reported,” they said. “The mixed solvent passivation strategy demonstrated here, hopefully, will open new avenues for improving perovskite solar cells’ efficiency and stability.”
They presented their findings in “Mixed Solvents Assisted Post-Treatment Enables High-Efficiency Single-Junction Perovskite and 4T Perovskite/CIGS Tandem Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Science.

The liquid electrolyte is continuously drawn up the separator by a capillary effect, from a reservoir at the bottom of the cell. The porous, hydrophilic separator sustains the flow rate required for water electrolysis. The alkaline capillary-fed electrolysis (CFE) cell reportedly leads to inherently bubble-free operation at the electrodes, with performances exceeding commercial electrolysis cells. “The alkaline CFE cell required only 1.506 V at 0.5 A cm−2, which represents a cell energy efficiency of 98% with consumption of only 40.4 kWh per kg of hydrogen” the researchers wrote in a paper published in nature communications, noting that energy consumption in commercial electrolysis cells stands at around 47.5 kWh/kg. “High energy efficiency, combined with the promise of a simplified balance-of-plant, brings cost-competitive renewable hydrogen closer to reality,” they said.
Argentina’s province of Tierra del Fuego presented in Buenos Aires its strategic plan to develop green hydrogen, singling out a roadmap, a feasibility study, and a series of parameters to promote up to US$6-billion in private investments in wind farms and electrolyzers. Governor Gustavo Melella said that the province is in an excellent position to produce green hydrogen due to its wind potential, water access, and hydrocarbons expertise. The provincial authorities presented the plan to representatives from Australia, the Netherlands, Japan, Korea, Germany, France, and Canada. According to Melella, France’s TotalEnergies, US-based MMEX Resources, and Germany’s Siemens Energy have already expressed interest in developing hydrogen in the province. The strategic plan is part of a broader attempt of the country to attract foreign investments in the sector. Río Negro, Neuquén, Jujuy, and Santa Cruz are the other four provinces betting on hydrogen. Argentina is also eying cooperation opportunities with Chile and the United Arab Emirates.
French green hydrogen producer Lhyfe and shipyard Chantiers de l’Atlantique, have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop offshore hydrogen production platforms. The French companies will collaborate on offshore renewable hydrogen production projects with ongrid or offgrid wind farms. “The two partners plan to develop production solutions with a minimum capacity of 100 MW, which will be installed on existing fixed structures, or mounted on seabed foundations or floating platforms,” Lhyfe said. Chantiers de l’Atlantique will design, build, and install the platforms; and Lhyfe will design and operate the renewable hydrogen production facilities. They aim to launch the world’s first offshore renewable hydrogen production demonstrator in September 2022, off the coast of Saint-Nazaire.
Researchers from the Chung-Ang University in Korea have developed a novel heterostructured catalyst that simultaneously boosts the two half-reactions of electrocatalytic water splitting, namely the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The researchers electrochemically deposited nickel-iron (NiFe) and layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets in a controlled manner on the surface of hollow cobalt sulfide (CoSx) nano arrays supported on nickel foam. “The integration of an active HER catalyst, CoSx and an OER catalyst, NiFe LDH, guarantees a superior bifunctional catalytic activity,” said Seung-Keun Park, who headed the study published in the Small journal. According to the researchers, the catalyst consistently delivers a high current density of 1000 mA cm-2 in both half-reactions at low cell voltages, suggesting its feasibility for industrial-scale water-splitting applications.
EU Member States are communicating to the European Commission the first Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) in the field of hydrogen. “We are talking about 41 projects, in 15 Member States, investing in the development and manufacturing of electrolyzers; of fuel cells; of technologies to power heavy-duty vehicles; or for the safe storage of hydrogen,” wrote Thierry Breton, European commissioner for internal markets. A second hydrogen IPCEI should follow in September. The European Commission also unveiled its plans to start a European Electrolyser Partnership. 
Saudi Aramco aims to produce up to 11 million metric tons of blue ammonia annually by 2030. In its first sustainability report, the Saudi oil giant also unveiled its plans for investment in renewables, targeting 12 GW of solar and wind power annually by 2035. 
A coalition of energy providers, shipping companies, and NGOs – including Siemens Energy, and Brussels-based organisations Hydrogen Europe and Transport&Environment (T&E) – has called on the EU to introduce a minimum quota of 6% sustainable and scalable hydrogen fuels by 2030.
HH2E and the Swiss MET Group teamed up to develop green hydrogen production plants in Lubmin, on the German Baltic coast. The project aims to produce around 6,000 tonnes (over 200,000 MWh) of green hydrogen per year. A second-stage expansion should increase capacity to over 1 GW. 
Opel has unveiled Vivaro-e Hydrogen, a plug-in fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). The new light commercial vehicle needs three minutes to refuel with hydrogen, and it has a range of more than 400 kilometers. The company plans to deliver the first vehicles to fleet customers in the autumn.

“This project is part of the framework agreement we signed with Libya's Renewable Energy Agency to implement a strategic plan to integrate more installed capacity from renewable energy sources into the country's grid,” Gecol said, without providing any additional financial or technical details.
The utility currently operates around 9 GW of generation assets, including 16 gas and oil plants. Renewable energy sources only accounts for about 2% of its total power supply. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Libya only has 6 MW of installed PV capacity.
In its strategic plan for renewables for the 2013-25 period, the Libyan government has set targets for 300 MW of PV by 2020 and 450 MW by 2025. It has also set targets to build 150 MW of concentrated solar power by 2020 and 800 MW by 2025.
Libya has a daily average of solar radiation level of around 7.1 kWh/m2/day on a horizontal plane, with more than 3,500 hours of sun per year. A recent study by the US Department of Energy’s Berkeley Lab, “Strategic siting and regional grid interconnections key to low-carbon futures in African countries,” showed that Libya and other African countries should be prioritized for solar projects, as they are home to a high number of potentially cost-effective sites.

The High Court of Justice of the Spanish region of Extremadura has ruled that land was illegally expropriated to host the nation's largest operational PV plant, the 500 MW Nuñez de Balboa solar plant in Usagre, near Badajoz. The solar park's owner, Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, now must dismantle 60% of the facility.
The owner of the property is Natura Manager, which owns 525 hectares of the 854 hectares occupied by the solar park.
“The ruling indicates that the land cannot be expropriated, as it was already leased for a period of 25 years,” the court said. “The request for expropriation lacked cause or justification to deprive the right of property.”
The court added that the company always had the legal title to build the plant, without the need for expropriation.
“And despite this, it carried out all the actions that depended on its will to get the expropriation procedure started, when not there was no justifiable reason for it,” it ruled, noting that it also recognizes the right “to the reinstatement of the farms free of the photovoltaic plant, with all its facilities.”
An Iberdrola spokesperson told pv magazine that the company will file an appeal with the Supreme Court of Spain. It claims that the dispute only involves one of the three owners of the project site.
“Around 50% of this land is owned by two tenants who have not raised any claim at any time and who maintain and respond to the contract signed at the time, initially, by the three owners,” the company said. “The expropriation procedure … followed the legally established procedures and respected all existing rights and guarantees.”
Iberdrola added that the plant was built under a valid and legitimate title, so it does not believe that it should be dismantled. “The facility has all the permits to produce energy and will continue to function normally,” it said.
The Nuñez de Balboa has been generating solar electricity since April 2020.

In his first major speech as minister for climate change and energy, Bowen will tell investors that the new government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wants to unleash private investment in renewable energy projects.
“For too long, Australians had been led to believe that climate change posed a choice: The environment or the economy; the cities or the regions,” he will tell the summit, which is being hosted by the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), a collaboration of Australian and New Zealand investors. “Good climate action can benefit us all because the truth is that good energy policy is key to good economic policy … Australia is under new management and Australia is open for business in the new global economy.”
Earlier this week, Albanese committed Australia to a more ambitious greenhouse gas reduction target of 43% by the end of the decade, based on 2005 emissions levels. He said the nation’s new 2030 target will provide much-needed certainty for investors.
“What businesses have been crying out for is investment certainty,” Albanese said. “The certainty that they need to invest over a longer time frame than the political cycle of three years.”
The IGCC said the renewable energy sector represents an enormous investment opportunity. But IGCC CEO Rebecca Mikula-Wright said a lack of credible climate targets and policies has impeded investment in Australia, even though “investors stand ready to invest billions of dollars into climate positive solutions for Australia’s future.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/17/us-government-to-support-12-remote-island-communities-in-transition-to-clean-energy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 17, 2022","US government to support 12 remote, island communities in transition to clean energy","The US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced plans to work with 12 remote and island communities around the United States to help them move to clean power, lower energy costs, and improve resilience
Through the Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project (ETIPP), DOE experts, national labs, and regional organizations will support projects in communities that often face high energy costs and vulnerable energy infrastructure due to their increased risk of natural disasters caused by climate change. ETIPP further supports the US government's goal of ensuring an equitable transition to a carbon-pollution free future.
“As climate change intensifies, remote and island communities, which experience higher energy costs and may lack the financial resources and expertise to make their energy systems more resilient, are more at risk to extreme weather events,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “DOE will connect 12 more communities with our world-renowned National Labs to execute strategic and locally-tailored clean energy and resilience solutions, driving the nation’s equitable transition to a net-zero economy.”
Remote and island communities often lack the financial resources and the access to experts to plan a clean energy transition. The ETIPP will work with local community leaders, residents, and organizations to help identify what the energy challenges are, and then will provide assistance in establishing a strategy.
The 12 selected communities that were selected through a competitive process are:
“Clean energy availability is one of the keys to unlocking a future of renewable, reliable, and affordable power,” said U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King (ME) in a joint statement. “As home to one of the crown jewels of America’s National Park System, Mount Desert Island has long been a model for environmental stewardship and has made significant strides to preserve Acadia’s natural wonders. We welcome this investment, which will help the community accelerate its plans to increase the resiliency of the local grid and transition to a clean energy future.”
Six regional organizations – Alaska Center for Energy and Power, Coastal Studies Institute, Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, Island Institute, Renewable Energy Alaska Project, and Spark Northwest – will help the selected communities prioritize their energy resilience needs and communicate results throughout their projects. Experts from DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories will work with the communities to conduct technical activities that help decision makers plan resilient upgrades to their energy systems.
Started in 2021, ETIPP’s first participants were composed of 11 communities from Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, and North Carolina. Read about all ETIPP community projects, which are funded by the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/17/global-energy-storage-market-set-for-rapid-expansion-by-2025/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 17, 2022",Global energy storage market set for rapid expansion by 2025,"In recent years, the global installed capacity of wind and solar has shown steady growth and now energy storage is expected to follow in their footsteps. According to Taiwanese analyst TrendForce, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery storage has significant advantages over other technologies and is becoming the primary installed capacity of new energy storage around the world.
This echoes earlier findings from US analyst Wood Mackenzie, which predicts that LFP’s market share will surpass nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) in 2028. Last year, NCM still accounted for half of the market, but LFP batteries began to grow in prominence due to their competitive cost, long lifecycles, and high safety performance.
According to TrendForce, the cumulative installed capacity of global renewable energy in 2021 stood at 3,064 GW. This highlights the pressing need for energy storage to balance intermittency.
In 2021, the global energy storage market maintained a high growth rate. Newly installed capacity was 29.6 GWh, up 72.4% year on year, said TrendForce. Going forward, the global energy storage market is set for rapid expansion, reaching 362 GWh by 2025.
China is soon expected to overtake Europe and the United States. According to TrendForce, the country’s energy storage market is expected to break through 100 GWh by 2025.
In the United States, due to the current stagnation in newly installed pumped hydro storage capacity, future growth will focus on electrochemical energy storage. Newly installed capacity in the United States is predicted to reach 136 GWh in 2025. Meanwhile, Europe is predicted to install 54 GWh by 2025 buoyed by various geopolitical forces at play, said TrendForce.
Looking at the battery storage market, TrendForce noted that the dominance of South Korean manufacturers, such as Samsung and LG, has been reduced to a certain extent. This is partly due to the accelerated expansion of Chinese battery makers that remain faithful to the LFP battery tech, such as BYD and CATL.
When it comes to energy storage power conditioning systems (PCS), the bulk of them originate from solar inverter manufacturers. This market segment is expected to become increasingly competitive in the future for established players, such as SMA and Sungrow, as well as newcomers.
TrendForce said system integration will see relatively fragmented competition, with small- and medium-sized companies in the majority. However, some leading upstream companies, such as Sungrow and NextEra Energy, will also be part of the mix, it added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/17/crossboundary-energy-access-raises-25-million-to-finance-solar-powered-minigrids-in-africa/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",COSMAS MWIRIGI,"JUNE 17, 2022",CrossBoundary Energy Access raises $25 million to finance solar-powered minigrids in Africa ,"This investment will build upon an additional $25 million in senior debt to deploy $50 million of capital into CBEA’s near-term pipeline of solar-powered minigrids. 
The Rockefeller Foundation, Ceniarth, DOEN Foundation, Shell Foundation, and UK Aid provided initial funding. The fund was established in 2019 and expects to invest $150 million in solar projects over the next two years. 
The minigrids will combine solar and batteries to provide 24/7 grid-quality power to households and businesses. This initiative will enable residential and small business subscribers to access renewable electricity for the first time. The solar-powered minigrids will help to bridge the gap by bringing clean electricity to rural areas of Africa that do not presently have access to electricity. 
About 75% of the world’s population lives in Sub-Saharan Africa, which lacks access to power. South Sudan, Burundi, Chad, Malawi, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, and Tanzania are among the world’s least electrified countries and might benefit from sustainable energy sources such as solar and wind. 
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the solar minigrid sector needs $187 billion of investment to achieve universal energy access by 2030. CBEA believes project finance is key to unlocking the long-term, infrastructure-type capital that the minigrid sector needs. CBEA first pioneered its blended project finance structures in 2019 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Ceniarth, DOEN Foundation, Shell Foundation and UK Aid. 
CBEA will deploy a total of $150 million over the next two years to bring clean energy to 1 million people in Africa. Minigrids combine solar power and batteries to provide 24/7 grid-quality power to homes and businesses. This initiative will allow residential and local small business subscribers to access renewable electricity for the first time. The solar-powered mini-grids will help bridge the gap by bringing clean electricity to rural areas in Africa that currently have no access to electricity. 
According to the IEA, more than 600 million people in Africa do not have access to electricity. Solar minigrids solve this problem, unlocking the potential of those living without electricity. CBEA ‘s blended finance approach creates a new model for rural financing electrification in Africa, bringing renewable electricity to 1 million people once the $150 million target is fully implemented. 
“Work is still needed on every aspect of mini-grids, including regulation, business model, and subsidy programs,” said Gabriel Davies, managing director and head of energy access at CrossBoundary. “But we’re excited by the step-change in scale and pace that we’re seeing from developers, investors, regulators, and donors. We’re also encouraged by the amount of capital the sector is prepared to absorb in the next 24 months.” 
William Barry, managing director of ARCH Emerging Markets Partners' Africa Renewable Power Fund, also said that distributed renewables, including minigrids will be a “critical component of Africa’s energy future.” He added CrossBoundary is helping to provide a “blended approach to the challenge of unlocking capital” for such initiatives.
