The future of Sun Cable’s proposed AUD $30 billion (USD $20.7 billion) Australia-Asia PowerLink project planned for the Northern Territory could be decided in less than three months, with the administrators revealing that they hope to have the company sold or recapitalized by the end of April.
The first creditors’ meeting was held on Nov. 17 after Sun Cable, which is largely owned by mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s private firm Squadron Energy and technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ private investment company Grok, entered voluntary administration on Jan. 11, citing an “absence of alignment” among shareholders.
The administrators said Sun Cable will be put up for sale before the end of January amid a “strong level of interest” in the company and its Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) venture. The administrators said they plan to appoint an adviser shortly to conduct the sale process which is expected to be finalised by April.
“Indicative timing for the sale process is approximately three months,” FTI Consulting said in a statement released after the meeting of creditors.
Both Forrest and Atlassian co-founder Cannon-Brookes, who have provided AUD 65 million in interim funding through Grok to allow Sun Cable to continue to operate, are expected to submit bids for the company.
Sun Cable’s AAPowerLink project aims to power Darwin and export solar from the NT to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometer submarine transmission link. The proposal includes building up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage in the Barkley region.
Fortescue Metals Group Chair Forrest, who has made no secret of his support for green hydrogen as the fuel of the future, has indicated he intends to bid on the company. But he has questioned the technical viability of the submarine cable. It is expected that if Squadron Energy gains control of Sun Cable, it will scrap the undersea cable plan.
Cannon-Brookes, who is the chairman of Sun Cable, is also tipped to bid for the company and has indicated that he intends to proceed with the original proposal if he is successful, as he fully backs the project’s ambition and the team.
FTI said it is now seeking proposals from advisers to act on the sale and run the sale process. An appointment is expected shortly. The sale process is slated to take three months. The second creditors’ meeting would normally be held on or before Feb. 14, but FTI said it would apply for an extension to carry out the sale process in advance.

In view of rising electricity prices as airports strive to reduce CO2 emissions, many aerodrome operators are turning to renewables for a secure, independent energy supply. Airports often have large undeveloped areas and flat roofs that could be considered for harvesting solar energy. Aviation emissions-reduction measures such as sustainable fuels and hydrogen and other aircraft propulsion technologies are still in development while PV is ready to roll out and can have a direct impact on the carbon footprint of airports.
There are various opportunities for airports and smaller airfields to generate economic value from rooftop PV or ground-mounted solar. Site operators can develop areas themselves to lease as “ready-to-build” sites. From a permitting perspective, the planning, installation, and operation of PV systems would then face only minor hurdles. Alternatively, an airport operator can directly invest, use solar panels for its own electricity needs or supply energy customers or traders via a power purchase agreement.
Is glare from panels a problem for pilots and air traffic controllers? Do PV installations pose a physical obstacle to aviation and is there a possibility of electromagnetic interference with air traffic control communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) equipment? Can the required safety distances on the ground be maintained, for example from runways and taxiways? Do PV systems interfere with rescue and firefighting services (RFFS) during emergency operations?
However, the placement of solar arrays near aprons, taxiways, or runways can present a challenge in terms of aviation safety and regulatory compliance. There are a range of common concerns.
Addressing those questions requires a broad knowledge, and practical experience, of conducting aeronautical safety assessments and of aeronautical planning and approval processes. Airsight has conducted technical and aeronautical feasibility studies for solar near airports and other flight operation areas.
Maximizing the generation potential of airport PV while ensuring the already high safety level of flight operations and other processes often requires a multi-level risk assessment of potential hazards posed by panels near “aircraft maneuvering areas.” Such assessments ensure only acceptable risks exist for airport operations. It must be demonstrated to the responsible aviation approval authority that the solar system will not compromise the safety level of the airport and that aviation regulations at national and international level will be strictly followed.
Depending on airport characteristics, many requirements must be observed, from an aeronautical perspective, for the planning and approval of an airport PV system.
A hazard analysis and risk assessment of glare and irritation effects from solar installations must be carried out, as well as development of measures to reduce glare – a glare assessment.
An obstacle assessment is required, under national and supra-national regulations (such as in the EU) and an assessment of compatibility with air traffic control CNS systems must also be performed.
Developers will need a hazard analysis and risk assessment of the impact of solar arrays on runway safety, for instance in the case of unplanned veer-off of aircraft from the runway, or any impact on the evacuation of aircraft in case of accidents.
An assessment of any impact on emergency response by RFFS is needed, as is an impact assessment for wildlife management, for instance as a result of increased breeding activity of birds
Also, compliance checks must be carried out in relation to regulations regarding aerodrome design and certification.
Interdisciplinary expertise in hazard analysis and risk assessment is necessary for processing the test criteria for PV at or near airports, covering sustainable aviation, airfield planning and approval, safety of air traffic operations, and aviation obstacles and CNS installations. This requires extensive knowledge and experience with national and international specifications, standards, and norms for airfield design and management.
Big airports such as Edmonton in Canada, Washington-Dulles in the United States, and most recently, Frankfurt in Germany, are operating or planning open-space PV systems near taxiways and runways. In May 2022, a 24 MW solar system was commissioned at Vienna-Schwechat Airport, in Austria, around 200 meters from the runway. The airport says the project is the largest ground-mounted solar system in Austria and, together with the rooftop systems already installed at the site, covers around a third of the airport’s annual electricity consumption.
The solar potential of airports is clear when looking at the length of runways. A 4 km runway, such as that found at Munich International Airport in Germany, could accommodate a 50-meter wide, 3 km long solar site that could generate around 17 GWh per year with an installed capacity of 15 MW – all in line with safety and regulatory requirements.
The energy transition requires that previous principles be broken down, new ideas be developed, and the exploitation of existing renewable energy potential also be evaluated at safety-critical infrastructure such as airports.
The areas required for solar are available at many airports, in some cases on a large scale, and could make a significant contribution as long as they do not compromise the high level of safety in aviation.

The ADF is currently seeking consultants for the project through a tender.
The project will includ3 an unspecified amount of battery storage and a 66 kV transmission line. The government chose the proposed location for its relatively cool temperature, the elevation, and the presence of existing infrastructure that could connect the array to the national grid. Prospective consultants have until Feb. 23 to submit their proposals.
The Eritrea National Energy Policy, which was issued in 2018, aims to increase the electrification rate across the country. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Eritrea had just 24 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/24/passive-solar-module-cooling-tech-based-on-paraffin-wax/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EGYPT",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 24, 2023",Passive solar module cooling tech based on paraffin wax,"Researchers at Sohag University in Egypt have developed a passive cooling system for solar panels that uses a PCM known as paraffin wax RT-42.
PCMs can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range and have often been used, at the research level, for PV module cooling. Paraffin wax is obtained from petroleum by dewaxing light lubricating oil stocks and is commonly used in candles, wax paper, polishes, cosmetics, and electrical insulators.
The scientists placed the cooling system on a 40 W polycrystalline panel with a size of 55 cm × 65 cm and compared its performance with that of an identical reference panel without cooling. They tested the panels with tilt angles of 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees and with different PCM thicknesses.
The two modules have an efficiency of 16.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 12 V, a short-circuit current of 4.3 A, and a fill factor of 0.78.
“To accommodate the PV panels, a rectangular PCM container with inside dimensions of 55 cm × 65 cm x 4 cm made of a 2 mm thick galvanized sheet is used,” the group explained. “The container is mounted to the back side of the PV panel and coated with a silicon adhesion to prevent the possible leakage when the PCM is completely melted.”
The academics measured the temperature distribution on the front surface of the PV panels at different sections using an infrared camera. During the experiment, they observed that, for all thicknesses of the PCM, increasing the tilt angle of the panel reduces the surface temperature. ”
“When the PV-PCM panel is installed at an angle of 15 degrees, it records the highest temperature distribution over the panel surface, while the lowest temperature is recorded for the surface of the solar panel at a tilt angle of 30 degrees,” they stressed. “This is likely ascribed to the fact that the energy flow within the PCM due to the convection is very low when the tilt angle is small.”
The cooled panel, when installed with a tilt angle of 30 degrees, achieved a power yield that was 15.8% higher than that of the reference module without cooling.
“Changing the tilt angle from 15 degrees to 30 degrees enhances the electrical efficiency of PV-PCM with 3 cm thickness by 7.4%,” the scientists stated. “Finally, using PCM with a thickness of 3 cm increases the electrical efficiency of PV-PCM panel by 14.4% compared to the PV reference panel.”
The scientists did not provide information about the cost of the proposed technology and its applicability to commercial production. They described the passive cooling technique in “Performance enhancement of PV panels using phase change material (PCM): An experimental implementation,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.

Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that takes the wasted energy from the process of slowing down a vehicle.
The proposed underground gravity energy storage (UGES) concept consists of lowering sand into an underground mine and lifting this sand to an upper reservoir via electric motors to store energy at moments of low power demand.
“UGES uses regenerative braking to adjust the descent speed of the sand in the mine shaft and generate electricity,” researcher Zakeri Benham told pv magazine. “It has the advantage of making use of existing infrastructure and providing clean, cheap, and long-duration energy storage with no material intensity, on top of being already close to the electricity grid and roads.”
The system consists of a shaft with variable depths and diameters, a motor/generator, upper and lower storage sites, and mining equipment.
“To maximize power capacity, the sand containers in the shaft occupy approximately 50% of the shaft’s volume,” the scientists said. “The other 50% of space is required for filling and emptying the containers with sand.”
The charging mode consists of collecting sand from the lower storage site at the bottom of the mine with excavators and transporting the sand to the shaft with electric trucks or conveyor belts. Energy is stored using cheap or excess electricity from the grid or a large solar PV farm nearby to pull the sand up via the shaft with the motors/generators. After the sand reaches the top of the mine, the sand is stored in sand piles.

Agrivoltaics – the practice of co-locating solar facilities with cropland – is increasingly being adopted throughout the world as a way to introduced distributed clean energy while not compromising land use.
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
The paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland. At a global scale, it is estimated that 1% of all farmland could produce the world’s energy needs if converted to solar PV.
There are many different ways to install agrivoltaic arrays. One common method is to raise the array to leave space for farming equipment or livestock to move freely below. Another trending design is to orient the PV arrays vertically, leaving wide open spaces in between the array rows.
United States
In Somerset, California, German-designed Sunzaun vertical solar arrays were installed at a vineyard. Installer Sunstall developed the facility, which was composed of 43 450 W modules connected to a microinverter and two batteries.
The minimalistic design used holes in the module frames to make a simple attachment to two piles, negating the need for a heavy racking system. The bifacial solar modules produce energy on both sides of the vertically oriented array.
In traditional systems designed with a landscape orientation, the rails used to mount panels onto the racking system are often cut to fit the expected panel size. If the size of the panel changes after all other component procurement has been completed, the project may face delays while the rails are reengineered to fit the updated panel size. Sunzaun’s design allows for easy adaptation to a change in panel size by adjusting the distance between each pile. It is also possible to adjust the height of the panels from the ground if needed.
Germany
Scientists from the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences have looked at the potential impact of deploying vertical west-east oriented PV systems on a massive scale in the German energy market. They have found that such installations could have a beneficial effect in stabilizing the country’s grid, while allowing greater integration with agricultural activities than with conventional ground-mounted PV plants.
The scientists found that vertical PV systems can shift solar yield into hours of higher electricity demand and more electricity supply in the winter months, thus reducing solar curtailment.
“If electricity storage of 1 TW charging and discharging power and 1  TWh capacity is integrated into the energy system model, the effect is reduced to CO2 savings of up to 2.1 Mt/a with 70% vertical east-west and 30% inclined south facing modules,” they said. “Finally, while it might seem unrealistic for some to achieve a rate of 70% vertical power plants, even a lower rate has a beneficial impact.” 
Japan
In Japan, Luxor Solar KK, a subsidiary of German module manufacturer Luxor Solar, built an 8.3 kW vertical PV system in the parking area of a rice processing factory owned by Eco Rice Niigata.
“The cars will be parked between the vertical rack systems,” Luxor Solar KK CEO Uwe Liebscher told pv magazine. “The goal of this system is to show the durability during winter, and the additional energy yield due to the reflection of the snow. Niigata, on the other hand, is known for being a high snow load area, with up to 2 meters to 3 meters of snow in winter.”
The latest edition of pv magazine considers how industry heavyweights are increasingly planning gigawatt-scale assets, looks at the huge potential repowering could unlock for German solar, and examines how solar can help trucking companies in the energy transition. A packed edition also features a focus on the Middle East.
The south-oriented system features Luxor Solar’s own heterojunction solar modules, as well as mounting systems from German vertical PV specialist Next2Sun and inverters from Japan’s Omron. The vertical array will supply electricity to a rice processing factory next to the system. The city of Nagaoka supported the project with JPY 2 million ($14,390).
“A vertical installation uses only a minimum space of the farmland while maintaining more than 85% of the light reaching the crops, ensuring an optimal balance of solar and farming, which is crucial in Japan,” he said. “This allows us to build agrivoltaic systems on utility crops farmland, like for wheat, potatoes or rice, on a big scale.”
France
In France, TotalEnergies and agrivoltaics specialist InVivo commissioned a 111 kW vertical agrivoltaic demonstrator. TotalEnergies said the pilot facility will investigate the impact of solar panels on agricultural yield, as well as the biodiversity, carbon storage, and water quality of the site.
“We are convinced that the synergies developed between the production of green electricity, biogas and agriculture are one of the answers to guarantee our energy independence and our food independence,” said Thierry Muller, managing director of TotalEnergies Renouvelables France.
Sweden
Scientists at Mälardalen University in Sweden have developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that facilitates the analysis of microclimates in vertical PV projects. CFD simulations are used to solve complex equations about the flow of solids and gases through and around bodies, which can be used to analyze microclimates within agrivoltaic systems.
“Models of agrivoltaic (AV) systems will become frequently used for new AV system designs as well as decision-making as you can analyze/predict the microclimatic changes dependent on location and AV system solution,” researcher Sebastian Zainalli told pv magazine.
The study observed a 38% decrease in solar radiation intensity in the ground areas shaded by the vertical PV modules.
Key principles
The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory offered five principles for success in agrivolatics, which included:

The Dutch power and gas supplier has published an updated map of the congested areas and has invited developers of large-scale power plants to contact its experts for advice.
“Liander cannot guarantee that capacity will remain available for a long time,” it said in a statement.
It noted that the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) decided in May to change the grid code for the congested national network, in order to expand the share of renewables in the energy mix. Under the new rules, grid operators will be allowed to make agreements with market entities.
Liander also said in a separate announcement that it has worked with with grid operator Tennet to launch a new initiative aimed at selecting innovative projects for grid congestion management.
“Network operators are actively looking for more ideas to optimize the use of the network in order to connect more customers to the transmission and distribution network more quickly,” it said, adding that it will officially kick off the program in mid-February. 
The Netherlands urgently needs to address grid constraints, as high volumes of solar capacity will be deployed in the years ahead. Over the past two years, Liander has implemented a number of measures to increase grid capacity in several areas facing grid constraints, as such bottlenecks are preventing more renewables from going online. These measures include the deployment of two giant transformers and congestion management for grid bottlenecks.
Tennet also recently developed an interactive online map showing the locations in the country where the power grid is most congested.

The batteries are suitable for standalone storage or with solar or wind power.
“It is very suitable for solar power storage, with the added benefit of solar thermal storage in the salt water electrolyte tank,” CEO Gregory Giese told pv magazine.
The manufacturer said the new battery has an energy density of 125.7 Wh/L. It requires two large tanks filled with fluid electrolytes, one of which is saltwater and the other a proprietary electrolyte. The fluids are circulated through electrodes, which regulate the input and output of electricity from the battery.
The solution can be scaled by adding more electrodes and additional electrolyte tanks. Salgenx also offers the solution in 250 kW, 3 MWh, 6 MWh, 12 MWh, and 18 MWh configurations. The flow battery is membrane-free, unlike most redox flow batteries.
“The absence of the membrane saves huge upfront purchase costs, maintenance, and consumable expenses,” Salgenx says on its website.
The company claims that material costs of $5/kWh, $257kWh for system infrastructure, and a total system cost of $500,000, or $166/kW for the 3,000 kWh battery. The technology purportedly has a life expectancy of more than 25 years and a roundtrip efficiency of 91% at 10 mA/square centimeter.
The saltwater tank can be used simultaneously for thermal storage, in combination with a heat pump using carbon dioxide as a refrigerant.
“Typically the thermal savings using a heat pump and higher COP (coefficient of performance), may double that of electricity rate savings,” the company claims.
Salgenx develops the technology and sells licenses to third-party manufacturers to commercialize the solutions.

The EIA says that renewable energy in the United States continues its march toward being the nation's dominant source of electricity, as solar and wind power are expected to represent 16% of all generation this year. This doubles the 2018 contribution of 8%.
The US grid operated about 74 GW of solar photovoltaic capacity at the end of 2022, which is about three times the installed capacity at the end of 2017. Wind power has grown by more than 60% since 2017 to about 143 GW of capacity.
Solar capacity is expected to add another 63 GW by the end of 2024, an impressive growth of 84% in a two-year span. By 2024, solar may reach 6% of generation, while wind is expected to add 12 GW of capacity in two years, reaching about 12% of the total generation mix.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if the percentage of solar- and wind-generated electricity exceeds the EIA’s projections over the next two years, as the hundreds of billions of dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act pour into clean energy initiatives,” said Alex Formuzis, spokesperson for the Environmental Working Group.
Meanwhile, solar and wind are pushing fossil fuels off the grid. The EIA forecast for coal this year has fallen from a 20% contribution to 18%, and natural gas is expected to decline by a percentage point to 38% of the energy mix.
Coal is forecast to decline to 17% of US electricity generation in 2024, meaning next year may be a monumental year for classic renewables (solar and wind), to push coal further down the ranking list of contributors. When including hydroelectric power, U.S. renewable energy is expected to reach 26% of electricity generation by 2024.
Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) Senior Principal Kingsmill Bond said fossil fuel demand in the electricity sector has already reached its peak in demand. Driven by lowered costs, clean energy goals, and a gravitational shift in global capital toward renewables, solar and wind energy are expected to carry the torch left behind by coal, oil, and gas.
According to RMI research, fossil fuel demand for electricity has peaked in 95 % of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and 31% of the non-OECD countries excluding China.
“Putin’s war, the desire for domestic energy sources, and high fossil fuel prices only add to the pressure to change,” said Bond. “When we add up deployments in solar, wind, EVs, heat pumps, and hydrogen, we expect clean technology deployment over the course of this decade to replace four times as much fossil fuel demand as it did in the past decade.”
Investments in the US renewable energy market are expected to hit $114 billion by 2031, a 78% increase from $64 billion in total investments at year end 2021, buoyed by decarbonization momentum from the landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Much of this investment will go towards establishing a domestic supply chain of solar components.
“The IRA will completely reshape the renewables supply chain in the U.S., incentivizing the reopening of shuttered facilities as well as provide opportunities to build entire equipment supply chains from scratch,” said Daniel Liu, head of asset commercial performance at Wood Mackenzie.
