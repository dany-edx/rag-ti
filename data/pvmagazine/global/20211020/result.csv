https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/20/big-modules-head-for-standardization/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",Big modules head for standardization,"According to an announcement from module manufacturer Trina Solar, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) is poised to announce a set of standard dimensions for large format modules relying on the 210mm wafer launched by Zhonghuan Semiconductor back in 2019.
The standard, according to Trina, will be set out for different cell layouts as in the table below. Having a standard set of dimensions should make thing simpler, and therefore cheaper, for project developers and component suppliers, all of whom have to deal with significant uncertainty over module sizes and electrical characteristics since the switch to larger wafer formats began to play out.
The process began in May, when the CPIA brought together industry experts and representatives from across the supply chain to agree on a set of standards for products incorporating the 210mm wafer. Cell & module manufacturers including Trina Solar, Risen Energy, Canadian Solar and Tongwei – all of which have chosen to work with the 210mm wafer rather than then smaller 182mm product being promoted by Longi and others – took part in the CPIA event and agreed to standardize various technical details of the modules including module dimensions, size & positioning of mounting system attachment holes and other details including cell spacing. Modules will also be designed to meet the latest international standards including IEC 61730, published by the Switzerland-based International Electrotechnical Commission.
“This means 210mm module manufacturers, end users and system solution providers have achieved uniformity in technical issues,” said Trina Solar in a statement. “Standardization of modules will greatly reduce BOS costs and LCOE, and deliver the convenience and maximum value of ultra-high power modules and solutions to solar applications.”
Trina says it expects the move for standardization to directly result in cost reductions for balance of systems components, and a more efficient supply chain. On top this, it expects the manufacturing industry to be able to innovate and bring new processes to scale more quickly, and to bring down manufacturing costs as well.

The company was awarded 1.548 GW (1.540 GW of wind and 8 MW of solar) – all of the capacity it was competing for – according to preliminary results that the company shared with pv magazine.
“Being the winner again in this second auction of renewables organized by the government in 2021 is a very relevant milestone that reveals the strengths of capital energy,” they explain, adding that “the credibility of our business, with more than 20 years of experience in renewable energies, and the high efficiency which has allowed it to present highly competitive offers without sacrificing the profitability required by investors, or the flexibility granted by having a large portfolio and deciding on risk coverage.”
Capital Energy’s portfolio now exceeds 35 GW, of which more than 8.7 GW has been granted a grid access permit. In Spain’s previous auction, the company was the biggest winner with 620 MW, followed by Iberdrola with 243 MW, Naturgy with 215 MW, Acciona with 106 MW and Endesa with 50 MW.
Capital’s averages award price in this auction was €28.6/MWh, more than four euros above the average price reached in the previous auction held in January of this year.
The second auction awarded a total of 3.12 GW, 95% of the 3.3 GW on offer. 2.258 GW went to wind projects, and 866 MW to solar, at an average price of €30.56/MWh. The auction marks the first time in history where solar did not cover all of the offered capacity.
Other winners are Forestalia, which acquired 562 MW of wind and 215 MW of PV, or more than 25% of the auctioned capacity. Repsol won 138 MW of wind power. Naturgy, one of several large companies not to participate in the auction, would have been awarded 221 MW.
Teresa Ribera, Spain’s Minister for the Ecological Transition, gave assurances on Monday that Iberdrola would stop revising upwards its medium- and long-term industrial electricity supply contracts, a potential peace offering in the fight between government and some electricity suppliers over measures introduced to quell a sudden rise in electricity prices.
As was rumored, however, Iberdrola, together with Enel Green Power subsidiary Endesa, Acciona, and Greenalia, did not participate in today’s auction. Of the 3,300 MW auctioned, 600 MW will have an accelerated deadline requiring them to be in operation by September 30th, 2022 – to help lower electricity prices as soon as possible. Iberdrola blamed regulatory uncertainty for its non-participation in the auction, despite the fact that the auction guarantees a fixed price for ten years.
This was also the first auction that allowed for citizen participation, with a reserve of 300 MW for distributed systems, aimed primarily at PV installations smaller than 5 MW. Zaragoza City Council, which submitted a bid to generate and sell power through Forestalia subsidiary Levitec, did not win, and so the 5 MW project it bid for will not be completed.

The big news was the company's raised ambitions in emissions reduction. It unveiled a new target to reduce its Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, an apparent tripling of its previous target. 
To achieve this new target, the miner is now targeting a 15% emissions reduction by 2025 (from a 2018 baseline of 32.6 Mt [CO2 equivalent – equity basis]), and will directly invest approximately $7.5 billion toward its emissions reduction between 2022-2030. 
We’re also setting new targets. We will bring forward our 2030 target of reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15% to 2025. We are also more than tripling our 2030 target, increasing it to a 50% reduction in our scope 1 and 2 emissions.
— Rio Tinto (@RioTinto) October 20, 2021

This investment will partially go to the continued development of carbon-free aluminium technology Elysis and “pathways to produce green steel” which mean “a focus on renewable power for iron ore in the Pilbara and for the Australian aluminum smelters, including $0.5 billion per year from 2022 to 2024.”  
Rio Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm, who has been in the top job since January in the wake of outcry in response to the company's destruction of two 46,000-year-old sacred Indigenous sites in Western Australia last year, said “Rio Tinto is taking action to strengthen our business and improve our performance by unleashing the full potential of our people and assets, working in partnership with a broad range of stakeholders.”
Stausholm said that all of Rio Tinto's commodities are “vital for the energy transition and continue to benefit from ongoing urbanization.” We have a clear pathway to decarbonize our business and are actively developing technologies that will enable our customers and our customers' customers to decarbonize.” 
However, this strategic ‘pathway' might not be as clear as Stausholm makes out. According to the Financial Times, Rio Tinto's head of strategy and development resigned yesterday, on the eve of the company's investor day. Peter Toth is the second senior executive to leave the mining giant since Jakob Stausholm was appointed chief executive in January. According to a company statement Toth “has accepted a new position outside of Rio Tinto.” 
An Australian parliamentary report was published this week in response to the Juukan Gorge site destruction which called for an overhaul of the nation's cultural heritage laws which could allow indigenous groups to launch legal action against mining companies. In a statement, Rio Tinto welcomed the final report of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia following its inquiry into the destruction of rock shelters at Juukan Gorge on the land of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikiura people (PKKP) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
“We have been working hard to rebuild trust and meaningful relationships with the PKKP people and other Traditional Owners,” said Stausholm. “Rio Tinto is absolutely committed to listening, learning and showing greater care, and this remains a top priority.” Of course, Traditional Owners need a lot more than just words from mining corporations like Rio Tinto, and meaningful change is still yet to materialize.
The above mentioned renewables uptake at Rio Tinto's Pilbara sites is expected to include “the rapid deployment of 1 GW of wind and solar power.” This would replace the natural gas power plant currently in use and see the electrification of mining equipment while abating “around 1 million tons of CO2“.
However, the company said the full electrification of its Pilbara system, “including all trucks, mobile equipment and rail operations, will require further gigawatt-scale renewable deployment and advances in fleet technologies.” 
The miner also says it is investigating whether there are biomass and hydrogen pathways to green its steelmaking. 
However, the big renewables news from the investor day was from Rio Tinto's aluminum business, which will switch the Boyne Island and Tomago smelters (in Gladstone, Queensland, and the NSW Hunter Valley respectively), to solar and wind energy. Rio Tinto is estimating the job to transition the smelters will require around 5 GW of renewables.

The mega solar-storage project, which will be located at the Edwaleni Power Station in the central town of Matsapha, will have an initial capacity of 100 MW and supply more than 100 million kWh a year to countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.
The solar farm, which will comprise 75,000 panels covering 45 hectares on a site totaling 54 hectares, is expected to help reduce load shedding in South Africa and other neighboring SADC states by providing much needed power at peak times.
“We are so grateful to the government of Eswatini for their support, confidence, and belief in our
vision for this project, and we are so excited for the role we can play in Eswatini’s and Africa’s green
energy future,” said Frazium Energy director Robert Frazer. “We believe in the strength of Eswatini’s future.”
The company intends to invest beyond the €100 million already committed for the solar-storage project in the coming years, Frazer added. “Africa’s largest battery is coming, and it is coming to Eswatini. The future is not just bright, it is solar-powered.”
Manqoba Khumalo, Eswatini's minister of commerce, industry and trade, said: “Frazer Solar has shown again that it is a friend and partner to Eswatini, and a trusted investor and true pioneer in the future of our energy sector. The mega solar-storage project will provide a real and tangible benefit to all Emaswati, both in the creation of at least 200 new jobs, and in the provision of green, solar power, and dispatchable electricity across the Kingdom and beyond.”
Frazium Energy chose the Kingdom of Eswatini to host the project after considering 11 countries. The company had planned a similar project in the Kingdom of Lesotho in 2018 but it was canceled following a dispute with the government.
The large-scale solar-storage project follows Frazium Energy’s completion of a solar healthcare project in the Kingdom of Eswatini earlier this year. “Responding to the acute healthcare needs exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company delivered 92 solar-powered hotwater units to every governmental medical clinic nationwide, providing free hot running water for medical staff and patients’ use,” Frazium Energy stated.
That project was funded by Frazer Solar with assistance from the German Development Finance Institution (DEG), a subsidiary of the KfW development bank, and delivered by Frazium Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/20/laser-focus-on-perovskite-film-formation/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",Laser focus on perovskite film formation,"Even as perovskite solar cell edge closer to large-scale commercial production, developing reliable processes for their large-scale processing remains a challenge. Understanding how different processes affect the film formation and structure will be an important in ensuring devices can meet expectations for quality and long-term performance in the field.
Observing these structures on a small enough scale, however, presents another challenge. And the process of synthesizing different materials and then characterizing them afterwards can be time consuming and provide limited insight. A new process developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the U.S. allows for real-time observation of the processing and formation of the thin film, and can also allow scientists to observe its reaction to light throughout processing.
“When people make solar thin films, they typically have a dedicated synthesis lab and need to go to another lab to characterize it,” said Carolin Sutter-Fella, a scientist at Berkeley Lab’s molecular foundry. “With our development, you can fully synthesize and characterize a material at the same time, at the same place.”
At Berkeley Lab’s Advanced Light Source facility, the group equipped an x-ray station with a laser, allowing them to simultaneously observe changes in the structure as it is formed into a thin film, and how its reaction to light develops during the process. The work is described in full in the paper Out-of-equilibrium processes in crystallization of organic-inorganic perovskites during spin coating, published in nature communications.
They used the set up to observe methylammonium lead iodide, one of the most commonly investigated perovskite materials, during spin coating, and gained detailed insights into four stages of film formation, including the first few seconds where the precursor begins to solidify.
The group says that its work will help other researchers to better understand their processes, and that it could eventually be used in industrial environments for quality control and real time process monitoring. “The instrument will allow researchers to document how small things that are usually taken for granted can have a big impact on material quality and performance,” said Shambhavi Pratap, lead author of the research and now a researcher with the Technical University of Munich.
They will now focus on further developing the observation tools into a set up that others can make use of. “”We know that the research community is interested in using this new capability at the ALS,” said Sutter-Fella. “Now we want to make it user friendly so that more people can take advantage of this endstation.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/20/uk-retailers-sign-130-mw-of-solar-ppas-as-electricity-prices-surge/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM,WESTERN EUROPE",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",UK retailers sign 130 MW of solar PPAs as electricity prices surge,"On the back of high wholesale prices, U.K. electricity retailers are intensifying efforts to sign power purchase agreements with solar projects. Online PPA brokerage Renewable Exchange has reported the development, noting that 130 MW of solar PPAs have been signed in the last week alone.
Shortfalls in the supply of natural gas and challenging wind power generation conditions have resulted in high and highly fluctuating wholesale power prices in the United Kingdom. As a result, Renewable Exchange argued, energy retailers are showing a growing willingness to sign PPAs with solar generation assets.
Day-ahead electricity prices in the United Kingdom surged to almost GBP 425 ($585.60)/MWh for Sept. 15 – a record high – when an interconnector to France went down. Prices have been consistently high in recent months, remaining above GBP 100/MWh throughout August.
Given the price dynamic, it appears that U.K. utilities are looking to lock in supply. Renewable Exchange reports that 25 solar projects have signed PPAs with offtakers over the past week, totaling 130 MW of generation capacity.
“Generators now seek to secure their PPA contracts much further into the future, too,” says Chris Smith, chief commercial officer at Renewable Exchange. “Assets tendering through our platform this week will lock out as far as into 2024.”
Renewable Exchange is an online portal that allows renewable energy asset owners to enter into direct PPAs with offtakers – namely, U.K. electricity retailers. While primarily active in the United Kingdom, the platform has “recently” facilitated a wind power PPA in Germany, as part of its expansion on the continent.
With wholesale prices high in the United Kingdom and in many parts of Europe, Renewable Exchange says that it is seeing increased activity from offtakers looking to lock in renewable energy supply. Renewable PPAs both provide stability in terms of pricing and meet the surging interest from consumers in carbon-free electricity.
“At the moment, the unpredictable weather, and the lack of security in terms of foreign gas supplies are causing massive swings [in wholesale electricity prices] within days,” a spokesperson for Renewable Exchange told pv magazine.
While the location and connection voltage of a solar project will influence the PPA price it can achieve, Renewable Exchange reported that indicative prices have roughly doubled on last year.
“For solar assets contracting with PPA start date in the next month or so, they could expect PPA values in excess of GBP130/MWh for power and embedded benefits on one-year long contracts,“ the spokesperson continued. “In May 2021 equivalent contracts would have obtained prices in the region of GBP 65/MWh.“
Renewable Exchange said that new offtakers have recently begun bidding for PPAs on its platform including Trailstone, Brook Green, Conrad Energy and Octopus Energy. They join companies such as Smartest Energy, EDF, Drax (previously Opus), Good Energy, Ecotricity, Ovo, Statkraft, Limejump, Total and Engie, according to Renewable Exchange.
The majority of renewable assets using the PPA platform are operational wind power assets, although Renewable Exchange added that some projects still in the development phase have been able to sign PPAs via its online service.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/20/chinas-emission-reduction-action-squeezes-pv-production/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CHINA",,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",China’s emission-reduction action squeezes PV production,"In September 2020, China’s president, Xi Jinping, announced the nation’s CO2 emissions would peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality would be achieved by 2060, in what has been termed a “double carbon policy.” In December, more details were made available, namely that China would aim to cut carbon intensity per unit of GDP by more than 65% from 2005 levels, and would increase the share of non-fossil fuels in energy consumption to 25% by 2030. Moreover, by 2030 China aims to be home to a minimum of 1.2 TW of operational solar PV and wind power generation capacity. By the end of 2020, China had 253 GW and 281 GW of solar and wind capacity, respectively, installed.
The “dual control policy” refers to the reduction of quantitative targets set for both total energy consumption and energy intensity – the latter representing the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP growth. In 2020, China limited its energy consumption to 5 billion tons of standard coal equivalent. As a result, provinces are required to meet targets set by China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) earlier this year.
Pick up your copy of the latest edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
Subsequently, in early June and mid-August, the NDRC issued a dual-control scorecard for each province. Accordingly, the scorecard features three indicator colors: red, orange, and green. If a province scores orange and/or red, it is expected to take measures in order to bring the province back on track, such as aiming to become “green-flagged.” Surprisingly, in between the release of the two quarterly scorecards, the number of “red-flagged” provinces increased by four (30%) and Fujian province was twice changed from orange to completely red by mid-August. Overall, by mid-August, only 10 out of 30 provinces scored green twice, and provinces such as Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Ningxia, Qinghai and Yunnan exceeded both targets.
In light of that trend, in mid-September the NDRC announced updated measures under its dual control policy. Consequently, various provinces have released action plans designed to ensure a realization of those targets before the end of 2021.
Yunnan serves as a telling example. The Yunnan provincial government released a notice instructing industrial silicon production output to be reduced by 90% from September to December. Between January and August, Yunnan’s industrial silicon output made up approximately 20% of China’s total domestic supply. Currently, prices for industrial silicon have reached RMB80,000-90,000/ton ($12,400-$14,000) representing a 300% increase on the same period of last year.
Local Yunnan aluminum manufacturers have shut down 200,000 tons of production capacity, from a total of 730,000 tons, leading to price increases of 20% in a single day. At present, aluminum prices are at their highest levels since the mid-2000s. Since January, aluminum prices have increased by more than 50%. Similarly, soda ash has reached its highest price level in 10 years and has increased by 80% since January. Soda ash is a key material for solar glass.
In order to cope with the situation in future, Yunnan province announced this week that it has increased its electricity tariffs for industrial use by 50%, a measure which is scheduled to become effective on January 1.
Since early 2018, the price for polysilicon had been falling, reaching an all-time low of RMB56/kg ($8.70) in April and May last year. Since then, prices have increased and the latest transaction price came in at RMB270/kg ($41.95). The latter represents an increase of 13.2% compared to before the national holidays.
Consequently, given the price increase for raw materials – which translates to higher prices for polysilicon, EVA, backsheets, aluminum frames, solar glass, junction boxes and so on – prices for solar panels have reached a level not seen in the past 12-18 months. Latest bid prices for a 60 MW, public, solar module procurement tender were, on average, at RMB2.10/W ($0.326) with the highest reaching RMB2.208/W ($0.343). However, and more importantly, the bulk of that 60 MW order is to be delivered by May, thus indicating either that module prices could stay at an all-time high level during the next two quarters, or how reluctant manufacturers are to lower their prices in the coming 6-7 months. It is worth noting, however, that average bid prices for solar panels were at RMB1.55/W ($0.24) in December.
Taking into account the high prices, manufacturers have lowered production output, according to various industry sources. For instance, out of 26 module and 52 cell production lines, average capacity factor was 46% and 43%, respectively. Prior to the national holiday week at the start of the month, the capacity factor of cell lines was almost 30% higher.
Overall, power restrictions now imposed by 20 out of 30 provinces and regions are subject to different deadlines, ranging from just 1-2 weeks to several months, or even until September. It is currently unclear whether, in the coming days or weeks, PV manufacturers will be exempted from power restrictions, given the industry’s strategic relevance and importance.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology – responsible for implementing the “Industrial Green Development Plan 2016-2020” – released the fifth batch of 719 nationally approved green factories, and 1,073 green products, in October 2020. Although PV related products are included, it appears that less than a dozen solar PV manufacturers made it onto the national list. Provincial lists for Jiangsu and Zhejiang, both home to hundreds of solar companies, do contain, in total, 98 and 79 companies, respectively, but, similarly, each list contains just a handful of solar companies.
Whether those “green factory lists” will be taken into account when determining whether PV companies are to be exempted from power restrictions remains to be seen. One example which indicates that PV companies could be exempted, is the fact Inner Mongolia was named and shamed in February for having failed to meet its 2019 energy targets. Government officials quickly ordered many companies to either reduce or stop producing altogether. However, after a local solar wafer company argued industries of strategic importance should be exempted, it was allowed to resume production.
Unfortunately, in addition to the double carbon/dual control policies, the forthcoming “Autumn and Winter Air Pollution Comprehensive Plan for Key Areas 2021-2022,” could put further pressure on various industrial sectors, including solar PV. A first draft, just released by the Ministry of Environment and Ecology, is aiming at 60 cities (previous plans merely covered 28) and could result in significant production restrictions and, therefore, could also further negatively impact the overall PV supply chain. That China has more than doubled the number of targeted cities may be a result of the country’s hosting of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will begin in February. Eager to ensure blue skies throughout the games, measures designed to realize that ambition could not only be far-reaching, but also strictly enforced.
So much for the bad news, on Friday I'll take a look at the possible positive effects of China's emissions reduction measures on the solar industry.

NITI Aayog, an Indian government think tank, has collaborated with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to develop a comprehensive geographic information system (GIS) energy map of India with the support of the government of India.
The GIS map provides a holistic picture of all the energy resources of the country, enabling the visualization of energy installations such as conventional power plants, oil and gas wells, petroleum refineries, coal fields and coal blocks, district-wise data on renewable energy power plants, and renewable energy resource potential through 27 thematic layers.
The map attempts to identify and locate all primary and secondary sources of energy and their transportation/transmission networks to provide a comprehensive view of energy production and distribution in the country. 
“It is a unique effort aimed at integrating energy data scattered across multiple organizations and to present it in a consolidated, visually appealing graphical manner. It leverages the latest advancements in web-GIS technology and open-source software to make it interactive and user-friendly. The Geospatial Energy Map of India will be useful in planning and making investment decisions. It will also aid in disaster management using available energy assets,” said the government in a press release.
Dr. Rajiv Kumar, vice chairman of NITI Aayog, said that GIS-mapping of energy assets will ensure real-time, integrated energy sector planning in India.
“Energy markets have immense potential to bring in efficiency gains. Going forward, GIS-based mapping of energy assets will be advantageous to all concerned stakeholders and will help in accelerating the policy-making process,” said Kumar. “Fragmented data has been brought together; this will be a great research instrument.”

New York state has begun to sell off more than $200 million in manufacturing equipment that it bought for planned Tesla and Panasonic solar manufacturing facilities in Buffalo.
According to local media outlets, the state is moving this equipment to make room for new equipment Tesla has already purchased for planned expansions of its operations at the RiverBend manufacturing facility. The state is framing the story to say that the jobs and local benefits created by the plant will outweigh any losses that come from the equipment sale.
The equipment is being sold by NY CREATES, the state-associated non-profit overseeing the RiverBend facility. Investments in the facility and equipment were initially made by the state, under agreements that Tesla and Panasonic would lease both the facility and use the equipment.
Most of the equipment, which was reportedly purchased in 2015 and early 2016 before Tesla acquired SolarCity, was used by Panasonic prior to the company’s departure from RiverBend in 2020.
Of the $207 million in equipment being sold, roughly $125 million was used by Panasonic. Some $32 million in equipment will remain at the facility and be used by Tesla. An additional $22 million worth of equipment that had been stored in a local business park will be recycled.
It has reportedly cost the state more than $200,000 to store the equipment. It is also expected that the equipment resale will be for a lower price than the equipment’s original evaluation.
Reports also said that NY CREATES is having difficulty selling the equipment due to its specialized nature, and that the state has hired a global financial services group to remarket it. The state has not disclosed its return on the equipment that has been sold thus far, hoping not to negatively impact negotiations.
