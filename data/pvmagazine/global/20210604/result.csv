The latest SpaceX Dragon resupply spacecraft left NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 3, carrying more than 7,300 pounds of science experiments as well as new solar arrays for the International Space Station (ISS).
The resupply mission will deliver a new ISS Roll-out Solar Array (iROSA), produced by Redwire, to the space station in the trunk of the Dragon spacecraft. After the Dragon docks to the space station’s Harmony module, the robotic Canadarm2 will extract two arrays, the first of six arrays to be delivered to the station. Astronauts will install them during spacewalks planned for June 16 and 20. The power upgrade costs around $100 million.
Using solar cells from Boeing’s subsidiary Spectrolab, each iROSA assembly will provide more than 28 kW of power at beginning of life. Combined, the six new arrays will produce more than 120 kW, boosting the space station’s power-generating capability by 20-30%.
 
The iROSA technology is based on a previous demonstration of roll-out panels performed on the station in 2017. Redwire said the array’s design uses composite booms to serve as both the primary structural elements and the deployment actuator. These are paired with a modular photovoltaic blanket assembly.
Instead of using motors for deployment, iROSA uses stored energy from carbon fiber booms that are cut and rolled back against their natural shape for storage. When it is time for them to be deployed, the stored strain energy of the booms enforces the unrolling deployment actuation. When fully deployed, the now-rigid booms provide the solar arrays’ structural stiffness and strength.
The new solar arrays will be attached at a slight angle to an outboard set of the lab’s existing arrays to provide additional power, helping make up for age-related degradation. While the new panels are smaller than the originals, they produce more power.

Theoretically, having wildflowers on the land around a solar park can have benefits to the system owner in energy yield and vegetation management, as well as providing much-needed habitat for bees and other pollinating insects.
With these projects still in their early stages, however, long-term benefits are yet to be proven, and more research will be needed to refine the approach and ensure maximum benefits are realized. A group of entomologists in the United States has analyzed recent projects and research in this area, and put together suggestions for best practices and the development of standards for developing and managing pollinator habitats on land also occupied by a solar PV installation.
The group, led by the Entomological Society of America, reports its findings in the paper Can Solar Energy Fuel Pollinator Conservation?, published in Environmental Entomology. “You can say, ‘How is this different than a hundred other conservation practices?'” says Adam Dolezal, assistant professor of entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “And the answer is, well, it has some very weird and specific requirements to make it even on the table for solar developers to consider. And that's something we're still learning.”
To realize the potential benefits of this approach, care must be taken from the start. Developers should “choose plants and arrangements appropriate for a site’s unique growing conditions”, taking into account environmental factors like climate and soil conditions, as well as PV system characteristics such as the height of the panels and minimizing overgrowth.
And after the planning and installation stage, ongoing maintenance will be required to keep the habitat thriving and ensure that some slower-growing species can establish themselves, and this would likely need third party monitoring and certification, as is beginning to appear with legislation for ‘pollinator friendly’ landscapes being introduced in various regions.
But there is plenty more work needed for this approach to realize its full potential. “For this practice to provide tangible results, cooperation between policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders is critical to producing recommendations or requirements that benefit pollinators while remaining realistic within the framework of utility-scale solar developments,” the researchers conclude. “without rigorous implementation, assessment, and independent oversight, these efforts could be seen as little more than a form of ‘greenwashing’ that touts benefits to pollinators without providing them.”

The country’s Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE) issued an invitation to bid for the construction of ground-mounted solar power projects on an independent power producer (IPP) and build-operate-own (BOO) basis.
Interested developers will have to submit their project proposals to state-owned utility Electric Power Generation Enterprise (EPGE), which was formerly known as Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise, by August 21. Selected projects will be granted a 20-year PPA.
The MOEE concluded in September a 1 GW PV tender launched in May 2020 by allocating all of the procured capacity. Final prices ranged from $0.0348/kWh to $0.051/kWh. The biggest winners of the procurement exercise were Chinese inverter maker Sungrow and China Machinery Engineering Corp. (CMEC), with nine and eight projects, respectively.
A consortium formed by China's State Power Investment Corporation Limited (SPIC) and local company Khaing Long Gems secured four projects. Two more consortia – including a group involving Chinese solar manufacturers Longi and GGL Systems – also won projects. The remaining two bidders, including groups led by German developer ib vogt and Myanmar's Gold Energy, likewise secured projects.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country reached an installed PV capacity of 84 MW at the end of 2020.
Off-grid solar already plays a key role in Myanmar’s electrification strategy. A number of rooftop PV arrays and minigrid projects having already been developed in rural parts of the country. However, the utility-scale solar segment has also started to take off.

Highview Enlasa, a joint venture between Highview Power, a UK-based provider of long-term energy storage solutions, and Chilean energy company Enlasa, is planning to invest $150 million in a liquid air storage project to be developed in Diego de Almagro, in Chile's northern region of Atacama.
The 50 MW facility, which is currently in the pre-feasibility engineering development phase, will be able to provide 10 hours of storage.
This project is scheduled to enter into environmental proceedings in August, with construction expected to start in the second half of 2023 with the support of SK Engineering and Construction, a subsidiary of Chilean conglomerate Koppers group.
This technology is based on a simple principle: air in a gaseous state turns into a liquid when cooled to -196 ° C, being stored very efficiently in thermally insulated tanks at low pressure. Subsequently, its heating to room temperature causes rapid regasification and a volume expansion of 700 times, which is used to drive a steam turbine associated with a generator and create electricity without combustion, all this with a total efficiency that reaches 60 %, but which can reach much higher values if the system is complemented with other industrial processes that generate cold or residual heat.
Highview Power is also developing several energy storage projects throughout Spain, with an aggregate capacity of up to 2 GWh and an estimated investment of about $1 billion.

Manufacturing giant Longi Solar unveiled its new n-type TOPCon “Hi-Mo N” PV panel. Executive vice president Dennis She said it comprises n-type HPC solar cells with efficiencies of up to 25.21%. He added the maximum efficiency of the new module is up to 22.3%, on a 570 W product.

The module is also said to be PID free, with 1% degradation occurring in the first year and less than 0.4% in the following years. “HPC”, according to Li Hua, Longi’s research head of cell tech, represents the terms “High Performance Cell” and “Hybrid-Passivated Contact”.
Given the company’s scale, and current high price of n-type cell technology, the news is interesting in terms of what this could mean for prices going forward. Analysts predict that by 2025, n-type will start to become the dominant technology. Big manufacturers getting involved is important to that trend being realized.
Longi also signed strategic cooperation agreement with the Shanghai Tongji University to establish a Hydrogen Laboratory in Shanghai for research into green hydrogen.
Equipment, hydrogen storage and transportation, and applications for green hydrogen, will all be focused on. Li Zhenguo, board chairman and president of Longi said the company aims to be the world’s leading hydrogen technology company and will work closely with Tongji for technology research and development, personnel retraining, and transformation from R&D to production.
Huansheng Solar, a joint venture between Zhonghuan Semiconductor and Maxeon, which focuses on the PV module side of the business, also released two new module products at SNEC 2021.

The first is a new 670 W power module based on Zhonghuan’s 210 mm large size wafers. The G12-69P bifacial duo-glass panel is equipped with stacking technology and has an efficiency of 21.6%. To achieve this, Zhonghuan used laser curve cutting and conductive adhesive to connect the cells. According to the company, the new product is particularly suitable for utility-scale PV projects.
The second solar module utilizes interdigitated back contact (IBC) cell technology. The total weight is said to be around half that of traditional products on the market, because the cells’ thickness are roughly 1/10th that of regular cells. Its efficiency, meanwhile, is reportedly above 21%. Zhonghuan did not mention costs or when the IBC module will go into mass production.
JinkoSolar released its latest Tiger Pro series PV module with a power output of 415 W. Its dimensions comprise 1.1 m x 1.7 m, and it weighs 22 kg, making it suitable for single-person installation.
With a super high load capacity of 6000Pa/4000Pa, this module is especially suitable for the residential rooftop PV market. Jinko provides a 15-year quality assurance and 25-year power generation guarantee for this product.
JA Solar also released a new module, the DeepBlue 3.0 Pro, which is an upgrade of its previous DeepBlue 3.0 product. Utilizing new zero-gap technology, efficiencies of 21.7% have been reached – said to be 0.4% higher than the previous version, while still available at the same cost.
A 72 cell glass/backsheet module achieved a power output of 560 W. And the larger 78 cell product reached 605 W. Compared to other high-density interconnection layouts, JA Solar says its new DeepBlue module uses advanced soft connection and erases the risk of cracks on connection.
JA Solar said 182 mm wafers are the optimal size for this PV product. All of the company’s new module products are now based on 182 mm wafers, its PERCIUM cell tech, and 11 busbar and half-cut technology.
TBEA released its new generation 1500V 300KW+ string inverter products: the TS315KTL-HV and the TS330KTL-HV, which boast a maximum capacity of 315 KW and 330 KW, respectively.
These string inverters support 24 input lines, 12 MPPT with a maximum current of 48 A for each, and are said to be suitable for both 182 mm or 210 mm based high power PV modules.
Based on this new 300 KW+ series PV inverter, TBEA is promoting system solutions for 4 MW PV installation units. According to its calculations, compared to a conventional unit of 3.15 MW, the new 4 MW unit will reduce average construction costs by 2.36%, cable costs by 0.36%, installation costs by 0.16%, and O&M costs by 1.62%. Meanwhile, the total levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) will be reduced by around 1%.
Sungrow Floating PV, a subsidiary of inverter manufacturer Sungrow signed a strategic R&D cooperation agreement with Jiangsu Ocean University for the development of floating PV technology in offshore and coastal beach settings, and for personnel training.

Sungrow said China has plenty of offshore areas for floating PV installations. However, because the sector faces severe conditions, such as wave impact, for example, it is essential that floating arrays and anchorage systems have a high wave tolerance.
The strategic cooperation with Jiangsu Ocean University will allow the two parties to work closely together to target key technologies and solutions for such issues.
Solis came to this year’s SNEC with its flagship string inverter product, the G6-GU320K-EHV – a typical representative product for the high current and high-power market. The inverter’s maximum power is up to 325 kWA, making it one of the string inverters with the highest power rating to date.
This inverter uses 1500 VDC and can work in temperatures ranging from -45 to 60℃. According to Solis, in extreme conditions, the total output in 25 years for this inverter type will be higher than conventional types by at least 3.4%. Furthermore, the maximum current input is 45A for each MPPT, which makes it the largest MPPT current string inverter, and this greatly improved the system safety.
Watch out for more reports from SNEC later.

The two companies also want to “explore new opportunities for developing decarbonized hydrogen and ammonia,” suggesting that hydrogen will be among a large portfolio of green measures that oil and gas majors will adopt to react to the increasing societal pressure.
Anglo-Dutch energy major Royal Dutch Shell has awarded Australian engineering company Worley a services contract to support the development of a new 200 MW electrolysis-based hydrogen plant in Rotterdam, Netherlands. “The new plant will be powered by renewable energy from an offshore wind farm that is currently in development. Once complete, the green hydrogen plant will be one of the largest commercial green hydrogen production facilities in the world,” reads a note released by Worley on Tuesday. Operations are scheduled to start by 2023 and are estimated to produce 50,000 to 60,000 kilograms of green hydrogen per day. “The green hydrogen produced will initially be used to decarbonize Shell’s nearby refinery in Pernis and support the industrial use of hydrogen in the heavy transportation industry.”
The Netherlands are moving closer to set up HyXchange, a hydrogen exchange platform. A recent report outlined the conditions that would allow its establishment. The main elements are “hydrogen certification, an index that would make prices transparent, a spot market and the development of trading instruments to balance the physical hydrogen network and to store the gas,” the Port of Rotterdam wrote, citing the report by Bert den Ouden on behalf of Dutch natural gas infrastructure and transportation company Gasunie and the port authorities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Groningen and North Sea Port. Gasunie has been working to connect the infrastructure in the Netherlands to that of Germany and Belgium.
Belgian hydrogen solutions developer CMB.TECH opened the first multimodal hydrogen refueling station in Antwerp on Thursday. “It is the first refuelling station in the world that produces green hydrogen, which will be used to power ships, tube trailers, cars, trucks and buses,” the company said. CMB.TECH also announced the launch of a hydrogen truck. The hydrogen refuelling station is built at the Port House in Antwerp. CMB.TECH chose the location on the border between the city and the port “to be able to supply hydrogen to the many industrial applications in the port on the one hand and on the other to keep it easily accessible to the general public.”
Germany-based Siemens Mobility and Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nuremberg for Renewable Energy (HI ERN) signed an MoU to jointly research the use of Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) technology in rail transport. In this process, an organic carrier liquid absorbs hydrogen and releases it only when needed. The hydrogen is thus chemically bound and can’t escape in a gas form, not requiring storage under high pressure or at low temperatures. “Siemens Mobility’s interest in the LOHC technology that we’ve decisively developed over the past few years at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg and at the HI ERN is an excellent basis for a possible cooperation in the future,” commented HI ERN director Peter Wasserscheid. “We share with Siemens Mobility the vision of developing a hydrogen technology that uses the existing fuel infrastructure to power large vehicles like trains.”
Lightsource bp, the 50/50 joint venture between British oil company BP and solar developer Lightsource, reached an agreement with Portugual’s Insun to develop five solar projects totaling more than 1.35 GW of photovoltaic power. The €900 million projects are in the initial development phase. The company said it was also actively exploring opportunities for green hydrogen in the country. Portugal aims to reach 2.5 GW of green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade. Lightsource bp has partnered with authorities in the UK and Australia to establish large-scale green hydrogen projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/04/four-terminal-iii-v-solar-cell-with-32-57-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 4, 2021",Four-terminal III-V solar cell with 32.57% efficiency,"A group of researchers at the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has simulated a four-terminal tandem III-V solar cell by stacking gallium arsenide (GaAs) films onto interdigitated back contact (IBC) silicon solar cells with a glass interlayer.
“While we have done some initial mini-module integration work, significant size scaling will ultimately be needed to reach commercialization,” the research project's main author, Adele Tamboli, told pv magazine. The cells could reach commercialization after several challenges are addressed, she added. “The component cells have both been demonstrated at industrial scale. However, the cost is still high and will need to be reduced.”
The device has an active area of 1 cm2 and is claimed to have higher efficiency compared to similar cells built at the research level, as the thickness of the GaAs absorber layer was optimized. “If the absorber layer is too thin, transmission through the top cell will increase, and high-energy photons will be collected by the bottom cell at a lower voltage,” the scientists explained. “If the absorber layer is too thick, approaching the minority carrier diffusion length of the absorber layer material, the carriers generated will recombine prematurely, and the photon energy will be lost as heat.”
The GaAs cells were grown on GaAs substrates through metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). The absorber layer thickness was between 1.5 to 3.5 micrometers to bracket an expected optimum of 2.4 micrometers. The IBC cells with a thickness of 300 micrometers were provided by the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany. “The tandems were assembled by stacking the processed GaAs cells on top of amorphous silicon bottom cells with a thin layer of the same epoxy used for inversion in between,” the academics stated. “The resulting cells were then cured at room temperature for 24 h.”
The researchers found that all the four-terminal tandem cells developed with this design achieved an efficiency of over 32% when the GaAs thickness was above 1.5 micrometers. A cell with an absorber layer with a thickness of 2.8 micrometers showed the highest top cell and tandem efficiency of 26.38% and 32.57%, respectively. “While the GaAs top cell here had a slightly decreased fill factor (FF), the IBC bottom cell exhibited a slightly higher efficiency than the silicon heterojunction bottom cell used previously,” the research team emphasized.
The findings of the research and a description of the cell can be found in the paper “Optimization of four terminal rear heterojunction GaAs on Si interdigitated back contact tandem solar cells”, published in Applied Physics Letter.

Indeed, for the next two auctions, they expect demand to be much lower than supply.
“Unfortunately, the road to a concrete development of renewables in Italy is still uphill,” Gianluca Biscotti, founder of engineering consultancy BFP, told pv magazine.
Last week, Italian energy agency Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE) allocated 73 MW of renewables capacity in the country's fifth clean energy auction for projects with capacities above 1 MW. The procurement exercise drew bids for 98.9 MW; the government initially hoped to assign 1.48 GW of new projects. Overall, only 20 MW of solar were allocated.
“I would though suggest to operators to take part in the final two auctions of the RES1, if possible, as convenient incentives like the ones presented in RES1 will no longer exist in a truly competitive market,” Mauro Moroni, the founder of Moroni & Partners, told pv magazine.
The RES1 Decree, a comprehensive reform enacted in 2019, sought to incentivize 8 GW of renewable energy plants by around 2023/2024. The decree introduced an overall average annual cap on incentives of €5.8 billion.
According to Moroni, only smaller installations on roofing with asbestos were not convenient in the current regime.
“The poor results prove the need for change, which seems to be coming. It is news of the last hours that by the summer or immediately after RES2 will arrive. We all hope this new decree will be more applicable and effective than RES1. But the real issue is the authorization part, which needs simplification and speeding up,” Moroni argued.
Last week, the government approved the so-called Simplification Decree, a series of measures intended to simplify investments and which includes the Procedura Abilitativa Semplificata (PAS), which bundles several procedural processes.
“The simplification of authorization procedures for industrial land included in the Simplification Decree is the only positive development and measure, but that’s not enough,” Paolo Rocco Viscontini, president of Italia Solare, told pv magazine.
The government should offer better conditions, including a 50% tax break, to convince owners of industrial roofs to install PV systems, he added. Viscontini is also calling for a simpler legislative framework and more transparency from the GSE.
“Surely it will be easier to authorize PV plants on industrial land thanks to the extension of PAS to plants up to 10 MWp, but, in our opinion, it will not be enough to move the overall value of installations in Italy,” Biscotti commented. “We hope that the conversion of this decree into law will solve the other long-standing problems that slow down the procedures, especially in relation to the inhibitory action of the Ministry of Culture and the inertia of many regional and provincial administrations that do not carry out the procedures in line with the timing stated in the law,” he noted, adding that these are all issues that will take several months to solve.
“The Simplification Decree could finally sanction the change of pace of the decarbonization of our country,” said Moroni, adding that RES2 should support plants in agricultural areas “or at least agrophotovoltaic”, as much as the re-powering of plants, without discarding the opportunities stemming from floating and off-shore.
Italy, which has over 21 GW of solar capacity, is planning to install around 50 GW by 2030.

The manufacturer describes the new product as the first bifacial module with n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells.
The module is built with 144 half-cut cells is available in six versions with power ratings ranging from 545 W to 570 W and efficiencies between 21.3% and 22.3%.
The open-circuit voltage is between 50.85 V and 51.60 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 13.46 A to 13.81 A. The product measures 2,256×1,133x35mm and weighs in at 32.3kg. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
It also features an IP68 enclosure rating, 2mm coated tempered glass, and an anodized aluminum alloy frame. The module can be used with operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius and its operating temperature coefficient is -0.31% per degree Celsius.
The panel comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is claimed to be less than 1% and power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.40% of the nominal output power after 30 years.
“Hi-MO N maintains the optimal 182mm cell and 72-cell module size,” the company said in a statement released.
The new panel is based on its proprietary high-performance computing (HPC) technique and is claimed to provide higher bifacial gain, better temperature coefficient and low irradiance performance, lower working temperature, better light-induced degradation (LID) and potential induced degradation (PID) performance. “Energy yield is 2-3% higher than that of mainstream P-type bifacial modules,” Longi affirmed.

Pacific Energy subsidiary Hybrid Systems Australia has confirmed that it will build a new factory in Perth to produce off-grid and edge-of-grid systems.
Hybrid Systems Australia, a subsidiary of QIC-owned Pacific Energy, has taken an initial 10-year lease at the Perth Airport industrial precinct, where the purpose-built facility will be located. Hybrid Systems Australia said the new facility will allow it to increase production capacity and to service growing demand for standalone power systems (SPS).
In February the Western Australian government said that it had set aside AUD 218 million ($167 million) to manufacture and install more than 1,000 SPS in the state over the next five years.
Pacific Energy CEO Jamie Cullen said modeling by Western Power showed about 6,000 viable properties in Western Australia where SPS units could be installed in the years ahead.
“This investment is a recognition that increasing energy decentralisation and decarbonization pressures are going to drive demand for clean energy sources such as SPS and the bigger grid-connected battery energy storage systems (BESS),” he said. “This is the biggest SPS manufacturing facility in the world as far as we are aware.”
Cullen said the technology is also ideally suited to Queensland. Hybrid Systems Australia has estimated future demand of about 2,000 SPS in the state.
Since 2016, Western Power has installed 58 SPS in Western Australia. Western Power CEO Ed Kalajzic said the power utility would continue to roll out SPS to improve power reliability in regional and remote areas.
“Like many electricity networks around the world, Western Power is looking at ways we can improve power reliability and quality and improve operational and cost efficiencies for the community,” Kalajzic said. “We’re increasingly using renewables and SPS provides a viable alternative to traditional poles and wires while realizing commercial, social, and environmental benefits.”

“The agreements will see the consortium develop, build and operate three large-scale, solar-hybrid, off-grid utilities,” Gridworks said in a statement. The plants will supply power to three cities, Gemena, Bumba, and Isiro, which are located in the country's northern region and currently have no connection to the country's power network.
The consortium was selected as a preferred bidder in the frame of a tender held under the umbrella of the Essor Access to Energy (A2E) Initiative, which is a UK government-funded program launched in 2019 to supports the DRC Government's mini-grid auction and project preparation process.
“The initial investment for the three sites will be at least US$100 million, funded with a mixture of equity from the consortium, debt provided by development finance institutions (DFIs) and capital grants from donors and DFIs,” Gridworks further explained. “The consortium is in discussions for the provision of debt finance with both the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund and the African Development Bank (AfDB), and for the potential provision of grants with the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), the Rockefeller Foundation and the AfDB’s Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa.”
The company expects to reach financial close for the three projects within 14 months. The plants are to be built by the Moyi Power joint venture and are expected to be completed within 18 months after the start of construction.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, DR Congo only had 20 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020. The country has one of the lowest levels of access to electricity in the world, with only 9% of the population being supplied with power. This percentage in rural areas drops to as far as 1%. It has an installed capacity of just 2.67 GW, of which 2.54 GW comes from hydropower and 135 MW from thermal power.

Norway’s Scatec has signed an agreement to acquire a 50% stake in Indian developer Acme’s 900 MW solar power project in the Indian state of Rajasthan.
The project will be built with an estimated total capex of $400 million, with 75% debt financing from an Indian state-owned lender.
Acme will provide turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services. Commissioning of the plant is scheduled in 2022. Once operational, the plant is expected to produce 1,600 GWh of electricity per year. The power will be sold under a 25-year power purchase agreement with Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI).
The Rajasthan installation with Acme marks Scatec’s first project in India.
“[India] is targeting significant growth in the renewable energy capacity by 2030 and is a key growth market for renewables. We have already established presence on the ground and are positioning for future tenders within solar, wind and hybrids,” said Raymond Carlsen, CEO of Scatec.
Scatec is targeting 15 GW capacity by the end of 2025 and expects India to be a key market in the years to come.
“We see opportunities to offer various large-scale solutions across technologies in India, both based on federal and state tenders, as well as through entering into direct PPAs with corporate off-takers. Our proven track record from renewables in emerging markets and solid partnerships will support our entry into the Indian market,” said Carlsen.
Oslo-based Scatec develops, builds, owns, and operates solar, wind, and hydropower plants and storage solutions. It has more than 3.5 GW in operation and under construction on four continents.
Acme has a cumulative portfolio of 5.0 GW, out of which 2.3 GW is operating and 2.7 GW is under construction. The company aims to achieve an operating capacity of 25 GW by 2030.

A New College of Florida student, Antonia “Toni” Ginsberg-Klemmt, has won a $10,000 OZY Genius Award for what she calls “Gismo Power,” a mobile solar carport with an integrated electric vehicle charger.
Ginsberg-Klemmt’s Gismo Power apparatus is a foldable solar carport that’s entirely mobile and can be folded for storage in a garage. In operation, the appliance can fit up to 24 solar modules on its frames, which can be angled or lowered depending on the position of the sun at any given time.
It also uses a SolarEdge Inverter/EV charger. This is connected to an extension cord, which serves as the plug for Gismo Power to connect to the grid.
The OZY Genius Award is a $10,000 prize awarded to 10 college students pursuing “projects or ideas that have a positive impact on society.”
According to Ginsberg-Klemmt, the idea to create a portable solar EV charging carport came from the recognition that her school’s campus did not have EV charging stations.
Because Gismo Power doesn’t have an attached battery system, the apparatus must be connected to the grid, so it does not waste the generated electricity. While on the grid, however, the system acts just like any rooftop solar installation, sending excess generation back to the grid and paying for itself via net metering.
Ginsberg-Klemmt owns the only Gismo Power prototype, but she is working to construct a more powerful version for New College of Florida. Once that project is complete, she plans on beta-testing a handful of systems. She estimates that the system would cost around $20,000, but that may not be reflective of the final price after beta-testing.
Ginsberg-Klemmt is also pursuing OSHA & UL certification and generic permitting for the first grid-tied electrical appliance to generate electricity. This process includes improvements to electric code compliance and usability improvements. Once those benchmarks have been achieved and commercial scaling becomes a reality, Ginsberg-Klemmt plans to produce a “startup series” of 10 to 100 units, while also starting the “Gismo Power Factory,” a manufacturing facility.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/04/solar-101-obvious-and-not-so-obvious-us-solar-incentives/,"COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 4, 2021",Solar 101: Obvious and not-so-obvious US solar incentives,"From pv magazine USA
The next step in our Solar 101 series is to look at state-level incentives that can make a big difference in your project’s financial prospects.
Multiple revenue streams affect the payback period of a solar power project. We’ve already discussed three of them: savings from electricity generation, federal tax credits, and net metering. Soon, we’ll show how these revenue streams combine to cover the $21,000 average cost of a solar power project.
If you live in a state without solar incentives, then this article might apply less to your project. For example, while California offers net metering and produces more solar electricity than any other state, it doesn’t offer a specific solar incentive. Similarly, there are no incentives offered by the “Sunshine State” of Florida, nor for the Longhorns down in Texas.
For example, many cities offer their own solar incentives and renewable energy loans, not to mention important legal protections. And of course, all states are still eligible for federal-level solar incentives.Those three states are the largest in the country, totaling 90 million of the 328 million people in the country, according to the U.S. Census website. If you’re one of those 90 million, you can still use the tools outlined in this article.
You can explore the tools available in your home state several ways. The first – and most important – is to communicate with your contractor. Your contractor will know your incentives well, because it’s their job to show a project’s best financial return on investment.
A second tool – often challenging to navigate – is your electricity utility’s website. As you work through the installation process, you might have to access the website to download or submit documents. Reading through and interacting with your utility’s web resources is time well spent, as it provides valuable information about local laws and procedures. Keep in mind that some states, like Massachusetts, share their solar incentives on a government website instead of a power company website.
A third – and the best tool to learn about your state incentives, in this author’s opinion – is the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIREusa.org). This is the same tool we used to research your state’s net metering laws.

The DSIRE team published a high level map above, along with an article that summarizes the many laws; however, because there are so many solar incentive laws around the country, it’s difficult to put all the information into one image.
Keeping that complexity in mind, let’s do a quick walkthrough on how to find the information that matters for your solar project.
Once these steps are complete, you should see a list of solar-focused incentives and laws that apply (mostly) to residential solar power. Clicking on these individual links will give you detailed information on the topics, including links to applicable legislation.

Take a moment to examine all of these incentives and laws thoroughly. Keep in mind that many of them are not standard “incentives.” For example, Massachusetts offers a “property tax exemption.” In Florida, homeowner associations may not stop you from installing solar power. And in Colorado, there’s no sales tax on residential renewable energy installations.

After you focus on solar related laws and incentives, return to step #1 (above), and browse through the energy related laws in your state. Some states offer electric vehicle incentives, heat pumps, lighting, efficiency, and other clean energy-related support.
And one final pitch for the DSIRE team. If you are a solar professional looking for a simple, centralized document of all laws related to solar, energy storage, and/or electric vehicles , check out the  DSIRE Insight informational package. It is delivered in PDF and spreadsheet format that allows for fast browsing.
