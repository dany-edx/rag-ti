(ZETDC) have agreed to develop Zimbabwe's first utility-scale green hydrogen power plant. HDF Energy is developing the project in Manicaland province, in southeastern Zimbabwe, while the country's largest generation assets are in the northwest. The plant will provide continuous green power to the grid via a substation located 4 km from the project site,” said HDF, noting that annual electric production will reach 178 GWh. 
Rystad Energy says that Africa’s total announced electrolyzer pipeline capacity has reached 114 GW, with 61% of it in Sub-Saharan countries. It said the region has an announced electrolyzer pipeline of about 70 GW, with Mauritania accounting for 50% of the total, followed by South Africa and Namibia. The Norwegian research firm said that just 13 MW of the planned 114 GW have reached a final investment decision to date. “Sub-Saharan Africa holds a highly strategic position for the development of a successful green hydrogen economy, as South Africa sits on about 90% of the world’s global platinum group metals reserves – critical for the production of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers,” it said. 
Teco 2030 has signed an agreement with an undisclosed party to cooperate on up to 50 MW of fuel cell projects. “The projects represent marine fuel cells- and on-shore stationary fuel cell systems in megawatt scale,” said the Norwegian company. “The [deal] outlines a three-year cooperation commitment to successfully execute the project objectives.”
AFC Energy has launched a new ammonia cracker platform, with a focus on markets in Europe and Asia. “The ammonia cracker’s modular design and low-cost system architecture makes the cracker readily scalable from small-scale hydrogen production to multi-million tonnes per annum,” said the London-based company. It added that it is in discussions with ship owners, European utilities, OEMs, and industrial scale hydrogen users.
Air Liquide has announced the construction of an industrial-scale ammonia (NH3) cracking pilot plant in the port of Antwerp, Belgium. The authorities have confirmed financial support for the pilot plant, which will be operational by 2024.

The acceptable renewable sources are floating or ground-mounted PV, hydropower, and wind. The projects can be either standalone or grid-connected. The department “intends to procure new electricity generation capacity from IPP to reduce the ongoing and increasing cost of energy and the reliance on electricity from the grid,” according to the tender document.
Prospective providers have until April 18 to submit their offers. Successful projects should be operational for 20 years.
Last December, South Africa’s Eskom kicked off a tender for 36.5 MW/146 MWh of storage. The country has recently introduced a rebate scheme for rooftop PV in an attempt to address the severe load-shedding challenges it has been facing.

They created a three-layer thermal model, a simplified thermal model, an empirical model, and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model. They applied the models to a single 330 W JA Solar module in a floating solar system on Passauna Lake in Brazil, between May 2020 and September 2022. The system has an installed capacity of 130 kW and occupies an area of 1,200 square meters.
The more complex thermal model studied the dynamic behavior of solar cell temperature in three layers of the module: front surface, cell surface, and back surface. The simplified thermal module considered the temperature of the module as a whole. The empirical model calculated the temperature of the back of the module using site data via least-squares regression analysis. The CFD modeling also determined the temperature of the back of the module using the finite element method (FEM).
The results show “a good correlation between the proposed four models and the actual data collected from the site with an [root mean square deviation (RMSD)] in the range of 0.5 C to 4.8 C,” the scientists said. The complex thermal model showed the best fit, with a RMSD of 2.04 C, followed by the empirical model at 2.27 C, the simplified thermal model at 2.89 C, and finally the CFD model at 3.26 C. However, the simplified thermal model showed the best results in terms of following the linear fit line of the module’s actual temperature.
The scientists also compared the efficiency of the floating solar module with ground-mounted systems, as modeled by Sandia National Laboratories. The results show that a maximum of 3% efficiency gain is possible, compared to the ground-mounted Sandia model.
“The effect of the water cooling plays an integral part in the efficiency increase of the [floating PV] module; as the cell temperature goes down due to water proximity, the efficiency increases,” the academics explained.
They shared their findings in “Floating photovoltaic module temperature estimation: Modeling and comparison,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.

The Rome-based company claims it will be Italy’s largest agrivoltaics installation upon completion. The plant will feature bifacial PV modules mounted on trackers, both from undisclosed manufacturers.
Enel is using a “solar-first” approach to solar and agriculture, with electricity generation remaining the main goal. Its approach is designed to retrofit large-scale solar plants to allow crops to grow between the trackers and the panels. Agriculture is integrated into existing solar farms, rather than the other way around, as is often the case in agrivoltaics projects.
“The solar plant we are building in Tarquinia shows that an increase in the use of renewable energy can be harmoniously combined with agricultural activities,” said Salvatore Bernabei, CEO of Enel Green Power. “In fact, this plant will seamlessly integrate with the local area and will host crops, resulting in a positive impact on the environment, the economy, and the local area, as well as helping to reduce Italy’s energy dependency.”
Around 330 employees from local companies will be involved in the construction of the Tarquinia plant. It is scheduled for completion within 13 months.

Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) said this week that its new PVT solar module PX-1 from German manufacturer Sunmaxx PVT has an overall efficiency of 80%.
The module measures 1,750 mm x 1,140 mm x 38 mm and features 108 PERC half-cells in the M10 format. The electrical output is 400 W, which corresponds to an electrical efficiency of about 20%.
The new product has also a thermal output of 1,200 W, which corresponds to a thermal collector efficiency EtaO of 60%. Fraunhofer ISE measured this value under maximum power point (MPP) conditions in full sunlight, at a module temperature of 25 C, and at a wind speed of 0 meters per second.
Fraunhofer ISE has conducted additional tests on real operating scenarios on outdoor and indoor test stands. The measurements showed that the module heats up to a maximum temperature of 30 C in full sunlight. Conventional PV modules reach temperatures of up to 80 C, which reduces their efficiency.

“An unprecedented number” of interconnection requests last year from utility-scale renewables and storage projects “continue to prolong interconnection queue backlogs,” FERC says in a recent report.
Drawing on preliminary data compiled by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, FERC says that about 1,730 GW of utility-scale solar, wind and storage projects are now active in the interconnection queues of transmission system operators. That’s almost 400 GW more than the approximately 1,350 GW reported by Berkeley Lab at the end of 2021.
Solar, wind and storage projects in the interconnection queues make up nearly 94% of the total capacity in the queues, with solar constituting over half of that amount, the report said.
Total capacity in the queues exceeds 1,366 GW of generation, 325 GW of standalone storage, and 159 GW of hybrid storage and generation capacity. Those values including 84 GW of natural gas and 2 GW of coal capacity.
The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has estimated that 24% of the projects seeking interconnection from 2000 to 2020 have subsequently been built, the report said. The PJM grid operator, which serves a larger population than any other grid operator, has projected that 5% of the projects now in its interconnection queue will be built.
The FERC staff report said the costs to interconnect “have grown substantially over time with the cost of broader network upgrades driving nearly all this growth,” and provided the nearby graph from Berkeley Lab. Interconnection costs for solar, wind and storage are higher than for natural gas, the report added.

Hanwha Qcells America has revealed that its solar supplier, Hanwha Advanced Materials Georgia (HAGA), will build a new advanced materials manufacturing facility in Bartow County, Georgia.
HAGA will supply Qcells with encapsulant film ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA), which is the front “foil” on solar modules sandwiching the cells against the backsheet and front glass. There were shortages of EVA in 2022, and by supplying its own EVA foil, Qcells can ensure a steady supply of the material. Qcells said that HAGA will be the only company manufacturing solar EVA in the United States.
HAGA's $147 million investment is expected to create more than 160 full-time jobs, including engineers, line operators with the facility starting production in June 2024.  The facility is critical to supporting Qcells’ plans to develop a fully integrated US solar supply chain.
“The products we make are an important piece of the clean energy supply chain puzzle, and we are excited to meet this need,” said Inhwan Kim, chief executive officer of Hanwha Advanced Materials. “Building our cutting-edge, advanced materials in Georgia will not only create new careers in solar but help bring more affordable, reliable clean energy to customers across the country.”
The announcement comes just two months after Qcells announced plans to invest a historic $2.5 billion in the expansion of its operations, in order to set up a fully integrated solar supply chain production base in Georgia. In what is considered the largest investment in US solar history, the South Korean company – a subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions – is the first company to establish a fully integrated, silicon-based solar supply chain in the United States.

“Heat pumps have been available for many years, but as a technology reserved for those who have their own houses. However, most people live in apartments in densely populated urban areas, where fossil fuel heating has been the go-to solution,” said Qvantum.
Qvantum CEO Fredrik Rosenqvist said the company replaces apartment gas burners with low-temperature local district heating networks, and then combines them with compact heat pumps.
“Our solution makes it possible for European building owners to rapidly switch to fossil-free heating, both in new and old developments,” said Rosenqvist.
The solution includes a pre-plumbed indoor water tank unit and a compressor heat pump module, the QG-6 (M). Qvantum claims that the heat pump can be placed under kitchen sinks, while the water tank can be wall-mounted anywhere in an apartment.
The heat pump has a heating capacity of 6 kW, measures 230 mm x 430 mm x 410 mm, and weighs 30 kg. The hydro unit has a capacity of 145 liters, measures 500 mm x 500 mm x 1,050 mm, and weighs 95 kg.
The Qvantum QG has a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4, according to the company's data sheet. It can purportedly produce hot water up to 70 C. Its seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) for heating water to 35 C is 4.42, while the SCOP for 55 C applications is 3.81.
The solution is based on local low-temperature district heating networks using incoming circuit water of 10 C to 20 C and heat pumps as the energy center.
“The energy in that grid can then be used by the apartment heat pumps, both to provide heating and cooling. Along the circuit, excess heat and cold is harvested, and the energy is recycled to the grid,” said Qvantum.
The new heat pump recently won the ISH Design Plus award. The competition “rewards future-proof products which demonstrate an optimum combination of sustainability, aesthetic appeal and functionality,” according to the ISH Design Plus website.
Qvantum has been producing heat pumps for more than 30 years. It is now building a new factory in Sweden with an annual capacity of 50,000 heat pumps.
