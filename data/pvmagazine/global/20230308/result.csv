“The new rules apply only to power plants connected to the high voltage grid, which in Israel is from 620 kW to 16 MW,” Eitan Parnass, the director of the Green Energy Association of Israel, told pv magazine. “These contracts be closed in a free market environment with no intervention whatsoever from government's entities.”
Only solar developers will be able to take advantage of the new regulatory framework, as wind power projects are still limited by current regulations. Unlike PV arrays, wind projects still benefit from the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme.
Israeli renewables developer Doral Group, meanwhile, has secured its first PPA from real estate company Melisron. The agreement will go into effect in January 2024.
“The amount of electricity consumed by Melisron as part of the transaction represents about 10% of the total green electricity produced by Doral's PV facilities that are expected to connect to the Israeli grid in the next two years, which is approximately 1 GW, with an energy storage capacity of about 1.8 GWh,” the developer said, without providing details.

The team has also developed a multi-source heat pump with Germany-based heating manufacturer Viessmann. The device uses air and geothermal as heat sources.
“In city centers, there is often not enough space to drill boreholes for geothermal probes and the use of outdoor air as a heat source is comparatively inefficient and has a higher noise emission,” Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “The multi-source heat pump system combines the advantages of the two heat sources: outside air and ground. With this combination, a smaller drilling area is achieved yet the high efficiency of a brine heat pump is still achievable.”
The researchers installed the solution in a 160-unit apartment building in Karlsruhe-Durlach, Germany. The system was paired with a peak-load gas boiler and a 60 kW PV system on the building's rooftop.
“To achieve low-CO2 heat generation in these buildings, the heat pumps were designed to have the maximum possible coverage rate with the gas boiler operating correspondingly seldom,” said Fraunhofer.
In the first six months of operation, between February and July 2022, the multi-source heat pump achieved source temperatures of 8 C on average, according to Fraunhofer ISE. Its coefficient of performance (COP) during that period was reportedly 3.2. The gas boiler accounted for 31% of the heat supplied to the building. This “is primarily due to the high-temperature requirements for hygienic domestic hot water,” the research institution claimed. Overall, the retrofit system reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 42%.
“The demonstrator multifamily houses in this project have proven the feasibility of retrofitting multifamily houses with heat pumps and low exergy technologies,” said Manuel Lämmle, a researcher from the University of Freiburg.
“To achieve optimal operation, it is important to consider the given situation, including the heat distribution systems and the amount of space in the heating cellar,” he said. “During the retrofit, it is also essential to perform a hydraulic balance of the heating system and check if flow temperatures can be further reduced, e.g., by replacing individual radiators.”
The project included other technological developments such as hybrid heat pumps, heat pumps with propane as the refrigerant, and high-temperature heat pumps. The other technologies partners included German manufacturers Bosch, Beck+Heun, and Kermi.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/08/topcon-shingle-solar-cell-achieves-22-0-efficiency-via-thermal-laser-separation/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 8, 2023",TOPCon shingle solar cell achieves 22.0% efficiency via thermal laser separation,"Scientists from Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and US-based solar panel maker Solaria have developed a solar cell based on TOPCon technology and shingle design.
“To our best knowledge, this is the first publication dealing with TOPCon shingle solar cells separated by thermal laser separation (TLS) and edge-passivated by the passivated edge technology (PET),” researcher Elmar Lohmüller told pv magazine. “The PET is a proprietary development of Fraunhofer ISE, to address the cutting losses in today‘s half-cut, third-cut, or shingle solar cells, by simple, high-throughput post-processing of singulated cells.”
Fraunhofer ISE filed a patent application back in 2018 and is offering a sampling of the technology for interested partners. Solaria is one of the first industry partners testing post-metallization PET on TOPCon shingle solar cells.
“The PET approach could address a key need of the industry – to mitigate efficiency losses incurred by cell cutting and do so in a cost-effective way,” Ricky Dunbar, a Solaria spokesperson, told pv magazine. “Our cooperation with Fraunhofer ISE has shown that PET can effectively reduce these losses for TOPCon shingle cells at a promising throughput.”
The proposed manufacturing process uses thermal laser separation (TLS) instead of conventional laser scribing and mechanical cleaving (LSMC) for cell singulation. TLS only requires a short initial laser scribe with a cleave laser and water-air aerosol jet to create a starting crack that can then propagate through the wafer in any direction.
“This results in cuts with very smooth edge surfaces,” the scientists explained, noting that TLS was performed via the microDICE laser system developed by Germany's 3D-Micromac.
“The TLS process optimized in this work yields up to 0.2% more efficient shingle cells directly after separation in comparison with shingle cells that have been singulated by LSMC,” the academics said, noting that the cell based on TLS achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.0% “It is shown that TLS can be performed such that no degradation of the surface passivation quality occurs in the vicinity to the dividing line.”
The research team introduced its findings in “TOPCon shingle solar cells: Thermal laser separation and passivated edge technology,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“As we are still in the development phase of an industrial PET tool, valid data for yield ratios of the two approaches for a reliable cost calculation is not sufficiently available, yet,” Lohmüller said. “Nevertheless, PET will add a process step, which to our current knowledge is easily scalable to current throughput demands, thus the demonstrated gain in efficiency has substantial potential to overcompensate the additional cost.”

The installation features 540 W monocrystalline modules and lithium-ion (LiFePO4) batteries from undisclosed manufacturers, a RIC Energy spokesperson told pv magazine. It provides and stores electricity to power two water treatment plants and five water pumping stations in the East African country.
“The water is sourced from Lunyangwa River, treated, and supplied to the population through a reticulated urban water supply system,” the spokesperson said.
The hybrid system will power the supply of water to more than 200,000 people, according to a RIC Energy statement. It is expected to reach an annual power output of 2.2 GWh and avoid 2,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The European Investment Bank fully financed the project, to a total of €2.83 million ($2.99 million).
“The construction of this project, which has made one of Malawi's largest water supply systems self-sufficient in energy, has made a significant contribution to the stability of the local water supply system in a country with an unstable electricity grid and where supply problems and blackouts are common,” RIC Energy said in a statement.
The Spanish company also built a hybrid solar and storage system for a water desalinization plant in Cape Verde in 2021. It is looking at doing similar projects for water supply in other parts of Africa, the spokesperson told pv magazine.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Malawi had an estimated cumulative solar capacity of 142 MW at the end of 2021.

Following the passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), an energized solar industry has started aiming high and envisioning a future in which the United States has a robust domestic energy supply chain. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has published a roadmap to achieve this goal, with a target of 50 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity by 2030.
The United States has been plagued by numerous pressures threatening the supply of solar modules imported from overseas. With decarbonization and climate goals under threat due to this shortage, the United States is now turning to domestic manufacturing to power the energy transition.
“Greatly expanding US PV manufacturing could mitigate global supply chain challenges and lead to tremendous benefits for the climate as well as for US workers, employers and the economy,” said the US Department of Energy (DoE).
The DoE concluded in a study that US production could reach 10 GW in two years, 15 GW in three years, and 25 GW in five years on its path to 50 GW of annual production.
The DoE tracks the nationwide capacity of domestic manufacturing. Where does the United States stack up in relation to its goals? The figures below represent active capacity, which is set to expand dramatically due to numerous investment announcements following the enactment of the IRA.
