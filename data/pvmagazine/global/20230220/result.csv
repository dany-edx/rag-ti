It says charging can be completed in as little as three hours, and the containerized nature of the batteries means they are delivered as fully integrated systems with inverters, HVAC, fire protection, and auxiliary components, all in one unit.
The systems feature lithium-iron phosphate batteries Pylontech US3000 and bidirectional inverters Victron Quattro 48/5000/70/120. For solar input, the maximum array voltage stands as 250 V, the maximum array current at 30 Amp, and the maximum power at 4.9 kWp.
The 30 kVA battery measures 1140 mm X 1450 mm X 1580 mm and weighs 1360 kg. The 60 kVA solution measures 2250 mm X 1300 mm X 2065 mm and weighs 2,700 kg.
The systems can be scaled up as required, which makes them suitable for a range of applications, including events, data centers, refineries, and renewable energy projects. Regardless of the project type, Aggreko works with customers to build contracts with rental periods as short as six months or extend to several years, with a simple monthly or annual fee.
The freshly released 2023 battery lineup forms part of Aggreko’s Greener Upgrades program, which also includes the Fuel Flex 450 kW natural gas generator and Tier 4F diesel generator, which is said to meet the most stringent Environmental Protection Agency  regulations for diesel engines.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/20/effects-of-single-axis-agrivoltaics-systems-on-non-irrigated-grassland/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"FEBRUARY 20, 2023",Impact of single-axis agrivoltaics systems on non-irrigated grassland,"Scientists at Colorado State University are investigating how the redistribution of rainfall and light caused by agrivoltaic systems mounted on single-axis trackers can affect the growth of non-irrigated grassland. The study is part of the Sustainably Colocating Agricultural and Photovoltaic Electricity System (SCAPES) project, funded by the US Department of Agriculture.
“What we found is that on the drip edges of modules, depending on whether you’re tilting to the east or the west when there is a rainfall, you can get somewhere between two to five times the amount of precipitation dumped in one spot,” PhD student Matthew Sturchio told pv magazine. “If you want to quantify that for Colorado, it’s about changing the annual precipitation from 350 mm to 1,200 mm of rain. When you do that, you can really improve the amount of soil moisture that stays throughout the season, instead of letting it evaporate.”
Sturchio and his team are conducting research on Jack’s Solar Garden, a 1.2 MW community solar garden in Boulder, Colorado. The project was installed in 2020 and features more than 3,200 380 W monocrystalline PV modules from Vietnam-based solar manufacturer Boviet Solar. The panels are mounted on single-axis trackers, one-third of them at 2.4 meters height, and the other two-thirds at 1.8 meters.
Colorado has a semi-arid climate, with stronger rainfalls and temperatures around 35 C in the afternoons. Temperatures in the morning are around 22 C. The trackers tilt to the east in the morning, and to the west in the afternoon, following the sun. When it rains, this movement simulates the conditions of large rainfalls on either edge, with more water falling on the west edge due to the higher rainfall volumes in the afternoon.
Consequently, the research team originally expected the west drip edge to show increased grassland productivity. Instead, they found that the east edge, with lower soil moisture, has higher grassland growth.
They placed moisture sensors on the land and found that there is a 40 cm to 60 cm wide strip that benefits from the increased soil moisture from the drip edges. Experiments showed that air temperature and dryness also impact grassland productivity within and outside that strip.
The temperature optimum for the grassland growing at Jack’s Solar Garden is a lot closer to 30 C than it is to the 35 C registered in the afternoons, according to Sturchio. “If you exceed 30 degrees, you are reducing the amount of photosynthesis that can happen for that plant,” he said.
The team found that the lower air temperatures and reduced air dryness in the morning compensate for lower soil moisture, leading to increased productivity in the east edge.
 

The shading provided by the solar arrays also proved to increase productivity.
“Typically, you’d imagine that grassland is adapted to deal with really high light for the entire day,” said Sturchio. “But we found that if you shade for half of the day with the solar array, it improves photosynthetic efficiency. You have higher rates of photosynthesis when the sun is available because you have a shorter photoperiod,” he explained.
Moreover, shorter photoperiod results in less evapotranspiration from the leaves, reducing the amount of water loss. This could prove crucial in keeping grassland productivity during periods of drought, according to Sturchio. The team hopes to test the hypothesis if Colorado experiences a drought period in the future.
The installation at Jack’s Solar Garden is designed to maximize electricity production, without much space between panel rows. The team found that the soil outside the east or west edge strip behaves more like the space between panel rows, and the conditions between the two strips are more similar to the conditions directly underneath the solar arrays.
They also observed that the leaves of plants under the solar arrays are 4 C cooler. “There are a lot of plants that can benefit from this lower temperature in the middle of summer in Colorado,” said Sturchio.
Overall, the present design leads to 9% less grass production, mainly attributed to the space directly under the solar array. The economic gains from electricity production vastly compensate for the slightly lower crop production, according to Sturchio.
“But if we space the solar arrays out to 15 meters apart, then you get a 6% increase in productivity in a wet year,” he claimed.
Going forward, the SCAPES project aims to develop agrivoltaics in degraded agro-ecosystems.
The team believes that their understanding of the effects of single-axis agrivoltaic systems on rainfall and light redistribution and consequent impacts on crop productivity can help to restore land degraded by overgrazing, agriculture practice, and water scarcity.

The country’s cumulative installed capacity hit 14.3 GW across more than 1.2 million installations, up 4% from December 2021.
Rooftop installations for microgeneration projects below 4 kW in size accounted for most of the growth, with 288.6 MW of new capacity at the end of December 2022. Cumulative microgeneration capacity hit 3,169.1 MW, from 2,880.5 MW in 2021 and 2,764.1 MW in 2020. The UK Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) said that 130,596 PV systems were installed in UK homes last year, up 115% from 2021 and marking the highest level of annual deployment since 2015.
Large-scale installations between 5 MW and 25 MW have grown by just 23 MW since 2021. This segment’s cumulative capacity was 4,358.5 MW at the end of 2022, 4,335.5 MW in 2021, and 4,320.5 MW in 2020. The country did not add any PV installations above 25 MW in size in 2022, leaving cumulative capacity at 1,728.7 MW since 2021. In 2020, the figure was 1,653.7 MW.
In December 2022, 50 MW of new installations were added across all segments.
“The number of new installations is the lowest seen in the past four months, with many projects likely delayed due to the Christmas and new year period,” the government said. “The figure for deployment within the latest month should always be taken as highly provisional – it is likely to be revised as further data are received on newly operational sites.”
At the end of September 2022, 55% of the UK’s total capacity, or 7,739 MW, came from ground-mounted arrays or standalone solar installations. This includes two operational solar farms accredited on contracts for difference, according to the government.

Lewis bases are generally used in perovskite solar research to passivate surface defects in the perovskite layer. This has positive effects on energy level alignment, interfacial recombination kinetics, hysteresis behavior, and operational stability.
“Lewis basicity, which is inversely proportional to electronegativity, is expected to determine the binding energy and the stabilization of interfaces and grain boundaries,” the scientists said, noting that the molecules proved to be highly efficient in creating strong bonding between the cell layers at the interface level. “A Lewis base molecule with two electron-donating atoms can potentially bind and bridge interfaces and ground boundaries, offering the potential to enhance the adhesion and strengthen the mechanical toughness of perovskite solar cells.”
The scientists used a diphosphine Lewis base molecule known as 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino) propane (DPPP) to passivate one of the most promising halide perovskites – the formamidinium lead iodide known as FAPbI3 – for use in a cell's absorber layer.

They deposited the perovskite layer on a DPPP-doped hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx). They observed that some DPPP molecules redissolved and segregated at both the perovskite/NiOx interface and the perovskite surface regions, and that the crystallinity of the perovskite film improved. They said this step enhanced the mechanical toughness of the perovskite/NiOx interface.
The researchers built the cell with a substrate made of glass and tin oxide (FTO), the HTL based on NiOx, a layer of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) as the hole-transport layer, the perovskite layer, a thin layer of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60), a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, and a metal contact made of silver (Ag).
The team compared the performance of the DPPP-doped solar cell with a reference device that didn't go through the treatment. The doped cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V and a fill factor of 82%. The undoped device reached an efficiency of 22.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V and a fill factor of 79%.
“The improvement on fill factor and open-circuit voltage confirmed the reduction in defect density at the NiOx /perovskite front interface after DPPP treatment,” the scientists said.
The researchers also built a doped cell with an active area of 1.05 cm2 that achieved a power conversion efficiency of up to 23.9% and showed no degradation after 1,500 h.
“With DPPP, under ambient conditions – that is, no additional heating – the overall power conversion efficiency of the cell stayed high for approximately 3,500 hours,” said researcher Chongwen Li. “The perovskite solar cells that have been previously published in the literature tend to see a significant drop in their efficiency after 1,500 to 2,000 hours, so this is a big improvement.”
The group, which recently applied for a patent for the DPPP technique, presented the cell tech in “Rational design of Lewis base molecules for stable and efficient inverted perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science. The team includes academics from the University of Toronto in Canada, as well as scientists from the University of Toledo, the University of Washington, and Northwestern University in the United States.

The New York Power Authority (NYPA) has unveiled a 50 kW/250 kWh demonstration system at its offices in White Plains, New York, featuring a cell-isolating technology from Cadenza Innovation, a Connecticut-based company.
The project is demonstrating peak energy demand shaving to reduce the peak electricity load in commercial buildings. The pilot project will also help advance New York State’s nation-leading climate and clean energy goals, including Governor Kathy Hochul’s recently announced plans for a framework to achieve 6 GW of energy storage resources by 2030.
Following an April 2019 battery fire at Arizona Public Service’s McMicken site in Surprise, Arizona, states such as New York have adopted stringent requirements for lithium-ion battery installations.
Cadenza’s SuperCell is produced with funding assistance from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and is designed with fire safety in mind. The battery technology prevents thermal runaway, meaning a malfunction in the cell is isolated to that one cell and is not expected to propagate into surrounding cells that make up the battery in the event of overheating or fire. The supercell’s safety feature enables energy storage systems to be installed into more densely populated urban areas.
The Cadenza battery system was developed in collaboration with Hitachi Energy to highlight the role of energy storage in enhancing demand management and grid flexibility.  The battery project is projected to serve as a model for integrating low-cost, high-performance and thermally safe renewable energy resources into the grid.
“This initial testing phase shows the potential for this type of battery energy storage system to serve as a model for managing energy demands and lowering costs for owners of commercial and industrial buildings,” said NYPA CEO Justin Driscoll. “The unit is reducing peak loads at the Power Authority’s main offices, smoothing electricity network operations and showing a safety advantage by demonstrating a reduction in the potential of thermal runaway.
Cadenza’s battery is U.S. Department of Defense tested UL compliant. The SuperCell’s design bolsters grid resilience and powers a range of uses in the commercial and industrial market. By packaging components to lower costs and increase safety, the battery is designed to reduce the need for additional fire safety protection and mitigation systems, resulting in improved energy density and advanced lithium-ion systems.
Under New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), the state has pledged to generate 70% of its power resources from renewable energy by 2030 and become net zero by 2040. Hochul recently proposed expanding New York State’s energy storage programs to double the goal to 6 GW by 2030, which represents at least 20% of the state’s peak electricity load.
BloombergNEF (BNEF) says the global energy storage market will increase 15-fold by 2030 and “expects batteries to dominate the market at least until the 2030s, in large part due to their price competitiveness, established supply chain and significant track record.” BNEF’s Helen Kou recently told pv magazine USA that 54 GW of Inflation Reduction Act-driven storage will lift the U.S. to 112 GW/396 GWh this decade.  BNEF’s post-IRA forecast includes 2.5 GW of added storage capacity in New York through 2030 that would have not been added without IRA incentives such as the standalone storage ITC credit.
Founded in 2012, Cadenza Innovation has raised $15.5 million in growth funding to date from investors that include Turtle & Hughes, an electrical contractor, the US Department of Energy, Kestrel Holdings, Golden Seeds, Toba Group, and private investors.

The US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) monthly update of capacity additions shows that the energy transition is well underway. Across the United States, projects listed as actively under construction total more than 25.4 GW in capacity. This adds to the 107.5 GW of existing solar on the US grid that exists today, as reported by the EIA. 
Small-scale solar projects of 1 MW or less total an estimated 39.5 GW nationwide, while utility-scale projects above that threshold total nearly 68 GW, reports EIA. There are currently 366 utility-scale projects actively being built across the United States as of the most recent EIA data release. The average size of these projects is 69 MW. Of this total, 166 projects are listed as 50% complete or more, adding 10.2 GW of capacity. 
The largest project under construction is Gemini Solar, developed by Primergy, a Quinbrook Infrastructure company. This project will add 690 MW to the Nevada grid once complete. The next seven largest projects are all located in Texas, averaging 405 MW in capacity.  
Texas is a dominant state for utility-scale solar project construction, with 28 projects totaling 6.7 GW in capacity, with about 240 MW as an average project size. The state’s largest active project is 500 MW. 
Florida is making significant headway in the utility-scale project construction space. Just under 5 GW of capacity is currently being installed across 68 projects, averaging 73.4 MW in size. Notably, project designs are very uniform in Florida, with 65 of these projects ranging from 74 MW to 75 MW in capacity. 
California follows with 3.2 GW of projects actively under construction, with a greater emphasis on distributed projects. EIA reports 45 projects underway with an average nameplate capacity of 75 MW. The state’s largest active project is 300 MW. 
Another 1.96 GW of projects nationwide have been fully constructed and are awaiting final approvals to reach commercial operation. There are 48 projects that fall into this bucket, averaging 41 MW in capacity. Eight of these projects are 1 MW solar facilities in Minnesota, a market known for its standout performance in community solar projects of this size. 
Solar energy is now in the center stage of the US plans for a decarbonized economy, representing 70% of high-probability utility-scale power capacity planned through 2025.   
Solar’s rise to the top as a key energy resource now seems inevitable, but its fate was not always sealed. The technology contributed a negligible amount of power less than ten years ago, and the EIA did not begin reporting annual net generation of PV until 2014. In that year, solar contributed 27 TWh of electricity to the U.S. grid. Seven short years later, it generated 164 TWh in 2021, multiplying generation six times over. 
This progress has been made possible by supportive industrial policy, economies of scale, improved technological efficiencies, and business innovations. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) has fallen over the years, and the benefits of solar and energy storage become more crystalized as the threats of climate change increase with the passing years. 
Looking ahead, project construction is expected to continue to accelerate. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures and calls for a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. Princeton University released a Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT) in collaboration with Dartmouth College, Evolved Energy Research, and Carbon Impact Consulting, outlining the potential impact of the law. 
The impact on the US solar industry could be huge, to say the least. The Princeton report said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said Princeton. 
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The IRA would lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the report.

Shell has committed approximately AUD 580,000 ($400,000) to MGA Thermal to help finance the construction of a 5 MWh thermal energy storage pilot project. It aims to showcase the potential of the Australian company’s technology to store large amounts of energy as heat over long periods.
The company is commercializing a “miscibility gap alloy” approach to thermal energy storage. It stores heat in blocks made of aluminum and graphite, and dispatches it to generate electricity.
MGA’s patented thermal energy storage blocks, about the size of a large house brick, consist of small alloy particles embedded within graphite-based blocks enclosed in a fully insulated system. Once heated, the alloy particles can store heat for days with minimal energy loss. Heat exchangers are used a transfer gas to absorb heat from the blocks, with the heated gas or fluid suitable for industrial heat applications or to drive a steam turbine to generate electricity.
The technology has the potential to be a cost-effective, medium-duration storage technology due to its high energy density, low energy degradation, modular design and low cost. Shell’s money will support the creation of the demonstration plant at MGA’s new factory in Tomago, New South Wales. The unit has a planned storage capacity of 5 MWh, with charging and discharging at up to 500 kW for 10 hours.
MGA Chief Operating Officer Mark Croudace said the project, which is expected to go online this year, will produce valuable performance data. He claimed that it will “provide a tangible demonstration” of the technology for customers.
“Our technology is attractive for those looking to decarbonise, with a high potential impact in the medium- to long-duration energy storage sector,” he said. “Shell’s funding, in conjunction with [Australian Renewable Energy Agency], allows us to accelerate our pilot, going live in 2023, gather additional data about our technology, and continue our rapid growth into commercial industrial and power markets.”
Shell is just the latest to back MGA’s technology, with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency providing AUD 1.27 million to help finance the pilot unit. Australia’s largest electricity generator, AGL Energy, has also shown an interest, linking with MGA to investigate the technical and financial feasibility of using thermal batteries to provide the steam for a 200 MW turbine at the Torrens Island Power Plant in South Australia.
