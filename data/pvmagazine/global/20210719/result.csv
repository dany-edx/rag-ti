Spanish PV production equipment provider Mondragon Assembly has designed a new interconnection machine for the production of different kinds of technologies, including half-cut products, glass-glass and glass-backsheet panels, as well as mono or bifacial PERC, PERL and PERT modules.
The equipment is also claimed to be suitable for the production of modules that incorporate BIPV technologies and modules with high-efficiency cell technology, such as heterojunction (HJT) or TOPCon.
In terms of cell dimensions, this new machine is compatible with any cell size on the market, including M10 (182mm) and M12 (210mm) cells.
Mondragon Assembly states that this new machine is capable of interconnecting an unlimited number of ribbons or threads, with a cycle of 120 modules per hour, a non-stop autonomy of more than eight hours and an overall ‘uptime' of 99%. Other features are precise welding and zero breakage rate, no manual operations, and easy integration with the Manufacturing Execution System (MES), which is an information system that connects, monitors and controls complex manufacturing systems and data flows on the factory floor.
The company said it offers its clients “comprehensive support throughout the life of their business, providing specialized advice on new and future technologies.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/19/china-added-13-gw-of-solar-to-the-end-of-june/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"JULY 19, 2021",China added 13 GW of solar to the end of June,"China’s National Energy Administration has announced solar power generation capacity in the nation hit 268 GW at the end of last month, marking a 23.7% rise from the volume deployed at the same point last year.
The government body said 13.01 GW of solar capacity was added in the first half of the year with 5.86 GW of it accounted for by residential arrays which qualified for government subsidy.
The solar figures are higher than expected given the rise in photovoltaic product prices caused in recent months by a global shortage of solar panel raw material polysilicon, and mark the biggest volume of first-half additions in three years, since Beijing announced, in June 2018, a plan to taper down subsidy support in a bid for the technology to hit grid parity with conventional electricity generation.
That major policy shift saw 11.65 GW of solar added in China in the first half of 2019 and 10.15 GW in the same period of last year.
Solar industry analysts will have noted the 292 GW of wind power generation capacity reached in China by the end of June marked an even more impressive year-on-year increase, of 34.7%, for the renewable energy technology, as the nation's overall power generation fleet grew 9.5%, to 2.26 TW.
Industry observers fear the focus at the highest level has shifted to wind power to deliver China's national zero-carbon ambition, due to the recent price rises in the photovoltaics supply chain.
However, the polysilicon price appears to have stopped rising and downstream solar wafer and cell prices have begun to retreat, offering hope for solar installation figures in the current half of the year.

Much of the research that’s underway into improving today’s battery technologies is focused on working with new materials, also keeping in supply chain and environmental concerns related to several commonly investigated materials. But whatever material is used, sophisticated new techniques allowing scientists to observe mechanisms at work within the battery in minute detail will be essential to understanding where the issues that hold back performance are occurring, and how to get around them.
Two separate studies published in the past month have used such techniques to examine the role of oxygen in lithium-ion battery performance. It was already known that as the battery charges and discharges, tiny amounts of oxygen are released. But the tiny scale of this process makes it difficult to observe, and the wider effects of oxygen loss are not well understood. “The total amount of oxygen leakage, over 500 cycles of battery charging and discharging, is 6%,” explained Peter Csernica, a scientist at Stanford University who worked on one of the studies. “That’s not such a small number, but if you try to measure the amount of oxygen that comes out during each cycle, it’s about one one-hundredth of a percent.”
In the study led by Stanford University, the group sliced open battery electrodes after cycling and scanned samples using an x-ray microscope; and combined this with computational imaging to observe the structure at the nanoscale. They also shot x-rays through whole electrodes, to confirm that their observations at the nanoscale could be applied to the full component. Results of this analysis have been published in Nature Energy. The group found that oxygen is initially released in a ‘burst’ from the surface, and then a slower ‘trickle’ from deeper inside the cathode.
And they found that the release of oxygen fundamentally alters the structure of the cathode: “When oxygen leaves, surrounding manganese, nickel and cobalt atoms migrate. All the atoms are dancing out of their ideal positions. This rearrangement of metal ions, along with chemical changes caused by the missing oxygen, degrades the voltage and efficiency of the battery over time,” explained Stanford associate professor William Chueh. “People have known aspects of this phenomenon for a long time, but the mechanism was unclear.”
In a separate study, published in Advanced Energy Materials, scientists led by Japan’s Tohoku University found that, in a cathode based on equal amounts of nickel, cobalt, and manganese the oxygen release facilitates several unwanted reactions that deteriorate the battery structure, and that the presence of highly valent nickel in the cathode led to higher levels of oxygen release, and that the process overall reduces the battery’s ability to hold a balanced charge (valence is a measure of an element's capacity to combine with other atoms).
“Our findings will contribute to the further development of high energy density and robust next-generation batteries composed of transition metal oxides,” said Tohoku University researcher Takashi Nakamura.
By highlighting the role played by oxygen in battery degradation and confirming that it may be a more important piece of the puzzle than previously thought, both of these studies promise to provide the basis for future work that takes into account, or even focuses on, limiting the loss of oxygen during cycling and the damaging effects this has on the battery.

The two testing facilities are part of the Rolling Solar project, which is aimed at developing new large scale, solar-equipped noise barriers and retrofitting existing noise barriers with PV technology, while also assessing the costs of this emerging technology.
One of the two installations, which is 13m wide and 5m high, is still under construction but is already being used for its first measurements. It is located at EnergyVille's Thor Park in Genk, is south-oriented and is currently hosting solar panels relying on three different cell technologies: monocrystalline PERC modules; thin-film panels based on cadmium-telluride (CdTe); and solar modules made of copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS), which were provided by Dutch consortium TNO/Solliance. All the panels are equipped with power optimizers from Israel-based inverter and storage system maker Solaredge.
“It won’t be long before the remaining eight meters of noise barrier will be realized by our new project partner Group Ceyssens, a developer and producer of windows,” EnergyVille said in a statement. “This section will consist of metal frames, in which CdTe and CIGS-solar-cell modules, and bifacial crystalline silicon PERC solar cell modules, are slid.”
The modeling for the energy yield was developed by imec scientists. It is expected to provide data on frequent shadowing caused by clouds and passing cyclists or cars, as well as efficiency and stability data related to solar module power generation. “SolarEdge’s power optimizers have a sample time of about 10 minutes,” EnergyVille further explained. “We want it to be one minute or less.”

Solar noise barriers are described as an ideal solution for Belgium, which has land and policy constraints for the deployment of ground-mounted PV. These barriers, however, should still have the primary function of reducing noise, and include some transparent sound-absorbing material placed over the solar panel. The material used so far, EnergyVille explained, has caused a 30% loss in energy yield on modules tested in the laboratory. “Construction and infrastructure company Habenu-van de Kreeke, the project partner that installed the pilot plant in Genk, is, therefore, now working on the development of new translucent material, together with a subcontractor,” it also stated.
The consortium is now in talks with the City of Antwerp and Bruxelles Environnement, the public service responsible for the environment and energy in the Brussels-Capital region, for the potential deployment of new noise barriers.
The same group of research institutes has already developed a pilot PV-integrated noise barrier together with Netherlands-headquartered construction firm Heijmans, which has a plan to build a total of 68 solar noise barriers in its homeland. “The test set-up is 12m wide. A total of five cassettes of 1m high each, in which solar cell modules are incorporated, are stacked on a concrete plinth,” EnergyVille said. “The two lower ones contain two-sided crystalline silicon solar cell modules. The upper one is equipped with thin-film CdTe solar cell modules [and] the middle two with double-sided thin-film CIGS solar cell modules.”
Prior to this project, Heijmans participated in a field study that demonstrated that the use of solar noise barriers on roads and railways could be an effective way to generate electricity.

That initial price – in a system which at its outset was applied to around 2,000 designated electricity power enterprises according to the state-owned Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange (initialized to CNEEEX) which will temporarily oversee the process – was around 28% higher than the average cost of carbon determined by previous pilot schemes in seven provinces and municipalities but much lower than the European level of around €50/ton.
CNEEEX said the energy companies included in the initial round of the new system account for more than 4 billion metric tons of carbon emissions annually, around 40% of China's total.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry as one of our quarterly themes. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The Shanghai-based energy exchange will temporarily oversee the carbon market until the formation of a dedicated body pledged by China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) when it issued executive law Regulations for Carbon Emission Trading, in December. The regulations took effect in February.
A press conference about the trading scheme, held in Beijing by the information office of the China State Council last week, said the emissions trading scheme would be expanded over the course of the current five-year plan to include emission-intensive industries including steel, cement, petroleum, chemistry and building materials. The 14th five-year plan runs until 2025 and the MEE is working on the emissions standards of such industries, and a quota allocation scheme, with that aim in mind, it was added.
China has operated pilot carbon trading schemes in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, and Shenzhen, with the first having started operations in October 2011. Those programs incorporated more than 3,000 entities from 20 carbon-intensive industries including electricity generation, steel, and cement. Central government statistics indicate those forerunner programs to Friday's national scheme had traded certificates related to 480 million tons of carbon to the end of June, with turnover of around RMB11.4 billion (€1.49 billion).
The country has opened the national carbon market to help it reach its stated goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, and delivered on a promise made by president Xi Jinping in a climate summit in April.
Zhao Yingmin, deputy minister of the MEE, has stated in local media that “China is also actively participating [in] the discussion of Article VI of the Paris Agreement, to promote the construction of the global carbon market mechanism under the Paris Agreement,” and the opening of the national emissions trading scheme took place a day after the EU had fleshed out plans for its proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM).
The CBAM plan would see the importers of goods made outside the EU forced to purchase carbon allowances, at prices set by Europe's emission trading scheme, to offset the embedded carbon footprints of the imports. It is expected the effectiveness of non-EU carbon trading schemes would be taken into account when assessing whether the carbon emissions baked into the production of imported goods had already been accounted for.
The European Commission is proposing mandatory tracking of the carbon footprint of imported goods from 2023-25 with carbon allowance offsetting to be introduced from 2026.

German start-up Sax Power GmbH is offering a residential AC battery it says works entirely without an inverter and has 50% more capacity and service life than conventional batteries.
According to its specifications, the battery stores direct current and can deliver both alternating current and direct current. The conversion is not carried out by transistors such as IGBTs or MOSFETs, but via the software of the battery management system. By interconnecting with cascaded H-bridges, the cell blocks can be controlled individually. That enables the system to build a sinusoidal curve typical of alternating current from the individual DC voltage values. It also increases efficiency, since the conversion is purely electronic. Sax states the efficiency of its solution is 99%. The option of plugging the battery into a main socket is a further innovation, according to the company.
Sax Power said, in this type of device the current is measured by folding current transformers. That means no cables have to be disconnected in a household network. In addition, a second current measurement of the same type is carried out on the feeding line to the house. The battery then receives the information it needs for optimal use, via wireless communication units.
The manufacturer said some performance can be lost with the plug-in device, which has a nominal power output of 3.7 kW. The standard product, without the plug-in, has an output of 4.6 kW.
The battery comes with lithium iron phosphate cells and the capacity of the basic model is 5.2 kWh but it can be expanded with extra modules to 15.6 kWh. The nominal current is 20 A, or 16 A with the plug-in installation.
The company offers a 10-year guarantee for the device, which weighs 52kg and is said to be easier for installers to mount as they do not have to handle an inverter.
In May, the product received a German Innovation Award and Sax Power said it will be on display in October at the EES storage fair held alongside The Smarter E trade event. The developer said its product has qualified as a finalist for the EES Award at this year's show.
A price for the product can be found on the Sax Power website. The basic version is listed as costing €5,079. In a version with wireless communication and a better smart meter, the device costs €5,210. It will be sold in series from autumn.

The European commissioner for economy, Paolo Gentiloni, on Thursday held a press conference about the EU's proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) – which would levy charges on non-EU products in relation to their embedded carbon footprint – and about a planned revision of the taxes applied to energy generation.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
Commissioner Gentiloni said the long-trailed CBAM would initially require importers of goods into the EU to report on the embedded carbon footprint of the products in question, from 2023-25, without having to pay any associated cost. Importers would, however, have to purchase certificates to offset the carbon represented by the imported goods from 2026 onwards, under the European Commission proposal, with the weekly prices of the carbon allowances set by a beefed-up EU emissions trading scheme.
The commissioner dismissed claims the CBAM would amount to protectionism by indicating the regime would be specifically linked to individual imported goods rather than to their countries of origin.
The former Italian prime minister also outlined the planned changes to the bloc's Energy Tax Directive, the rates of which, he said, have been unchanged since 2003.
Commenting on the fact electricity is taxed by volume, without regard to the sustainability or otherwise of the power or the fuel used, Commissioner Gentiloni said the rates “do not reflect the actual energy content or environmental performance of the energy sources covered. They lead to pollutant fuels being taxed less than their cleaner alternatives, which of course makes no sense. In short, the current rules are completely out of synch with our green ambitions.”
Under the proposed reform of the directive, a new tax regime would set minimum taxation rates for different types of electricity generation and fuel use, reflecting environmental performance and energy efficiency. It would then be down to EU member states to tax the most environmentally harmful fuels the most, said Gentiloni, with exemptions to the minimum rates only available to the most sustainable sources of energy.
The new regime would list more energy products and uses which have emerged since 2003 and the commissioner said the mandatory exemption from taxation of kerosene in aviation, and of oil used in shipping, would be lifted, with sustainable alternatives in both sectors to instead be exempted from tax for ten years.
Gentiloni said the proposed taxation reform would give member states “in-built possibilities” to mitigate any resulting rise in costs for lower-income households.

The Mexican government plans to develop what it claims will be Latin America's largest PV plant. The array will be built in Puerto Penasco, in the state of Sonora – one of the world's best regions for solar power generation.
The project was initially announced by the CEO of the country's power utility, CFE, Manuel Bartlett Díaz, and Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador. They have claimed that the solar facility will be Latin America's largest solar park and the eighth biggest in the world. Currently, Mexico's largest operational PV project is the 750 MW Villanueva plant, built by Italian utility Enel in 2016.
Last week, the governor of Sonora, Alfonso Durazo, said the project would require an investment of approximately $2 billion, with construction to proceed in several phases. He did not provide any details on project financing, but a private-public partnership is likely, given that the Obrador government has always opposed the idea of giving sole permission to build power assets to private investors.
The plant is expected to occupy a surface area of around 2,000 hectares. Construction will also entail the deployment of a new connection line. The project is part of an overall plan by CFE to modernize its power assets and distribution system.
CFE is currently also developing two PV projects with a combined capacity of 350 MW in the state of Baja California. It has only turned to solar in recent times, after having opposed energy reforms introduced by the Pena Nieto government in 2013. Through these reforms, which introduced a successful auction scheme for renewables, several gigawatts of solar power were deployed throughout the country, including 11 large-scale solar plants in Sonora.
In March 2019, CFE said it had decided not to resume auction tenders for renewable energy. In May 2020, Mexico’s National Energy Control Center (CENACE) imposed new restrictions on renewable energy deployment, citing the need to protect energy security during the Covid-19 pandemic. The provisions halted grid connections for new solar and wind power projects until further notice.

Gujarat-based Rayzon Solar has announced that it is expanding its module production capacity to 1.5 GW with the addition of a new line.
The manufacturer will add a 1.2 GW mono PERC (passivated emitter and rear contact) line to its existing 300 MW state-of-the-art facility in Gujarat. The capacity additions will be finished by the end of December.
Rayzon Solar’s facility is equipped with an automated stringer and laminator. It has the capacity to produce 335 Wp polycrystalline panels and 400 Wp monocrystalline modules.
Kamlesh Gohil, international business development head at Rayzon Solar, told pv magazine that the new 1.2 GW production line will be equipped to produce mono PERC solar panels with wafer sizes up to 220 mm. It will have the capacity to produce 600 Wp panels with efficiency ratings of 21.4%. 
“It will change the industry scenario and help to get the maximum output from a small area for big-scale PV projects,” said Gohil.
The new production line will be equipped with the latest technology, including a half-cut cell bussing system with a multi-busbar stringer from Wuxi Lead.
Rayzon Solar now joins the list of Indian manufacturers embracing mono PERC technology, in line with the global trend and rising domestic demand for such panels.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/19/serial-inventor-aims-to-change-pv-value-chain-by-addressing-heat/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 19, 2021",Serial inventor aims to change PV value chain by addressing heat,"From pv magazine USA
It happens every day: A bird flies over your rooftop solar panel array and deposits an unwelcome offering on a cell. The bird dropping is an annoyance that needs to be cleaned off. But it also can result in a hot spot on the affected cell, impacting the entire panel’s output and potentially affecting its long-term performance.
The phenomenon is known as reverse bias and the hot spot that is its hallmark is something of an Achilles' heel for the solar industry. That’s because a single cell weakened by a bird dropping or a leaf shadow can be overpowered by stronger cells that surround it. Those neighboring cells send a reverse flow through the weaker cell, causing it to experience temperatures that can exceed 400 F (204.4 C) and operate at voltages in excess of 20 times those of forward voltages.
All of that leads to cell stress, premature aging, and the increased likelihood of a module’s total failure.
A serial inventor, Kent Kernahan, first began to tackle the problem more than a decade ago. His solution was to design a control technology that detects reverse bias and redirects current away from the affected cell and through the rest of the otherwise healthy solar panel. He went on to create a company, IdealPV, to develop the technology.
And here’s where things get even more interesting: He also established a business model that could help disadvantaged communities all across the United States, by making the technology available to non-profit entities set up under Section 501(c)3 of the U.S. tax code. The first such nonprofit to start manufacturing IdealPV solar cells is now getting underway in California. More on that in a bit.
Call for help
At its core, the control technology that Kernahan developed watches for a signal that the weakened cell sends out as it begins to overheat. The control system uses that signal to throttle back the affected cell, redirect current across the panel, and ease the onset of a reverse bias event.
“The breakthrough allows us to anticipate reverse bias” and act to alleviate the emerging hot spot, Kernahan told pv magazine in a recent interview.
IdealPV’s solar panel technology is based on what Kernahan refers to as the Law of Forward Only Zero Hot Spot (FOZHS). Derived from the First Law of Thermodynamics and the Law of the Photoelectric effect, FOZHS lays out that the conductance of a solar cell falls as its voltage becomes more negative. The company’s solar panels make practical use of this insight to keep the conductance of each solar cell high and prevent any of them from being subjected to the reverse (negative) voltage that drives extreme heat into the cell.
In and of itself, that’s a useful advancement in cell design. But Kernahan sees broader implications for his innovation across the cell manufacturing value chain. Because most modules are designed to manage wide variations in temperatures across very small intervals, everything from glass to adhesion and backsheeting is designed to handle temperature extremes.
By addressing reverse bias and the resulting heat, Kernahan and IdealPV moved to unwind and rethink the entire module manufacturing process. For example, without the need of bypass diodes and busbars, it becomes practical to put more, shorter cells in series. This reduces internal cell and panel currents and increases internal panel voltage. In turn, this allows for cells with corner chips, local AR defects, and cracks to be used. Such cells typically are a fraction the cost of cells without defects.
The ability to remove heat-related design parameters “dumbs down the manufacturing requirements,” Kerhahan said, making for a “very forgiving manufacturing process.”
And that opens the door for what Kernahan and others hope will be a nationwide network of nonprofit solar module manufacturing facilities. By making use of provisions within the U.S. tax code, a group known as Community Home Energy Retrofit Project (CHERP) is working with individual and corporate investors whose focus is not on shareholder returns and maximizing profits, but on an underlying social mission to work in disadvantaged communities and expand solar’s adoption among low- and moderate-income people.
The first factory dedicated to IdealPV solar cell production opened in Claremont, California, earlier this year. Made possible in part by $2.1 million from the California state budget, the factory is waiting on certifications for its solar panel from the National Testing Laboratories. Once those certifications are in hand, CHERP will start to hire with a goal of producing its first modules later this year.
The factory will create around 200 jobs, with entry-level warehouse and installation workers paid between $16 and $20 per hour. Each panel produces around 330KWh a year through its expected 25-year production life. Each will cost about $160 to build  and take around 45 minutes to assemble. The plant will be able to produce up to 105,000 panels a year or enough for about 6,000 typical Southern California households. The switch to solar is projected to save those residents a combined $6.5 million in energy costs yearly.
Once the first facility is up and running, the plan is to replicate the template nationwide and help other community-based nonprofit groups to create manufacturing jobs and deploy solar. Talks are under way with a substance abuse recovery facility in West Virginia, a green sustainability initiative in Michigan, and a gang rehabilitation and re-entry program in Los Angeles.
The initial goal of taking the heat out of solar panels could lead to the emergence of a non-profit-based solar manufacturing sector, Kernahan said. “We want to bring back middle-class employment and manufacturing,” he added.

Maxeon's new Performance 3 AC solar PV module is the second product in its AC portfolio, following the introduction of the Maxeon 5 AC panel in late 2020. The new panel will be sold in Australia through authorized installation dealers under the SunPower brand, starting in the third quarter.
While technical details about the new Performance 3 AC panel remain scant, it is available in four versions, with power outputs ranging from 370 W to 385 W, efficiency ratings ranging from 18.9% to 19.6%, and a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V. It measures 1,690 mm × 1,160 mm × 35 mm, including the frame, and weighs 22.2 kg.
The new product is based on monocrystalline PERC cells. It is fitted with an Enphase IQ 7A microinverter and features tempered glass with an anti-reflective coating, as well as an anodized aluminum frame.
The module can be used in operating temperatures ranging from -40 C and 60 C, with an operating temperature coefficient of -0.34% per degree Celsius. It comes with a 25-year limited performance and product guarantee. The maximum annual degradation is said to be 0.45% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.2% of the nominal output power.
The company said the new panel offers installers more efficient installations, simplified logistics, and more flexible system designs.
Maxeon Solar Technologies Chief Executive Jeff Walters said that the panel provides residential customers with a system that can be designed to maximize power output.
He said the AC architecture also provides the flexibility to expand the solar system as energy needs evolve, accommodating electric vehicle charging, AC storage, and the electrification of home appliances.
“Today’s customers are increasingly demanding, they expect top quality and peace of mind from their solar systems,” Walters said, noting that there has been strong demand for the Maxeon 5 AC panels in Australia.
Keera Single, CEO of Australian solar power provider Solargain, said the AC modules have enjoyed early success in Australia.
“SunPower AC Energy Solutions offer a unique solution to customers who may have not been qualified for a conventional string system, so it’s a great opportunity for us to reach new customers,” she said.
