The two companies said in a joint statement that they are currently conducting a feasibility study for the project, which is the world's largest heat pump ever planned to date.
“The planned large-scale heat pump will enable production of steam using electricity from renewable energy, tapping waste heat from the cooling water system at BASF as a source of thermal energy,” the statement reads. “The residual heat in the water will be processed using compression to produce steam that will be fed into the site’s steam network.”
According to Basf, its industrial site in Ludwigshafen has a annual steam demand of 20 million MT. ” By integrating the planned heat pump into the site’s production infrastructure, up to 150 metric tons of steam can be produced per hour, equivalent to a thermal output of 120 megawatts,” the company said. “At the same time, it would make the cooling water system more efficient and less dependent on climate and weather conditions.”
Basf utilizes steam at the site to dry products, heat up reactors, and distilling. Currently, this demand is covered by heat coming from different production facilities located at the site, as well as gas and steam power plants.
The project is aimed at helping the two companies in gaining experience in the use of industrial-scale heat pumps and to assess the applicability of similar projects at other sites. “The feasibility study’s findings with regard to the economic viability, efficiency and competitiveness of the technology will form the basis for the subsequent decision-making process for the construction of the heat pump,” the two companies said, adding that the first results should be available by the end of this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/04/the-mobility-revolution-new-anode-material-for-fast-charging-batteries/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 4, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: New anode material for fast-charging batteries,"Scientists at Russia’s Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) and Moscow State University have worked out the charge storage mechanisms of NiBTA — a recently discovered material that can enable advanced fast-charging batteries. Today, development of fast-charging metal-ion batteries is crucial for solving the range anxiety issue that has held back the mass adoption of electric vehicles. Since conventional graphite anodes are unsuitable for fast charging because of hazardous dendrite formation at low potentials, the Russian scientists have been exploring the working principles of the recently proposed NiBTA, a one-dimensional Ni-based coordination polymer derived from benzenetetramine (BTA), in lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-based batteries. Among other techniques, both experimental and theoretical, the scientists used operando and ex situ X-ray diffraction, operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), which allowed them to track the structural changes inside the batteries in detail. “We were the first to apply such a rigorous approach for this class of compounds. This study sheds light on the redox chemistry of coordination polymers, which can be useful for many applications,” says the first author of the study, Skoltech Professor Roman Kapaev. In partially sodiated or potassiated states, the material undergoes fast bulk faradaic reactions, which should be beneficial for high-rate capabilities. The different behavior in the Li-, Na- and K-based systems is explained by the distinct crystal structure rearrangements. At the molecular level, the charge-discharge mechanism is similar for all types of batteries. Their findings were published in Chemical Science.
Mercedes-Benz is investing billions of euros in its European assembly plants to ready them for production of electric only vehicles by the end of the decade. The luxury car manufacturer said its German plants in Sindelfingen, Bremen, Rastatt and the plant in Kecskemét, Hungary, will start producing the new electric models in the Top End Luxury, Core Luxury and Entry Luxury categories from the middle of the decade. The Sindelfingen site is the lead plant for Top End Luxury and will produce models of the electric platform AMG.EA from 2025. The Bremen and Kecskemét plants will produce models of the e-platform MB.EA – i.e. the Core Luxury models – and the Rastatt and Kecskemét plants will build the repositioned models platform MMA from 2024. As part of the implementation of the company's 2022-2026 business plan, Mercedes-Benz says it is investing more than €2 billion in its European production sites. “This step marks a new phase of introducing next-generation electric platforms in production, securing future employment at European locations,” the company said. The production portfolio already includes six all-electric Mercedes-EQ models, which roll off the production line at six locations on three continents. Presently, Mercedes sources its EV batteries from a global network of partners with factories on three continents but considers local battery production to be “a key success factor.” To further deepen vertical integration in manufacturing and development, the manufacturing and assembly of parts of the electric drive systems for future models of the Mercedes-EQ brand will start at the end of 2024 at the Untertürkheim plant. Meanwhile, its Berlin plant will expand its production portfolio in future to include the manufacture and assembly of high-performance electric motors from the acquired British specialist Yasa. In terms of sustainability, the company aims to increase the production of renewable energy at its sites. Solar plants with a capacity of more than 11 MWp are to go into operation by the end of next year. By 2025, Mercedes-Benz is looking to invest a three-digit million sum in the installation of PV systems, on top of new power purchase agreements for wind turbines worth €1 billion by the middle of the decade. By 2030, it is planned to cover more than 70% of the energy demand in production from renewable energy sources – 15% is to be generated by on-site renewables.
LG announced that it is moving into the EV charging station business with the acquisition of South Korean charger maker AppleMango. Together with GS Energy and GS Neotek, an energy services company and a related IT service provider, LG purchased the company to create “fully-featured charging stations” and integrate the existing charging management system developed in-house.  Established in 2019, AppleMango has developed proprietary technologies and systems, including a slim, aesthetically-pleasing fast charger. According to LG, the acquisition secures access to the necessary operational infrastructure by working closely with GS Energy and GS Neotek, both of which have considerable experience operating EV charging stations and related businesses. LG also expects to add digital signage technologies to create charging stations with a user-friendly interface and real-time control/management. The company explicitly mentioned its IP-rated outdoor digital display with a sturdy, dust- and water-proof enclosure. This year, LG will establish an EV charger production line at LG Digital Park in South Korea and aims to provide customized charging solution for various settings, such as private residences, shopping malls, hotels and public institutions, in the near future. Moreover, LG expects the acquisition to create synergy with the company’s “ongoing efforts in the area of vehicle components, including developing and supplying EV batteries and adjacent products, such as energy storage system (ESS) and energy management solutions.” LG has been growing the e-mobility portfolio with the recently launched EV charging solution business joining the LG Vehicle Component Solutions (VS) Company, ZKW Group and the LG Magna e-Powertrain, which has recently become a core supplier to General Motors.
Electrify America said Tuesday it had raised $450 million in a deal that includes its first external investor as it aims to accelerate its rollout of ultra-fast charging stations in the US and Canada. The deal, which values North America’s largest ultra-fast EV charging network at $2.45 billion, includes more than $100 million from German industrial company Siemens and additional capital from VW Group on top of its original commitment of $2 billion through 2026. Electrify America said the investment highlights the long-term growth and viability of its plans to expand to 1,800 charging stations and more than 10,000 ultra-fast chargers in the US and Canada by 2026.
In an update to its 2020 study, the Faraday Institution predicts that there will be demand for 10 UK-based gigafactories by 2040, each producing 20 GWh per year of batteries. The study finds that the UK is making progress but not moving fast enough compared to its European competitors. “UK battery manufacturing plants could reach a combined capacity of 57 GWh by 2030, equivalent to around 5% of total European GWh capacity, compared with 34% in Germany,” the update reads. According to the study, by 2030, around 100 GWh of supply will be needed in the UK to satisfy battery demand for for private cars, commercial vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, buses, micromobility and grid storage. This demand is equivalent to five gigafactories, with each plant running at a capacity of 20 GWh per annum. By 2040, demand is expected to rise to nearly 200 GWh — the equivalent of 10 gigafactories. In addition, the overall industry workforce of the automotive and EV battery ecosystem could grow by 100,000 jobs from 170,000 to 270,000 employees by 2040, up from Faraday's 2020 report which predicted a growth of 50,000 jobs from 176,000 to 220,000 employees by 2040. “The UK is well placed to have a leading position in next generation batteries such as solid-state, lithium-sulfur and sodium-ion technologies. The UK is already home to global experts in battery research and to well-established companies. We must move quickly to exploit this competitive advantage by establishing large-scale domestic manufacturing in the UK while continuing to fund long-term battery research,” Faraday CEO Pam Thomas said.
As of July 1, the Australian Labor government has introduced new incentives for electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, fulfilling a promise made before the election. The so-called Electric Car Discount comes in the form of exemptions to import tariffs and fringe benefit taxes, depending on the country of origin. Cars coming from most of Europe, Japan and South Korea are expected to be thousands of dollars cheaper once the import tariff of 5% falls. Some popular models to benefit from the incoming lift of the import tariff are the Nissan Leaf, the Mercedes EQA, the Hyundai Kona EV, and the Mini Cooper SE. For instance, the Electric Vehicle Council estimates that a $50,000 model such as the Nissan Leaf will be more than $2,000 cheaper due to removing the import tariff. The so-called fringe benefits tax will apply to company cars provided to employees for personal use, qualifying for a 47% tax rate on the financial benefit of the arrangement. The Labor government estimated that excepting EVs from the fringe benefits tax could cut the EV cost by as much as $9,000 for models costing around $50,000. Any exemptions will only apply to EVs with a sale price below $77,565 in 2020-21, the luxury car threshold for fuel-efficient vehicles in Australia.

“For us, agrivoltaics is above all a collective project,” Jean-Michel Lamothe, a farmer in France's Landes department and vice president of the French Federation of agrivoltaic producers (FFPA), told pv magazine.
Lamothe is also leading the Pujo Arbouts Territoire Agrivoltaïsme (PATAV), an association of 35 farmers spread across the six municipalities of Castandet, Vignau, Maurrin, Hontanx, Pujo-le-Plan and Saint-Gein.
“In our area, hydrologists have traced a perimeter of 1,400 hectares, where groundwater shows a concentration of pesticide metabolites above the regulatory limit of 2 μg/L,” Lamothe explained. “This situation is the result of the intensive use that has been made in the past of phytosanitary products and herbicides on corn fields.”
According to Lamothe, the nature of the land currently makes it difficult to implement organic farming. “This is why we opted for an agrivoltaic solution,” he stated. Due to the low water quality, operators have no other choice but to cultivate new species, which will make it possible to recreate biodiversity but, at the same time, will offer less productivity. “We decided to grow plants rich in omega-3s, which respond well to our water quality problem and the climate of the region: flax, chia, camelina, rapeseed, and sunflower,” he further explained. “And we will compensate for the drop in productivity with revenues from photovoltaics.”

The group of entrepreneurs is now partnering with Green Lighthouse Development (GLHD) on solar projects. The company wants to use monofacial panels installed on trackers at a height of 1.2 m from the ground, with the module rows having a 9 m distance to allow the passage of the harvester cutter bars under the panels.“In May, we experienced an episode of high heat and drought,” Lamothe said. “Under the panels, which retained the evapotranspiration of the plants, we found that the plants were greener and better developed than between the rows. So we think the return will be higher than what we originally estimated.”Only 700 hectares of the 1,400 hectares in the area will be equipped with solar panels. “Our ambition is indeed to maintain agricultural activity on our land, despite the decrease in water quality. This requires several sources of income.” Harvesting machinery and production packaging equipment will also be pooled.
The objective is also to create value for the whole territory through the taxes paid to the municipalities. At present, farmers hope to obtain authorizations in early 2023 for financing finalized in late 2023-early 2024 and commissioning in early 2025. “We will have to go to ‘zero-phyto' on our crops,” Lamothe concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/04/sungrow-introduces-new-residential-solutions-with-ev-charger-to-enable-more-powerful-flexible-renewable-energy-systems/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"JULY 4, 2022","Sungrow introduces new residential solutions with EV charger to enable more powerful, flexible renewable energy systems","As rising gas prices continue to push up the cost of electricity across Europe, the economic burden on businesses and households is increasing. Those with solar on their rooftops are better positioned to deal with such price hikes and are looking for ways to maximize every advantage of their systems.
For solar homes seeking to increase their energy independence, the way to go is all electric. Ideally, households should optimize the use of each and every green electron their rooftop PV systems are producing and direct them to their batteries for greater self-consumption and their wallboxes to power their transportation needs.
The forward-thinking R&D team at Chinese manufacturer Sungrow has already come up with a solution to meet all these needs in one. Its 3-phase all-in-one smart system featuring a hybrid inverter and battery solution, EV charger, and fully integrated monitoring iSolarCloud allows homeowners to embrace full control of their energy production and consumption.
The three-phase hybrid inverter and the battery included in the kit have been on the market for some time, but when coupled with the AC011E-01 EV Charger, an 11kW AC charger with IP 65 protection, their benefits are multiplied. Charging the electric vehicle from solar+storage+EV charger as opposed to charging from the grid is not only superior for environmental reasons, but also in terms of savings.

The whole solution can be monitored and managed via Sungrow’s free of charge monitoring platform: iSolarCloud, which receives fresh data from the inverter every 10 seconds so the homeowner can check energy flow and self-consumption in near real time.
Choosing the right EV charging solution for your home is no easy task and one of the performance criteria to keep an eye on is flexibility. Sungrow’s AC011E-01 EV Charger offers four different charging modes to fit all needs.
The integration into iSolarCloud allows to accurately monitor PV production, to store surplus in the home battery, and to coordinate the optimal charge of the electric vehicle using only local renewable energy or a mix from all sources for fast charging.
Furthermore, it’s possible to set a specific amount of kWh and a desired pickup time. The EV-charger will create the optimal charging mix, making sure to use as much self-generated renewable energy as possible.
Sungrow Power Supply Co., Ltd has installed over 224 GW worth of PV inverters worldwide as of December 2021. Founded in 1997 by University Professor Cao Renxian, the company is a leader in the research and development of inverters with the largest dedicated R&D team in the industry and a broad product portfolio. Offering PV inverter solutions and energy storage systems for utility-scale, commercial & industrial, and residential applications, as well as internationally recognized floating PV plant solutions, NEV driving solutions and EV charging solutions, Sungrow powers installations in over 150 countries.
The EV charger business is rooted in its 25-year track record of power electronics technology, and shares experience in designing and managing durable and reliable products.

“Q Energy will operate as a holistic solutions provider in renewable energy power plants – from greenfield development all the way to the business as an independent power producer,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. Q Energy will stand independently alongside its Q Cells photovoltaics division, which “will continue to deliver completely clean energy solutions to private and commercial end customers,” the spokesperson added.
The new company will be a direct affiliate of the group's Hanwha Solutions Corporation unit and will control the German division Q Energy Europe GmbH as well as the France-based subsidiary Q Energy France SAS. “For Q Energy Europe, the step from Q Cells into an own independent company means expanding from solar into wind, storage and green hydrogen. Therefore, we will leverage the experience and expertise of its sister company Q Energy France, which brings more than 20 years of experience in successfully developing wind farms in France.”
The new company has a project portfolio of around 12 GW, of which around 9.2 GW are for solar power plants. “The projects are in various stages of development,” the spokesperson explained. “Specifically in Spain and Portugal, we have recently completed construction of some projects while others are either under construction or will be started within the next couple of months. In France, we also have two projects currently under construction.”
Most of the projects, with a capacity of around 5 GW, are located in France, while Spain, Portugal, and Germany account for 4 GW, 2 GW, and 1 GW, respectively. “We’re currently expanding into Italy, the UK, and the Netherlands,” the spokesperson added.

The hydropower station is owned by Alpiq itself (39%), Swiss Federal Railways (36%), Industrielle Werke Basel (15%), and Forces Motrices Valaisannes (10%). Its construction started in 2008 and it uses two different water reservoirs at the Émosson Dam, which was completed in 1974.
Located in a cave 600 m underground between the Emosson and Vieux Emosson reservoirs, the Nant de Drance power plant relies on six pump turbines, each with a power capacity of 150 MW. It uses the Emosson and Vieux Emosson reservoirs to operate. The water stored in the upper reservoir of Vieux-Emosson, which has a storage capacity of 227,000,000 m3, or 20 million kWh, falls into the underground power station via two vertical shafts that are 425 m high.
The project was built at a cost of approximately CHF 2 billion ($2.09 billion) and saw the participation of 60 enterprises. It required the excavation of 400,000 m3 of rock and the drilling of 17 km of galleries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/04/five-steps-to-ensure-battery-quality/,"ENERGY STORAGE,SPONSORED,CHINA,WORLD",,"JULY 4, 2022",Five steps to ensure battery quality,"High quality never happens by chance. It is always the result of comprehensive, well thought out, and concerted effort. For Growatt, quality is the lifeline spanning the company’s entire spectrum of operations and extensive portfolio of products, including PV inverters, energy storage systems, EV chargers, and smart energy management solutions.
The Shenzhen-based manufacturer first promoted its storage products back in 2015 and has since expanded its portfolio to include a variety of DC- and AC-coupled solutions for residential and small commercial use. At the end of 2021, Growatt had delivered around 3.8 million sets of its PV inverter and battery systems.
Growatt’s battery manufacturing is co-located with its PV inverter production in Huizhou, China. Spread over approximately 200,000 square meters, its manufacturing facility has an annual capacity of 20 GW of PV inverters and 400,000 battery modules. Faithful to the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry because of its extreme safety, Growatt has released multiple models of its branded battery energy storage systems, such as AXE, Hope, GBLI and the ARK series.
All of Growatt’s battery systems have gained a good reputation in the market thanks to high quality and reliability, not to mention confirmation by independent testing service providers. Last year, Growatt’s modular ARK residential battery energy storage solution achieved outstanding performance in TÜV Rheinland’s rigorous safety and reliability tests and won the prestigious All Quality Matters Award. As might be expected, for Growatt, quality is all that matters.
“Growatt would never compromise on quality, even under the cost pressure,” says Ray Cheng, head of overseas marketing at Growatt. “We’re very certain the high quality of products can bring cost savings for the company in different ways, such as through reducing maintenance cost or saving marketing costs that occur due to any quality defects.”
To deliver top-notch reliability and performance, Growatt strictly executes its tested Five Step Quality System for the new product development and mass production process. The first step of the systematic quality program is Component Engineering. At this stage, Growatt conducts safety tests for the battery cell and module, including over-charge, over-discharge, short circuit, dropping test, thermal runaway test, extrusion test, seawater immersion test, temperature changing test, low air-pressure test, and the shaking test with the goal to ensure that fire, explosion, or leakage accidents do not happen under the worst conditions.

For instance, in the thermal runaway testing, a heating element is placed near a battery cell exposing it to temperatures up to 215 C. As soon as the heat is spread to the adjacent battery cell, an explosion-proof valve will open, preventing fire.
For the second step, Design Engineering, Growatt conducts a variety of engineering verification tests, including state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH), to verify the charge and discharge accuracy under different C rates and temperatures, alongside charge/discharge switch tests. In addition, the battery management system (BMS) test and the state of power (SOP) algorithm import test are also critical for the battery.
The BMS is the brain of the system and the first in line to provide full protection in cases of over/under temperature, over/under voltage, over current, and short circuiting. One of the critical parts of the BMS test is real-time data collection, covering temperature, SoC, cell and pack voltage, charge and discharge current sampling and other parameters, giving a comprehensive picture of the battery’s status and health at any given moment.
Next comes the design verification test stage, in this Growatt assembles the energy storage system and combines inverters, batteries, and monitoring devices to verify that all the elements work seamlessly as a whole under various external conditions.
For the fourth step, Environment and Reliability Engineering in the trial-run and validation stage, Growatt conducts long-term charge and discharge cycle tests and capacity and conformance tests to assess battery status in the full life cycle. In addition, it runs the ecological application tests to guarantee that the whole system is operating reliably in different application scenarios.
The Manufacturing Engineering stage focuses on both product launch and mass production. In the product launch stage, the manufacturer conducts product audit tests, such as the type test, capacity audit test, and conformance test. Overall, there will be at least 128 testing steps for the battery product development, ensuring an exhaustive and extensive quality assurance process.
On top of the rigorous in-house regime, all battery storage products made by Growatt are also subject to the third-party verification tests to achieve global certifications such as CE, IEC 62619, VDE 2510, UL1973, UL9549, UN38.3 MSDS, and more. Finally, for the mass production stage, Growatt cutting-edge manufacturing facility has achieved quality management system certificates ISO 9001, ISO14001 and ISO 45001. In addition, the manufacturer conducts full tests for the whole manufacturing process, including IQC inspection, module test, aging test, air tightness test, and package test to deliver superior quality products and excellent customer experience.

Of those, seven were selected based on their technical experience and economic capacity, with the project cost evaluated at €11.5 million.
In the second stage of the tender, “the proposals will be evaluated according to technical and economic criteria,” João Santana Ramos, project manager at Hyperion, told pv magazine. “If all the specifications required in the tender documents are met, the three main criteria for evaluation of the applications will be: price; energy efficiency of the Hydrogen Production Unit (HPU); and deadline for the delivery of the plant.”
A solar PV plant with a production capacity of 12 MW will be adjacent to the HPU. Additionally, a renewable PPA will be established to raise the load factor of the electrolyzers and maximize production. The PPA will “meet the standards required by the EU so that all hydrogen produced is considered green,” said Santana Ramos. The electrolyzers will produce 1,500 Nm3, or 135 kg, of green hydrogen per hour. “The exact output capacity of the electrolyzers depends on the supplier and their equipment efficiency, but it should be around 7.5 MW,” he explained.
The hydrogen will be produced at a high purity level (>99.999%), making it suitable for many applications. One of its destinations will be the sale to off-takers who will load tube trailers on-site, as compressed hydrogen at about 200-300 bars. Its second destination will be the Portuguese natural gas distribution network. A 3.5 to 4 km pipeline will be built between the production unit and the network injection point, with the hydrogen injected at a pressure of 20 bar.
The companies bidding for construction of the plant are mostly from Portugal and Spain. Portuguese companies include Construção e Manutenção Electromecânica (CME) in partnership with French PEM electrolyzers producer Elogen; PRF Gas Solutions; Cimontubo; and ERI Engenharia. On the Spanish side are Elecnor Group, and H2B2 Electrolysis Technologies in partnership with the Portuguese FCC Industrial and RCC. The Swiss Proman completes the list of bidders competing in the second stage of the tender.
The tender follows the procedure established by the EU-funded Operational Programme for Sustainability and Efficient Use of Resources — PO SEUR in Portuguese — which last year awarded the Hyperion Green H2 Setúbal project €5 million in CAPEX support.
Hyperion Renewables counts with more than 15 years of experience in the Iberian renewable energy industry, mainly focusing on solar energy, with a portfolio of some 2 GW of projects that are completed and in development. The company is currently developing over 280 MW of green hydrogen production through electrolysis, distributed over four projects, three of them located in Portugal and one in Spain's Badajoz region.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/04/solar-plus-storage-for-islands/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDONESIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 4, 2022",Solar-plus-storage for islands,"Indonesia‘s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resource has provided an update on the program run by state-owned utility PT PLN (Persero) to deploy solar-plus-storage plants across remote islands in the country.
According to the ministry, solar facilities totaling 5.3 MW and connected to an unspecified number of storage systems have been deployed across 17 islands to date. These include Palue (760 kW), Messah (530 kW), Gunung 490 (kW), Golo Lebo (440 kW), Parumaan (420 kW), Papagarang (380 kW), Nuca Molas (380 kW), Wontong (320 kW), Nangabere (270 kW), Mbakung (260 kW), Kebirangga Selatan (200 kW), Ranakulan (190 kW), Seraya 190 (kW), Kakasewa 140 (kW), Batu Tiga (120 kW), Legur Lai (150 kW), and Kalelu (100 kW).
The facility installed in Messah, an island in the country's southernmost province of East Nusa Tenggara, was built in 2019 and provides power to 467 customers, including households, businesses, and public entities, the ministry explained. The PV system has a capacity of 530 kW and relies on five bidirectional inverters, 27 inverters, and 590 batteries.
According to recent research from the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) in Finland, the combination of solar and storage may help remote islands have a 60% share of renewables in their electricity mix.
In the paper “A review of 100% renewable energy scenarios on islands,” published in WIREs Energy and Management, the research group provides a holistic view of energy system studies for islands aiming at 100% renewable energy penetration and reviews all existing literature, including 97 scientific papers. “Detailed information on actions used on-demand as well as on supply-side are delivered,” it specifies. “In this context, there is no limitation regarding single technologies, energy system sectors, regions, or size of islands.”
According to the scientists, balancing the high variability of wind and solar resources via more dispatchable renewable energy technologies such as biomass and biofuels or storage will be crucial for realizing the 100% renewables target. “Further technologies providing the remaining required electricity are hydropower plants and pumped hydro storage, solid waste plans, and bioethanol plants,” they point out, noting that solar and wind may also be used to produce hydrogen for use on the islands themselves. “Bioethanol capacities have a crucial role in supply reliability and provide power in short periods of very low solar, wind, and biomass availability.”
After reviewing the existing research, the LTU researchers concluded that the target of powering islands with 100% renewable energy is technically feasible and economically viable. “This has been shown for several small islands as well as for large island states, independent of their geographic location,” they stated. “The role of electricity will become that of a primary energy source and the electricity sector is the backbone of any smart energy system.”
According to their findings, a 30% renewable share may become possible by building capacity and infrastructure while, for a 60% share, storage deployment will be crucial.  Furthermore, sector coupling will be the final step to achieving a 100% target. “We found that there is still not the same common sense on multi-sectoral approaches for islands as it could also be found for energy systems transition in general. Full sector coupling studies are not yet the standard for 100% renewables islands, and a detailed industry sector inclusion is fully missing for islands,” they concluded.

Publishing a country report about the nation, which comprises more than 500 islands to the east of the Philippines, Irena estimated 190 MW of solar generation capacity and 20 MW of wind farms could help Palau become almost entirely powered by clean energy.
The international body pointed out the country would also require 412 MWh of battery energy storage capacity and 41 MW of battery inverters, to even out supply from those renewables assets.
That could all be secured for the nation for less than $130 million, according to Irena.
Palau, one of the island nations at risk of disappearing due to rising sea levels, wants to have a fully renewables-powered energy system by mid century.
With the added solar, wind and battery capacity able to supply 92.1% of Palau's power, according to Irena, the last mile could be attained with the use of clean energy-powered green hydrogen.
Irena has estimated Palau had just 2 MW of grid-connected solar capacity at the end of 2021, with the panels in place since the end of 2018.
The nation had a further 235 kW of off-grid solar, according to Irena, present since the end of 2019.

“To obtain the required energy output a matrix is constituted by several single units,” the company's marketing manager, Christoffer Isdahl, told pv magazine. “Usually, those single units are gathered in a string first, and then all the strings are attached together.”
The floats are attached with polyurethane hinges and each float measures 1,880 mm x 1,880 mm x 85 mm. Its weight is 60 kg and a string made of 14 floats reaches 840 kg. “The aluminum float itself is made from two 1.5 mm pressed blanks with dimples,” Isdahl explained. “The two blanks are symmetrical, positioned facing each other, and clinched to constitute the float.”
A special photovoltaic panel is bonded to the top of the float, giving a total unit thickness of 85 mm. “The PV panel is composed of a solar glass that is 3.2 mm thick and a laminate enclosing the PV cells, the circuits, and the plastic protection,” Isdahl stated. “The laminate is 1.5 mm thick and is bonded to the glass by the PV panel manufacturer. The total thickness is then 4.7 mm.”

The solar panel has a power output of 537 W and is based on 100 monocrystalline PERC cells measuring 158.75 mm x 158.75 mm. It features a power conversion efficiency of 22.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 68.7 V, and a short-current of 9.57 A. It is also equipped with small pockets that use marine water for liquid cooling.
To connect the floats into a large matrix, a system consisting of two aluminum brackets and several hinges is mounted on each side of the panel, with one hinge being shared between two panels. “The brackets are a centerpiece of the mechanical fastening of the system,” Isdahl said. “On one side they are bolted to the aluminum float with a set of aluminum blind rivet nuts, where each rivet nut offers a tension load resistance of 17.5 kilonewton and, on the other hand, they encompass the polyurethane hinges within the parallelepipedal socket that they are shaped in.”

“Our work is a review paper, in which we explored possibilities for integrating power electronics onto crystalline silicon solar cells,” the research's corresponding author, David Van Nijen, told pv magazine. “We envision the application of these innovations first in the residential market or in specific applications, such as in PV-powered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and later, as the economy of scale kicks in, uptake in the utility-scale market.”
In the paper Exploring the benefits, challenges, and feasibility of integrating power electronics into c-Si solar cells, which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science, the Dutch research group specified that their main goal was to explore a different approach to facilitate sub-module power electronics, increase granularity, and enable novel approaches to power conditioning. “We review the research efforts that have been performed on the topic so far and outline the feasibility of different unexplored possibilities,” it stated.
Through their review, the scientists found that diodes are the most suitable devices that can be integrated into PV cells, with some designs having already been demonstrated at the research level. They said the so-called Alq3/p-Si Schottky diodes, which are also known as hot-carrier diodes or low voltage diodes, are the best ones for being embedded in solar cells. This kind of diode consists of the junction of a semiconductor with a metal and is known for providing fast switching action and a low forward voltage drop.
As for transistors, the academics said their integration in PV devices may be more complex. “Since transistor fabrication processes require lithographic steps, it is necessary for cost-effective integration to combine as many processing steps as possible with PV fabrication,” they emphasized, stressing the constraints in combining the production steps of standard vertical power transistor designs with those of the photovoltaic industry.
Their review also considered passive component integration, for which several “promising” approaches were found, and thin-film capacitor integration, which the scientists said is challenging due to insufficient high capacitance.

State government-owned energy company Stanwell is progressing plans to develop a large-scale standalone battery with a combined 1.45 GW/2.9 GWh of energy storage adjacent to its coal-fired Stanwell Power Station near Rockhampton in central Queensland. Stanwell said the battery would support ongoing investment in renewables and help maintain system security and reliability.
A material change of use application has been lodged with Rockhampton Regional Council on behalf of Stanwell, which owns and operates the Stanwell and Tarong coal-fired power stations, for a new utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS).
According to the planning report, the BESS would be installed on a 12-hectare site near the Stanwell Power Station and would be built in two stages. Stage one would involve the installation of lithium-ion batteries with an output of 150 MW/300 MWh while stage two may use lithium-ion or flow battery technology with an output of up to 1,300 MW/2,600 MWh.
Stanwell, which is also progressing plans to develop a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to the Tarong Power Station site near Nanango in the South Burnett, said it is seeking to develop a high-quality, cost-effective portfolio of renewable energy and energy storage assets to support its long-term strategy of providing low-emissions solutions to commercial and industrial retail customers.
“As a business, we are investigating a range of future energy solutions to ensure we are in the best position possible to respond to the changing market,” the company said. “We are investigating a range of opportunities to incorporate technologies into our asset portfolio, including hydrogen, energy storage, wind, solar and bioenergy.”
The government-owned generator said large-scale BESS will play an increasingly important role in the National Electricity Market (NEM) as it moves to a predominantly renewable-based energy system. “Energy storage will be critical as it helps facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the energy system by storing electricity generated by wind and solar and supplying it to the market when required,” it said.
The first stage of the Stanwell battery would incorporate lithium-ion technology.The report, lodged by Brisbane-based design and engineering company Aurecon, indicates the Stanwell battery will be capable of storing electrical energy from, and exporting to, the NEM. “The project will store electricity during periods of high supply and or low usage and provide electricity during critical peak times allowing for reliable and affordable energy supply during these periods,” the report says.
The BESS will also provide Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) services to the NEM, helping ensure energy supply and demand are matched at all times. “By acting as a load during the peak solar generation periods and providing energy services that support system stability, the BESS will support the deployment of renewable energy power generation in the NEM,” the report says.
The Stanwell battery is to be built on a site adjacent to the Stanwell power plant, about 28 kilometers southwest of Rockhampton. Stanwell said locating battery storage at the site would allow it to capitalize on existing land and connection infrastructure with the proposed BESS to connect to Queensland network operator Powerlink’s adjoining switchyard via a 275 kV transmission line.
While no timeline for the project was detailed in the planning report, Stanwell has previously indicated to would likely be brought online in 2024, although the report acknowledges the project remains subject to approvals.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/04/reports-reveal-which-manufacturer-is-believed-to-have-product-seized-under-uflpa/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 4, 2022",Reports reveal which manufacturer is believed to have product seized under UFLPA,"From pv magazine USA
The detained shipment of product seized under the recently-enacted Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), first reported by ROTH Capital Partners, is believed to be product from JinkoSolar, according to reports shared with pv magazine USA by trusted industry sources.
According to the initial Roth note, the detained shipment is being withheld until the vendor provides documentation showing the source of the quartzite, the raw material for making polysilicon, though the vendor at the time was not named.
pv magazine has reached out to Jinko for comment on the detained shipment reports, and will provide said comment once it is received.
If the reports are confirmed, the result could be a much more dire situation than was initially regarded when the Department of Homeland Security Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans released its June 17 strategy for preventing the importation of goods mined or produced using forced labor under the UFLPA.
Under that plan, only a handful of polysilicon suppliers with operations in Xinjiang were listed, along with MGS supplier Hoshine Silicon, and the action was seen as a best-case scenario for the solar industry, with other companies thought to be at risk left off the list of banned imports.
It was also believed by ROTH at the time that companies that have already gone through the Hoshine WRO enforcement process would not be a focus of initial UFLPA enforcement, though the reported detention of Jinko product would prove this belief inaccurate.
The issue of quartzite documentation is an especially tricky one, as ROTH shares that, to its knowledge, none of the module vendors have quartzite documentation, and that two of the leading suppliers, Wacker and Hemlock semiconductor, would currently find it difficult to provide this information. It is possible that this is information the companies could provide, but doing so would take time. If the reports are confirmed, untold capacity of U.S.-bound product shipments could now be in jeopardy.
The same sources who provided reports on potentially detained Jinko shipments also believe that Trina Solar has had product detained, and pv magazine has reached out to Trina for comment on these additional reports.
