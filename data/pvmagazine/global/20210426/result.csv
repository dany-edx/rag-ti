Though commercial applications capable of long-term high performance appear just around the corner, concerns surrounding stability remain. And though plenty of different methods have been suggested to address these concerns, new approaches are certainly welcome.
Scientists led by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology present one such approach in their new paper, Unraveling the compositional heterogeneity and carrier dynamics of alkali cation doped 3D/2D perovskites with improved stability, published in Materials Advances. The group first incorporated the alkali metal rubidium into a three-dimensional perovskite film, and then grew a two-dimensional “Ruddlesden–Popper” perovskite material on top of it.
“We have conducted a very thorough, holistic study of two recent promising discoveries – rubidium doping and 2D capping – to better understand the impact these discoveries have on perovskite technologies,” said NIST researcher Christina Hacker. “We aren’t the first to look at rubidium doping or 2D capping, but we are the first to really understand what role these discoveries have in a photovoltaic device.”
Their work analyzing these materials showed several advantages over control devices produced without incorporating the two new approaches. The two-dimensional perovskite acts as a capping layer, protecting the more sensitive perovskite cell material beneath from moisture. The device also maintained 81% of its initial efficiency after 60 days exposed to ambient air at 50% relative humidity, without an encapsulant. A control sample of the 3D perovskite, meanwhile, lost 65% of its initial conversion efficiency in the same period. “The 2D cap prevents the water from degrading the crystal structure,” explained Hacker. “But it is thin enough that it does not lead to poor electrical properties.”

Doping the cell with rubidium, as well as structuring the device in 2D/3D bilayers, was shown to reduce the energy needed for electrons to move through the layers, further improving the device's performance. “We did test the solar cells using the stack and got a peak efficiency in the 20% range,” Hacker told pv magazine. “However, our goal was not to achieve record efficiencies, but rather to perform a detailed study of the impact of Rb doping and 2D/3D heterostructures to better understand the structure of these films and how this structure impacts PV performance to better guide future efforts to achieve peak efficiencies.”
New routes
While 19% performance loss would likely be too high for the cells to receive any interest outside of the research community, it’s notable that was done with no encapsulant. And the group hopes its work in 3D/2D approaches will be valuable in later work – including insights into how much rubidium. “This work provides the perovskite community with a facile strategy and fundamental understanding to rationally design a 3D/2D bi-layer architecture with significant guidelines toward high-performance perovskite photovoltaics with improved operational stability,” they conclude.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/26/vortex-generators-and-glass-texturing-for-solar-module-cooling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 26, 2021",Vortex generators and glass texturing for solar module cooling,"From pv magazine Australia
A decrease of 10 degrees Celsius in operating temperature could double the lifespan of solar panels and boost their performance every day. Researchers at the University of New South Wales have completed a successful desk-top study that modelled methods yielding an effective 2-3 degrees Celsius cooling of solar panels, and are following up with live experimental research to verify and expand on that effectiveness.
Although constantly exposed to heat, solar modules work better under cooler conditions.
In an exclusive interview with pv magazine Australia, UNSW’s Scientia Professor Martin Green, who is also Director for the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, explained: 5 degrees Celsius reduction in operating temperature can yield a 2% improvement in module performance on a hot day; and the degradation which limits module lifespan and is largely catalysed by heat can also be mitigated by reducing their operating temperatures — five degrees reduction in operating temperature is expected to result in 50% increase in project life.
Results of the desktop study — led by UNSW Professor Renate Egan, partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and carried out in collaboration with 3M and solar system innovators 5B — were published at the end of March, and showed that of the novel methods explored for lowering the temperature of solar panels, vortex generators and glass texturing, have so far proved to be the most effective solutions.
“Glass texturing is an interesting approach,” says Green, “because people have looked at it before, but from the point of view of the visible optics — trapping more sunlight into the cells and things like that. We’re looking at it from the thermal point of view where texturing can improve the thermal emissivity of the module, that is it can improve radiative dissipation and its increased surface area can also improve convective losses.”
On the intriguing topic of vortex generators, he says that left to do their job in the sun, modules heat up by some 30 degrees Celsius. This generates airflows up the front and back surfaces of the module, and as the flow of air gets hotter along the back surface, it tends to get trapped against the module.
“It’s a nice laminar flow along the back, which you might want to be designing for in racing cars because you get minimum interaction with the surrounding air,” says Green. But it’s not good for heat transfer, or dissipating heat, for which he says “you want the air to be turbulent as it passes over the module”.
Vortex generators, aka small plastic “fins” added to the back of the solar panel, “break up the laminar flow of air and create regions of turbulence that can greatly increase heat transfer from local areas,” says Green.
The numerical study resulted in three patents being filed, and was extremely useful in establishing the feasibility of several approaches before proceeding to potentially costly physical testing.
It’s quite difficult to do measurements in the real world, says Green, “because cooling effects can be subtle”, but with the development of engineering simulation software such as COMSOL and Ansys systems used in this instance, researchers can test and adjust design approaches “until you’ve achieved a difference that’s big enough” to warrant investing more effort in experiments, says the Professor.
Solar innovators at 5B, renowned for their rapid-rollout PV systems which have been chosen to unfold across the 12,000 hectares (10 GW) of solar PV planned for Sun Cable’s Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) project near Elliott in the Northern Territory, have gathered highly accurate solar-performance data on their systems, which contributed to UNSW’s simulations.
Having developed its preassembled, relocatable solar system — appropriately called Maverick — that extends like mini-mountain ranges, across the ground, 5B has had to answer concerns that it might run slightly hotter than more elevated, conventionally mounted systems.
5B Chief Technology Officer, Rhett Evans, told pv magazine Australia, that the company collects large amounts of data to verify the performance of its technology under different conditions.
As an industry partner to UNSW’s Module Design for Lowering Field Operating Temperature and Improved Yield Study, 5B made its data available to researchers, and it will also participate in the subsequent round of experimental research.
“They’ve developed some really good methods for doing the thermal modelling in the first place,” Evans says of UNSW’s approach. He adds, “We want to be a party to that, using it to understand how we can make our specific products work better.”
3M has been a long-term partner of UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering and is involved in two of the study’s other streams of cool thought: heat-conducting tape that channels heat generated on the solar panel to the cooler extremities of the frame; and more complex coatings than are currently applied to the glass of solar panels.
“I think probably 100% of modules now have anti-reflection coating on the top glass surface,” explains Green, “but we’re looking at coatings that will reduce unusable infrared light penetration.” This will improve the performance of the visible wavelength of light transformed into energy by solar panels, and at the same time improve the thermal performance of the module.
Although Green is shooting for 10 degrees Celsius thermal reduction in solar panels operating in full sunlight, he says going all out for the biggest reduction possible will then allow researchers to hone in on the most efficient methods to deliver 5 degrees reduction, and which can be incorporated into the manufacturing of solar panels.
“You don’t want to go too far from the beaten path,” says Green, “we want to minimize the variation from what manufacturers feel comfortable with.”
Professor Egan says that a cost analysis of the two most successful cooling technologies to emerge from the desktop study revealed that the Vortex Generator technology could reduce the levelized cost of electricity generated by 5-8% if implemented as an add-on during manufacturing; a 2-3 degree Celsius cooling benefit would outweigh the estimated cost of $3-5 per square meter.
The Glass Texturing technology, in turn, could reduce the levelized cost of electricity by 3-15%. Although the benefit of this approach varies depending on the actual cooling effect — which is estimated to range from 1-5 degrees Celsius — its cost is very low at less than $0.3 per square meter.
In the experimental study, which will conclude at the end of 2022, Green hopes to gather data relevant to a variety of PV module types, mounting systems and applications, including rooftop solar, bifacial solar panels and 5B’s Maverick concertina systems.
Four of 5B’s module partners — Canadian Solar, JA Solar, Jinko and Longi — are also participating in UNSW’s experimental cooling study.
Green reminds pv magazine, that his colleague, the late Professor Stuart Wenham, “pioneered this consortium-type approach” to integrating research with industry.
“If you get a number of high-profile manufacturers involved” at the outset and they like the way things develop, he says, “then the whole industry is will follow because you’ve got some of the key players pushing in that direction”.
The benefit of this research to solar developers can mean a great deal: “People are worried about every per cent, in relative terms of output that you get from the field,” says Green. Small gains in performance across large installations and in the high-output lifetime of a solar farm, “can make all the difference to a project’s success,” he says.

The REC Alpha Pure Black Series is available in five versions with power ratings ranging from 385 to 405 W, and efficiency ranging from 20.8% to 21.9%.
The new product is made with 132 heterojunction, half-cut monocrystalline cells and its maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
The open-circuit voltage is between 48.5 V and 48.91 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 10.10 A to 10.30 A.  All five versions of the module measure 1,821×1,016×30mm and weigh 20.5kg.
The panel can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius and their operating temperature coefficient is -0.26% per degree Celsius. It is enclosed between 3.2mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, and also features a junction box with an IP 68 rating.
The manufacturer offers a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. It said the module series is eligible for the premium REC ProTrust warranty package, which offers up to 25 years coverage on product, performance and labor, with guaranteed power of at least 92% in year 25 of operation.
“Because aesthetics play a role in rooftop solar applications, this gapless layout combined with a black backsheet gives the REC Alpha Pure BlackSeriesa seamless appearance, which alongside its lead–free construction and high power, makes it a compelling solar panel choice for both residential and commercial rooftops,” REC explained.
The panels are manufactured at the company's manufacturing facility in Singapore.

Bernabei was speaking at a webinar dedicated to driving the African energy transition, organized by the European Commission, African Union Commission, and the European Council's Portuguese presidency, and backed by the European Investment Bank, African Development Bank and the secretariat of the Africa EU energy partnership.
Enel Green Power boss Bernabei said: “Some countries, like South Africa, Morocco, and Egypt, have great regulatory policies but we cannot make a greater impact with only three countries.”
Frans Timmermans, executive VP of the European Green Deal for the European Commission, said the EU and its member states stood ready to help African governments introduce the policies required to help catalyze private-sector investment in clean energy.
Through the auspices of the African-EU Green Energy Initiative, the European Union and African Union would finally implement a long-desired strategic energy partnership which would aim to drive investment in clean power generation, raise access to electricity, and promote energy efficiency, said Timmermans.
The commission VP said: “We cannot limit ourselves to energy access based on six hours of electricity per day, which is barely enough to plug a fan, a radio, and a TV. We need to think big. We need access on a scale which can truly help the economic development and the industrialization of Africa.” Stating the bloc and its member states have, since 2013, more than doubled their contributions to partner nations pursuing a sustainable development path, Timmermans said 30% of the EU's external partnership budget would be devoted to climate change investment over the next seven years.
The commission representative also emphasized the need for supportive policymaking, including energy sector reform, carbon pricing and access to affordable finance in African nations. While Timmermans said the public sector needed to take action, European Commission peer Koen Doens, director-general for international partnerships, said stronger links between African and European businesses could also play an important role.
Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), said a broader approach needed to be adopted in Africa, both in terms of widening the debate beyond which technologies to deploy and in terms of national interests. Cross-border, regional infrastructure would be more effective in harnessing the industrial and development benefits which industries such as green hydrogen production might offer to the continent, he said, adding, the 2.7 GW of solar capacity installed in Africa last year amounted to just 0.01% of the renewables projects added worldwide.
Africa will need a decade to complete the goal of providing access to energy for its 600 million people who are unconnected at present, said African Union commissioner for infrastructure and energy, Amani Abou-Zeid. “We urgently need to think of innovative ways to mobilize resources and invite [the] private sector and governments on this journey to green energy access,” she added.
That sobering prospect is also an opportunity, Kandeh Yumkella told the webinar. “Connecting 600 million people with electricity is not only a challenge but also a great business opportunity for the two sister continents,” said Yumkella, co-chair of the strategy group for energy at policy thinktank the Africa Europe Foundation.
Lack of accessible finance is a significant hurdle between African businesses and that opportunity, the event heard, and Hela Cheikhrouhou, CEO of Washington DC-based energy finance provider Nithio Holdings, emphasized the benefits blended finance – comprised of public and private-sector cash – could offer.
“If you looked at the map of the world ten years ago,” said commissioner Timmermans at the event, “coal was the cheapest option to produce electricity everywhere, with a few small exceptions. Today, in competitive procurements, renewables come out cheaper than the cheapest coal plants. Last year, we saw record-low auction prices for solar energy in Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Chile. For instance, it cost only three cents per kilowatt-hour. But if you wanted to build a new coal plant, it would cost you three times more, over nine cents.”
The commission VP said: “Fossil fuels are not a good business and we would never try to convince our partners in Africa to buy second-hand fossil fuel technologies.” In terms of the planned partnership between the EU and Africa, he added: “It's about enhancing technology transfer, boosting the transition to new energy resourcing and leapfrogging some of the developments that would lead to higher emissions, rather than to more sustainable energy systems.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/26/italian-ruling-could-facilitate-more-pv-development/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"APRIL 26, 2021",Italian ruling could facilitate more PV development,"PV developers and the legal community in Italy have welcomed a recent ruling by the Council of State, whose opinions will guide the approach that public authorities take to permits for renewables projects.
“Judgment No. 2983/2021 is very important. The Council of State affirmed that (renewable energy) plants are not only an expression of private economic initiative, but represent the public interest, as they contribute – even indirectly – to the protection of environment and landscape,” Andrea Sticchi Damiani, founding partner of law firm Sticchi Damiani, told pv magazine.
Mauro Moroni, founder of Moroni & Partners, goes further. “In this light, private investors involved in RES activities emerge as actors of strategic importance for the implementation of environmental and energy policies,” he said.
Not all experts expect to see immediate impacts, however.
“I don't expect an alignment from the regional and provincial administrations in the short term. However, the council's ruling will certainly be acknowledged by the regional administrative tribunals (TAR) as they settle the many ongoing disputes,” Gianluca Biagio Biscotti, founder of engineering consultancy BFP, told pv magazine. “Unfortunately, even if important, a sentence is not a law in Italy. Hence, I doubt that without a clear and direct legal provision that prevents a discretion often preconceived by public administrations, administrations will smoothly adapt to this new mindset.”
The Council of State has said that renewable energy plants are compatible with areas classified for agricultural purposes by urban planners, according to Sticchi Damiani and Moroni & Partners.
“It pointed out that the opinion of the Ministry of Culture [MIBACT] is not binding where there are no landscape or archaeological constraints. In such cases, therefore, the proceeding authority (in most cases the region) will be called to carry out an independent assessment of the project,” said Sticchi Damiani, referring to MIBACT’s local representatives.
The Ministry of Culture has long been considered an obstacle to PV development in Italy.
“The ruling decreases the local weight of the MIBACT, highlighting how the priority is to realize the plants,” said Moroni.
PV development on agricultural land now has a brighter future in Italy. Local authorities are now expected to be more sensitive to the specific features of projects.
“I have been long arguing that competences in the energy and environment fields should be completely taken away from regions,” said Biscotti, in reference to the Abruzzo region's decision to oppose renewables development on agricultural land. Abruzzo’s regional politicians have imposed a veto until eligible and non-eligible areas are clearly defined.
“On initial examination, it seems likely that the central government – as has happened in many other circumstances – will challenge before the constitutional court any provision aimed at introducing blanket bans on the installation of renewable energy plants in agricultural areas. Should the government fail to challenge the provision, the operators may appeal to the regional administrative court, asking a referral to the Constitutional Court,” said Sticchi Damiani.
Developers agree on the need to define suitable and non-suitable areas.
“It is essential, and we all expect it. We also wish for a regulatory provision that states that, on sites labeled as suitable, rejections can only be exceptions,” said Biscotti.
According to Moroni, suitable areas should speed up development.
“A simplified procedure should be foreseen in suitable areas, allowing investments to go ahead without worrying about not receiving permitting because of demagogic reasons,” he said.
Experts are cautiously optimistic about Roberto Cingolani, Italy’s new minister for the energy transition. “The minister has a huge responsibility. He repeatedly said that he wants to decrease bureaucratic hurdles for RES plants. We all hope that he will do so,” said Moroni.
Biscotti is more critical. “In my opinion, we witnessed many declarations and few concrete facts. From the storytelling of this government, it seems to emerge a strong focus on gas and hydrogen, not much on renewables. However, some days ago, the Italian Senate approved the European Delegation law, with several important decisions on renewable energy,” said Biscotti.
Sticchi Damiani is the most positive. “The minister will be able to defuse the obvious inefficiencies of the system that have generated billions of lost investments.”

The ministry selected four projects with, each, a capacity of 15 MW. Two projects are planned to be located in the Adıyaman province of southeastern Turkey, and their developers offered prices of TRY0.209/kWh ($0.0248) and TRY0.22/kWh ($0.0260).
For the other two projects, which are both expected to be built in the Ağrı province, in the eastern part of the country, final bids were TRY0.282/kWh ($0.0335) and TRY0.289/kWh ($0.0344).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/26/how-to-attract-bees-into-solar-parks/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 26, 2021",How to attract bees into solar parks,"Researchers from the Lancaster University and University of Reading, in the United Kingdom, have proposed a series of recommendations to enhance pollinator biodiversity in solar parks. “The recommendations are not yet codified in guidelines but we hope that this study can provide scientific evidence to contribute to the formation of future guidelines and inform industry development of good practice for pollinators,” research co-author Holly Blaydes told pv magazine. “We hope to work with industry and policy [makers], as appropriate, to achieve this.”
She also explained that the findings are underpinned by literature which focused on the U.K. and northwest Europe, and are, thus, valid for these regions. “However, overarching outcomes are likely to be appropriate to other temperate regions and some of the findings will be universal as the underpinning ecology of pollinators is similar everywhere,” she added. “But, pollinator species vary with region and so to ensure a robust evidence base and identify important differences, ideally, a similar review would be undertaken.”
In the paper Opportunities to enhance pollinator biodiversity in solar parks, published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, the British group explained that biodiversity could be both positively and negatively affected by solar parks, and associated land-use change. In agricultural landscapes that are intensively managed and species-poor, however, solar parks may help to restore the ideal conditions for pollinator habitats. “Creating suitable habitat on solar parks, which are commonly located amongst intensively managed agricultural land, could offer refuges for pollinators in landscapes where much habitat has been lost whilst also increasing landscape heterogeneity and connectivity,” the scientists emphasized.
They created a database with pollinator groups, themes, sub-themes, interventions, and the impact of interventions on pollinators. All of these data were analyzed, each considering foraging resources; nesting; breeding and reproductive resources; site management; landscape and connectivity; and climate. “Management recommendations were based on the evidence within one, or multiple, sub-themes, and assigned a confidence level based on the confidence levels of the relevant sub-themes,” they explained. “Our review suggests enhancement of pollinator biodiversity is achievable through undertaking considered management of solar parks to provide pollinator foraging and reproductive resources, enhance landscape heterogeneity and connectivity, and generate microclimatic variation.”
The academics concluded that solar parks could enhance pollinator resources where they are most needed. “Many pollinators are in decline, both in the U.K. and in other parts of the world,” Blaydes said. “Actions to conserve pollinators include reversing agricultural intensification and maintaining natural habitat, both of which can be achieved within solar parks.”
In another study published this month, a U.S. research group ascertained that the partial shading provided by solar parks creates a microclimate that favors the abundant growth of more varied flowers and pollinators. It also found that partial shading increases bloom abundance by delaying bloom timing, increasing foraging resources for pollinators during the hot and dry season.
Another recent study, from France, has also shown that the environmental consequences of solar on biodiversity tend to vary, depending on species and location.

The largest photovoltaic complex under development in Europe is taking shape near Guadalajara, in central Spain, and will be constructed by Spanish solar developer Solaria Energía.
The Trillo project is planned to have a capacity of 626 MW and construction is scheduled to start on May 7. Its completion should be achieved by the end of this year.
Solaria Energía obtained approval for the construction of the plant in October 2019, when the project was still sized at 450 MW. Just two weeks later, the company reported having obtained an additional favorable approval linked to the Trillo 400 kV node, and the enhancement of the plant to 626 MW.
Although the company presents the complex as a unit, it consists of several units, each with a capacity lower than 50 MW, that have been processed separately.
The “largest in Europe” label is currently being disputed by more developers in Spain. Iberdrola also defines its Francisco Pizarro project, with 590 MW of capacity, as the largest photovoltaic plant currently being developed in Europe. Construction work has already started.
Both plants, however, may fall short of the first place ranking, if the 1 GW project announced by Spanish developer Soto Solar last week will also see its construction begin. The company plans to link the huge facility, known as Erasmo, to energy storage and green hydrogen production.

Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO of Lagos-based Daystar Power, said he has had to go back to clients who have not signed off his company's quotes to renegotiate the price for solar electricity, and Madagascan counterpart Hery-Zo Rajaobelina said he will be forced to extend the leasing contract periods he negotiates with customers.
Jinko, in an uncredited post on the website of trade body the Africa Solar Industry Association, last month warned rising polysilicon prices and an historic shortage of shipping containers, compounded by customs clearance delays suffered because of Covid-19 disruption, would force prices up until at least mid June.
“The module makers eventually cannot bear the cost pressure any more, which is transmitted from the upstream sector as material shortages [continue] to ascend,” read the Jinko statement. Those input and logistics cost pressures have driven prices for mainstream monocrystalline silicon panels as high as RMB1.78/W ($0.27), said the manufacturer, adding: “The turbulence of the solar PV supply chain will last at least three months or longer, [until] supply and demand will further improve and rebalance again.”
Von Hardenberg, whose company installs solar for commercial and industrial clients in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Togo, said the price hikes have been occurring since last summer.

“For us there have been two drivers of price increases: equipment costs and freight,” he said. “In July, we would have paid $0.20/Wp. That same panel price rose 15% by the end of 2020. The equipment price has since relaxed, it is not back to July levels but is maybe 7-8% higher than in July.
“For freight … that’s shocking, what happened there, I think. The cost of shipping a container from China to West Africa has increased by a factor of five or six. So if we paid $2,000-3,000 in July, it cost $10,000-15,000 by December. These two, combined, result in significant price increases.”
With panels representing only part of total solar project costs, that 20% PV module price rise has translated into a 5% rise in project costs for Daystar. The installer will absorb the costs on contract offers it has signed with customers, said the CEO but, since December, unsigned quotes have had to be renegotiated.
“We had to look at all our project pricing in December and we had to go back to some clients and say ‘we can’t do our original price any more,’” added Von Hardenberg.
Rajaobelina, of Madagascar-based GC Solar SA has faced a similar dilemma, and told pv magazine: “It's up to us and our partner; either to decrease our margin or to increase the length of the leasing contract [offered by GC Solar to the customer].”
He anticipates future leasing deals – under which the installer adds the rooftop solar system and sells the electricity generated to the client – will have a duration of 10-12-years, rather than the typical eight-year term which GC Solar has offered to date.

In Rajaobelina's case, at least the full impact of the panel price rises is yet to kick in. “For our projects, generally the providers used to send out their previous stock, so we can manage with that,” he said. “For future projects, the suppliers have put the prices up. For projects we install now, we use solar panels which have cost around $1.30/W but for future projects, for the end of this year, we have seen that become around $1.40-1.45/W.”
Daystar chief Von Hardenberg found a partial workaround by paying directly for shipping and said: “It’s surprising that a small company in West Africa can get better freight costs than a big multinational, so I suspect there is some margin there for [the solar manufacturers].”
GC Solar already bought its panels at factory-gate prices and paid for shipping itself. Administrator-general Rajaobelina accepted the current punishing shipping costs are a result of the Covid-19 crisis, a situation which, in theory, should ease once the global vaccination effort starts to take effect. Asked about the prospect of prices coming back down at some point, he smiled wryly and took a drag on his cigarette, before adding: “Those prices won't come back down.”
In terms of the wider impact of more expensive panel prices on the roll-out of African solar, both company bosses were sanguine, albeit with different rationales.
For Von Hardenberg, the fact other solar project components, such as inverters and batteries, are continuing to benefit from cost falls means solar will continue to remain competitive in West Africa. Besides, he explained, wildly fluctuating local currencies and rates of inflation, plus costly finance add up to ensure unpredictable costs are par for the course in Africa. Things are improving at least on the latter point, he said, adding: “Three years ago, if you tried to get a loan from a Nigerian bank for solar, they would say ‘Solar? I can’t use that as collateral.’ Now they are much more open to the idea.”
For Rajaobelina, panel price rises are less of a worry than the other odds stacked against him in an island nation where he says the government subsidizes diesel-dependent wholesale electricity from generation costs of around $0.35/kWh to the extent customers can be billed as little as $0.02/kWh.
“That makes it impossible,” he said, of having to compete, “This is why our leases are for eight years.”

Coal India Limited, which accounts for around 80% of the country's domestic coal production, has announced it has signed its first power purchase agreement (PPA) for the sale of solar electricity. The coal producer signed the PPA with Gujarat state utility Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) to sell the power generated by the 100 MW solar plant for INR2.20/kWh (€0.024) for 25 years.
In its maiden venture into solar power generation, Coal India secured the 100 MW project in a 500 MW reverse auction conducted by GUVNL which also saw NTPC, Sprng Energy, and Tata Power’s TP Saurya allocated generation capacity at the same price.
With a capital investment of INR442 crore (€48.9 million), Coal India will execute the 100 MW project through a solar engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor. In a back-to-back arrangement, the coal company had already issued the tender to finalize the EPC company. The project will be executed within a year from the date of placement of the work order, Coal India said in a statement.
The fossil fuel business is following counterpart NLC by entering the solar market.
Coal India Ltd (CIL) this month announced two new business units: CIL Solar PV and CIL Navikarniya Urja, with both intended to capitalize on the growth opportunities in solar. CIL Solar PV Limited will manufacture ingots, wafers, cells and modules.

pv magazine: You recently took over as the CEO of REC. What do you see as your most important task to start with?
Jan Bicker: REC‘s most important asset is – and has been for 25 years – our innovations, which is why we’re totally focused on expanding our successful REC Alpha Series. We’re launching a new-generation Alpha module that not only delivers significantly better power output, but also has much less impact on the environment at the production stage. It’s good that this entire question of the environmental footprint is gaining traction. We already have the world‘s lowest carbon footprint for our silicon production in Norway. But we have to keep up the momentum. We have also given our ‘classic’ products, the TwinPeak and N-Peak, a facelift upgrade, and plan to bring out new generations of solar panels in these series. We’re also looking to expand capacity at our Singapore site as well as with a potential new factory in France.
What does it mean for you to become CEO of a company that celebrates its 25th anniversary this year?
I can honestly say it’s a great honor to take over at the helm of a company that is such a pioneer in the solar industry. REC is basically as old as the industry itself. Not many companies can stake a claim to this longevity. Having a management team with so much experience and such a great track record also makes my job a lot easier.
Until recently you were REC's chief financial officer. How did REC do financially in 2020?
Owing to the pandemic, 2020 was a year of mixed fortunes for REC, as for many other companies. In the first six months we had to contend with corona restrictions, the impact on supply chains and short-term uncertainties in global markets. What made it even more challenging for REC was that we launched the Alpha just before the pandemic struck. The timing was unfortunate, to say the least. But we turned things around fast, and recovered strongly in the second half of the year, with REC and the Alpha product doing very well on the markets, particularly in the U.S.
How do you think the pandemic has changed the solar industry in general and REC in particular?
In general, corona has reinforced the focus on sustainability at all levels – in policymaking, business, and also among consumers. New policy programs such as the Green Deal in Europe are springing up; corporations are making huge investments in solar power. And after months of working from home due to the pandemic, more consumers are now discovering solar as a simple way to cut electricity bills, be more autonomous, and contribute to reducing carbon emissions. However, seeing how the pandemic has disrupted supply chains, there are renewed calls at national level for countries to be more independent of products made in China. This of course has a huge impact on the solar industry, since China accounts for three-quarters of module production worldwide. This will increasingly work to the advantage of REC, which has production sites in Singapore, Norway and perhaps France in the future. What was positive for me personally was seeing how well REC is positioned for remote working. I find the collaboration between our global teams works even better than before corona. So even once the pandemic is over, working from home will continue to be part of the REC regime.
You want to build a new factory in France. How advanced are the plans?
The new module manufacturing facility in France would be an excellent project for REC, for France and for Europe in general. However, it’s also highly challenging. It involves so much more than just defining what equipment you need, what the production lines should look like and what production costs to expect. We also have to analyse precisely what the market will be for a “Made in France” solar panel – specifically, do I have the right distribution channels, not to mention the right network? This isn’t something you can put in place overnight. It takes years of experience and an excellent network of contacts. REC, with our long history in the industry, does indeed have these resources. We have just completed the public consultation process in France. However, there are still a number of stages to complete before the final decision, which will probably be by June.
Do you have any further plans to expand production?
We would like to expand production at our main site in Singapore. It would definitely be possible. We have already expanded before, and shown there is a real demand for REC solar panels “Made in Singapore,” especially in the U.S., where we in fact sell everything we supply.
What do you expect REC's top markets to be this year?
The U.S. is currently our top market, followed by Australia and Europe, especially the Benelux region. In their bid to outdo other players, Chinese competitors are announcing more and more powerful modules.
How is REC countering this challenge? Can we expect more new developments this year?
It’s not difficult to deliver higher power output if you make the module a lot larger. We’re not worried about that sort of development. What matters for us and for our customers, particularly in the rooftop segment, is power efficiency, or power output per square meter. Our Alpha solar panel has one of the best power efficiency ratings on the market. The current generation has a power output of 217 Wp/m2, and the new series will deliver even more. Bigger is not always better. There are also limits in terms of market acceptance. We see the limit at M6 for residential and M10 for commercial solar installations.
How do you see the role of solar energy in combatting climate change, and what do you expect of COP26?
I am convinced that solar energy is one of the key pillars to combat climate change. It's cost-effective and doesn't require extra land. A solar system is quickly installed, and it will operate for 25 years or more. People have been underestimating the potential of our industry for years. So what I expect of COP26 is that countries will realize they need to set far more ambitious goals to expand solar. In our climate study after the Paris Agreement, we calculated exactly what contribution solar can make, and what a forward-looking energy mix could look like, using Germany as an example. To hit the target, Germany would have had to install around four times more solar capacity in the past few years than it has actually achieved. This is possible, as we saw in 2010-12.
Where do you think we will be in 2050?
By 2050, solar will be the absolutely dominant energy source, in an electricity market that will by then have grown significantly. Thanks to technology innovations in solar panels and storage, especially large-scale storage, electricity will be very cost-competitive.
In transportation, fossil-fuel combustion engines will have disappeared; it will be much quieter on the roads. What we still don’t know is which fuel – electric or hydrogen – will come out ahead.
What are you most passionate about?
I am passionate about solar and the opportunities it presents for a future with easy availability of clean, cheap electricity. I also find it incredibly exciting that more and more countries are realizing that the access to cheap, clean power is a significant competitive advantage for an economy.
And then there is “Tiger Beer brewed by the sun.”
A few years ago, Tiger Beer Brewery installed REC solar panels on their roof in Singapore, where also our main production site is based. Marking their pride in the installation, every Tiger Beer now bears a label that says “Brewed by the Sun.” This makes me proud too, and it’s a reminder of just what is possible with solar energy and REC. I’m really looking forward to having a meal out in Singapore with colleagues or friends, so I can order a “Tiger Beer brewed by the Sun” – and play my part as an ambassador for more solar energy. There are still a lot of free rooftops in this world. It’s time to make them electric.

French cooperative Céléwatt has completed construction on a 250 kW solar park in Carayac, a commune in the Lot department in southwestern France.
The ground-mounted array was built with mounting structures made of raw oak wood, that was not processed in a sawmill. To optimize the mechanical characteristics of the rough wood and to avoid any discontinuity in the fibers, 600 oaks were cut, out of the growing season.
A first in France and in the world, this mounting structure concept was developed by French engineering company Mécojit. “After the final checks carried out by Mécojit, an Enedis technician made the connection at the end of the morning,” CéléWatt said in a press release. Enedis is France's grid operator.
Less than 18 months elapsed between the filing of the project approval request and the first kilowatt-hour being produced which, according to Céléwatt, proves the feasibility of community and regional renewable energy. The project was also supported by French energy cooperative Enercoop, which will buy power from the plant at a price of €0.08/kWh.
“Our original idea was to promote local employment and natural resources,” Bertrand Delpeuch, the president of Céléwatt, told pv magazine in November. “As we had no room for maneuver on the origin of our 746 monocrystalline panels, which are delivered to us from China by the company Talesun, we decided to focus on the poles.”
The stability of the panels will be checked every three years with a visual inspection of the resistance of the wood and a general overhaul will be carried out during the ten-year maintenance work. Céléwatt stated that everything was done to maximize the array's duration over time. “This is a very resistant and endogenous wood species, which will not fear weather fluctuations,” it added.

The company said it competed against two other unspecified international bidders. It has secured the rights to develop, fund, build, operate and maintain the PV power plant, but without a fixed tariff or feed-in premium.
“Solarpro Holding will give 18% of the annual revenues to Elektrani na Severna Makedonija (ESM) for the next 35 years,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “After that, the PV power plant will be transferred to the public partner.”
ESM is North Macedonia’s state-owned utility. It launched the tender in December 2019.
“ESM provided the construction site with all the permissions and grid connection opportunities, and we are obliged to build the plant and to split the revenues with it,” the spokesperson said. “We plan to sell its energy with merchant agreements on the local electricity market or with power purchase agreements (PPAs).”
Solarpro said that the installation will be its second solar project in North Macedonia. Last year, it won another tender to build a 10 MW solar park in Makedonski Brod.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Balkan country had around 94 MW of cumulative installed PV capacity by the end of 2020. Thermal power plants account for 842 MW of North Macedonia’s total power generation capacity of 1.41 GW, with hydroelectricity and wind accounting for 553.6 MW and 36.8 MW, respectively.

CELA Clean Energy Latin America, a financial advisory and strategic consultancy focused on renewable energy, has just published a study on power purchase agreements signed by wind and solar companies in Brazil's open electricity market.
The study was based on interviews and questionnaires conducted by eight of the largest renewables companies in the country. Together have more than 4.3 GW of operational renewables capacity installed in Brazil.
CELA Clean Energy Latin America analzyed 70 PPAs already signed in the free energy market (Ambiente de Contratación Libre – ACL). The total capacity is equivalent to 1.7 GW. In terms of the installed capacity of projects with energy contracted in the ACL, there are approximately 6.5 GW of installations, with solar accounting for approximately 5 GWp of the total, with 1.5 GW of wind capacity. The installed capacity that CELA Clean Energy Latin America analyzed corresponds to about 30% of the total installed operating capacity of wind and solar sources in Brazil today.
Five of the participating companies are IPPs. They are large power generators that operate the facilities with long-term objectives. Three of them are developers (companies that sell their projects at some point).
Based on CELA Clean Energy Latin America's previous study, conducted last year, it is now clear that the volume of power contracted in the free market in Brazil has grown 2.6 times since January 2020. CELA Clean Energy Latin America's latest study analyzes the evolution of PPA timeframes, prices, and indexation curves.
The consultancy said it has also considered the most-used contracts, such as independent energy production and self-consumption, the segmentation of off-takers, and data on the marketing and sales strategies of the companies it interviewed.
“In 2020 and 2021, the wind and solar PV sectors are much more mature, and companies are increasingly prepared to develop and negotiate these PPAs,” says Camila Ramos, the CEO of CELA Clean Energy Latin America. The study shows that the conditions for PPAs, including pricing, have evolved considerably. The financing environment has also become more competitive.
