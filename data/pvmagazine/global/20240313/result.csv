The seven sites, located from North Devon to Lincolnshire, will have a combined installed solar capacity of 330 MW. The developer will install a 35 MW BESS at the Langford site and a 10 MW BESS at the Claydon site. It said it is building the other five sites to facilitate the future co-location of battery storage, in order to maximize the best use of the grid.
The developer said it will install the first projects from the solar portfolio it secured through the acquisition of JBM Solar. Mobilization is now underway at the sites, and the projects have secured contracts for difference.
UK contractors Ethical Power and Equans Solar & Storage have won construction contracts for the projects and will provide engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services.
The first of the seven sites is expected to become fully operational by the end of this year. Once all of the sites are fully operational, they will be capable of meeting the average annual electricity needs of over 140,000 typical UK homes.
“Quick to deploy and using the most modern solar technologies, we aim to maximize the generation potential of these sites for the UK; with a national target to increase solar capacity fivefold by 2035 and similar for battery storage, our projects will play a key role in helping ensure the UK decarbonizes its power grid and achieves its challenging net zero targets,” said Katja Wünschel, the CEO of RWE Renewables Europe & Australia.
RWE has set a target of commissioning about 450 MW of new UK solar capacity per year up to 2030 in support of the national solar targets. Globally, it plans to increase its installed solar capacity from 3.9 GW to 16 GW by 2030.
In February, the company announced the construction of a 450 MW plant in Greece and its first utility-scale storage facility in the Netherlands.

In its strategic plan for the 2024-27 period, Spanish inverter manufacturer Power Electronics said it plans to invest €300 million ($328 million) to expand its inverter production capacity in Spain and the United States.
A company spokesperson told pv magazine that its current production capacity is 30 GW, and it will increase manufacturing capacity in the United States by more than 20 GW by 2026.
The new factory will cover an area of 174,015 square meters and “will be designed with the latest manufacturing and assembly technologies to serve as an optimal center for the manufacturing and distribution of its products throughout the country,” said the company.
The plan also foresees the completion of a new plant in Llíria, Spain, for the Electric Mobility division.
Power Electronics products are present in almost 2,000 plants in 35 countries around the world. The company closed the year 2023 with an installed AC power capacity of 91 GW. According to Wood Mackenzie's report on inverter shipments in 2022 published in August, Power Electronics is ranked seventh globally.

3,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/13/european-parliament-approves-legal-requirement-to-install-solar-on-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-03-13,European Parliament approves legal requirement to install solar on buildings,"Members of European Parliament (MEPs) have adopted the EU Solar Standard, which will require the installation of solar on buildings across EU member states.
The standard forms part of the European Performance of Buildings Directive, which was provisionally agreed upon in December. The directive was formally approved by MEPs on Monday, with 370 votes to 199 plus 46 abstentions, and will now have to be formally endorsed by the Council of Ministers to become law.
The legislation says that if technically and economically suitable, EU member states will have to deploy solar installations progressively in public and non-residential buildings, depending on their size.
It sets a timeline of integrating solar installations into building works of new commercial and public buildings by 2026, on commercial and public buildings that undergo relevant renovations by 2027, on new residential buildings by 2029 and on existing public buildings by 2030.
Agricultural and historic buildings can be excluded, while EU member states can decide to exclude buildings for their special architectural or historical merit, temporary buildings, and churches and places of worship.
The directive is aiming to help reduce energy consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions in the EU’s building sector, as it works towards climate neutrality by 2050. According to the European Commission, buildings in the EU are responsible for 40% of the area's energy consumption and 36% of its greenhouse gas emissions.
Jan Osenberg, Senior Policy Advisor at SolarPower Europe said the EU Solar Standard “puts the power in citizens’ hands and will enshrine the energy transition into the places where we sleep, work, and live”.
“As the grid catches up to the energy transition, installing energy generation where we use energy will also help the grid, by keeping electricity local and empowering citizens with the information and technical ability to use electricity smartly,” he explained. “They can see when they are generating more electricity and can adjust their consumption accordingly.”
Osenberg added that the law must be translated into reality with “effective integration into construction practices and building requirements”. He said exemptions, support measures and system design criteria will all have to be defined.
European countries including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Germany already have similar measures in place, which Osenberg says ministers and stakeholders can use to draw upon the best practices.
A SolarPower Europe report, published at the end of last year, put the European Union's total installed solar capacity at 263 GW, after 56 GW of solar was deployed in 2023, a 27% year-on-year increase.
The report also forecast 73.8 GW to be installed in 2025, followed by 84.2 GW in 2026 and 93.1 GW in 2027.

In 2022, 1,060 MW were installed, followed by 850 MW in 2021, 1,010 MW in 2020, 544 MW in 2019, and 367 MW in 2018.
Approximately 1.4 GW of last year's newly deployed capacity was installed in the Dutch-speaking macro-region of Flanders. Around 426 MW was deployed in the French-speaking region of Wallonia. The metropolitan region of Brussels installed another 11 MW.
Each of Belgium’s three macro-regions has its own individual regulatory framework for solar and renewable energy.
Energie Commune said the new statistics are based on provisional data and that another 200 MW of PV capacity could still be missing, which means growth for last year may be even higher.
“The rise in energy and electricity prices had a strong impact on Belgium, as most European countries, thus motivating some to invest in an installation photovoltaic,” the association said. “The three Regions benefited from a temporary reduction in the VAT rate to 6% for the purchase of a photovoltaic installation installed on residential buildings that are less than 10 years old.”

5,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/13/policy-recommendations-to-support-u-s-rooftop-solar-installations/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-13,Policy recommendations to support U.S. rooftop solar installations,"From pv magazine USA
Among the leading sources of electricity, solar has the unique advantage of being able to be installed in a distributed fashion, integrating it with the built environment, preserving land and reducing transmission infrastructure needs. Rooftop residential solar can offer homeowners bill savings or price predictability in the long run, and when paired with a battery, offers a value-add of backup power and extreme weather resilience.
Environment America modeled the viable technical potential for rooftop solar in the United States, finding that it can serve 45% of U.S. electricity demand based on 2022 levels. In 2022, rooftop solar generated about 1.5% of the total electricity consumed.
Solar is also now the most cost-effective new generation source in most markets and most conditions in the United States. On average, new-build solar costs 29% less than the next-cheapest fossil fuel alternative, said a report from Ernst and Young.
For homeowners, rooftop solar can represent long-term bill savings and predictability. Environment America said though the initial investment can be substantial, most buyers can expect to break even in about eight to nine years and can expect to save between $20,000 to $96,000 on bills over the 25-year-plus life of the system.
Rooftop solar “has myriad benefits for the environment and consumers,” said Environment America. This includes reducing the need for dirty power plants and expensive transmission lines, providing lower costs, and can help to increase the grid’s resilience to extreme weather and other shocks.
Policy recommendations
Environment America made a series of policy recommendations for states and local governments to help tap the massive potential of U.S. rooftops in a recent report.
First, it recommends that states update their grid interconnection policies to align with best practices. It recommended referencing the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) Model Interconnection Procedures, 2023 edition, to support beneficial interconnection procedures.
For permitting, it recommends cities and counties to establish online automated permitting systems for small onsite solar project. SolarAPP+, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is a free online automated permitting software for local governments. Furthermore, states can support automated permitting by funding technical backup programs for local governments implementing the software, said the report.
Environment America said states can provide support for installation of solar on community buildings, like schools, libraries, and community centers. Nearly one in 10 K-12 schools in the United States have rooftop solar. Working against its stated climate goals, California enacted a rulemaking decision in 2023 that made it more difficult for schools, renters, and other multi-meter properties to adopt solar.
It also recommended that states adopt policies that enable the creation of virtual power plants (VPP), which lets customers sell electricity from their solar-attached batteries to the grid during times of peak demand. VPPs help customers get a return on their solar investment, and they help squeeze out peak demand reserve natural gas plants, known as peaker plants, that are highly inefficient.
Some states, even ones with massive rooftop solar potential like Florida, do not enable customers to use power purchase agreements (PPA) or other third-party financed solar projects. This shrinks the potential market size, as PPA often offer a no-upfront cost installation, securing a predictable cost of electricity for the long run. PPAs work similarly to leases in their financial structure. Environment America recommends legislating PPA access state law to open a larger market.
A major recommendation from Environment America is the support of clear, long-term rules for net energy metering (NEM). NEM involves customers exporting solar production to the grid in exchange for credit on their utility bill. In California, NEM rates were cut in April 2023 by about 80%. The market has since cratered, with nearly 20,000 jobs lost and numerous installers declaring bankruptcy.
“States should take into account the full benefits of rooftop solar, including present and future climate benefits, land conservation and community resilience benefits, and reduction in the need for new transmission and distribution lines, when determining how solar power owners should be compensated for the electricity they supply to the grid,” said Environment America.
The organization said states sure ensure consistent and predictable compensation for the lifetime of a solar investment. Overly complex metering and compensation systems that change frequently lower consumer confidence and adoption. It also suggested utilities should not assess discriminatory fees on rooftop solar customers.
“Utilities must honor commitments they made to customers who installed solar panels in past years regarding how much they would be paid for solar energy they supply to the grid,” said the report.
Finally, Environment America suggests states should ensure access to rooftop solar for renters and in low-income communities. This would include supporting virtual net metering programs and community solar programs.
California has recently worked in direct contrast to these recommendations, damaging both virtual net metering and community solar efforts in its state, despite claims from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that it is concerned about equity in solar adoption.

These figures do not include data from the Palestinian territories for 2021 to 2023.
Eitan Parnass, the founder and director of Israel’s Green Energy Association, told pv magazine that all of the newly added capacity in 2023 consists of solar, including utility-scale PV plants awarded through tender schemes and small systems backed by feed-in tariffs.
Similarly, more than 90% of about 6 GW of renewables installed today in Israel are PV systems. Israel’s wind energy resources are less strong, resulting in fewer wind power installations.
The Electricity Authority has also noted that the increase in electricity demand in Israel is higher than other Western countries due to reasons such as the rising population and relatively high economic growth.
Renewable energy covered 12.5% of Israel’s electricity demand last year, up from 10.1% in 2022. Given the country’s steady increase of annual electricity demand and in order to maintain these rates, Israel needs to continue to add significant amounts of green power, said the Electricity Authority.
However, Israel aims to generate 30% of its electricity from renewable energy by 2030.

8,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/13/european-roads-rails-may-host-403-gw-of-vertical-pv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-13,"European roads, rails may host 403 GW of vertical PV","The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has assessed the potential of both monofacial and bifacial vertical PV installations deployed along roads and rails across the European Union.
“This is the first systematic, pan-European investigation of the total PV potential associated with roads and railways, considering different technologies and configurations,” the scientists said, referring to the novelty of their work.
For their road analysis, the researchers used open-access spatially explicit data, a road network derived from the OpenStreetMap project, which is an open-access geographic database maintained by a community of volunteers, and highway datasets of the European Union.  They identified motorways, trunk roads, and primary roads suitable for vertical PV installations and excluded secondary and tertiary roads, as well as sections with tunnels, bridges, and intersections.
As for the rail analysis, the academics utilized data from the Geographical Reference database of the European Commission (GISCO) and discarded underground lines, junctions, and stations.
They also specified that their overall analysis reflected the limitation imposed by the road or rail direction at a given location for the orientation of the PV system. “This was in turn determined by dividing the transport infrastructure into 500m-long segments and estimating the mean direction of each segment,” they stressed. “The orientation of the corresponding PV structure was defined as perpendicular to the segment direction in both clockwise and anticlockwise senses.”
The scientists found that the EU transport infrastructure may potentially host 403 GW of vertical PV capacity, which they said would correspond to an annual energy production of 391 TWh. They also found that the annual energy potential per km of the EU's transport infrastructure is approximately 0.65 GWh/km/yr for bifacial PV.
“Cyprus and Latvia stand out as the biggest potential beneficiaries in relative terms, with the potential to cover 75% of their current electricity consumption per capita,” the academics noted.
Their findings are available in the study “European transport infrastructure as a solar photovoltaic energy hub,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.
Recent research from the Netherlands revealed that vertical PV systems tend to provide unexpected yield gains compared to horizontal arrays and have found that vertical installations have much lower operating temperatures. These scientists ascertained that vertical arrays operate at a temperature difference with respect to ambient that is “nearly halved,” which they said results in a 2.5% higher annual energy yield.

9,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/13/dynamic-photovoltaic-blinds-for-glaze-facade-buildings/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,CHINA",LIOR KAHANA,2024-03-13,Dynamic photovoltaic blinds for glaze-façade buildings,"Researchers from China have developed a new dynamic and vertical photovoltaic integrated building envelope (dvPVBE) system for high-rise glaze-façade buildings.
The novelty of the system lies in its flexibility with weather-responsive slat angles and blind positions. “Recently, highly dynamic and weather-responsive PVBEs have been studied to further improve building energy efficiency,” the academics said. “However, relatively complex structures are not suitable for high-rise buildings because of their weak windproofing characteristics, which prevent their large-scale application in cities. Consequently, the development of simple, flexible, and intelligent PV shading devices continues to present significant challenges.”
To solve those issues, the scientists designed the proposed system as a tight external layer of windows. In a prototype they made, the frame structure and blind slats were made of aluminum alloy, with the solar cells being integrated into the slats. The slats were controlled by a motor, hidden in a top-frame structure.
“Unlike traditional static external blinds, the slats of the dvPVBE can stop at any height of the frame and rotate between 0 degrees and 90 degrees via the precise stroke control of the motor,” they explained. “The blinds can be deployed partially or fully.”
The dvPVBE can be controlled either manually by the building's occupants or automatically by three automatic control strategies, which the group called power generation priority (PGP), natural daylight priority (NDP), and energy-saving priority (ESP). In each, the slat angle and blind position are controlled by a set of inputs – such as incident solar radiation, room occupation, indoor illumination, and real-time electrical power consumption and generation. Blind position refers to the distance from the top frame to the bottom slat.
The PGP and ESP control strategies were further investigated in a computer simulation. A 24-story office building in Beijing, China, was designed for the tasks, with no additional high-rise buildings surrounding it. A representative room of 5 m × 5 m × 3 m located on the south-facing façade was simulated in that building, with a window-to-wall ratio of 70%. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) temperatures were set to below 26 C in summer and above 18 C in winter.
Including a start-up period, during the working days, the system was in operation from 7:00 to 18:00. The PV on the slats was simulated as having 26 monocrystalline silicon cells per slat on 24 slats per window. The cells were assumed to be provided by Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar, with an efficiency of 21.32%. The slat angels were able to change by increments of 5 degrees. Four typical days around the vernal equinox, summer solstice, autumnal equinox, and winter solstice were selected for the analysis.
“For the control strategies of the dvPVBE, the PGP strategy was used during non-working hours, and the ESP strategy was used during working hours,” the researcher said. “To further demonstrate the viability of the dvPVBE in enhancing building energy efficiency and conduct a fair comparison with static PV blinds, the simulation primarily focused on evaluating the influence of adjustable slat angles on energy performance.”
The simulation showed that the dvPVBE system exhibited superior energy performance compared with the static PVBEs throughout the year. The dvPVBE covered 131% of the office room's annual energy demand. Compared to the static system, the net energy output increased by at least 226%.
“For most of the daytime throughout the year in Beijing, 45° – 60° slat angles are recommended to balance the utilization of natural light and solar energy,” the academic group emphasized. “In the early morning, large slat angles are recommended to allow sufficient daylight penetration to lower the lighting load, particularly in the winter.”
The academics introduced the novel concept in the study “A New Dynamic and Vertical Photovoltaic Integrated Building Envelope for High-Rise Glaze-Facade Buildings,” published in Engineering. The group was formed by scientists coming from China's Shenzhen University, Tsinghua University, Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hunan University, State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geotechnics and Tunnelling, and the Ministry of Education.

Inorganic FeSi2-based solar cells have recently drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community as these devices offer superior thermal stability and good optoelectronic properties compared to conventional solar cells. Furthermore, Fe and Si used to form FeSi2 are abundant in nature.
The scientists explained that their tandem cell takes advantage of combining the larger bandgap of the top CdTe cell and the smaller bandgap of the bottom FeSi2 cell. “The top cell transforms photons with elevated energy efficiently while minimizing thermalization losses and transmitting the solar spectrum in the close-infrared region light to the lower cell,” they highlighted. “In order to improve light absorption, it is crucial to reduce the undesired losses at the junction resulting from Fresnel surface reflection.”
The scientists used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell configuration. They assumed the top cell to be built with an n-type cadmium sulfide (CdS) window layer, the CdTe absorber, and a back surface field (BSF) based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The bottom cell was designed with an n-type CdS window layer, the FeSi2 absorber, and a copper tin sulfide (Cu2SnS3) BSF.
In the simulation, the team considered parameters such as energy bandgap, diffusion length, and doping concentration. “CdTe has featured a 1.5 eV bandgap and a 4.28 eV electron affinity, while the bandgap and electron affinity of FeSi2 are 0.87 eV and 4.16 eV, respectively,” it specified. “An optimal, slender tunnel junction connecting the upper and lower cells with monolithic architecture has been assumed for the electrical linkage.”
The numerical analysis showed that the top CdTe cell may potentially achieve a power conversion efficiency of 26.13%, while the FeSi2 bottom cell may reach up to 35.25%. It also demonstrated that the tandem device may achieve an efficiency of 43.91%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.928 V, a short-circuit current of 25.338 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 88.88%.
“These results suggest the practical feasibility of fabricating high-performance CdTe–FeSi2 double-junction tandem solar cells for efficient solar energy conversion,” the scientists affirmed.
The cell was described in the study “Design and optimization of a high efficiency CdTe–FeSi2 based double-junction two-terminal tandem solar cell,” published in Heliyon.

Since spring 2023, fans of German football team SC Freiburg have had some protection from the weather when they cycle to the stadium. A 300-meter-long PV roof stretches over part of the cycle path – Germany's first system of its kind.
Austrian startup Mo Energy Systems, which is in which already presented standardized solutions for photovoltaic facades last year, has now developed a standardized system for such solar cycle paths.
Thanks to prefabrication, the system is quick to install, according to the manufacturer. Around 100 meters of cycle path can be covered within a few days, Mo Energy Systems said. It developed the product together with the Austrian company PR Stromkreis Elektrotechnik and architectural firm Gerold Strehle.
The 12-meter standard elements are designed to make it possible to equip routes of any length with PV. The width is between 2 meters and 4.5 meters. Mo Energy Systems calculates that a km of cycle path with a width of 3 meters could generate around 450,000 kWh of electricity per year.
In addition to the modules and brackets, each structure includes a steel substructure with cables as well as a foundation. The anchoring is implemented without any concrete or excavation work. The inverters are integrated into the supporting structure.
According to Mo Energy Systems, the system is vandal-proof and can be dismantled and reassembled elsewhere without leaving any residue. Maintenance and cleaning are carried out using rail-guided stationary or temporary trolleys.
The project was awarded the “Special Prize for Visionary Concepts” at the 4th Innovation Award for Integrated Photovoltaics of the Austrian Technology Platform Photovoltaics (TPPV). The prize will be awarded on April 4, 2024, in Vienna.

13,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/13/new-zealand-welcomes-first-big-battery-to-national-grid/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,2024-03-13,New Zealand welcomes first big battery to national grid,"From pv magazine Australia
New Zealand’s first utility-scale battery energy storage system has commenced operation with electricity distribution company WEL Networks confirming that its 35 MW/35 MWh Rotohiko battery facility has completed testing and commissioning.
The battery is located at Huntly in the Waikato region on the upper North Island and is the first of its scale to commence operations in New Zealand.
Wel said the grid-connected facility, which includes 16 battery modules, eight inverters and four transformers, will deliver strengthened reliability of electricity supply for Waikato customers and will benefit the national grid through its ability to help correct supply and demand imbalances.
The battery is connected to WEL’s 33 kV local lines network but is capable of providing fast reserve support for the North Island grid at times of high demand, enhancing grid stability and resilience and allowing for more renewable energy generation to be connected to the grid.
WEL said the Rotohiko battery, which will store enough energy to meet the daily demands of more than 2,000 homes, will participate in the electricity market providing instantaneous reserves and undertaking energy trading.
“The 35MWh BESS is the first battery of its scale in New Zealand and something we’re very proud of,” WEL said. “It will deliver huge benefits by improving the resilience of the electricity system, while also increasing the value of intermittent renewable generation in the region.”
Transpower New Zealand, the state-owned operator of the national grid, said the battery will play a pivotal role in the reduction of emissions in the Waikato and will move the nation closer to its goal of becoming 100% renewable by 2030.
“We see the Rotohiko battery as a milestone achievement by WEL, and we look forward to working with industry over the years to come to connect more batteries and other flexible resources to the power system to realize New Zealand’s renewable future,” Transpower said.
While the Rotohiko battery is the largest of its kind currently operating in New Zealand, it will soon be overshadowed by the 100 MW / 200 MWh Ruakākā BESS being constructed by Meridian Energy about 150 km north of Auckland.
Renewables developer Meridian has already commenced construction of the battery with project completion expected in the second half of 2024. The BESS project is stage one of a two-stage project that anticipates the future construction of a 130 MW solar farm.

14,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/13/car-batteries-can-optimize-the-power-grid/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,AUSTRALIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-03-13,Car batteries can optimize the power grid,"Research from Australia suggests that employing electric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) connections at a 10% penetration rate can reduce peak demand charges for local substations by 6% and substantially lower fueling costs for electric vehicle (EV) owners. However, without proper management, EV penetration levels above 20% could negate those benefits.
The study, ‘Network tariffs for V2G,’ conducted by enX and commissioned by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), aimed to explore the interaction between dynamic electricity and network tariffs (which are real-time, similar to wholesale pricing tools) and the increasing number of EVs connecting to the grid. The study also sought to understand how these EVs could help alleviate grid pressure in comparison to fixed time-of-use tariffs.

Findings indicate that V2G connections under dynamic pricing, specifically tariff types s3 & s6 in the chart above, led to the greatest substation peak demand shaving. These same dynamic pricing tariffs also saved significant amounts on EV owners’ electricity bills, with some V2G participants earning a net positive revenue on their vehicles’ electricity use, including one small account that covered 100% of their overall electricity use.
The analysis examined the load at the Metford substation in New South Wales, Australia, specifically focusing on one of the highest peak demand days of the year, March 6, 2023. On this day, the maximum peak demand reached 41.6 MW at 6 pm. Under a dynamic pricing electricity and network tariff focused on peak shedding, the substation experienced a reduction of 2.54 MW in peak load. This reduction accounted for 6.29% of the substation’s peak demand value.
The analysis also found that an early morning peak is developing and expected to reach a high-stress point as V2G EVs hit a 20% uptake rate.

The dynamic pricing model achieved the most significant reduction in peak demand when applied to both network charges (including transmission, distribution, and demand-type charges) and electricity pricing. This model priced electricity based on current market rates, contrasting with time-of-use pricing that relies on fixed periods of higher and lower rates.
The analysis also revealed that a combination of bidirectional network support tariff and spot passthrough pricing (scenario s5) resulted in a reduction of 2.11 MW, nearly matching the 2.54 MW in savings from the optimal model. Models s3, s5, and s6 all generated significant savings for their car owners, as well as significant peak shaving for the substation.

In total, the analysis modeled 520 unique user accounts, including customers with solar power installations of varying sizes and diverse patterns of electricity usage. The study was motivated by projections for the year 2050, which predict a significant increase in EV battery capacity. According to the document, EV battery capacity is expected to reach approximately 2.4 TWh, four times the estimated power grid storage capacity of 0.64 TWh. The researchers emphasize that unlocking the potential of these batteries will be crucial for optimizing the power grids of the future.
