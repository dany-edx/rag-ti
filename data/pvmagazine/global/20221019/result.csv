Italy's Nice has released the Nice Next Fit M Solar Kit, a solar-powered tubular motor for vertical blinds and shutters, with an electronic limit switch.
The tubular motor is powered by a small PV panel, which is also connected to a battery. When the battery is discharged and the sun isn’t shining, operation throughout every season is reportedly guaranteed by charging via USB Type C. In addition, the solar-powered motor reduces energy consumption by up to 35% compared to analog motors.
The manufacturer told pv magazine that the Next Fit Solar price is between €320 ($314.50) and € 440, depending on the force needed to operate the weight of the blinds.

The Next Fit series features intelligent and efficient management of sunlight and internal temperature. In winter, it boosts thermal resistance, while in summer, it controls overheating, said the company.
The device’s motor can be connected with a pre-assembled power cable, which can be easily disconnected and replaced without the use of tools. It has a maximum continuous operation of 10 minutes before thermal protection activation, which reportedly facilitates installation operations.
In terms of connectivity, the Nice Next series has an integrated Nice bidirectional radio communication protocol, which is compatible with all Nice gateways. In addition, the product line is also programmable via TTPRO BD and features active bidirectional functionality for Nice Era P series transmitters (P1SBDR01, P6SBDR01, P6SVBDR01, P6SVBDR01).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/19/new-tool-to-simulate-climate-at-utility-scale-pv-project-sites/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 19, 2022",New tool to simulate climate at utility-scale PV project sites,"A research group in China has developed a meteorological and forecasting model to assess climate impacts from utility-scale PV plants.
“The proposed model is unique based on its analytical expression of land-surface processes and the coupling of this expression with a mesoscale meteorological model,” the scientists said, noting that the new model can simulate the near-surface climate of utility-scale PV plants.
The new tool features a PV-associated energy balance model integrated with a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The latter is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system that serves both forecasting and atmospheric research needs. It is suitable for a broad range of applications across scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers, including weather forecast research, air quality and wind energy evaluation, as well as hydrological research studies.
The model is based on the surface energy balance principle, which determines the amount of energy flux available to evaporate surface water and to raise or lower the temperature of the surface. According to the scientists, relying on this principle represents the first attempt to parameterize the soil/latent heat and non-constant or observation-constrained critical parameters in solar plants.
The researchers tested the model at a 70 MW utility-scale PV plant located in Wujiaqu, in China's Xinjiang region, with the testing period running from July to October 2020. They found that the shielding effect of the solar modules reduces the surface soil temperature while increasing the heat of the surrounding atmosphere and the temperature gradient between the atmosphere and the land surface.
They also determined that the downward soil heat flux in the PV plant grows by approximately 34.0 % during the daytime.
“At night, the PV panels cool and absorb heat rapidly from the near-surface atmosphere, so the decreased surface temperature steepens the temperature gradient between the deep soil and the surface, resulting in a small increase in the upward soil heat flux of approximately 7.0%,” they said.
During the cold season, the daily mean soil heat flux in the PV plant declines by approximately 22.0 %.
“The physical shading of the PV panels lowers the land surface temperature in the PV plant, and the cooling range varies with diurnal and seasonal variations. Generally, the cooling during the daytime/summer is stronger than that during the night/winter,” the scientists said.
They introduced the model in “A coupled WRF-PV mesoscale model simulating the near-surface climate of utility-scale photovoltaic plants,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The research team comprises academics from the National Climate Centre of China Meteorological Administration (CMA), Tsinghua University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“This coupled WRF-PV model not only better reproduces the variations in the max/mean daily surface temperature, downward shortwave radiation, and wind speed observed from two utility-scale PV plants, but also improves the simulation ability of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux over PV plant areas,” they said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/19/global-installed-pv-capacity-could-hit-260-gw-in-2022/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 19, 2022",Global installed PV capacity could hit 260 GW in 2022,"The IEA PVPS recently published its latest report on “Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2022.” It estimates, “with a reasonable firm level of certainty,” that the world installed a minimum of 173.5 GW of new solar capacity in 2021, representing a 22% year-on-year growth. That makes 2021 another record-breaking year, despite the pandemic-related perturbations.
“The markets reached incredible numbers last year, but they will probably be even higher this year,” Gaëtan Masson, co-author of the report and co-chair at the European Solar Manufacturing Council, told pv magazine. “Without trade disruptions as we’ve seen in the last two years, my bet is that the market will reach 260 GW.”
He said this prediction is “roughly on line” with the predictions of an undisclosed company.
“Looking at production numbers , we had 153 GW of wafers produced in the first six months of the year, so it is not totally impossible to see a market of around 250 GW to 260 GW,” he added.
European manufacturing
Last year, the European Union came second in terms of new installed solar capacity with 28.7 GW, after China with 55 GW.
“Most probably we will see production capacities in all segments of the value chain in Europe in the coming years. I think that the atmosphere has changed significantly, policy makers started to understand that there is no growth without local manufacturing,” said Masson.
However, most European manufacturing projects happening at national level are too small to be competitive.
“There is a political will, there is an industry need, but the conditions are too favorable in the US or in India for the time being, so we will lose a certain number of projects which only a few months ago were supposed to be developed in Europe,” Masson noted.
This problem of competitiveness will not be solved at the policy level through the European Commission, he said. He argues that European PV manufacturing isn’t lacking policy instruments at the European level, but rather massive investment and continuous technology development at the national level.

The current edition of pv magazine casts an eye over the Asia-Pacific solar markets, considering how cross-border interconnections can drive better resource efficiency, as well as the crucial role microgrids can play in the continuing roll-out of photovoltaics. We also examine the Tango fab being planned in Sicily by Italian energy group Enel as part of Europe's attempts to shore up energy security with a domestic solar supply chain.

“If you want to remain competitive, you need to be flexible, you need to develop new production lines mostly on a yearly basis, with lower cost, to benefit not only from economies of scale, but also from technology improvements, and lower cost of manufacturing,” he said.
Continuous investment in the order of €1 billion ($977 million) a year will be needed to replace Europe’s current “static projects,” added Masson.
“That’s probably the key challenge that will not be solved by public support. It must be understood by the investors that it will be a multibillion investment for each company, with a continuous need for fresh money, and increase of production capacities,” he concluded. “The market will follow up – there’s no problem.”

Siraj-1 is Qatar’s first large-scale solar plant. It is equipped with 2 million Longi Hi-MO 4 bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers. It features 3,240 string inverters supplied by Sungrow and will feature a semi-automated cleaning system.
The park is 60%-owned by the utility and 40% by the French-Japanese consortium. It is valued at QAR 1.7 billion ($467 million). It will sell power under a 25-year power supply deal for QAR 0.0571/kWh, which was the winning bid at Qatar’s January 2020 tender.
“Al Kharsaah can supply 10% of the country's peak power consumption and will avoid 26 million tons of CO2 emissions during its lifetime,” TotalEnergies said in a statement.
The inauguration of the 800 MW plant follows QatarEnergy's recent announcement of two new large-scale PV plants in the industrial cities of Mesaieed and Ras Laffan, with capacities of 417 MW and 458 MW, respectively.
*This article was updated on 24/10/2022 to reflect that Sungrow is the string inverters' manufacturer.

“Our Integ O Series inverter has a small size of 291 mm × 220 mm × 158 mm and a weight of only 6 kg,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Although it is so compact, it still inherits our consistent product performance advantages.”
The Chinese inverter maker offers three versions of the transformerless devices, with nominal power ranging from 1.5 kW to 3.3 kW, an efficiency rating of 97.5%, and a European efficiency of 97.0%.
The maximum input voltage is 500 V and the MPP voltage range is between 50 V and 450 V. The inverters also feature IP65-rated protection and have cooling systems based on natural convection.
“The inverter supports PV input current up to 15 A, which is compatible with all mainstream solar modules in the market to prevent power loss due to the current limit of high-power modules,” the spokesperson said.
The inverters also offer 60 V startup voltage, which reportedly ensures longer work time and optimal PV utilization.
“With 110% continuous overloading capacity and export control ability, it can provide excellent performance during operation,” said the spokesperson.
Solinteg recently released hybrid inverters with outputs ranging from 3 kW to 9 kW, and single-phase inverters with power ranging from 3.6 kW to 6 kW.
“We will continue to bring more new products to our customers,” said the spokesperson. “We will launch Integ M 25 kW to 50 kW three-phase hybrid inverter for commercial application soon.”

They enabled two-phase fluid flow and heat transfer experiments to be conducted in the long-duration microgravity environment on the International Space Station. The new subcooled flow boiling technique results in better heat transfer effectiveness and could be used to control the temperatures of future systems in space. It can cool cables that carry high charges, potentially allowing for the faster flow of electricity on Earth. Specifically, it can be used to reduce the charging time for EVs to just five minutes, according to the researchers.
Pennsylvania University researchers have reported a battery tech breakthrough that enables 10-minute charging times for typical EV lithium-ion batteries. “Our fast-charging technology works for most energy-dense batteries (more than 250 Wh kg−1 or higher than 4 mAh cm−2) and will open a new possibility to downsize electric vehicle batteries from 150 to 50 kWh without causing drivers to feel range anxiety,” said Chao-Yang Wang, a professor of mechanical engineering at Penn State. Wang was the lead author of the study, which was recently published in Nature.
Huazhong Agricultural University researchers have reported a new lithium metal battery breakthrough. Their findings address two key challenges that are holding the technology back – lithium deposition and energy loss during charge cycles. In a recent paper in Nano Research, the researchers describe how they created a 3D scaffold and infused molten lithium onto it. The key to ensuring the safety of this technique is using a layer of nanosheets made out of a magnesium-aluminum double oxide. For the next step, we will replace the heavy matrix with a light-weight matrix to yield a high weight ratio of active lithium to improve the battery energy density,” said researcher Feifei Cao. “We expect to prepare a high safety composite lithium anode that is competitive for high gravimetric energy-density cell with more than 500 Wh kg-1.”
StoreDot has demonstrated silicon-dominant extreme fast charging battery cells that can charge over 1,000 consecutive cycles. The Israeli battery developer said the cells are being shipped to StoreDot's global automotive OEM partners for testing. They include Volvo, Polestar, Daimler, and VinFast.
Renault has announced plans to build a network of 200 EV fast-charging stations across Europe. The French car maker’s e-mobility unit, Mobilize, said it wants to install stations at intervals of 150 kilometers on major highways. The first stations will open in southern France in the coming months, followed by additional installations in Belgium, Spain, Italy and France that will by delivered by mid-2024.
Shell has formed a nine-member consortium to offer electrification solutions for mining sites. The consortium includes Skeleton, Microvast, Stäubli, Carnegie Robotics, Heliox, Spirae, Alliance Automation, and Worley. They will work to create battery-based solutions for off-road vehicles that can be charged in approximately 90 seconds via charging stations installed on site, and in most cases combined with renewable energy microgrids for power supply. The battery technology will be provided by Germany-based Skeleton Technologies.
Solarever has presented its first electric car built for mass production in Mexico. The solar module manufacturer launched the E-WAM in two versions: the Lite and the Bold. E-WAM promises a journey of up to 335 kilometers on a single charge. Both versions are based on LFP batteries.
Maxeon Solar Technologies has expanded its SunPower One home energy solution to include EV charging. The Singapore-based PV manufacturer has partnered with Chinese EV charging company Star Charge to enable the use of self-generated solar power for EV charging. The EV charging products will be integrated into the SunPower One home energy solution in select European markets in the first quarter of 2023. Maxeon plans to continue to add features to its SunPower One system through future partnerships.

The group analyzed the potential based on the availability of underground space, spatial structures, geo-environmental conditions, and installed capacity. They found that there are 91 abandoned mines that are suitable for pumped hydro storage facilities. The facilities would have a total installed capacity of 15,830 MW and would reduce carbon dioxide emissions in about one million tons.
In a case study, the scientists simulated the charging and discharging power generation of a hypothetical pumped hydro storage facility installed in one of the mines. They assumed pump and turbine efficiencies of 85% and 90%, respectively, and an overall efficiency coefficient of 80%. The mean water level of the upper and lower reservoirs was estimated at 100 m and 560 m, respectively.
The results show that solar and wind would generate 7.44 x 105 kWh to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir. Then, the power generated by the reverse discharging process would be 7.3 x105 kWh. This would result in an installed capacity of 130 MW.

The scientists noted that the facilities could be built in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Qinghai, where most solar and wind resources are concentrated.  They added that the study’s results are only preliminary, and that a “comprehensive and accurate potential assessment needs to take into account other constraints such as regional renewable energy distribution, regional energy demand, ecological assessment and transmission infrastructure.”

AEMO said it has finished testing a connections simulation tool that will help developers of new storage projects to more efficiently prepare their applications for projects and reduce the time needed to connect them to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
AEMO said the connection simulation tool provides a cloud-based environment for users, including developers of energy projects such as large-scale solar and storage facilities, to run studies against AEMO’s model. This could help to integrate and fast-track renewable energy into the energy system.
Developers of large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia are currently required to submit testing models to AEMO that outline the impact a proposed project could have on the grid. If that modeling is delayed or denied, the developer is required to “tune” their model, which can be a costly and slow process.
AEMO said the connection simulation tool will allow project developers and their partners and electricity networks to rapidly test and refine their renewable energy plant and project configurations using the same detailed wide-area power system simulations being used by the market operator to assess connections applications, while preserving the confidentiality of their model data.
“In a world-first, we are enabling project developers to have open access to test their connection directly against AEMO’s power system model through a secure gateway,” said AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman. “This will allow developers to simulate their connection, interrogate the technical outputs and iron out any bugs quickly and directly. Connections have been a teething issue in recent years, but now this is an area where Australia is absolutely leading the world.”
Merryn York, AEMO’s executive general manager of system design, said the innovative resource will support Australia’s energy transition, helping reduce risks, costs and time for connection approvals.
“In the next decade, Australia will experience our first cluster of coal-generation retirements, equal to approximately 14% of the NEM’s total capacity, which will challenge electricity reliability and power system security,” she said. “Replacing coal with low-cost renewables, supported by firmed generation and the timely investment in transmission, is needed to provide reliable, secure and affordable energy for all Australians. The connections simulation tool will contribute by helping reduce risks, costs and time to approve the connection of new generation and storage projects, critical to replace retiring coal generation.”
The testing of the working prototype included generation developers, power system engineering consultants and energy equipment manufacturers to test the end-to-end user experience, including portal access, features and navigation, and running project modeling studies.
AEMO said the connection simulation tool is a critical foundational operating platform to achieve the market operator’s overall objective to efficiently manage a large number of grid connection applications from renewable energy developers.
In the past year, AEMO has registered 29 new generation and storage projects totalling 4 GW of capacity, an increase of 1 GW from last year and 2 GW from the 2020-21 financial year.
This included Australia’s largest battery (Victorian Big Battery, 300 MW), largest solar farm (Western Downs Green Power Hub, 400 MW) and largest wind farm (Stockyard Hill, 511 MW).
“In addition to the growth in the number of new projects and generation capacity, Australia is also breaking new ground with designing, testing and connecting new technologies, such as grid-forming batteries that provide inertia services,” York said.
The overall number of projects undergoing AEMO connection assessment across the NEM now remains high, with 149 projects with a combined total of 22.3 GW in the pipeline.
Partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Advancing Renewables Program, the connections tool is one of AEMO’s initiatives to streamline the connection process and experience for participants.
Other projects include the Connection Reform Initiative, a partnership with the Clean Energy Council (CEC) to remove delays and deal with the increasing complexity in connecting projects to the NEM.

“This trend was driven in part by steep solar price surges in markets such as Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy and the UK,” LevelTen said.
Solar PPA prices rose 15.4% to €68.57/MWh in the third quarter, with wind prices increasing by 8% to €78.50/MWh. Poland and Germany recorded the highest solar PPA prices, followed by the United Kingdom, Hungary, Greece, and Italy. Spain and Finland had the lowest prices of the European countries that were surveyed.
“Italian and Greek P25 solar prices [rose] by 28.2% and 32.1%, respectively,” said Gabriel Umana Gomez, customer success manager Europe for LevelTen. “The number of Greek solar offers continues to grow on our Marketplace with each passing quarter, increasing overall liquidity and producing a P25 price that is likely more indicative of the Greek market as a whole.”
European energy markets did not experience any price decreases in solar PPAs, but demand remained strong. Spain, Greece, and the United Kingdom had the highest supply of PPAs in the third quarter, mostly driven by solar.
LevelTen said it expects more supply to come from Eastern Europe, as Romania’s renewable energy sector is reportedly maturing at a rapid pace. Earlier this year, the Romanian Ministry of Energy launched a tender for the deployment of 950 MW of renewables capacity.
The consultancy has also called for more clarity from EU member states on their response to the €180/MWh revenue cap on solar and wind.
“We have seen this uncertainty cause some offtakers to pause on PPA activity until 2023, when hopefully more clarity emerges,” said Flemming Sørensen, VP Europe for LevelTen.
In July, Pexapark’s renewable PPA index prices surpassed 100/MWh for the first time.

Axium Infrastructure and two Canadian Solar subsidiaries, Recurrent Energy and CSI Energy Storage, have installed and activated what they describe as the world’s largest single-phase energy storage facility. The Crimson Storage project features 350 MW/1,400 MWh of standalone battery energy storage, delivering flexible power to California’s grid.
The project is held by a fund managed by Axium (80%) and Recurrent Energy (20%). CSI Energy Storage operated as the turnkey system integrator of the project, delivering engineering, procurement, and construction services.
“The Crimson Energy Storage project epitomizes California leadership – clean energy, innovation, and economic development through good, union jobs,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom.
The project is located in the California desert on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land. BLM approved the project in May 2021, marking the first standalone energy storage project to be approved on BLM lands under the Biden-Harris administration.
“The project represents another major step forward in the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035,” said Karen Mouritsen, state director of BLM California.
Upon activation, Crimson Storage became the largest active single-phase storage project in the world, and second-largest energy storage project currently in operation of any configuration. The project holds two long-term contracts with utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric. Both contracts are part of reliability mandates made by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
“Recurrent Energy began developing Crimson Storage and our larger energy storage pipeline in 2015 when no large-scale storage projects yet existed,” said Shawn Qu, CEO of Canadian Solar. “Last year, we started bringing these projects to fruition also thanks to our CSI Energy Storage team.”
