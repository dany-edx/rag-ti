That figure – marking a 60% rise on 2019, according to in-country analyst the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA) – surpasses the 30.1 GW added in 2019 and 44.3 GW witnessed a year earlier but falls short of the 2017 record of 52.8 GW, in a year in which China continued to be assailed by the spread of Covid-19.
Although the world's solar capital usually experiences an end-of-year rush of installations, the estimated December uplift of 22.3 GW – based on monthly installation data released by the China Electricity Council (CEC) – of new generation capacity is still remarkable, almost matching the 25.9 GW amassed from January to the end of November. The CEC reported China added 25.9 GW of solar to the end of November but the AECEA offered an even higher figure, of 23.3 GW, for December additions based on the NEA's quarterly numbers which indicated China added 18.7 GW of solar in the first nine months of the year and 29.5 GW in the closing quarter.
The threat of the authorities potentially removing all big-solar subsidies this year is likely to have contributed to that December stampede, together with the completion of projects delayed by the pandemic earlier in the year.
The AECEA's Frank Haugwitz pointed to the significant contribution made by utilities and other state-owned enterprises as they strive to hit renewable portfolio standards requiring them to source a minimum portion of their energy from clean sources. The state-owned bodies are also chasing a national ambition to hit peak carbon emissions no later than 2030, according to the AECEA. The analyst cited the recent announcement by the State Power Investment Corp that it had added 10.28 GW of solar in 2020, to take it to 29.61 GW of PV generation capacity. Haugwitz this morning added, half a dozen such utilities and state bodies have announced plans to add 200 GW of solar by 2025.
Wind power experienced even more astonishing returns, according to the NEA figures, with 47.1 GW of generation capacity added last month for a full-year figure of 71.7 GW, more than the last three years put together.
The near-120 GW of solar and wind power added in China last year prompted the NEA last month to moot setting a combined 120 GW target for this year, according to the AECEA, which said it is already revisiting the prediction it made this month that China would add 45-50 GW of solar in 2021. The analyst added, with around half of China's provinces having already announced their 2021-25 five-year plans, just five regions have set a combined target of adding 120 GW of solar by the end of the period. The details of the next national five-year plan are expected to be announced in March.
Last year's additions meant China hosted 250 GW of solar capacity at the end of December and 280 GW of wind farms, as part of a total power generation capacity of around 2.2 TW.

To help publicize the 2021 Energy Transition Investment Trends report by BNEF, the new-energy branch of the New York-based financial data and media company made a series of predictions for the year ahead.
BNEF head of solar Chase is anticipating another record year for solar after the world added an estimated 132 GW of generation capacity last year on the back of project investments of $149 billion – a rise of 12% on 2019 despite the Covid-19 crisis, just as wind, biomass and waste-to-energy spending all retreated.
The analyst also predicted a recovery of the supply of glass needed for solar panels would see average module prices fall a further $0.02/W to $0.18/W this year.
Although China spent the most on new generation capacity from all non-large-hydro renewables in 2020 – according to BNEF – the $84 billion invested represented a 12% fall on 2019, enabling Europe to almost close the gap, with $82 billion invested last year, for a thumping rise of 52%. Contributors to that European clean energy advance included the Netherlands, whose $14 billion investment represented a year-on-year rise of 221%; France, which committed 38% more, at $7.3 billion; Spain, which saw investment rise 16% to $10 billion; and Germany, which spent $7.1 billion more, for a rise of 14%.
Transitioning out of the EU club, the U.K. spent $16 billion on renewables capacity last year, for a year on year rise in investment of 177%. More than half of that figure was represented by the $8.3 billion allocated to the Dogger Bank offshore wind facility BNEF described as the biggest ever financing of non-hydro renewable energy capacity. Impressive renewables generation capacity investment was also recorded in Vietnam, up 89% from 2019 to $7.4 billion; Brazil, up 23% to $8.7 billion; and Japan, up 10% to $19 billion. There were notable reductions in spending in India, which fell 36% to $6.2 billion; and in the U.S., which invested 20% less, year on year, into renewables capacity, at $49 billion, as spending on wind projects halved.
Bundling in investments into other parts of the energy transition picture, such as energy storage and electric vehicles (EVs), BNEF has calculated the world saw $501 billion committed to zero carbon goals last year, a rise of 9% from the $459 billion witnessed in 2019. And the analyst expects the figure to remain steady this year as the world tries to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, with the 2021 figure helped along by sustained rises in EV sales as well as that anticipated bumper solar crop.
Sustainable debt finance will also set a new record this year, according to BNEF, with the analyst predicting $900 billion will be offered through green bonds and other sustainable funding pots, such as those linked to social impact. With clean energy stocks having reversed years of underachievement by appearing to offer a safe haven amid global energy turmoils last year, BNEF has warned energy transition-linked share prices are likely to have a bumpier ride this year, as is always the case with a new investment type after the initial lift-off.
Spending on energy storage capacity last year remained stable at $3.6 billion, according to the BNEF report, even as the technology became cheaper. China, South Korea and Japan together accounted for half that figure and the Americas invested a record $1.2 billion in stationary storage but Europe, the Middle East and Africa saw spending fall back to $600 million after a record 2019. The world also installed its largest batteries to date last year. California hosts the 300 MW/1200 MWh Vistra Moss Landing project and the 250 MW LS Power Gateway and China's Qinghai province connected up the 200 MW/200 MWh SPIC Huanghe New Energy Base.
Renewables-powered green hydrogen appears to be losing out to carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the energy transition, according to the update, although BNEF does not include industrial uses of clean hydrogen in its figures.
Investment in fuel-cell bus sales more than halved last year, from $865 million in 2019 to $400 million, but BNEF noted electrolysis investment rose from $168 million in 2019 to $189 million and added: “Hydrogen investment is expected to grow in the coming years, driven by increasing policy support.” That prediction was fleshed out by the statement the 90 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity completed last year is dwarfed by the 240 MW set to fire up this time around.
pv magazine last year took a deep dive into the topic of green finance and what it means for solar industry players, as a part of our UP initiative. Topics included the European Green Deal, regional growth opportunities, green bonds, and the role of the carbon bubble. We have also published a white paper, available here, on how to integrate solar into a green, post-Covid recovery
Nevertheless, non-industrial green hydrogen investment fell 20% to $1.5 billion last year as CCS spending rose 212% to twice that figure. BNEF said big investments by companies including Equinor, Shell and Total drove most of the advance and set up what could be “a pivotal year” for CCS if early stage government funding can be transformed into long-term finance. Those big project sponsors also reflected the trend, reported by BNEF, for the oil and gas majors to continue to invest heavily in zero-carbon technology.
EV sales offered further reasons for optimism, though, with BNEF estimating a record $139 billion was spent on passenger vehicles and charging infrastructure last year. That could set up another sector where Europe – with an anticipated 1.9 million EV sales this year, according to the analyst – could gain ground on China, which is expected to shift 1.7 million units. The U.S. market is expected to number 500,000 sales in 2021 although BNEF noted the arrival of the Biden administration could lift that volume.
Electromobility companies raised a record $28 billion on stock markets last year – up from $1.6 billion in 2019 and seven times higher than the previous high-water mark, achieved in 2016. That was part of overall energy transition public fundraising of a record $20 billion in 2020, a rise of 249% on the previous year on the back of those bouyant stocks. Cash calls included $2.8 billion raised by Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology, $846 million from investors in U.S. business Plug Power and $777 million from Chinese solar manufacturer JA Solar, added BNEF.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/20/the-best-redox-flow-battery-tech/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 20, 2021",The best redox flow battery tech,"Researchers from the University of Burgos in Spain, Italy's University of Padua, Finland's Aalto University, the University of West Bohemia Pilsen in Czechia, and the Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA) have conducted a comprehensive analysis of all redox flow battery (RFB) and hybrid RFP technologies. They argue that these technologies are promising alternatives to lithium-ion technologies in stationary storage applications.
Redox flow storage has advantages over other storage technologies, such as flexible modular design/operation, scalability, moderate maintenance costs, long-life cycling, high round-trip efficiency (RTE), depth of discharge (DoD), fast responsiveness, and negligible environmental impacts, the researchers said. Most of these positive factors are related to the technology's unique ability to decouple energy and power.
“Power and energy density limitations in comparison to other technologies such as lithium-ion batteries are generally overcome by the more cost-effective scalability,”  the group said.
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) and zinc-bromine redox flow batteries (ZBFBs) – the most representative kinds of hybrid flow batteries – are the real state of the art, the researchers claimed. However, the road to bringing them to commercial success and applicability is still a “long way to go,” they added.
Vanadium devices
The main barrier for VRFBs is low availability and the high cost of vanadium, as well as the need for a bidirectional DC/AC inverter to interface the grid. However, recent progress has been achieved with the electrolyte composition, membrane, and electrode, as well as improvements for efficiency and power and current densities.
Another big advantage with these technologies is the ability “to respond immediately to surge power demand from the grid, coping with power quality grid services such as sag compensation and frequency regulation,” the researchers said. The levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of such batteries has been estimated at €0.18 kW h─1 cycle─1.
“Present research aims at electrolytes capable of increased -active material concentrations and energy density, membranes with higher proton conductivity and lower ions crossover, porous electrodes capable of better hydraulic performance,” the scientists said. “Nevertheless, major issues remain. Low values of energy density make a VRFB system much bulkier than an equivalent Li-ion system.”
Zinc-based batteries
ZBFBs are devices with quite low current densities but no cycle-life limitations, as the electrolytes are not subject to aging effects.
“ZBFB pilot systems are capable of charge/discharge durations up to 10 h, a performance comparable to commercial VRFBs and can operate at current densities up to 80 mA cm─2, with energy efficiencies around 80%,” the academics said.
They also explained that zinc-based redox flow storage technologies are not cheaper than vanadium-based ones, although zinc and bromine are low-cost materials. These batteries actually need expensive sequestering agents to avoid toxic bromine vapor emissions. Their LCOS is estimated at more than €0.20 kW h─1 cycle─1.
Other devices
The researchers also looked at alternative aqueous inorganic pure flow batteries such as vanadium-oxygen redox flow batteries (VORFBs), vanadium–bromine redox flow batteries (VBFBs), hydrogen–bromine flow batteries (HBFBs), polyoxometalates-based redox flow batteries (POMs-RFBs), and aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). In addition, they analyzed different materials for electrolytes and membranes. They presented the case for semi-solid flow batteries (SSFBs) and solid targeted/mediated/boosted flow batteries (SMFBs).
They also studied hybrid flow/non-flow devices such as metal-solution-based redox pair flow batteries, as well as zinc-based, iron-based, copper-based or metal air-based redox flow storage systems. In addition, the scientists looked at the potential of solar redox flow batteries (SRFBs), air-breathing sulfur flow batteries, and metal-CO2 batteries.
“Research and development aiming low cost RFBs should focus not only on economical materials but also on the optimized system performance, mainly as regards energy density and power density, while maintaining high efficiencies,” the researchers said. “According to long lifetime and large scale application characterizing RFBs for stationary energy storage targets, stability and safety of the employed materials are crucial to guarantee the sustainability and to ensure the final success.”
They claimed that an overall LCOS of €0.05 kW h─1 cycle─1 could be achieved for the most promising technologies by 2030. They presented their findings in “Redox flow batteries: Status and perspective towards sustainable stationary energy storage,” which was recently published in the Journal of Power Sources.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/20/solar-offers-multiple-options-to-manganese-mine-in-botswana/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,BOTSWANA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 20, 2021",Solar offers multiple options to manganese mine in Botswana,"Giyani Metals Corp, a Canada-based company owning the K.Hill manganese project in southern Botswana, has concluded the feasibility study for the construction of a solar park at the mining site.
The company explained the PV plant may be built under three different scenarios: A “no-export” 14 MW project (scenario one) for self-consumption, that does not include the storing or sale of excess power generated by the facility, with the grid meeting the energy demand unsatisfied by the solar park; a “net-zero annual generation” 60 MW scheme (scenario two) matching the site's annual energy requirements during peak solar generation with surplus power being injected into the grid; and a “transition into IPP” 48 MW project (scenario three) that would contemplate the sale of excess power to the grid in smaller quantities.
The capex for the first project is estimated at around $10.5 million while for the other two projects, it is $44.9 million and $34.9 million, respectively. Net savings for the three solutions are indicated at $2.8 million, $11.1 million, and $9.7 million, respectively. “The solar plant study concluded that despite each option delivering operating cost savings to K.Hill, compared to using 100% grid power, it is recommended to initially implement scenario one, with the view to upgrading to either scenario two or three as a second phase once regulatory approval is granted,” the company explained.
The K.Hill, Lobatse & Otse manganese oxide project is located in the Kanye Basin and is expected to produce high-purity electrolytic manganese metal and manganese sulfate for the electric vehicle sector. “The K.Hill site is surrounded by flat topography which, coupled with the high amounts of annual sunshine, makes it highly attractive for solar power generation,” Giyani Metals stated.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Botswana had only 3 MW of installed PV power at the end of last year. The country is seeking to deploy rooftop PV through a net-metering scheme, and large scale projects via several tenders.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/20/a-pinch-of-chili-gives-perovskites-a-kick/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,SWEDEN",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 20, 2021",A pinch of chili gives perovskites a kick,"Though improvements have come thick and fast in the world of perovskite solar cells, it is still a very young technology with a wealth of possible pathways to further boost efficiency and ensure long-term performance stability, as well as to tune and develop new materials and open up pathways for new devices and applications.
The latest evidence of these possibilities comes from a collaboration between scientists in China and Sweden, which found that adding a small amount of capsaicin to the precursor mix for methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) – so far the most commonly investigated perovskite for solar cell applications – can lead to great improvements in both the efficiency and long term stability of the solar cell.
Capsaicin is the natural compound that produces the spice in chili peppers and related plants, and is also an ingredient in certain painkillers, as well as pepper sprays and animal repellents. Added to the perovskite mix, it was shown to completely transform the surface of the material, passivating defects and increasing electron density, allowing for better charge transport. “Considering the electric, chemical, optical, and stable properties of capsaicin, we preliminarily found that it would be a promising candidate,” said East China University scientist Qinye Bao, explaining how the group came to work with capsaicin in the first place.
To test this potential, the group added 0.1 weight-percent (0.1 grams of capsaicin per 100 grams of MAPbI3) to the precursor, and used this to fabricate solar cells. The cells were then tested and observed through a range of spectroscopic techniques. These are described in full in the paper Direct Observation on p– to n-Type Transformation of Perovskite Surface Region during Defect Passivation Driving High Photovoltaic Efficiency, published in Joule.
Testing showed that the devices containing capsaicin achieved 21.88% efficiency, compared to 19.1% for control samples produced without the additive. The capsaicin cells showed significantly lower leakage current, which suggests that the additive successfully compressed recombination mechanisms that limit the material’s performance. Cells with capsaicin also retained 90% of their initial efficiency after 800 hours stored in ambient conditions.
The group now plans to focus on improving this stability value, as well as investigating the use of capsaicin in other perovskite materials, particularly those that don’t contain lead or any toxic materials. “We will further focus on the relationship between chemical structures of natural forest-based biomaterial additives, their interaction with photoactive materials, and the corresponding photovoltaic performance,” says Bao. “We hope to generate new knowledge of great value to further increase the power conversion efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.”

Chinese inverter supplier Solis, which is supplying components for the project, said that the plant will be built across 4,516 acres of water surface. It will be the world’s largest solar PV plant to be built on a coastal tidal flat, it claimed.
“It is a grid-parity project built outside China's feed-in tariff scheme,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The first 3 MW unit has already been grid-connected.”
The plant will feature 685,216 monocrystalline modules with a power output of 440 W, provided by an undisclosed manufacturer. It will also include 255 kW K-EHV-5G 1,500 V string inverters from Solis.
“The inverter solution is comprehensively optimized and protected from the aspects of waterproofing, sandproofing, corrosion prevention, structure, and internal electrical arrangement and protective algorithm,” Solis said. “This ensures the inverter can operate for a long time, efficiently, safely, and stably in the harsh environment.”
The string inverters, which boast IP66 protection, are being installed at least 5 meters above the seabed, due to tidal fluctuations. Project construction has been affected by these fluctuations, which made the installation process particularly challenging.
“We had to increase the investment of personnel and equipment and optimized the construction plan to ensure that the project was completed on time,” the Ginlong spokesperson said.
The solar facility, which is owned by Sinohydro Bureau 12, is expected to generate around 400,000,000 kWh of electricity per year.

Back in early 2019, module manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells revealed that it had filed a patent lawsuit on three continents against competitors Longi Solar, JinkoSolar, and REC. A little more than a year later, in July 2020, the courts handed down their first rulings. In the United States, the lower court ruled against the plaintiff, but in Germany it ruled in the plaintiff’s favor. The judges granted Hanwha Q Cells an injunction, to which all defendants immediately appealed. JinkoSolar alone had affirmed from the beginning of the proceedings that the products it currently supplied were not affected by the lawsuit. The other two competitors remained tight-lipped in this regard. Nevertheless, the same companies took precautionary measures to at least limit the damage should the ruling be upheld. Longi Solar temporarily halted shipments of certain products, while REC reduced its product range to the Alpha series.
In November, there was some further movement in the dispute after the Chinese patent office rejected nullification proceedings initiated by Longi Solar in late 2019. However, the office only reviewed the legal validity of the two patents at issue in China and declared them partially invalid. Currently, a review before the European Patent Office is also in progress, but its final decision is still pending. Longi Solar wants to prevent the initiation of additional “needless” patent lawsuits. This dispute will therefore drag on for a while, and the outcome remains uncertain.
In August and September, module prices across the board reached all-time lows. For projects in the megawatt range, prices well below $0.18 were no longer the exception, even for monocrystalline modules. Following pandemic-related shutdowns in the spring, most PV manufacturers had resumed normal production operations. Raw material prices for silicon wafers and solar glass were also moderate, and the dollar exchange rate was balanced. However, this was to change significantly in the months that followed.
Driven by the chaos of an out-of-control Covid-19 pandemic in the United States and by President Donald Trump, the dollar exchange rate continued its slide. This exchange rate weakness made dollar-based solar panels from China somewhat cheaper. In addition, there is currently a shortage of polysilicon and solar glass. By the end of the year, manufacturers had already made several upward price adjustments of 10% or more. This trend will probably not reverse until the second quarter of 2021.
In the fourth quarter, the question was whether Covid-19 would leave its mark on the PV industry in 2020. There were studies indicating that up to 15% of all renewable energy projects in Europe were delayed or failed completely due to the crisis. However, this assessment mainly applied to medium and large-scale projects, often with transregional participation. In Germany, the government responded by extending the completion deadlines for tenders awarded by up to six months.
In the small to medium-sized PV systems sector, there was scarcely any discernible negative impact resulting from the pandemic, at least in Germany. Particularly systems combining PV with energy storage and/or charging infrastructure for e-mobility enjoyed growing popularity. Many consumers seemed to want to increase their level of self-sufficiency using their own solar power system at a high self-consumption rate. This provided full order books for many solar installers, who have been and continue to be among the winners in the crisis.
For exactly 20 years, we have known that the first PV systems to be subsidized under Germany’s Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) would cease to be eligible for compensation from the grid operator on Jan. 1, 2021, after 20 years in operation. Nevertheless, the German government has not managed to present a consensus-worthy follow-up regulation in time. This and a number of other important issues were supposed to be addressed by the amendment to the law, which was to take effect in 2021 and finally passed in November. The bill presented to the public by the German coalition parties in September was an unambitious, half-baked draft that triggered widespread indignation in the industry. Introduced without comprehensive changes, it threatens not only a collapse in installation figures, but also the loss of existing PV capacities. The continued operation of plants coming up on their 20-year mark would simply be uneconomical for many operators.
Since the introduction of the draft, associations, the opposition, and the governing coalition have been discussing the far-too-modest expansion targets, excessive measurement and regulation requirements, the counterproductive EEG surcharge for small systems, the extension of the tendering obligation to smaller PV systems, as well as the treatment of 20-year-old, or post-EEG, systems. An end has been in sight since Dec. 14, and at least some improvements are in the offing. We were all waiting with bated breath for the final text of the law.
Our two strong German women in Berlin and Brussels, Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, are standing up to the political machos elsewhere in the European Union and trying to implement the principles of the rule of law, a humane refugee policy, and more ambitious climate targets, through the Green Deal, for instance, to the extent politically possible at the moment. The issue of climate change has not completely dropped off the radar, despite the pandemic. Instead, parallels are pointed out and appeals are made to common sense and for people to listen to science much more closely than in the past when prioritizing measures and combating crises. Ultimately, the Covid-19 protection measures, the restrictions up to and including the hard lockdown, have made everyone around the world aware of what is important and what we can do without, if necessary, permanently.
Our Western society – no, the entire human race – is unlikely to be the same before the crisis once the pandemic has been dealt with, which will hopefully proceed apace in the coming year. Business and politics will also no longer fall back into their old, outdated patterns; I am optimistic about that. We will rethink many things, doing them differently and hopefully better as a result. This is an opportunity that has been given to us unexpectedly and that we should urgently take advantage of. For that I would just like to say, thank you!

According to a new report by Wood Mackenzie, front-of-the-meter (FTM) battery storage systems costs in the Asia-Pacific region could decline by more than 30% by 2025, with Australia, China, and South Korea leading the way. 
An acceleration in FTM battery storage systems of this magnitude lends added credence to the 7 GW of storage capacity that analysts from Cornwall Insight Australia say is currently in the pipeline.  Wood Mackenzie’s report argues that battery price reductions, along with improvements in battery density, contributed to a fall in storage system prices that exceeded expectations in 2020. The latter improvements contributed to a lowering of balance-of-system (BOS) costs and other considerations. 
Moreover, a less conspicuous but nonetheless important contributor to the lowering of costs is the streamlining of hardware prices between countries and regions. 
“As batteries are expected to represent shrinking portion of all-in system costs, there will be heightened focus on BOS cost reductions moving forward,” said Wood Mackenzie senior analyst Mitalee Gupta. “Manufacturers will continue to innovate and produce BOS components that help reduce labour costs, and installation crews are implementing more efficient labour practices as they gain more experience on job sites. Competitive markets will drive system efficiencies, product standardisation and cheaper batteries as we progress toward 2025.” 
Australia is expected to see costs decline by 34% to US$658/kW in 2025 for a 2-hour duration all-in FTM system. At the end of 2020, that price was US$990/kW. Wood Mackenzie foresees the installation of FTM systems accelerating nationwide. 
The Asia-Pacific region is the world’s largest manufacturer for lithium-ion batteries, says Gupta. This trend is likely to continue “as the region’s storage industry takes off, every component across the value chain will play a role in bringing down system costs. Fire risks and safety standards, tariffs and trade policies, and safe-guarding the supply chain amidst Covid-19 uncertainty are factors that could make or break the industry.”  
Indeed, in recent months we have already witnessed the acceleration of FTM projects in anticipation of continuing price declines. From a 100 MW battery storage facility proposed just this week near Rockhampton, Queensland. Other projects announced just in the first two weeks of 2021 include Origin Energy’s plans for a 700 MW mega-battery in the Hunter region of New South Wales, as well as Neoen’s 500 MW battery planned west of Sydney. Australia’s largest power producer, AGL, also remains on track to add at least 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its portfolio by 2024.
