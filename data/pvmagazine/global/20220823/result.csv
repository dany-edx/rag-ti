The DKK 250 million (€33.60 million) loan will co-finance a system consisting of mountain caverns and a tunnel connecting the existing Myrarnar upper reservoir and the Heygadalur lower water reservoir through eight pumps with a total capacity of 70 MW, said the NIB. It will push water uphill using surplus wind and solar energy, through four turbines with a combined capacity of 40 MW when required, it added.
“The agreement with NIB is only one of several loan agreements, since SEV has made other loan agreements with financial institutions and insurance companies located in the Faroe Islands, the Nordic countries and the US,” SEV said in a press release. “An agreement that involves DKK 650 million in available credit is part of the funding. This agreement is an association between Nordic and Faroese finance corporations, explicitly Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Betri Banki, BankNordik and Lív. A part of the funding is likewise borrowed from some American health insurance companies.”
The DKK 1.3 billion Mýruverkið II project is scheduled to go online in the 2027-28 period. However, SEV still needs to secure important authorizations, including the building permit, permission from the conservation authorities, and approvals for the environmental impact of the pumped storage system.
SEV currently serves 29 municipalities on the Faroe Islands. It owns the archipelago's electricity grid and 98% of its total installed electricity production capacity, including a 261 kW solar power plant inaugurated in December 2019.
“The pumped storage system in Vestmanna is the greatest project that SEV has ever initiated, and it is likewise one of the most impressive projects the Faroe Islands have seen,” the company said.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Faroe Islands had around 59 MW of renewable energy installed by the end of 2021. The islands have four diesel plants totaling 100 MW, six hydroelectric plants with a combined capacity of  37 MW, and several wind power plants equaling 18 MW.

The figures indicate that in July alone, the world’s largest solar market installed 6.85 GW of new solar capacity. NEA said that total investments in solar reached CNY 77.3 billion ($11.3 billion) in the first seven months of 2022, up 304% year on year.
JinkoSolar has revealed that its manufacturing operations in Sichuan province have been affected by power rationing imposed by the provincial government. The province is suffering power shortages due to ongoing high temperatures and drought, forcing some solar companies to suspend production. Last week, the provincial government urged 19 of 21 cities to suspend all industrial production for six days to save power for normal living consumption. JinkoSolar said it is unsure how long power rationing will continue, as drought is having a negative impact on hydropower generation.
China Shuifa Singyes Energy said this week that it has “temporarily squeezed” its solar engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) business in favor of its wind farms, due to rising solar project costs. Solar EPC revenue rose from CNY 60.6 million in the first half of last year to CNY 103 million in the January-June period. The state-run renewables developer posted CNY 2.97 billion of revenue in the first half.
Shunfeng International Clean Energy warned this week that it expects to record a first-half net loss of CNY 200 million, from just CNY 38.9 million during the same period a year earlier. It largely attributed this to net foreign-exchange losses of CNY 110 million.
Golden Solar has specified just how much the 54 million share options it issued in January will affect its performance. Earlier this month, the company warned that losses of CNY 3.84 million recorded in the first six months of last year would widen, largely thanks to expected amortization costs of CNY 77.8 million associated with the share options. The solar production equipment supplier said last week that it expects first-half net losses of between CNY 100 million and CNY 110 million.
TCL Electronics said last week that its small-scale solar operation generated a gross profit of HKD 14.2 million ($1.81 million) from first-half revenues of HKD 172 million, despite only starting up in the second quarter. Its parent company recorded net first-half profits of HKD 293 million.

The team, led by Assistant Professor Shunta Nishioka and Professor Kazuhiko Maeda, used ruthenium (Ru) dye-sensitized niobate nanosheets (Ru/Pt/HCa2Nb3O10) to suppress undesirable back electron transfer. The water-splitting system also consists of an oxygen evolution photocatalyst. Maeda said that the surface modification makes the nanosheet photocatalyst comparable to conventional semiconductor-based photocatalyst systems. “With the back electron transfer suppressed, the developed photocatalyst could also maintain hydrogen production at low light levels, giving it an edge over other photocatalysts that require high light intensities,” the researchers wrote in “Surface-Modified, Dye-Sensitized Niobate Nanosheets Enabling an Efficient Solar-Driven Z-Scheme for Overall Water Splitting.” Photocatalysts can absorb light and carry out water-splitting reactions simultaneously, generating an electron-hole pair for the water-splitting reaction. Researchers have previously developed a photocatalytic system, involving two semiconductor materials and an electron mediator, to prevent charge carriers from recombining. However, this development led to the undesired back electron transfer. “The electron mediator, which is typically a reversible electron acceptor/donor pairs, accepts electrons from one of the photocatalysts and donates them to the other,” the researchers wrote in Science Advances. They optimized the photocatalyst to avoid having the electron-accepting species compete with the hydrogen photocatalyst for electrons, which normally results in poor solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiencies.
South Korea has completed its largest hydrogen production complex in the city of Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi province. The $17.5 million facility will produce up to 7 tons of hydrogen per day, or 2,450 tons a year, by pyrolyzing gas via steam. It will annually supply fuel for up to 410,000 hydrogen vehicles. On average, most of the 33 hydrogen refueling stations operating in the Seoul region have been supplied with hydrogen from more than 120 kilometers away. “As the completion of this complex stands to substantially reduce hydrogen transportation costs, the provincial government expects the hydrogen supply price in the Korean capital region to drop as well,” said the authorities.
ScotWind has cleared the process to offer seabed agreements for three new offshore wind projects. “The three projects' initial supply chain commitments indicate an average of GBP 1.2 billion ($1.4 billion)  investment in Scotland per gigawatt of capacity built,” wrote Crown Estate Scotland. The three projects cover 560 square kilometers of the seabed and are expected to generate 2.8 GW of electricity. “The Scottish government sees offshore wind – and the hydrogen production which we hope will be enabled by offshore wind – as one of the most important economic and environmental opportunities we have,” said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
Vertex Hydrogen has awarded a project management services contract to Worley for its 350 MW low-carbon hydrogen production plant at Stanlow Manufacturing Complex in Ellesmere Port, England. “The 350 MW plant is the first in the UK to have completed front-end engineering and is expected to be one of the first large-scale and low-carbon hydrogen plants in the world,” wrote Worley.
Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia's ACWA Power have signed three energy agreements worth a total of $12 billion. They plan to invest in green hydrogen in the Central Asian country together with Air Products, and they also signed a $10 billion investment cooperation agreement to jointly develop gas-to-power, renewable energy, and green hydrogen projects in Uzbekistan over five years starting in 2023, said ACWA Power.

At a meeting on Aug. 17, the Swiss Federal Council amended the National Roads Ordinance. It now allows the country to generate renewable energy on free spaces along major national highways. The revised text will go into force on Oct. 1.
This announcement follows clarifications that were made in 2020 in response to a parliamentary inquiry tabled by National Council Member Bruno Storni. They concerned the potential for PV production on noise barriers along motorways and railways.
Last year, the authorities said the potential for electricity production along motorways and railways was 101 GWh per year, including 46 GWh for railways and 55 GWh for national roads. The Federal Roads Office (FEDRO) is already partly exploiting this potential of 55 GWh for its own electricity consumption, particularly near tunnels and in maintenance centers.
Other suitable surfaces such as noise barriers or rest areas will now be made available to third parties free of charge. The new provision also applies to any other installations intended for the production of renewable energy, such as wind or geothermal energy.
At the end of this year, the Swiss Federal Roads Office (FEDRO) will likely launch a call for applications to reserve areas for PV installations. Interested parties can submit an offer and, as soon as a lot is awarded, they will be assigned a precise timetable to build PV.
One of the conditions imposed on the use of surfaces belonging to FEDRO is that the third parties themselves ensure the sale of the electricity. Further details will be communicated later when the call for tenders is published.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/23/cubical-luminescent-solar-concentrator-devices-in-urban-environments/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 23, 2022",Cubical luminescent solar concentrator devices in urban environments,"A Dutch-Australian research team has developed a 1 cm3 luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) device, equipped with 20%-efficient bifacial silicon PV cells, which can be used and assembled in several mosaic configurations.
“These mosaic LSC PV devices could be applied to make solar energy ubiquitous in the urban setting where it requires making visually appealing devices that can function in the challenging lighting conditions found in cities,” researcher Mohammadreza Aghaei told pv magazine. “Thus, by developing such colorful, visually appealing mosaic LSC PV devices, one can accelerate the general acceptance of solar energy in the built environment, even with modest efficiency devices. The proposed LSC PV devices support colorful surfaces, transparency and provide for freedom, offering many design opportunities to enhance the overall functionality and experience of PV power generation within consumer products, the built environment and transportation.”
The LSCs are commonly used as photonic devices in the production of fine chemicals in photomicroreactors, in dynamic “smart” windows to control light entering spaces, and for distribution of color-tuned light to enhance plant growth in greenhouses. They can also be used to improve the efficiency of solar panels. The LSCs consist of luminescent materials that are also known as luminophores, which are groups of molecules that emit light when illuminated.
The materials, which can be coated on the surface of a polymer or glass plate, or used as a dopant of the polymer or glass plate acting as a light guide, can capture direct and indirect sunlight at one wavelength and re-emit it at a longer wavelength. If applied to PV, luminophores are able to capture high-energy photons that the photovoltaic panels cannot absorb and re-emit them as photons.

The scientists inserted the bifacial solar cells between individual LSC elements and created a pattern of cubical mosaic LSC elements. They said this design increases the available top surface area of solar cells per unit of aperture area and, as a result, the power conversion efficiency of the whole LSC PV device can be increased.
For the LSC devices, they used conventional materials such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) doped with commercial organic dyes and a Coumarin (Cou) compound. The researchers attached bifacial cells to the edges of the lightguides using an index-matching optical adhesive and monofacial c-Si PV cells to the backs of the lightguide cubes. They encapsulated the cells using polyolefin (PO) materials.
Under standard illumination conditions, the group found that the luminophores were able to absorb nearly all the high-energy photons and emitted photons with longer wavelengths more matched with the spectral response of the silicon solar cells. They also tested seveal mini-mosaics to determine the performance of arrays of LSCs.
“The greatest power conversion efficiency of 11.6% was obtained for the LSC PV device consisting of four cubical lightguides containing Cou with four edge- and four bottom-mounted bifacial and monofacial silicon solar cells, respectively,” they said. “The main source of the low fill factor values is related to the poor contacts between the tabs and the fingers of the PV cells, resulting in high series resistance.”
Aghaei said commercial production of the proposed devices could begin after their efficiency is further improved.
“In this phase, it is difficult to estimate production costs with great accuracy, however, a first guess would be that for these customizable LSC PV devices the production costs after commercialization will be $0.5 per watt or less,” he said.
The scientists presented the new technology in “Measured power conversion efficiencies of bifacial luminescent solar concentrator photovoltaic devices of the mosaic series,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The research group includes academics from the University of Melbourne and the University of New South Wales in Australia, as well as the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.
“In future studies, the coupling between the solar cells and the cubical lightguides could be further enhanced to improve electrical parameters as well the efficiency of the overall devices, and experimentation of thinner and/or larger mosaic elements and the effect of indirect light could both be explored,” they concluded.

Espresso, cappuccino, flat whites – you need a lot of electricity to prepare coffee. And it is sometimes not easy for the operators of mobile coffee shops to obtain energy in public places.
Germany battery specialist Liontron has developed a solution for this: a mobile coffee-shop bike that uses built-in lithium-iron phosphate batteries to provide enough electricity to prepare coffee all day long. Two PV modules with outputs of 200 W each charge the batteries.
The three 100 amp-hour, 24 volt batteries feed a 2,000 W Victron inverter, which converts the battery power to 230 V. The company said this can be used to prepare 300 cups of coffee per day with the integrated dual-boiler coffee machine and two coffee grinders.
When the sun is shining, the two roof-mounted, flexible, ultra-light 200 W solar panels provided by German manufacturer GreenAkku can recharge the three batteries. The energy requirement of the coffee bike is around 300 W per hour.
Liontron said the batteries can be replaced without special tools if they are damaged. All components – such as the cells, the electronic battery management system, and the Bluetooth module – are screwed together, not glued or welded. The company will present its new coffee bike at the Caravan Salon in Düsseldorf, which will be held from Aug. 26 to Sept. 4.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/23/new-models-to-predict-crop-yields-in-agrivoltaics/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 23, 2022",New models to predict crop yields in agrivoltaics,"An international research group has developed a new way to estimate photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and predict the crop yield in agrivoltaic projects.
“We have re-parameterized and applied state-of-the-art models for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) decomposition to assess (PAR) in agrivoltaics, which is an important variable in order to properly predict the crop yield,” researcher Silvia Ma Lu told pv magazine.
PAR is light of wavelengths 400 nanometers (nm) to 700 nm and is the portion of the light spectrum used by plants for photosynthesis.
“While for PV systems the key term is GHI, for crops, the analogous term is PAR,” the scientists explained. “PAR reaching the ground surface has two primary incoming streams, similarly to the incoming GHI. These are ‘diffuse' and ‘direct,' and their values are essentially affected by the quantity of clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere.”
The researchers used decomposition models of solar radiation, which are commonly applied to estimate diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) from measured GHI, to predict accurately diffuse PAR in agrivoltaic plants. They checked the applicability of seven standalone GHI decomposition models for PAR decomposition.
“It is known that, per unit of total PAR, diffuse PAR is more efficient for canopy photosynthesis than is direct PAR,” they said. “For this reason, it is essential to estimate the diffuse PAR component when agrivoltaic systems are being assessed, to properly predict the crop yield. The solar panels installed in the system cast shadows on the crops throughout the day and in these shaded areas, the crops receive mainly diffuse PAR.”
The proposed methodology is reportedly applicable to all types of crops and all types of agrivoltaic installations.
“It requires temporal and spatial knowledge of the shaded crop areas along the day and a crop model that differentiates diffuse and direct PAR to eventually predict the crop yield in an agrivoltaic system,” Lu said.
The academics re-parameterized and applied the models at three different locations in Sweden – Lanna, Hyltemossa and Norunda. PAR and PAR diffuse measurements were available for them, as they all belong to the Integrated Carbon Observation System stations network. They applied the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) model, where lower values are preferred, to indicate the accuracy performance of the modules.
“The nRMSE values ranging between 27% and 43% illustrate the high variability and weak performance of most of the stand-alone models because the models’ coefficients have been previously fitted in other locations with different climate conditions” they said. “Re-parameterization of the models is highly recommended if measured data of the investigated location is available.”
They achieved the highest normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 35.24% in Lanna and the lowest one of 23.75% in Norunda. They added that Ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), a parametric post-processing framework for making probabilistic predictions, may also be used in this case to provide further accuracy.
“EMOS takes the estimations of the above-mentioned models and outputs a predictive distribution with parameters optimized by maximum likelihood estimation,” Lu said. “Results show that EMOS can provide further accuracy in the estimation of the diffuse component of PAR, lowering the nRMSE to 23.02% in Norunda for example. The drawback of EMOS is that it requires the inputs of all the models forming the ensemble.”
The research team includes scientists from Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Italy and Mälardalen University in Sweden. The academics described their approach in “Photosynthetically active radiation decomposition models for agrivoltaic systems applications,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The research received financial support from the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (FORMAS).
“These results can be used to perform estimations of the PAR diffuse component in Sweden wherever ground measurements are not available,” the team concluded. “The overall methodology can be similarly applied to other countries.”
Other researchers at Mälardalen University recently investigated how to optimize electricity yields in agrivoltaic installations with vertically mounted bifacial PV modules. They developed a techno-economic optimization model that purportedly outlines the ideal design parameters for an agrivoltaic vertical PV system by combining climatological data with figures on expected solar power generation, shading distribution, water for irrigation, and agricultural yield. In particular, the proposed model takes into account how much PAR is received on the crops.

“The batteries are assembled at our facility in the Netherlands,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “We currently use different types of battery cells manufactured, for example, in Taiwan, China, and South Korea.”
The MG LFP 24 V battery is available in two versions, with storage capacities of 5.8 kWh and 7.2 kWh and nominal capacities of 230 Ah and 280 Ah. The smallest device measures 517 mm x 294 mm x 193 mm and weighs 41 kg. The largest measures 652 mm x 294 mm x 193 mm and weighs in at 53 kg.
The devices feature a cooling technique based on natural convection and can operate at temperatures ranging from -20 C to 45 C. They also feature an IP40 protection level and a nominal voltage of 25.6 V. The manufacturer said the storage system provides steady operation for up to 3.500 charge cycles and its end-of-life period is 70% of its initial capacity at 25 C, with the cycle life depending on the battery temperature.
“The assembly line for this new battery model starts rolling this autumn,” the spokesperson stated. “Therefore the first batches will be available from the end of November.”

The capacity of the storage system has not been specified. Eventually, the project will be used in green hydrogen production, via a partnership with Lhyfe. 
France's Lhyfe will develop the green hydrogen production side of the hybrid facility, which will use solar generation. According to BayWa r.e., there is a market for green hydrogen among industrial players, local authorities, associations, schools, and urban transport operators, all within a 150 km radius of the site. 
However, a one-year study on local usage potential will be conducted before any firm plans are made for green hydrogen production. BayWa r.e. wants the local authority to invest in the project during its development and become a majority shareholder during the construction and operation phase.
“This project will be a blueprint for regions that want to actively take part in the energy transition, especially as an investment opportunity for local authorities,” said BayWa r.e. France Managing Director Céline Tran.
French President Emmanuel Macron has made no secret of his country's interest in green hydrogen, as it is one of the country's development objectives for 2030. Macron mainly wants to produce green hydrogen through nuclear energy, but there still remains opportunity for solar-based electrolysis.
With green hydrogen plans shelved over the short term, the real thrust of the project is the potential of its solar storage. BayWa r.e. said that its solar-plus-storage hybrid will be able to “optimally” integrate with the grid, where it will “contribute to securing the electricity supply, particularly during the peak winter period.” 
BayWa r.e. France's director of innovation, Mathieu Bordeleau, said the company wants “this project to be a showcase of innovation in France that highlights the benefits of combining flexibility tools with renewable energy production.” He added that the company is “committed to demonstrate (sic) the technical feasibility of the project, but also its economic relevance with regard to all the services provided.”

In July, pv magazine reported that the ambitions of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park might have been scaled back, based on a budget update published by DEWA. That DEWA cost update said AED 12 billion ($3.27 billion) had been apportioned “to complete the independent power producer (IPP) projects in the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park” – plus two other infrastructure sites – “in the next five years.”
However an update published this week, following a site visit by DEWA CEO Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, indicated that 2030 remains the project deadline for an eventual 5 GW site. The latest project news released by DEWA confirmed the deadline for completion of the 900 MW fifth phase, originally set for mid-2021, is next year. The 330 MW first project of the AED 2.06 billion fifth phase is already operational and features bifacial solar panels mounted on single-axis trackers and fully automated robot cleaning.
This week, DEWA said the second project of the fifth phase was 93.3% complete and the third project was 26.03% complete. The company will own 60% of the fifth phase, with 50% state-owned Saudi developer ACWA Power and Gulf Investment Corp. (GIC) holding a 40% stake between them. GIC is equally owned by the governments of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
DEWA said construction work on the delayed 950 MW fourth phase of the solar field is 90% complete. That part of the overall project is being developed by DEWA and ACWA, with Beijing's state-owned Chinese Silk Road Fund holding a 24% stake.
Phase four of the park will feature a 600 MW parabolic basin and 100 MW concentrating solar tower, both of which were supposed to have been completed last year. It will also include 250 MW of conventional PV generating capacity. DEWA said the site currently has 1,627 MW of generation capacity and is working on an additional 1,233 MW, which would mean a further 2,140 MW would be required to hit the 2030 target of 5 GW.
