LDES systems are loosely defined, according to this Journal of Energy Storage paper, but are batteries capable of storing hours to months’ worth of energy.
A “cap and floor” scheme, according to the UK's natural gas and electricity government regulator Ofgem, is the regulated route for electricity interconnector development.
“It is a market-based approach which aims to incentivize developers to deliver interconnector capacity by limiting developers’ exposure to electricity market price risk,” the regulator said online.
DESNZ said it will use the consultation feedback to develop a policy framework enabling LDES investment. Eligibility criteria for assessing applications, the design of the cap and floor mechanism and proposed options for delivering the scheme will be explored.
Not-for-profit REA said it has “warmly welcomed” the consultation, saying it “sets [the] Government’s intention” to overcome LDES investment barriers. It is also a “major win” for REA, with the organization claiming it has been calling for the cap and floor mechanism for over two years.
REA Director of Policy Frank Gordon said developing these energy storage systems will make the Net Zero energy system transition “as smooth and cost-effective” as possible. “It is something we and others have been calling for over a number of years,” he said.
In 2021 REA outlined in a report the current LDES merchant model was a “significant barrier” to the development of large-scale, longer-duration energy storage projects. The organization urged the UK government through Ofgem to “establish a future-proof income stabilization mechanism to de-risk investment in longer-duration energy storage.”
Consultation closes on March 5, 2024.
The news comes as the UK government recently revealed the five major barriers preventing owners of heritage-listed homes and buildings from retrofitting their homes with energy-efficient technologies.

Colombia's Ministry of Mines and Energy has issued new rules for the deployment of energy communities across the country.
The new provisions define energy communities as organized groups of electricity consumers that can associate to generate, sell, or efficiently use power through renewable energy, renewable fuels and other distributed resources
The regulations make a distinction between collective self-generation, which is aimed exclusively at meeting a community's own power demand, and  – collective distributed generation, which entails the possibility of selling power to the grid or other entities.
The rules also say that the energy communities can associate with each other to set up associations of energy communities, through signed agreements.
“From a single photovoltaic solar generation asset, energy could begin to be supplied to a community of users, which would provide a solution in the supply of energy to industrial users,” the founding partner of Oge Energys, Hemberth Suárez Lozano, told pv magazine. “Another novelty has to do with the maximum power limit, which for self-consumption projects may now exceed 1 MW. But we will have to wait for the Mining and Energy Planning Unit to accurately define this size limit.”
The new provisions also state that users must be associated through contracts, which will be convenient to define their respective energy shares.
“As for now, these agreements are the result of the free will of the parties,” said Suárez Lozano.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/10/uk-government-identifies-energy-efficiency-barriers-in-heritage-buildings/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM",ANGELA SKUJINS,"JANUARY 10, 2024",UK government identifies energy efficiency barriers in heritage buildings,"Last week the UK government released its review of the “practical barriers” facing owners of heritage-listed homes and buildings when upgrading their stock to be more energy efficient. The 58-page document combines research and feedback from local authority conservation officers, heritage consultants and architects, heritage organizations, construction industry representatives and homeowners, and reveals five major issues.
The planning system is the first major hurdle, with respondents claiming that obtaining special permissions to upgrade their dwellings – spanning the fit out of solar panels, heat pumps or double glazing – takes “too long.” In some cases, this has led to applicants losing out on financial subsidies or being discouraged from applying.
A deficit of available council capacity to deal with these requests was also identified. According to the review, it took roughly two months for council staff to consent, alter or extend applications – but the document acknowledges the volume of local authorities reporting these kinds of decisions has increased over the past 12 months. Supporting local authorities to “develop critical skills and build capacity” was a recommended fix.
A shortfall of skilled construction workers was also problematic, with contributors citing the “loss of skills in the heritage construction industry as a key barrier to adapting historic homes.” This gap, compounded by workforce shortages and growing market requirements, led to project delays and in some instances the installation of “unsuitable measures.” Plugging the gap and training the workforce with specialist skills, however, could be a way to “boost the ‘green economy’” and create jobs, according to the report.
“Complex”, “sometimes contradictory” and “not easy to understand” information from a variety of sources was also identified. Respondents claimed there was not one major voice offering data surrounding historic home energy efficiency improvements, and what was offered varied between being “too generic” to “overly technical.” Those who sought independent information were often left out of pocket, according to the review.
“Many homeowners are therefore left uncertain about what they are able to do and whether they need permission or consent from their local planning authority to do it,” the report states. Improving digital information offerings and making the presence of the government’s heritage matter advisory body, Historic England, more well-known will help address the problem, the review recommends.
Retrofitting costs were also considered a “widespread problem” by the respondents. But this was an issue even to those with mainstream dwellings, the review found. “Cost is routinely identified as a key barrier to deployment, in terms of upfront and running costs, as well concerns about long payback periods,” the document states.
Expensive construction and installation fees have been compounded by a lack of specially trained construction workers and traditional materials, as well as general “challenges with the cost of living,” according to the review. This has led to fewer households being able to afford the upgrades, making energy efficiency improvements “unobtainable” to many.
There is no support currently offered designed to help upgrade and retrofit historic homes, but the UK Government has established a “suite of measures” to support energy efficiency upgrades and low carbon heating system measures, according to the report. This includes grant schemes, social housing improvement initiatives and other schemes.
The review, spearheaded by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), also listed 55 policy measures currently in place or planned to help get the UK’s 5.9 million historic buildings to Net Zero.
Downing Street said it would continue to work with the heritage sector and industry to continue examining the “most effective” and “best value” policy mechanisms to support the transition. “DESNZ will continue to consider the applicability of, and challenges faced by, historic homes as part of the schemes and support available,” according to the review.
The review was originally established to determine the “regional variations in experiences” of adapting listed buildings and homes in conservation areas with renewable energy technologies, however the researchers discovered the issues were “experienced across the country.”
DESNZ worked with the University College London Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering and London-based urban innovation company DG Cities for the review, with the research concluding in August 2023.

Australia and Southeast Asia experienced higher-than-average solar irradiance, exceeding their long-term averages by 2% and 10% respectively. Solargis attributed this to favorable weather conditions and reduced cloud cover.
Europe also benefited from higher-than-average solar irradiance, particularly in the southern Nordic region. Most of the continent exceeded its long-term average by between 1% and 7%, thanks to reduced cloudiness and rainfall.
The United States saw stable solar performance, with some regions benefiting from the El Niño effect bringing more sunshine and less precipitation. Solargis said Central America enjoyed stronger than average solar irradiance, while Africa maintained a steady and consistent solar resource.
In contrast, India continued a long-term dip in solar performance, which Solargis attributes to a prolonged and intense monsoon season. Central India was below its long-term average by between 1% and 5%, although Southeast India was up to 5% above its long-term average, thanks to an extremely dry and sunny June and August.
Solargis said extreme weather conditions are presenting challenges to solar projects at the regional level. In the United States and Australia, frequent and severe hailstorms have affected the insurability of projects. The data provider said that solar investors and operators should deal with fluctuating weather conditions by closely monitoring resource variability patterns.
Solargis CEO Marcel Suri said changing global weather patterns could alter the outlook for 2024.
“There is an increased need for stakeholders to closely monitor and analyze solar resource trends. This is crucial for optimizing projects and mitigating the ongoing risks in the face of changing climate dynamics,” Suri said. “As we navigate through the extremes, stakeholders must enhance their monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing capabilities to mitigate risks and embrace the unstoppable ascent of solar power in our global energy landscape.”

India installed 10,016 MW of solar and 2,806 MW of wind power in 2023. Solar installations fell by 28% compared to calendar year 2022, while wind installations rose 52% up year on year, according to a new report by JMK Research.
The solar additions in 2023 included about 6.5 GW of utility-scale solar installations, 3 GW in the rooftop segment, and nearly 500 MW in the off-grid/distributed solar segment.
JMK Research attributed the decline in utility-scale solar installations to low tender issuance activity during the period from 2020 to 2022. With the recent upsurge in tender activity, it said it expects utility-scale solar installations to increase in the future.
Rajasthan led all states in large-scale PV capacity additions with 2,193 MW installed in 2023, followed by Gujarat (1,317 MW) and Maharashtra (979 MW). Gujarat led wind installations by commissioning more than 1,300 MW of new projects in 2023.
India’s installed renewables capacity has now hit 133.89 GW, according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Solar energy accounts for the largest share of around 55% of the total renewables capacity, followed by wind.

A collaborative study by experts from NREL, Duke University, Solar Unsoiled, the University of Jaén in Spain, and Sapienza University of Rome has cast light on the assumption that rainfall alone can effectively clean solar panels.
In their examination of different pollens at five solar power facilities in North Carolina, the researchers discovered that pollen from tree species such as cypress, juniper, pine, and oak proved particularly stubborn in adhering to solar panels.

During peak pollen seasons, variations in pollen types led to a decrease in solar panel efficiency by as much as 15%. Despite the rain “cleanings,” unwashed panels suffered approximately 10% annual production loss. Manual cleaning with a wet brush, after rain, showed a performance increase of 5% to 11%.
The facilities studied, ranging in capacity from 4 MW to 9 MW, face due south at a 20-degree angle and have been operational for approximately seven years.
The researchers initially expected minimal soiling losses due to the area’s relatively high average rainfall and short dry spells. In testing, however, they found that the soiling and associated generation losses exceeded their expectations.
This data set is not universally applicable nationwide, as pollen types and intensities vary across regions. Deserts primarily contend with dust, but agricultural areas in these regions also face pollen challenges during certain seasons. Facilities on the US east coast, characterized by a generally wetter climate and dense tree cover, consistently encounter pollen-related challenges.
In this study, tree pollen was the predominant type affecting the sites during the spring, significantly impacting solar generation. The researchers observed that grass and weed pollens, which peak towards summer’s end, did not correlate with the highest soiling losses on solar panels, unlike tree pollen.
NREL and Solar Unsoiled will continue their research to gain a deeper understanding of the issue. They noted that pollen particles from different trees have varying adhesion levels, influenced by factors such as the size and shape of the grains, the nature of the surfaces they stick to, their compositional properties, and environmental conditions like relative humidity and wind patterns.

Namely, they have used data from the MODIS instrument onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites to analyze data regarding 116 solar farms worldwide.
“Satellite data with high spatial resolution and global coverage enables the detection of changes in surface properties at fine scales,” they explained. “We use long-term remote sensing observations from MODIS, which have good temporal coverage and moderate spatial resolutions.”
While some SFs analyzed in the study were photovoltaic (PV) and some were concentrating solar power (CSP) sites, all had a minimum occupying area of 400 ha. The scientific group also analyzed non-SF buffer areas. They were generated as ring-shaped areas with a width of 1 km surrounding the SF and 1 km away from the boundary.
The research has examined three MODIS measurements – LST, albedo, vegetation, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). These values were quantified during a 5-year window, as the first measurements were from two years before the year of construction and the last from after two years as well. To rule out any natural climate variability, the change in the buffer area was deducted from the change measured in the SF site.
“Globally, there was a significant decrease in albedo of -0.016 for most SF samples,” the research found. “Regionally, SF in North America (NA) experienced a larger albedo decline (-0.014 to -0.021) than those in East and South Asia (ESA) (-0.010 to -0.017).”

As for the vegetation, the overall EVI index decreased by -0.015, an 8.2% drop. That also exhibited regional variations – as all sites in North America showed a decrease of 0.023 in the EVI, while in East and South Asia, approximately a third of the SF showed an increase.
As for the LST, the researchers found an average cooling effect of -0.49 K during the daytime and -0.21 K during the nighttime. Additionally, 94 of the 116 states experienced land cooling in the daytime, while only 82 experienced it in the nighttime.
“Since there are different types of solar energy technologies, PV and CSP, we searched for pairs of PV and CSP SFs with the same land cover and in the same latitudinal band to compare their impacts,” the researchers added. “On barren land, PV had overall stronger impacts than CSP, except for a larger daytime cooling with CSP. In contrast, on cropland, PV had weaker impacts on albedo and daytime LST than CSP but greater impacts on EVI and night LST.”
The results of their analysis were presented in “A global assessment of the effects of solar farms on albedo, vegetation, and land surface temperature using remote sensing,” published on Solar Energy. It was written by academics from China's Beijing Normal University, the Southern University of Science and Technology, and the US's California Institute of Technology.

PV plant owners that want to feed solar power into railway networks face a technical challenge. Railway networks operate at a frequency of 16.7 Hz, but public power grids – for which common inverters are designed – operate at 50 Hz.
In order to address this issue, Germany-based  Smart Railway Technology has conceived an inverter that is designed to feed directly into a railway's 16.7 Hz power grid, without costly detours via conventional three-phase 50 Hz networks.
The new product, PV2Rail, features a rated output of 100 kVA. It reportedly meets all relevant norms and standards, which the manufacturer said guarantees that the device can be reliably integrated into existing infrastructure.
Smart Railway Technology's main business is the production of on-board power converters for international rail transport. The company once belonged to German inverter producer SMA Solar Technology, but was later taken over by Beijing Dinghan Technology Group in China.
In 2019, 10:10 – a UK-based climate change charity – developed a demonstrator solar array in partnership with Community Energy South and rail operator Network Rail. According to the developers, a solar plant could theoretically be connected to any traction substation and supply from 5 km to 10 km of track in either direction.

Starting from 6 kWh and scalable to 90 kWh, the system is said to provide enough essential whole-home power for two days to a month.
With 7,200 W of output, a single unit can run an entire home, including large home appliances like HVAC systems. When combined with EcoFlow’s new energy management system Smart Home Panel 2, the system can be scaled up to 21.6 kW of output – enough to power the most energy-demanding households.
The solar input ranges from 5.6 kW to 16.8 kW, allowing to connect up to 42 400 W solar panels. The 80 V to 450 V PV input port can connect up to 10 400 W solar panels in a single series, the company said.
The system is based on lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery cells with a 10-year lifespan. At 3,500 cycles, at least 80% capacity should be available. The new product is IP54-rated and is designed to operate in temperatures from -20 C to 45 C.
According to Ecoflow, the system is the first in the home backup power category to feature a cooling structure with sintered hear pipes.
“The inverter features EcoFlow’s patented X-Cooling technology, utilizing a groundbreaking heat-dissipating system that increases efficiency by 50%, reduces noise and extends component lifespan,” the company said.
The DELTA Pro Ultra can be charged through AC power, solar panels, and gas generators. It ensures uninterrupted power switchover for devices directly connected to the inverter, Ecoflow said.
When paired with Smart Home Panel 2, Delta Pro Ultra delivers a fully automated whole-home switchover in under 20 miliseconds, ensuring a seamless transition during power outages.
EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra is also suitable for off-grid power solutions, thanks to its modular and portable design, including recreational vehicles and tiny homes. Neither the battery nor inverter require permanent wall mounting and can be transported for camping, tailgating and other outdoor activities.
“Our innovations will soon be available in the US and Japan, with European availability awaiting final confirmation,” an Ecoflow spokesperson told pv magazine. DELTA Pro Ultra was launched at CES 2024, where it was recognized as an innovation awards honoree.
DELTA Pro Ultra is available on the EcoFlow website and Amazon.com. Users can purchase DELTA Pro Ultra (inverter and battery) for $4,999.

The WOA is inspired, in particular, by bubble-net feeding, which is a complex, cooperative hunting strategy consisting of a highly synchronized set of behaviors that involve communication and cooperation, demonstrating signs of high social intelligence. It comprises three operations to simulate the search for prey, encircling prey, and bubble-net foraging behavior of humpback whales.
“Two optimization variables, Spv and Sth, are involved in the optimization search process, and the whale optimization algorithm has obvious advantages in terms of solution accuracy and convergence speed compared to meta-heuristic algorithms such as particle swarm and genetic algorithms,” the researchers explained, noting that this algorithm also offers the advantages of fewer parameter settings and better optimization seeking ability.
The scientists developed an optimized version of the WOA, which they say enables maximizations of PV power generation for heat collection and reduces grid dependency. It is reportedly able to identify the optimal area ratio of the solar energy systems needed for the system configuration. “The installation area of photovoltaic modules and collectors will not only affect the power side, but also affect the thermal side,” they emphasized.
Using the PVsyst software, they tested the proposed approach assuming the combination of PV, solar thermal energy, and heat pumps in a high-rise dormitory building located at the Shandong University's campus. They found that the optimal solution would be deploying a 315 kW rooftop PV system, solar collectors with a daily heat collection of 3502.72 MJ, and an air source heat pump as an auxiliary heat source. “With the optimal ratio, the system can gain up to $82.44 per day of operation,” the academics stated.
The analysis showed that the heat provided by the heat pump and the solar collectors is able to equal the building's heat consumption, and that PV power and grid electricity can meet the building's power demand throughout the day, while also powering the heat pump.
Considering the current tariffs the Chinese authorities pay for surplus power injected into the grid, the academics conducted an economic analysis of the proposed system and found it provides clear benefits. “The initial investment is larger than the conventional system, but the later operating costs are significantly lower than the simple solar water heating system,” they said.
They introduced the new algorithm in the study “Research and analysis of energy consumption and energy saving in buildings based on photovoltaic photothermal integration,” published in scientific reports. “The results of the example show that the roof of the building has significant benefits in environmental protection and investment recovery period when the photovoltaic photothermal system with the optimal area ratio is installed on the roof of the building,” they concluded.

New figures from market research firm Sunwiz show that Australians installed 921 MW of new solar on rooftops in the fourth quarter of 2023.
SunWiz said residential volumes fell 2% on November, when a record 329 MW of new rooftop solar was installed across the nation.
Sunwiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston described the 321 MW December 2023 total as a “letdown,” but it was the second-best month on record and is above the volumes seen in the same month in 2020, 2021 and 2022.
The December tally took the annual total to about 3.17 GW of new rooftop solar capacity, a 14% increase on 2022 and behind only the 2021 record for annual installations of just over 3.23 GW.
While residential volumes were down on the previous month, SunWiz said the commercial market, comprising 15 kW to 100 kW systems, improved considerably over December 2023 and shows no sign of tapering off.
