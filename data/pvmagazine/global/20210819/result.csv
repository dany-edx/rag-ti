A new report by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory states that energy storage could play a significant role in India’s power system. The nation will deploy energy storage capacity in the range of 50 GW to 120 GW (160 GWh to 800 GWh) by 2030. Installations could increase to the range of 180 GW to 800 GW (750 GWh to 4,800 GWh) by 2050, representing between 10% and 25% of total installed power capacity by 2050. 
The researchers modeled the growth of grid-scale energy storage deployment in India under different technology costs, policies, and regulatory scenarios, resulting in a range of storage growth trajectories over the next three decades. The reference-case scenario represents middle-of-the-road projections, with standard assumptions through 2050. Additional scenarios were explored by making a change to the reference-case assumptions of value streams for energy storage, the costs of solar and storage, and fossil fuel investments. 
In the reference case, power capacity additions were assumed as per the national plan, such as 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030, and future projections for electricity demand growth. Further, it was assumed energy storage devices receive revenue for the full value of grid services they provide. 
Under reference-case assumptions, energy storage deployment would grow quickly, with an average annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2030. Installations would reach 635 GW by 2050, constituting around 23% of the nation’s installed power capacity (2,700 GW) by 2050. The total energy capacity of energy storage would be 3,220 GWh by 2050, with an average storage duration of five hours across all devices.

The Impact of Behind-the-Meter Solar in Ontario study, prepared by U.S.-based electricity price forecasting analyst Power Advisory LLC for CanREA, found rooftop PV could drive down the costs of firing up ‘gas peaker' plants to meet peak annual electricity demand in the Canadian province; would remove millions of dollars of associated carbon price costs, if a proposed levy is applied to gas generators; and could defray infrastructure expenditure expected as a result of the planned decommissioning of a nuclear power plant in 2026.
The report, published this month, found extensive savings for the province's power generation fleet if ambitious rooftop PV programs take place, even though household panels would have a negligible impact on the hourly peak electricity price in Ontario, which would still hinge on gas-fired generation costs.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
Power Advisory modeled four ten-year scenarios, ranging in ambition from a baseline case, which would continue the current modest rooftop PV trend in Ontario; up to a ‘high' outcome, which would see the province reach 200 MW of rooftop PV next year before adding a further 350 MW per year to the end of the decade.
In that scenario, the hourly price for electricity during the summer peak, when air conditioning ramps up demand, would only fall CA$1.88/MWh (US$1.49) thanks to the effects of household solar. However, the report stated, 3 GW of rooftop solar at the end of the decade would take CA$56 million (US$44.3 million) off the annual bill for deploying gas power plants to meet the highest periods of demand.
In addition, said Power Advisory, the minimum prices guaranteed to gas-fired generators in the auctions held to procure such extra facilities would fall as the result of rapid residential solar deployment, saving bill payers a further CA$14.3 million (US$11.3 million) in 2030, under the high-ambition scenario.
If Canada extends a proposed carbon price mechanism to gas-fired power facilities, the report added, the annual costs of running such plants could rise to CA$50.7 million in 2030, based on an estimated carbon levy of CA$50/ton (US$39.59). If, as has been recently suggested, the carbon price were to be set at a punitive CA$170/ton (US$134.60), that annual cost would reach CA$173 million (US$137 million) at the end of the decade, according to Power Advisory, with the bill almost certain to be passed on to electricity consumers.
The study also suggested the widespread deployment of solar could ease congestion fears associated with the Flow East Towards Toronto (FETT) grid interface. Grid bottlenecks are anticipated as the result of the decommissioning of the 3.1 GW Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, on the north shore of Lake Ontario. With Ontario grid company Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) planning a CA$50 million investment in the FETT interface, Power Advisory suggested rooftop solar could defer that bill.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/19/novel-pv-module-recycling-tech-from-south-korea/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 19, 2021",Novel PV module recycling tech from South Korea,"Researchers at the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) have developed a “non-destructive” solar module recycling technology that is claimed to be able to recover 100% of a module's glass.
The novel technique can be applied to either damaged or undamaged panels and works in four steps: The automated dismantling of the frame and the junction box; glass separation; metal recovery; and solar cell recycling. “The core process is glass separation, with the glass recovery rate approaching 100%,” the scientists emphasized, noting that this was obtained by separating the interface between the glass and the module encapsulant.
The Korean group claims that the new technique, which was, so far, tested on an undefined series of 72-cell panels, reduces power consumption by a third compared to other recycling technology, thanks to process optimization. The system is also said to allow the recovery of high-quality glass with an iron content of less than 200 parts per million, and of more than 65% of the components that make up a panel.
The scientists were also able to refine the silicon recovered from waste panels to make six-inch single crystal ingots and wafers. The wafers were used to manufacture a 20.05%, high-efficiency solar cell. “Recycling a ton of discarded photovoltaic modules means a reduction of 1.2 tons of greenhouse emissions,” said KIER researcher Jinseok Lee. “So this technique is crucial to achieving a net-zero economy.”
More technical details on the four processes were not disclosed.
The research project was supported by South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology. Korea-based provider of commercial heat treatment for metal and coating processing services, HST Co Ltd, has now been tasked to bring the technology to the market.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/19/combining-big-floating-solar-with-hydropower/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,BANGLADESH",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 19, 2021",Combining big floating solar with hydropower,"Complementing hydroelectric power with floating solar PV can be a suitable solution for daytime peak electricity demand and to offset the respective shortfalls of the two power generation technologies.
With this in mind, a research group from the Islamic University of Technology, in Bangladesh, has conducted a simulation to evaluate the integration of a 50 MW floating solar plant with the 230 MW Karnafuli Hydroelectric Power Station located at the Kaptai Dam on the Karnaphuli River in Rangamati district, in the southeastern part of the country. The facility covers around 5% of Bangladesh's grid electricity demand.
“Based on the available reservoir area and the yield of the Kaptai hydro plant, we considered 50 MW for the floating array,” research co-author Abdullah Al Mehadi, told pv magazine. “This capacity proved useful for the Kaptai hydroelectric power plant in compensating for the hydroelectric power plant's low yield during the winter season and, at the same time, the low energy production from the solar plant, due to lack of irradiation and reduced sunlight hours during the monsoon season, can be compensated by additional water reserves in the dam due to high rainfall.”
In the proposed project configuration, the floating plant should be located close to the dam's spillway, which the scientists say would reduce its environmental impact as local fishing activities and cohabitation of marine life are present on the other side of the basin. The array is planned to occupy a surface of 0.56km2, which would represent a minimal portion of the basin's total surface, which equals 777km2.
The simulated PV system is south-oriented and built with 400 W panels with an efficiency of 21.63% from Korean manufacturer LG, and string inverters from Chinese specialist Huawei. The modules should be installed with a tilt angle of 30 degrees.
All the power generated by the solar facility should be used during the day, during which only some of the five turbines of the hydropower plant would be in use. “Conserving water will later prove to be a key differentiator when the preserved water is used to satisfy the peak load demand at night,” the research group emphasized, adding that the hydropower facility may act as a backup for the solar plant in the event of a discontinuity or instability in solar radiance.
The PV plant's annual energy yield was estimated at 76,916 MWh and its performance ratio 0.752. The performance ratio is defined in IEC 61724 and is a metric commonly used to measure solar plant performance, for acceptance and operations testing.
According to the academics, the simulated system has demonstrated that hydroelectricity can respond appropriately to fluctuations in PV generation and that their complementarity is ideal for the so-called “load power plants,” which are plants that adjust their power output as demand for electricity fluctuates throughout the day. “The coupling of hydropower and floating PV is of particular interest in developing countries such as Bangladesh where grid infrastructure is unreliable,” they further explained. “Furthermore, installing a solar PV farm necessitates a significant investment in an electricity distribution system which can be avoided by constructing such a hybrid system where the distribution network already exists.”
The research team has not estimated, yet, the LCOE of the proposed system. “The cost of the panels and other accessories is difficult to ascertain because they will be subject to advance-trade VAT after their importation from abroad,” Al Mehadi said. “In addition, because floating solar plants have different maintenance situations than land-based plants, it is difficult to predict maintenance costs.”
The proposed hybrid system was described in the paper Optimized seasonal performance analysis and integrated operation of 50 MW floating solar photovoltaic system with Kaptai hydroelectric power plant: a case study, published in Energy Sources.
Several studies have been conducted in recent years on the combination of the two technologies. Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory said linking solar with hydro in a full hybrid system configuration at every hydroelectric facility in the world may result – at best – in the deployment of 7,593 GW of combined generation capacity for an estimated annual power generation of 10,616 TWh and 20% reservoir surface area coverage. And combining solar with hydro in this way brings further benefits, including improved system operation at different timescales; more opportunities for storage, thanks to pumped hydro; increased utilization rates of transmission lines; reduced PV curtailment; and lower interconnection costs and water evaporation.

Daqo expects another 180-220,000 metric tons of poly production lines to appear next year – enough to supply 240-250 GW of solar modules and 200-210 GW of generation capacity, the company said – and anticipates the polysilicon price will keep rising. However, that will not be enough to dent soaring global demand for photovoltaics according to the Daqo chief.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they’re changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
With commentators having observed a leveling off in the poly price in recent weeks – and Zhang himself stating the figure had been steady at $26-28/kg in July and this month – the Daqo chief executive nevertheless added: “We expect the strong price momentum to continue into the second half of this year.”
He put that prediction down to a failure to dent global demand for PV and to solar panel makers passing on the cost of more expensive polysilicon to their customers. The major solar manufacturers could learn a thing or two from Daqo in that respect, it seems, with a polysilicon production cost rise of two cents per kilogram between the first and second quarters of this year translating into an $8.91 hike in average selling prices over the same period, to $20.81/kg in the April-to-June period.
That added up to a revenue rise from the $256 million recorded in the first three months of the year to $441 million in the last quarter and net income for Daqo shareholders of $232 million, up from $83 million in the previous period. The year-on-year figures spell out how much the poly price has leaped, with Daqo posting revenue of $134 million in the second quarter of last year, for net income of just $2.4 million.
In terms of production volume, Daqo said its Xinjiang facilities manufactured 21,102 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon in the last quarter, up from 20,185 in Q1, although sales volume dipped over the same period, from 21,471 MT to 21,060.
Daqo recently raised RMB6.45 billion ($994 million) by floating its main business unit on the Chinese A-share market and said trading on Shanghai's Sci-Tech Innovation Board began on July 22. That windfall will help fund plans to expand annual production capacity to 270,000 MT by 2025, the company said.

A group of U.S. solar companies that decline to be named have asked the U.S. Department of Commerce to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed three petitions through law firm Wiley Rein requesting that the U.S. government investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that the circumvention of anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”

“The heat pump is suitable for all types of industries with available waste heat and a demand for process steam,” Sintef researcher Michael Bantle, told pv magazine, noting that the most interesting sectors are currently the food, chemical, and paper sectors. “However, in the renewable energy sector, the technology might be up and coming in combination with thermal storage.”
The machine, which the research group describes as the “world's hottest heat pump,” can be used with different industrial processes that rely on steam as an energy carrier and can reduce a facility's energy consumption by between 40% and 70%, as it enables the recovery of low-temperature waste heat, according to its creators.
The heat pump incorporates a rotary vane machine designed by Tocircle and water and steam technology developed by Sintef. “The vane machine is a type of compressor equipped with vanes that rotates such that it changes the compressor volume with each revolution,” Bantle said. “The secret behind Tocircle’s compressor is that all its moving parts that are in contact with the work medium are lubricated using water.”
The combination of water injection and steam compression does not only lubricate the compressor, which would otherwise end up being overheated, but also reduces thermal stress for the entire system. “This means that we no longer have to waste any heat, but can keep the heat we generate all to ourselves,” Bantle further explained. “This, in turn, will drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions because it will be possible to retain the surplus heat generated by the industrial process, feed it into the heat pump, and so increase the process temperature.”
When asked about the costs and return of investment (ROI) of the machine, Bantle stated that these depend on local energy prices and the benchmark technology. “Benchmarking against other electrified solutions, the system shows generally very good ROI,” he emphasized. “benchmarking against fossil fuel technology, the ROI will be longer but, again, that depends strongly on local energy pricing and possible also CO2 pricing.”
The consortium plans to bring the technology to the market during this year.

Researchers at Oxford PV, an Oxford University spinoff that focuses on perovskites, have been working on an efficiency solution that they said can help to scale up solar more rapidly.
The group is using perovskites to squeeze more power out of a solar cell, pushing past the 26% efficiency barrier presently achieved by silicon-only cells, and working to press against the “Shockley-Queisser” limit observed in photovoltaic materials.
Perovskites fulfill all the optoelectronic requirements for a PV cell, and can be manufactured using existing processes. Perovskites can be layered onto a conventional cell in tandem with silicon. These features, said the developers, make perovskites ideal plug-and-play materials to integrate with silicon technology.
Metal halide perovskites have been targeted by the research community for their properties, and have been under research and development for more than a decade. Perovskites are, in many ways, a foil to silicon, said the researchers. While silicon is a weakly absorbing material that requires hundreds of micrometers of thickness to fully absorb sunlight due to its indirect bandgap, perovskites are strongly absorbing, direct bandgap semiconductors. As such, they need less than a micrometer of material thickness.
Silicon requires energy-intensive fabrication processes to create high-purity single crystals necessary for low-defect densities, where perovskites are inherently defect-tolerant and can be processed at low-temperatures into polycrystalline cells. 
While the two materials behave quite differently, the end result is two high-quality materials that can deliver power conversion efficiencies of around 26% by using low-cost fabrication routes.
The increase in efficiency created by perovskite-tandem cells can help to offset some of the carbon emissions needed to produce high-purity silicon used for conventional solar PV cells, said Oxford PV.
Combining the perovskites in tandem with silicon, rather than rebuilding a process for pure-perovskite or other material combination, allows for a faster and less costly scale-up of manufacturing. Furthermore, existing supply chains already contain the physical elements that comprise perovskite materials, paving a clear path to scale up the technology rapidly.
Higher-efficiency cells do exist, like the III-V multi-junction devices built by Spectrolab and Azur Space. However, these are typically used in outer space, where cost is less critical than minimizing wafer area. These cells can operate at 40% efficiencies, but are expensive, and currently cannot compete with the conventional silicon market in a way that tandem cells could.
Oxford PV has been researching tandem cells for seven years, and the group said it is now close to starting mass commercial production in a factory in Brandenburg, Germany. The International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics forecasts the entry of tandem cells into the market after 2023.

Scientists at The Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra have produced a dual-sided silicon solar cell with a front conversion efficiency of 24.3% and a rear conversion efficiency of 23.4%, representing a bifacial factor of 96.3%. They claimed that the performance represents an effective power output of approximately 29%.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Ernst claimed that the numbers outstrip the performance of the best single-sided silicon solar cell. “This is a world record for selectively laser-doped solar cells and among the highest-efficiency bifacial solar cells,” Ernst said.
The results, which the research team claims have been independently verified by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), were achieved by using specific laser-doping technology to fabricate the cells.
“Laser-doping uses lasers to locally increase electrical conductivity,” Ernst said. “It is a low-cost, industry-compatible process for boosting solar cell efficiency.”
Principal researcher Dr. Kean Chern Fong claimed that the bifacial solar cells easily beat the performance of single-sided silicon solar cells and provide efficiency benefits for solar PV projects.
Bifacial solar cells, which are commanding a growing share of the PV market, absorb light from both the front and rear surfaces of the device, capturing albedo light reflected off the ground and roof surfaces that would otherwise be lost.
“We have developed what I would call a true bifacial solar cell, as it has nearly symmetrical power generation capacity on both surfaces of the device,” Fong said. “When deployed on a conventional solar farm, a bifacial cell absorbs direct incoming light, while also taking advantage of ground reflection, which can contribute up to additional 30% power generation. Bifacial solar cells are becoming increasingly important in the roll out of solar farms and are expected to have a market share of over 50% in the next five years. Our work demonstrates the incredible capabilities of this technology.”
The results are the latest milestone for scientists at ANU, which received AUD 3.6 million ($2.6 million) in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in January as part of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics Infrastructure project.
Earlier this month, scientists working on the PV potential of ultra-thin 2D materials discovered that the ability of the materials to generate solar energy can be controlled by “twisting” the angle between two layers of the material.
