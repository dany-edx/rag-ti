The scientists used the ChemDataExtractor text-mining toolkit, which they described as a “chemistry-aware” natural-language-processing (NLP) tool. It was applied to 25,720 scientific articles comprising 660,881 data entries representing 57,678 photovoltaic devices. The database for the dye-sensitized devices included 475,045 entries organized into 41,680 records. The one for perovskite cells included 185,836 entries organized into 15,818 records.
“Such a database could also reveal information about the variation observed in popular structures that have been synthesized multiple times in different studies, to glean information on the underlying variation for that particular architecture,” they said.

The researchers claim their multifaceted evaluation approach ensured data quality, with precision metrics ranging from 73.1% to 95.8%.
“It is interesting to note that the accuracy of data extracted for the PSC database exceeded that of the DSC database on both metrics,” they said. “This is surprising since the parsers for the photovoltaic properties and the logic for calculating derived properties are the same in both cases.
The research team described their findings in “Perovskite- and Dye-Sensitized Solar-Cell Device Databases Auto-generated Using ChemDataExtractor,” which was recently published in Scientific Data.

Installations rose significantly from 152 MW in the same period last year, and 115 MW in the first quarter of 2020. March was the month with the highest growth this year, at 241 MW, followed by February and January, with 103 MW and 89 MW, respectively.
If this growth trend continues over the rest of the year, Italy could see the largest amount of newly installed PV capacity over the past decade. Much will depend, however, on how many large-scale PV projects will be completed. In 2021, the country added 937 MW of solar and in 2020, it deployed 625 MW.
Residential PV systems up to 20 kW in size still account for the largest share of the total, with around 190 MW of capacity. PV systems ranging from 20 kW to 100 kW accounted for 35 MW of the quarterly total. Installations of commercial and industrial PV systems ranging from 100 kW to 1 MW reached 85 MW in the first three months of the year, while solar parks above 1 MW in size totaled 123 MW.
The parts of the country with the highest development volumes were the Latium region, which brought 93 MW MW of new solar online, and the northern region of Lombardia, with 66 MW. Veneto and Piedmont finished the quarter with 45 MW and 40 MW, respectively.
The provisional figures indicate that Italy exceeded around 23 GW of solar capacity at the end of March. The nation’s National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy aims for 50 GW of solar by 2030.

“We have demonstrated that the use of two-dimensional materials such as graphene and MoS2 can be used to improve the performances of perovskite photovoltaic not only on lab devices but also in a real context with large area panels,” researcher Aldo di Carlo told pv magazine. 
The scientists integrated the graphene flakes into the ETL to promote the crystallization of the perovskite wrapped within the ETL itself. They said this leads to a reduction in the electron trap density, while reducing the device's dark current and improving the cell's fill factor. Poly(triaryl)amine (PTAA), which is an excellent hole- transporting and electron-blocking material, was used for the HTL.
“At the perovskite–HTL interface, the buffer layer of fMoS2 flakes promotes the hole transfer from the absorbing layer to the HTL compared with reference devices without fMoS,” the researchers said. “In addition, the use of graphene and fMoS2 stabilizes the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces, respectively, under harsh testing conditions, such as prolonged illumination and thermal stresses.”
The module was fabricated with solar cells with an area of 9.1 cm2 and reached an active area of 81.9 square centimeters and an aperture area of 101 square centimeters. Its power conversion efficiency, measured under standard illumination conditions, is 12.5% and the fill factor reaches 81%.
“It is expected that the power conversion efficiency spread will be reduced by a fully automated perovskite solar module fabrication,” the researchers said.
The PV system is located at the campus of the Hellenic Mediterranean University (HMU) in Crete, Greece. The power generated by the facility is being stored in was stored in four serially connected 6 V vented tubular plate batteries with a capacity of 260 Ah. The modules have an area of 0.5 square meters and were used to build a standalone testing field with a total area of 4.5 square meters consisting of nine panels.
The group compared the performance of the panels with that of commercially available solar modules and found that the graphene-perovskite devices exhibited the smallest drop in open-circuit voltage with increasing temperature.
“The open-circuit voltage temperature coefficient of the graphene-perovskite panels is half of the one of crystalline silicon panels, simultaneously also exhibiting a larger positive short-circuit current temperature coefficient,” the scientists said. “At the same time, our results indicate that additional efforts are required to improve encapsulant materials and lamination protocol to extend further the panels’ lifetime.”
They introduced their findings in “Integration of two-dimensional materials-based perovskite solar panels into a stand-alone solar farm,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. The research group includes scientists from the University of Tor Vergata, the IIT Graphene Labs, the University of Siena, and GreatCell Solar Italia Srl in Italy, as well as Hellenic Mediterranean University in Greece.
“The data produced by the solar farm will be of fundamental importance for exploitation at the industrial level of the perovskite PV,” Di Carlo said.

“Of the 24 bidders, eight were from solar, another eight were from wind, seven were from run-of-river hydro, and one was from biomass,” the DOE said. “The success of this competitive process will set the benchmark for the future auction rounds, as the resulting Green Energy Tariff (GET) will reflect the value of electricity.”
The ministry said a new renewable energy auction will be held in 2023. Developers that did not qualify for last week's auction can file their project proposals in the next round, it said.
“The first green energy auction in the Philippines was held today, which is a significant step in encouraging more power generation investments in renewable energy, while protecting the interest of Filipino consumers – a testament to the country’s commitment to developing indigenous and clean sources of energy at competitive prices,” said Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi.
The authorities want to contract 1,260 MW of PV, 380 MW of wind power, 230 MW of biomass, and 130 MW of hydropower capacity. Around 900 MW will likely be assigned to Luzon province, while the provinces of Visayas and Mindanao are expected to be awarded 260 MW and 100 MW, respectively.
The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has set a cap price for PV technology at PHP 3.628 ($0.066)/kWh for the exercise. The cap for wind power is PHP 5.2887.
The government of the Philippines announced plans to introduce the Green Energy Tariff Program auction in February 2020.

Polar Developments, a Spanish startup specializing in portable solar energy solutions, presented its PolarGreen Tow system at the Next Generation festival in Madrid last week.
Mónica Sánchez García, head of communications for Polar Development, told pv magazine that the company is part of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program of the Science Park of the Carlos III University of Madrid. She said the PolarGreen Tow trailer can be transformed into “an authentic removable solar micro farm” in less than an hour.
The compact vehicle houses 12 solar panels, totaling 4.4 kW. Its folding system was inspired by the masts of space satellites.
“PolarGreen Tow is the first portable system to recharge an electric car,” said Sánchez García.
The system is scalable and can reach a capacity of up to 6.5 kW. It can be used to provide energy for cars, scooters or electric bikes. It can also provide energy support to homes during power outages, among other uses.
In March, Polar Developments launched a portable PV system for low-consumption applications. The device can recharge mobile phones, tablets and computers, as well as small appliances or electric tools, by simply unfolding the solar panels and connecting them.

Mining giant Rio Tinto has officially opened its Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia (WA). The company is calling Gudai-Darri its most technologically advanced iron ore mine in the region, with a capacity of 43 million tons each year. 
The mine boasts all sorts of Q-Branch-style gadgets, from autonomous trucks, trains and drills, to a digital replica of the processing plant complete with interactive 3D environment for virtual reality training. However, the flashiest technology has to be the site’s 34 MW solar farm. 
Consisting of 83,000 panels the solar farm will provide one-third of the electricity needs of the mine. It is expected to be completed in August. 
It is not surprising that the company is on its best behaviour after it destroyed two 46,000-year-old sacred Indigenous sites in the Juukan Gorge back in 2020. Perhaps the only surprising thing is that Rio Tinto has been allowed to continue mining at all. 
Rio Tinto Iron Ore CEO Simon Trott described Gudai-Darri as Rio Tinto’s first greenfield mine in the Pilbara in more than a decade. 
Western Australian Minister for Mines Bill Johnston said that the solar farm will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 90,000 tons a year, which equal to the annual emissions produced by 6,000 Australian households. 
Rio Tinto has promised to develop a 1 GW solar and wind power operation in the Pilbara, with plans to develop green steel. The company has also promised 4 GW of renewables, with firming for its Queensland projects.

Startup Legends Solar has unveiled a new early-access product, Legends Rooftop, which is an online, on-demand solar investment platform. The platform allows people to purchase anywhere from one solar panel to an entire array on a remote commercial rooftop. It is pitched as a way for millennial investors to access the benefits of solar.
Users select how many panels they want to invest in, with the smallest investment starting at a few hundred dollars. The platform tracks the performance of the panels and banks the energy savings created by the solar project in the user’s account. Withdrawals can be made at any time, said Legends Solar.
The company said there are some risks in the investment, including poor weather conditions, failure of payment by the “offtaker” or power purchaser, unexpected maintenance, or natural disasters and physical damage. It said that hospitals and universities are usually very consistent offtakers.
“With Legends Solar, you can invest in a single remotely located panel, or a whole rooftop’s worth, even without the suburban minimansion and white picket fence,” said Legends Solar CEO Lassor Feasley.
SDC Energy will serve as a financial partner for Legends Solar. The company has performed hundreds of solar financings in the past.
“The team at Legends Solar has challenged us to reimagine our approach to raising equity for new solar facilities,” said SDC Energy President Charles Schaffer. “We look forward to unlocking the solar asset class for a wider and more diverse set of retail investors. By doing this, we will accelerate the transition to a carbon free society and spread its financial benefits more equitably.”
The tool tracks solar production, the amount of carbon abated, total cash earned, and dividend payments.

“In the de-occupied territories most affected by the Russians, there are problems with electricity, and Tesla Powerwall stations provide backup power during power outages,” said Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov. 
Solar power systems are being deployed mostly to prevent blackouts and to protect critical infrastructure such as hospitals, said Olga Sukhopara, development director of the Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy. 
“After the liberation of the north of Ukraine, a lot of power grid lines were damaged or destroyed due to hostilities,” Sukhopara said, adding that all damaged grid lines in the region have been restored. 
Commercial rooftops and facade solar PV have become popular in recent years as a way to save on energy bills, said Sukhopara.  
“Cross-subsidizing in the electricity sector still exists in Ukraine: tariffs for households are state-regulated, while business pays market price for electricity which is on average three times higher than for households,” she said. “That's why businesses started installing solar systems for their own consumption more often – to lower energy bills and to provide themselves with electricity at fixed price years ahead.”
Ukraine's solar industry is mostly focused on survival now, and not on further development. The aim is to avoid going bankrupt under constant curtailment and lower feed-in-tariff payments, said Sukhopara.  
“Work is underway to amend the legislation on free access to the electricity market for RES producers,” she said. “We also hope to start exporting green electricity to the EU in the near future.”

State minister for energy and mineral resources, Olalere Odusote, has revealed how the regional authority and the World Bank foresee the breakdown of the 1 GW ambition. Citing a need to invest between $350 million and $700 million in 500 MW of rooftop solar by mid 2027, Odusote said 200 MW of the 1 GW total would be in the form of residential arrays, with the same figure expected on government buildings.
The state of Lagos and the World Bank discussed the plans at a recent workshop. The C&I solar is expected to be owned by leasing companies, with households and public bodies owning their own systems.
The Agasa News reported this week that there is an 83% shortfall between demand and supply of grid electricity in Lagos state, amounting to 33 TWh to 43 TWh. The article said Odusote had described rooftop solar as “one of the potential solutions being considered” to bridge the grid shortfall.
The workshop reportedly concluded the necessary finance for the rooftop arrays would come in the form of grants, equity investment, and cheap loans, provided by donor bodies, equity investors, and commercial lenders.
The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that Nigeria had just 33 MW of grid-connected solar generation capacity at the end of 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/22/solar-window-generates-electricity-thermal-energy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,HONG KONG",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 22, 2022","Solar window generates electricity, thermal energy","Scientists from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have developed a dual-band selective solar harvesting (SSH) window based on transparent photovoltaics (TPVs) and transparent solar absorbers (TSAs). The TSAs are used to convert ultraviolet (UV) or near-infrared (NIR) light by converting it into thermal energy.
“The harvested thermal energy is extracted by ventilated air to provide indoor space heating in cold seasons or abate indoor cooling loading in hot seasons,” they explained. “We demonstrated that the SSH window has a visible transmittance of 42%, achieves a solar-electricity conversion efficiency of 0.75%, and a solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 24% with a ventilated air temperature rise of 10 C.”
The research group used a luminescent solar concentrator (TPV) based on copper indium sulfide and zinc sulfide (CuInS2/ZnS) quantum dots (QDs) as the exterior window. It is able to collect UV light and convey it to opaque PV devices that are located at the edge of the transparent substrate for electricity generation. The TSAs were instead used to fabricate the interior side of the window where heat is produced and collected.
“The thermal energy is mostly extracted by the ventilated air within the gap for various purposes such as indoor space heating in cold seasons,” the group said.
The academics fabricated a prototype measuring 30 cm x 30 cm x 2.4 cm by assembling the TPV elements with the TSAs on the interior side. They claim the device showed a substantial visible transmittance and that it was able to generate 6 W per square meter of power and the thermal power of around 150 W per square meter.
“Thermal power is 25 times of the generated electrical power, suggesting that the harvesting thermal power is of primary importance for building-integrated solar energy harvesting windows,” they said. “With thermal energy harvesting by air ventilation, the total effective efficiency was estimated over 30% at a typical operating condition for building space heating applications.”
They presented their findings in “Selective Solar Harvesting Windows for Full-Spectrum Utilization,” which was recently published in Advanced Science.
“The SSH window can save the annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption by up to 61.5% compared with the normal glass, in addition to the generated electricity that accounts for up to 19.1% of the annual energy saving amount,” they said.
