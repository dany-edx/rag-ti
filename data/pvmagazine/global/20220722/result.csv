https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/22/industrial-process-for-module-recycling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 22, 2022",Industrial process for ‘mobile’ solar module recycling,"Flaxres says it has transferred its proprietary technology to an industrial process, and is bringing its pilot solar panel recycling system to market.
The basis for the breakthrough was a successfully completed mass test with the recycling of 7.5 tons of solar modules in the “Flaxthor” production plant, it added. According to Flaxres, more than 200 kg of silicon and 4 kg of silver were recovered, as well as 4.9 tons of glass of the highest quality. The site in Dresden has a potential recycling capacity of more than 1,000 tons per year.
The new site serves purely as a development location, a Flaxres spokesman told pv magazine. There, the pilot production plant with a maximum capacity of 10 tons per day will be operated to test new and optimized process steps for full automation. The company its pilot plant achieves a cycle time of 10 seconds per module.
Based on this prototype, Flaxres wants to develop mobile equipment that will fit into a shipping container and be rented to customers, he said. “A full-scale stationary plant is rather counterproductive. The issuance of the operating license is advised for the end of 2022,” the Flaxres spokesman added. The plan, he said, is to begin constructing these new “Flaxthor” plants in 2024, and to have them available to customers by 2025.
According to the Flaxres spokesman, several contracts have already been signed with customers operating internationally. “However, the plants will not be sold, but only leased on a monthly basis with our personnel.” He also said that 100% of the total recycling capacity of the five new plants has already been allocated for 2024.
The plants are suitable for both crystalline and thin-film modules, and can process modules with damaged glass panes. All modules are separated into their main components with a low energy input. The materials recovered are of high quality due to the separation process developed and can thus enable a genuine recycling economy. The company does not rely on chemicals for its recycling process, it added.
The quantities of solar modules generated annually for recycling are still rather small. By 2030, however, a quantity of around 400,000 tons of these solar modules is expected for Germany alone, according to Flaxres. This corresponds to a number of about 20 million individual modules, and many companies and researchers are working on efficient recycling processes.

The same does not hold for China, the US, and the United Arab Emirates, where gas prices are significantly lower. The analysts found cheapest hydrogen in the European Union could be produced in Sweden and Italy, while Germany and Poland would have the highest levelized cost of production. “This reflects the comparably better renewable resources in southern Europe,” BloombergNEF's Meredith Annex told to pv magazine. According to BloombergNEF's modeling, onshore wind is the cheapest source of electricity to power electrolyzers in all European countries. By contrast, solar is the cheapest source in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. “Chinese alkaline electrolyzers are currently the cheapest equipment for making green hydrogen in the market and would allow hydrogen projects to compete the most effectively with current natural gas prices. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) equipment is more expensive, adding a price premium of 11-17% compared to Western alkaline technology. Using PEM to produce hydrogen would make the clean fuel less competitive with current natural gas prices in Europe,” Annex said, explaining that European gas prices will likely fall again later this decade, making green hydrogen less competitive on an energy-equivalent price basis. “Yet industrial players may still see higher demand for green hydrogen as a hedge against future gas market volatility.”
The Fukushima Prefecture and Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation are planning to launch a hydrogen truck for use in the residential and industrial sectors. Iwaki and Koriyama will be the first two cities to introduce the light-duty fuel cell (FC) electric truck in collaboration with unspecified logistics businesses and infrastructure providers. “As convenience stores and supermarkets begin to introduce FC light-duty trucks from January 2023, we will build an energy management system that links the fleet management system of each company, vehicle travel information, and hydrogen station information,” Toyota said in a statement. The final aim is to optimize logistics and avoid traffic congestion at hydrogen stations. Heavy-duty FC electric trucks should be deployed at a later stage. The project will also seek to establish hydrogen models for the industrial sector. Companies will produce green hydrogen locally and use it in their gas furnaces, while stationary FC generators will be installed in offices and stores. So far, the initiatives, which target towns with around 300,000 inhabitants, have attracted 27 partners, mostly local subsidiaries of international companies.
A team of researchers from the Tokyo University of Science designed a highly symmetric ruthenium complex with a organic compound containing nitrogen and operating without water that is claimed to improve high-temperature proton conduction in fuel cells. The new hydrogen-bonded metal complex is starburst-shaped and consists of ruthenium ion (Ru3+), three imidazole (HIm), and three imidazolate (Im-­). The resulting single molecular crystal reportedly shows excellent proton conductivity even at temperatures as high as 180 C and as low as –70 C. Imidazole typically melts at 120 C. “Upon investigating the proton conductivity of this starburst-type metal complex, the team found that each of the six imidazole groups attached to the Ru3+ ion acts as a proton transmitter. This made the molecule six times more potent than individual HIm molecules, which could only transport one proton at a time,” the team said.  The researchers aimed to find an alternative to Nafion membranes and used a synthetic polymer-based ionic membrane, which serves as a water-based proton conducting solid electrolyte. The use of water makes the fuel cell unable to operate at temperatures over 100 C. According to the researchers, the insights from their novel molecular design could be used to develop new high-temperature proton conductors, and improve the functionality of the existing ones. The researchers presented their findings in the study “Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High-Symmetry Hydrogen-Bonded Molecular Crystal of Ru(III) Complexes with Six Imidazole–Imidazolate Ligands,” which was recently published in Chemistry – A European Journal.
The United Kingdom has launched a new contractual business model resembling a contract for difference (CDF) for green hydrogen producers. Project developers can submit their proposals by September 7. The subsidy is given by the difference between a ”strike price” reflecting the cost of producing hydrogen and a ”reference price” reflecting the market value of hydrogen. The UK government allocated up to £240 million (€281.4 million) to support the upfront costs of developing and building low-carbon hydrogen production projects. Companies can submit their proposals for both programs through a single application process. Additional details on the budget for this first procurement round will be provided in early 2023.
Hydrogen-electric aircraft developer ZeroAvia announced it received $30 million in funding from new investors Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital, NEOM, AENU, and International Airlines Group (IAG).
The government of the Canadian province of Alberta launched the open call for the first round of funding available under the $50 million Hydrogen Centre of Excellence.

South Korea-based Hanwha Group, the parent corporation of Qcells, is establishing a low-carbon solar supply chain to support its solar energy growth strategy in North America, where it is constructing a manufacturing facility in Georgia to nearly double its total US production capacity to over 3 GW. In keeping with its intent to source low-carbon products domestically, the company has signed an agreement to source solar glass from Canadian Premium Sand (CPS).
“Following a tour of our planned facilities in Manitoba and meetings in Calgary with members of Hanwha’s management team in June of 2022, we are delighted to enter into an MOU with Hanwha regarding long-term supply of our low-carbon, patterned solar glass,” said Glenn Leroux, CPS president. “Hanwha’s North American solar glass demand requirements of over 3 gigawatts of module manufacturing represents over 80% of our planned Phase 1 production capacity.”
CPS will manufacture patterned solar glass in a new facility in Selkirk, Manitoba that uses the high-purity, low-iron silica sand from its wholly owned Wanipigow quarry leases. CPS intends to power the facility with renewable energy, which reduces the carbon footprint of the glass.  The company also intends to use recycled water in the manufacturing process along with waste heat recovery. The initial facility (phase 1) will have an annual production of 20 million square meters or the equivalent of 4 GW of solar panel manufacturing demand. The location in Manitoba has room for 4 such facilities in total. CPS expects to be manufacturing at full capacity in the first facility by 2025.
As Qcells expands its manufacturing footprint in North America, the company sees “tremendous value in securing supply from a trusted partner that is proximal to our operations,” a company spokesperson said. “Additionally, the integrated nature of CPS’ operation with its wholly-owned sand resource and the use of renewable hydro-electricity in its manufacturing process offer excellent alignment with our low-carbon objectives.”
In May Qcells announced that its new solar panel manufacturing facility, expected to come online in 2023, will be located in Dalton, Georgia near where the company already operates a 1.7 GW module factory. In March, Hanwha Solutions, parent corporation of Qcells, announced that it was stepping up efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products when it became the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, a major US manufacturer of polysilicon. Following its initial $160 million acquisition to acquire a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha announced that it was acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at around $44 million.
Hanwha’s US initiative supports the Biden administration’s efforts to increase solar power generation by 40% and to decarbonize all electricity by 2035. Hanwha sees the enactment of the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) as critical to a US-based solar supply chain. While Hanwha had stated that it would “…implement a multi-phase, multi-billion-dollar expansion across the full solar energy supply chain” once SEMA was passed, the expansion has begun.

“The investor consortium is led by French investor Meridiam, Allianz Capital Partners, and Japanese company Kansai Electric Power,” the EIB said in a statement released. “Alongside the EIB, other promotional banks include the UK Infrastructure Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).”
The bank said construction on the project should begin by the end of this year, with completion being scheduled for 2028.
The predominantly submarine cable will have a length of 725 km, a capacity of 1.4 GW, and a DC voltage of 525 kV. It will connect a converter station operated by Tennet near Fedderwarden, in Germany, to the UK network operated by National Grid via a converter station on the Isle of Grain.
German conglomerate Siemens will build the converter stations and cable manufacturer Prysmian will deploy the cable.
In September 2020, Tennet and National Grid announced a cooperation agreement to explore the feasibility of connecting Dutch and British wind farms to the energy systems of both countries via subsea electricity cables called interconnectors. Under the terms of the cooperation agreement, the two grid operators will explore the development of a multi-purpose interconnector (MPI) to simultaneously connect up to 4 gigawatts of British and Dutch offshore wind between the British and Dutch electricity systems, providing an additional 2 GW of interconnection capacity between the countries.

The Ministry of Economy improved the net metering regime by increasing the maximum size for residential PV systems eligible to inject surplus power into the grid from 4 to 6 kW and from 20 to 40 kW for commercial solar arrays.
As for the rebate scheme, it will cover up to 30% of the costs of buying and installing a PV system, with a maximum amount of MKD 62,000 ($1,025) being available for each project.
Furthermore, the local media outlet energetika.net reported that the head of the country's energy regulator – the ERC – has promised to eliminate all network fees that are currently applied to residential and commercial consumers that install a PV system.
The Macedonian government is targeting to deploy 250 MW of rooftop PV capacity by 2030, according to its National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP).
North Macedonia is currently also supporting large scale solar through a series of tenders. The most recent one was launched by the Ministry of Economy in July. Other solar tenders were previously held in the country by the state-owned electric company Elektrani na Severna Makedonija (ESM).
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Balkan country had around 94 MW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of 2021.

“We found that adhering multiple modules to a custom vinyl tarp allows the user to reconfigure the modules strings to accommodate 12, 24 & 48V off-grid systems all the way up to residential type all-in-one inverters that require over 120 Vdc to charge batteries. ,” the company's COO, Lee Feliciano, told pv magazine. “Our module provider is US-based Merlin Solar.”
The system is built with flexible modules provided by Merlin Solar with a power output of 70 and 80 W, respectively.
New Use Energy Solutions' PV array is available in three versions; the TriFold SunTarp array, which combines three solar modules, weighs 6.8 kg and has a power output of 210 W; the 320 W FourFold SunTarp model that integrates four panels and weighs in at 10.8 kg; and the six-module HexFold SunTarp which has a power output of 410 W and has a weight of 20.4 kg.
“They store easily even in the trunk of compact cars, and we can scale them into larger arrays,” the company's CEO, Paul Shmotolokha, stated. “Our modules are 30% lighter than traditional monocrystalline solar panels and easy to fold, carry and stow.”

In the study Impact of the tilt angle, inverter sizing factor and row spacing on the photovoltaic power forecast accuracy, published in Applied Energy, the scientists also developed a multi-objective optimization (MOO) method, which they claim can help identify the tradeoff between the energy yield and forecast errors of PV plants.
“This study is the first to connect the field of PV forecasting and design optimization,” they stated. “The results contribute to both the forecasting research community – by revealing how the verification and the expected accuracy depends on the design parameters – and the PV designers – by proposing a method for taking the costs of forecast inaccuracies into account during the optimization of PV plants.”
The scientists conducted their analysis across ten locations, including the seven Surface Radiation budget (SURFRAD) network stations, which were established in the United States to support satellite retrieval validations, and three meteorological stations in Hungary. These locations, they specified, cover five climate zones, a wide range of altitudes, and different forecast error characteristics.
Their model considered error metrics such as the mean-normalized mean bias (nMBE), mean absolute (nMAE), and root mean square errors (nRMSE) as a function of the tilt angle, the inverter sizing factor, and row spacing for the ten examined locations. “The default parameters for these diagrams are 25 degrees tilt and 0 degrees azimuth angle, 1.0 inverter sizing factor, and 2.5 relative row spacing,” they stressed. “As a general tendency, an increasing tilt angle increases, while an increasing sizing factor decreases the nMAE and nRMSE. The effect of the row spacing is only visible at relative row distances shorter than 2.1, and it is still small and ambiguous.”

They also explained that depending on the location, with a tilt angle up to 45 degrees and inverter sizing factor up to 1.5, the high tilt angle can increase the nMAE and nRMSE by up to 49% and 43%, while a high inverter sizing factor may decrease the errors by up to 25% and 10%, respectively. The effect of the row spacing was estimated at less than 5% in most cases.
The academics stressed that the error of the irradiance-to-power conversion is strictly dependent on the three design parameters and that yield forecast accuracy is usually affected by the whole error pattern of the irradiance forecasts instead of simple average errors. “The irradiance-to-power conversion of solar forecasts can introduce bias and affect the variance of the power forecasts; therefore, it is recommended to perform a further calibration and bias correction even after the power forecasts are calculated,” they suggested, noting that forecast error should be always included in the design optimization of PV plants.
“This paper is the first to reveal that the expected forecast errors should be considered during the PV design optimization; still, the presented results are preliminary,” the researchers concluded.

“The key to the development of efficient flexible perovskite-CIGS thin-film tandem modules is the development of near-infrared (NIR) transparent perovskite solar modules on a flexible polymer foil,” the research's corresponding author, Fan Fu, told pv magazine. “Researchers in the Laboratory for Thin Films and Photovoltaics at Empa have overcome the challenges of laser patterning on flexible substrates to realize the first all-laser scribed monolithically interconnected NIR-transparent perovskite mini-modules on polymer film.”
The perovskite mini-module used in the tandem panel was fabricated on a flexible polyethylene napthalathe (PEN) substrate mounted to a glass substrate in a p–i–n device architecture. This configuration, according to the research team, shows reduced absorption in the NIR region.
The scientists used thermally evaporated buckminsterfullerene, a molecule which is also known as C60, for the fabrication of the electron transport layer (ETL). To protect the underlying layers from ion damage during the sputtering of transparent conductive oxide (TCO), they placed a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer on top of the C60 by atomic layer deposition (ALD). They also applied P2 scribing to create a pathway to interconnect the adjacent subcells and P3 scribing to isolate the rear electrode between the subcells.
The mini-module has a power conversion efficiency of 10.8% and an average transmittance of over 75% in the NIR range, which makes it suitable for tandem applications. “The light-harvesting potential of the NIR-transparent mini-module can be improved by utilizing a thicker wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite absorber with excellent optoelectronic properties,” the academics said.
The perovskite module was combined with a CIGS module with an efficiency of 15.1%. “The flexible 4T perovskite-CIGS mini-module performs at an efficiency of 18.4% and outperforms both the perovskite and CIGS stand-alone mini-module,” the Swiss group emphasized. “An absolute efficiency gain of 7.5% and 3.3% is achieved with respect to the perovskite and CIGS stand-alone mini-modules.”
The Swiss Scientists present their findings in “Laser patterned flexible 4T perovskite-CIGS tandem minimodule with over 18% efficiency,” which was recently published in Solar RRL. “The flexible perovskite-CIGS tandem mini-modules can potentially be used in applications where flexibility and lightweight are important considerations, such as portable and wearable electronics, building- and vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV and VIPV), internet of things (IoT), and space applications,” Fu concluded.

Sydney-based manufacturer Canyon Solar has launched a modular solar carport solution for commercial applications that has been specifically designed for rapid installation with company director Will Beaumont claiming the time-saving translates into a significant reduction in site labor requirements and a corresponding cost saving for clients.
“We found with the second prototype that we just finished installing in the Southern Highlands that we’re cracking three times faster installation compared with an in-situ system,” he said. “If you’re deploying it three times faster than an in-situ installation, there is quite a good labor saving in there which we are passing on to the client. “The labor component is typically 40% of the turnkey costs of the system so it translates to about a 20% cost saving on labor.”
Canyon’s modular solar shade structure is built around individual pods, each measuring 7.5 m long and 2. 6m wide with two pods combined to create a single unit that covers three car park bays. The units can be deployed in series to give shelter to hundreds of vehicles, the manufacturer said.
Each individual pod houses six 660 W bifacial panels from Canadian Solar coupled with multi-string inverters from Sungrow but the structure is designed to easily incorporate components from other manufacturers. The waterproof system can be grid-connected, linked to storage and seamlessly integrates with electric vehicle charging hardware.
The pods and steel support structures are pre-assembled in the factory and delivered to the site where the pods are lifted into place atop the prefabricated columns and rafters. Final electrical connections are completed before the system is commissioned.
“Basically 80% of the work is done before arriving at the site,” Beaumont said. “All the modules on the pods are already installed, they’re wired, the waterproofing system is actually incorporated into the module mounting system so that is already done as well. “The idea is when you go to install it, all you’re doing is erecting the columns and the rafters are attached to that. You are then basically just using a forklift or a telehandler to lift the pods into place and finishing off the final connections.”
Beaumont, who established Canyon Solar after time spent with C&I solar heavyweight Solgen Energy, said the modular shade structures provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional cloth or membrane-based shade structures and rooftop solar PV installs.
“If you’re trying to sell solar just on solar, carport systems don’t make sense because there’s a lot of extra costs in terms of the foundations, the support structure, all those components,” he said. “But when you look at what a traditional shade cloth costs and what rooftop solar PV costs, which is usually AUD 1.20 ($0.82) per W, when you combine those two budgets, our solar shade structure actually costs less. “When you subtract what a normal shade structure will cost, our effective solar cost is usually between AUD 1.10 and AUD 1.20 per W. If you are already considering putting shade in the car park, solar shade is actually better than rooftop solar in many cases. And that is from a dollar-per-watt perspective.”
Canyon Solar is yet to secure its first commercial project but Beaumont said the company is in negotiations with “a number of shopping centers and universities” with the first of the installations expected to be completed before the end of the year. “I’m very optimistic that modular solar shade structures will become a big part of the future solar industry,” he said. “We’ve now hit the point where it is commercially better to install a solar shade structure than a traditional membrane-based shade cloth in most commercial carports.”

As the cost of polysilicon rises, the need for increased efficiency and reduced costs in PV products intensifies.
Large and high-power components now account for 80% of capacity and shipments of wafers, cells, and modules, and have become mainstream in the market. Large modules, considered 182 mm and 210 mm, made up nearly 80% of shipments in Q2.
Major module makers are expected to ship a total of 203 to 230 GW throughout 2022, and shipments of 210 mm modules will rise rapidly, said the report.
The high-power 600 W or greater modules are generally used for utility-scale ground mounted applications. Analysis of nearly 90 GW of module tenders indicated that 77% of buyers want power of 530 W and above. About 19% of module tenders reported no size requirement.
The quantity of residential, commercial, and industrial products is expected to see a rapid increase under the thriving intensity of the distributed market, said the report. These products are currently sitting at a power range of 400 W to 450 W, with approximately 68.75% of products at 410 W to 430 W.
The report said that 56 cell manufacturers, about 80% of all cell makers, can now produce 180 mm and 210 mm cells, a year-over-year growth of 51% of manufacturers with that capability. The report said large cells of this size are expected to reach 593.25 GW in 2023, and 210 mm cells alone are expected to reach a market share of 58%.
Large wafers of this format size are expected to reach 90% of the market share by 2023. Progress made in wafer thinning has exceeded initial expectations, said the report, leading to a significant reduction in wafer consumption.
Businesses faced with persistently high prices of raw materials are steadily reducing their use of wafers by rapidly switching from 165 μm to 160 μm to 155 μm. TrendForce expects this will continue the move toward 150 μm. Wafer consumption is thus expected to drop from 2.7 g/W to 2.8 g/W in 2021 to about 2.6g/W.
As PERC technology is nearing the theoretical limit of efficiency improvement weighed against cost of materials, transportation, and land costs, N-type modules are becoming essential for PV businesses seeking competitive advantage. Manufacturers are targeting this technology for its improvement in conversion efficiency and reduction in system costs.
Last month, Trina Solar announced it is developing a 210 mm N-type module that is expected to have a capacity of above 700 W. The report said 210 mm and N-type continue to optimize levelized cost of electricity, which may further increase the share of PV in renewable energy buildout.
