The state-owned utility released the results of its second module procurement tender on its website. The companies each won 350 MW contracts, totaling 1.05 GW.
Daqo New Energy said its board of directors has approved a $700 million share repurchase program, effective from Nov. 7, 2022, to Dec. 31, 2023. The company has been authorized to repurchase up to $700 million of its own issued and outstanding ordinary shares.
TBEA said it expects to produce around 120,000 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon in 2022, up 53.5% year on year. It said that it 2023 output will likely fall in the range of 240,000 MT to 250,000 MT. In the third quarter, it signed a number of long-term polysilicon supplement agreements with major companies such as Jinko Solar.
FuturaSun has doubled its module production capacity from 500 MW to more than 1 GW. The Italian manufacturer opened its first module factory last year in Taizhou, Zhejiang province. It has now opened a new production plant next to the original one, with two production lines totaling 550 MW, to process 166 mm to 210 mm half-cut cells. FuturaSun said it plans to allocate some of the new production capacity to other markets in Asia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/09/max-planck-spinoff-making-metal-mesh-electrodes-for-lithium-ion-batteries/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022",Max Planck spinoff making metal mesh electrodes for lithium-ion batteries,"A new approach developed by researchers at the Max Planck Institute could potentially pave the way for the transition from 2D foil current collectors, which are used in today’s lithium-ion batteries, to fleece current collectors. The innovation could drive the emergence of a new generation of rechargeable batteries with high energy density, faster charging rates, prolonged runtimes, and longer lifespans.
At the heart of the team's innovation is a process developed by Joachim Spatz, the director at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research. The process results in very fine metallic fibers, which can be used to make thicker battery cells.
The metallic fibers, which have good electrical conductivity, are then processed into a dense, conductive metal mesh and filled with the active material of the anode or cathode. Such electrodes make it possible to increase the thickness of battery cells to more than 2 mm, or 10 times that of cells commonly used today.
The active material, which is important for energy storage, currently accounts for just 60% of lithium-ion battery weight. But the new design developed at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research reduces the metal content and increases the active material proportion of the total battery weight.
The metal meshes have a significantly larger surface area than conventional current collectors, so the batteries with such current collectors can be charged and discharged much faster. In addition, the metal mesh is said to make the lithium-ion batteries safer by reducing the electrical resistance of the electrodes and increasing their mechanical stability, eliminating unfavorable hotspots in heat generation, as well as electrical and mechanical stress.
The researchers said the new batteries are resource efficient due to “significantly reduced material consumption and an extremely energy-saving manufacturing process.” The millimeter-thick electrodes are said to translate into significantly extended battery life and up to 30% less material costs per kilowatt-hour.
The active material and the batene fleece, as the current collector, are highly elastic and capable of adapting to volume changes during charging and discharging. This reportedly prevents the premature aging of the battery.
While the innovation can function as a drop-in technology for existing production lines, according to the researchers, it is not limited to the lithium-ion batteries of today. The ultra-fine metal mesh electrodes are also said to have great potential for other battery chemistries, such as lithium metal solid-state batteries or sodium-ion batteries.
Batene GmbH, a newly established spinoff of the institute, has licensed the technology through the Max Planck Society’s central technology transfer company, Max Planck Innovation, and is now marketing it. It has already secured initial funding of €10 million.
The startup has also exclusively licensed the corresponding rights to develop and market the technologies. Following successful demonstrators, it is now ready to build up a larger production capacity for electrodes made of metal fleece, to further develop the technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/09/hydrogen-producing-rooftop-solar-panels-nearing-commercialization/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BELGIUM",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022",Hydrogen-producing rooftop solar panels nearing commercialization,"KU Leuven researchers in Belgium have created a hydrogen panel that directly converts water vapor from the air into hydrogen gas, with the help of sunlight. They claim it produces 250 liters of hydrogen per day, at an efficiency of 15%. They are developing it under the Solhyd project, which is now in a transition phase from research to spinoff.
In a nutshell, hydrogen panels are modules that use solar energy to split water molecules and produce hydrogen gas. This means only the most arid places on Earth are too dry for hydrogen panels to work efficiently. They are akin to classical solar modules, but instead of an electric cable, they are connected via gas tubes.
Specifically, electricity is produced by the top layer solar panel, with a system of tubes underneath, where the hydrogen is produced from water molecules extracted directly from the air using a membrane.
“Solhyd hydrogen panels are compatible with most commercial modern PV modules, which are directly plugged into our system. This way, we can benefit from the ongoing developments and cost reductions in the PV industry,” KU Leuven researcher Jan Rongé told pv magazine. “To further enhance this synergy, Solhyd hydrogen panels are compatible with common PV mounting structures.”
The researchers described the hydrogen panel as small-scale, modular, and ideal for decentralized production. They estimated that 20 of the panels could supply electricity and heat for a well-insulated house with a heat pump all winter long. When installed alongside a solar thermal collector and traditional solar panels, hydrogen panels could help heat homes and provide electricity throughout the year.
“The hydrogen panels themselves do not store hydrogen and work at very low pressure. This has several safety and cost benefits. The hydrogen is collected centrally from the hydrogen panel plant, and then compressed, if needed,” Rongé said. “Hydrogen can be stored indefinitely in compressed form. Of course, certain applications do not require compression, or will use other means of storage.”
Hydrogen produced by Solhyd panels can be used in a wide range of applications, including mobility.
“In the shorter term, we are mostly targeting mid-sized applications, such as backup power, logistics, heavy transport, but also providing energy in the Global South,” said Rongé. “Later, you could think of anything from large scale ammonia production down to small-scale off-grid systems.”
The researchers said they foresee a similar system-price cost curve like the one seen in PV, and noted that they use non-precious materials to keep the hydrogen panels affordable. They have tested several prototypes since the project launch in 2011 and are ready to launch industrial production of hydrogen panels.
In September, the Solhyd project moved from the university labs to a new 350 square-meter production space close to the Belgian town of Leuven, where pilot production lines were established with the help of Flemish government funding. Initially, the team will produce a few dozen hydrogen panels for small-scale pilot projects. But by 2026, the team expects to scale up production to 5,000 panels a year.
“At this moment we expect that the product will be commercially available from 2026 onwards,” Rongé said. “When we achieve mass production, the price will be close to that of PV modules today.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/09/rooftop-pv-performance-during-heatwaves/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022",Rooftop PV performance during heatwaves,"Scientists from research institutions across China have developed a model to evaluate the impact of rooftop PV on the energy use of residential buildings and their surrounding air temperatures during heatwaves. They revealed their findings in “Thermal and energy benefits of rooftop photovoltaic panels in a semi-arid city during an extreme heatwave event,” which was recently published in Energy and Buildings.
The study assesses the impact of rooftop PV arrays of varying energy efficiencies on mid-rise residential buildings. In particular, it investigates the impact on air conditioning use and surrounding urban temperatures. The researchers conducted the study in northeastern China, in a semi-arid area that was hit by an extreme heat wave in 2018.
They handled the numerical evaluation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, coupled with building effect parameterization (BEP) and building energy model (BEM).
“Forced by the atmospheric conditions on the lowest level of the WRF model, the system computes the surface momentum, heat, humidity and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes induced by the underlying urban surface and feeds back these fluxes to the atmospheric dynamic governing equations,” said the researchers.
The academics analyzed 12 simulations with different percentages of rooftop coverage and panel conversion efficiency against a control case. They assumed that the PV arrays were installed in parallel and at a certain height away from the roof. It was also assumed that every building in the city used an air-conditioning system during the modeled heatwave conditions.
The control case had an air-conditioning system installed, but no rooftop PV. The 12 scenarios consist of rooftop PV coverage levels of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, with conversion efficiencies of 10%, 20%, and 30%.
The results showed that an increase in covered area and conversion efficiency contributed to strong cooling effects. Rooftops with 100% PV coverage and energy efficiency of 30% could lower air temperatures by 0.4 C to 0.7 C. The combination reduced air-conditioning energy consumption by 14.74%.
“Such results indicate that the cities with a lower albedo and emissivity could benefit more from [rooftop PV] implementation in urban heat mitigation, along with an increasing urban effective albedo,” said the researchers.
Based on the 12 scenarios, the average daily cooling energy consumption reduction ranged between 1.29 MWh and 6.58 MWh per square kilometer. That represented an energy reduction of 2.89% to 14.74 %, relative to the control scenario. The 25% rooftop coverage and 10% efficiency scenario showed negligible thermal impacts, “suggesting a minimal threshold of [rooftop PV] coverage in terms of improving thermal environment,” the researchers concluded.

However, achieving high efficiency and overcoming challenges related to long-term stability is only part of the picture.
Scientists and startups have presented a range of different ways for perovskite solar cells to be manufactured at scale, and we’ll probably see quite a few different approaches introduced over the next few years. Flash testing involves products that are tested under simulated sunlight to determine their efficiency, along with other characteristics.
This stage in production is important for quality control and monitoring throughout a cell or module’s lifetime, and requires a clear comparable standard for all devices. However, applying standards developed for silicon PV to perovskites raises a number of challenges. These challenges are neatly described in a new white paper by German flash-testing equipment supplier Wavelabs. Along with others, it has been hard at work on solutions for the past several years.
“PST cells require a flexible, spectrally and temporally variable light source,” said Britta Mette, a product and service engineer at Wavelabs.
The paper explains that the manufacturer sees three main challenges to flash testing of perovskite-silicon tandem devices (PSTs). First is the need for “pre-conditioning.” Unlike silicon cells, perovskites take a few seconds to stabilize when exposed to light, so they need to be exposed for longer periods to be accurate. As a solution to this, Wavelabs suggests that some form of “light-soaking” will be needed before the actual test measurement is taken, with a timing and intensity that can be varied.
“Light soaking needs to become an integral part of cell testing capabilities,” the company said. “The light-soaking technology needs to provide the option to adjust soaking times fast, easy and in a stable manner.”
The ability to measure the two (or more) cell layers separately, while they are laid out as one device, is also a key challenge.
“PST cell flasher and testing systems need the flexibility to create varying spectra and light intensities according to the respective cell’s optimum – and to do this at ease and with precision,” the manufacturer stated. “This also includes being able to monitor the current mismatch between sub-cells during degradation tests to ensure the best match and optimal performance in the field.”
Finally, the paper notes that two-sided flash testing is needed for bifacial products. The ability to adjust light conditions to reflect various conditions, particularly for the light reaching the rear side of the cells, will be an increasingly valuable attribute for flashing equipment.
The company is naturally keen to note that its point of view that it sees its LED-based solutions as uniquely able to meet all of these challenges. It said that they allow for easy switching of different light conditions, intensities and durations, although other flashing technologies do exist on the market and are also preparing solutions for perovskites.
“Cell flashers for the characterization of PST cells must offer the possibility to take into account the specifics of different cell designs as well as to implement measurement on an industrial scale, “said Wavelabs COO and CTO Patrick Mergell. “Currently, only LED-based cell flasher technology meets the necessary measurement requirements of PST solar cells in a form that is simple, accurate and efficient.”

It reportedly has outstanding surface passivation properties and offers similar electrical performance to passivating contacts based on doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) or polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si).
“The limited optical transparency of a-Si:H or poly-Si results in significant parasitic absorption, which limits performance when these contacts are applied to the illuminated side of a cell,” the researchers explained, noting that TMOs are versatile when used as electron- or hole-selective heterocontacts. “Furthermore, these films can be deposited at low temperatures (T ≤ 200 C), implying a strong opportunity for process simplification and cost reduction.”
They designed the carrier-selective passivating contacts with a 2 nm stack based on aluminum-alloyed titanium oxide (Al-TiO2)  and a 2 nm stack based on pure TiO2. They said the optimized stack allows superior surface passivation, while maintaining low contact resistivity between the semiconductor material and metal electrode.
“Surface passivation was observed to improve somewhat with rising substrate temperature deposition up to 75 C, before slowly deteriorating above 75 C, reaching its lowest level at 200 C,” they said.
The research team used the novel passivating contacts to demonstrate an n-type c-Si solar cell that achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.9%, an open-circuit voltage of 665 mV, a short-circuit current of 40.78 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 80.8%.
“The only moderately high open-circuit voltage of the Al y TiO x /TiO x cells is inconsistent with what would be expected based on the superb surface passivation demonstrated by the novel stack in this study,” they said. “This suggests that surface passivation deteriorates somewhat following metallization.”
The academics said that more work should be done on how to sustain the surface passivation quality after the metallization step. However, they claimed that the initial results are highly encouraging.
“We believe that by definitively addressing these challenges, our novel stack has the potential to match, and possibly outperform, Si-based contacts (a-Si:H and poly-Si) in terms of fabrication cost, simplicity, and performance,” they said.
They described the new approach in “Outstanding Surface Passivation for Highly Efficient Silicon Solar Cells Enabled by Innovative AlyTiOx/TiOx Electron-Selective Contact Stack,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.
“This study establishes a pathway for the development of novel heterocontacts combining outstanding electrical properties with high optical transparency, capable of addressing current performance limitations in high-efficiency c-Si solar cells, based on Earth-abundant, economical, and simple-to-prepare TMOs that are appropriate for industrial use,” they said.

Australian civil engineering contractor Abergeldie Complex Infrastructure launched its Ardent Underground vertical hydrogen storage solution in 2019. Building on its boring technology, the design is a purpose-built deep shaft to house compressed hydrogen – not too dissimilar from the salt cavern concept.
Hydrogen storage isn’t a simple task, as the molecule is small and volatile. But without it, projects like Energy Estate’s proposed Hunter Hydrogen Network simply aren’t secure investment decisions.
“The whole discussion now is basically an energy security discussion,” Simon Currie, principal and co-founder of Australian developer Energy Estate, told pv magazine Australia. “We need to have lots of security on the production side, and we need to have lots of security along the midsteam.”
In hydrogen projects, storage is especially vital because to make ammonia and other green hydrogen derivatives, you need a baseload power source so the plants can run uninterrupted 24/7. The way to achieve that is a “both/and” scenario, according to Currie.
That is, you need lots of electrical storage to power the facility – be it in the form of pumped hydro, batteries, concentrated solar thermal power (CSP). You also need hydrogen storage so you have a “large buffer sitting on the midstream side of it,” added Currie. The stored hydrogen then becomes a backstop for when variable sources like wind and solar aren’t available, and pumped hydro or batteries are depleted.
The first project Energy Estate and Abergeldie will look at together is the proposed 1.6 GW Hunter Hydrogen Network (H2N) – a proposal that Currie describes as more of an “ecosystem” than a project. It is being jointly developed by Energy Estate and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which is a joint venture between Toyota Tsusho and Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco).

SunPower, a US residential solar development company, added 23,100 customers in the third quarter, with revenue increasing to $470 million and net income hitting $139 million, from a $73 million net loss in the July-September 2021 period.
Like other residential solar companies, California-based SunPower says it sees more customers turning to solar, as US retail energy prices continued to escalate by 14.3% year on year through August. For its fiscal year 2022 guidance, the company reiterated its plans to conclude the year with 73,000 to 80,000 customers, while generating $90 million to $110 million in net income.
SunPower said the serviceable market for US residential solar will expand by up to 50 million homes, given the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the boosting of the solar ITC credit to 30% through 2032. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie have issued projections suggesting that 7.3 GW of incremental installed capacity could be added from 2023 to 2027.
SunPower pointed to additional market tailwinds from the IRA, including a 30% standalone energy storage ITC credit starting in 2023, and ITC adders for single-family leases, as new sources of customer accretion.
