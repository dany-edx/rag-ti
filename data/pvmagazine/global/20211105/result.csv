https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/05/greece-launches-gr-eco-islands-initiative-with-e100-mlllion-pot/,"MARKETS,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",Greece launches Gr-Eco Islands Initiative with €100 mlllion pot,"The Greek government and the island of Halki hosted an inauguration of the island’s green energy community project, comprising an 1 MW solar PV farm, electric vehicles and a 5G telecommunications network. pv magazine presented the project in detail in July.
The pilot project is looking to foster clean and energy independent island communities. The project inaugurated today comprises a PV array that will provide free electricity to the members of the energy community, as well as electric cars and various Internet of Things (IoT) hardware and software – an attempt to link the islands’ public institutions, such as its school and the local health center, to mainland Greece and the world.
An addition to the project initially announced in July is a solar-powered boat, which was designed and built by a Greek family enterprise in the nearby island of Patmos. The electric boat will offer excursions around Halki, providing an ecotourism element to the project.
Among others, today’s inauguration ceremony was attended by Greece’s prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis; the Greek minister of the environment and energy Kostas Skrekas and France’s ambassador to Greece Patrick Maisonnave.
The Halki community energy project was described as a symbol of close Greek-French cooperation. The project has been funded by Greek and French entreprises – with a combined investment of €1.5 million. This upfront investment was donated to the local energy community, comprising the local institutions, households and businesses that wish to join the scheme free of charge.
“Our target for Halki is to act as an ambassador, a case-study that this [the concept of an island energy community] works and that it creates value for any community who joins our Gr-Eco Islands Initiative,” said Alexandra Sdoukou, the secretary general for energy and mineral resources at Greece’s energy ministry at the inauguration.
Sdoukou’s team is behind the development of the Halki project and the new government initiative that aims to green the country’s islands.
“Chalki has 592 electricity customers,” said Sdoukou, off which “482 are households, 96 are small business and 14 are public authorities. These customers are served by 11 different electricity suppliers and have an annual electricity consumption about 1600 to1700 MWh.” Therefore, the ministry concluded that a 1 MW photovoltaic park will be enough to cover the electricity needs of the island.
The members of the energy community are not directly connected to the PV park. Instead they will receive electricity credit for free commensurate to the solar park’s generated energy, which operates under virtual net metering. The generated solar power feeds the local electricity of the islands of Halki and Rhodes in in the southeastern Aegean Sea.
According to our calculations, Sdoukou added, a business owner participating in the energy community will only have to pay about €2 for the generation of the electricity it consumes during four months. This is down from approximately €240 that it paid before.
Similarly, argued Sdoukou who included copies of electricity bills in her presentation, a typical island household will pay about €6 for the electricity it consumes in four months, down from €235 it paid before.
“Understandably, the consumers will still have to pay for the regulated charges of their electricity bills, for example the fee for using the electricity network. However, the competitive part of their bills will be a gift from the sun,” concluded Sdoukou.
Rather to the point, the secretary general commented that “an emerging issue is that replicating the Halki project across the Greek seas, will require funds.”
Critics could argue that the Halki project is entirely financed by donations and that corporations wouldn’t always donate systems and work. The secretary general provided an answer on this commenting that the government has “set up the so-called Decarbonisation Fund for the islands.”
Specifically, she added, the ministry has already “secured €100 million via the European Union’s Structural and Investment Funds, concerning the period 2021-2027. This €100 million pot will allow Greece to replicate the Chalki project in a dozen other Gre-Eco Islands.”
Moreover, Sdoukou claimed that the “ministry is currently in talks with the European Commission concerning Greece’s unused CO2 emissions from the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme for the period 2013-2020. The compensation that Greece will receive as a result of emitting less CO2 in the past years is over a billion.”
Speaking to pv magazine after the inauguration ceremony, the secretary general commented that “Greece aims to direct these funds towards the Gre-Eco Islands Initiative and we have communicated this to the European Commission. So, the Commission and the ministry are currently in the process of defining the investment routes for these funds to green our islands.“
In the following months, Greece will publish an initial list of islands that the new initiative is targeting.
The Gr-Eco Islands Initiative concerns all Greek islands, however the government has decided to start with the smaller ones, such as remote Halki. These islands are typically not connected to the country’s main electricity grid and suffer from economic underdevelopment. A second list of islands under the same initiative will follow at a later stage.

The two companies say that this technological development would provide a step-change improvement in the efficiency and carbon intensity of steam methane reforming for the production of hydrogen. “The ZoneFlow Reactor, a structured catalyst module that replaces conventional catalyst pellets in SMR tubes, provides far superior heat transfer and pressure drop performance,” the two companies wrote on Wednesday, adding that they will conduct reactive testing in ZFRT’s large-scale pilot plant at the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. “The reactive testing will validate the expected 15% increase in throughput over conventional catalyst pellet systems. Results from the pilot plant testing are expected to be available by mid-2022.” ZF Reactors are structured catalysts for use in steam methane reforming to produce hydrogen. Compared to conventional pellet catalyst, ZF Reactors improve heat transfer into the reforming reactor by over 100% without increasing the pressure drop across the reactor.
The Namibian government wants to appoint Windhoek-based project development company Hyphen Hydrogen Energy as the preferred bidder to develop the country's first large-scale vertically integrated green hydrogen project in the Tsau -Khaeb national park. “The project, worth an estimated US$9.4 billion [€ 8.14 billion], will ultimately produce 300,000 tons of green hydrogen per year for regional and global markets, either as pure green hydrogen or in derivative form (green ammonia),” Hyphen wrote in a statement on Thursday. Following the conclusion of the feasibility study and sign-off from the government, Hyphen would have the right to construct and operate the project for 40 years. “The first phase, which is expected to enter production in 2026, will see the creation of 2 gigawatts of renewable electricity generation capacity to produce green hydrogen for conversion into green ammonia, at an estimated capital cost of US$4.4 billion [€ 3.81 billion]. Further expansion phases in the late 2020s will expand combined renewable generation capacity to 5 gigawatts and 3 gigawatts of electrolyser capacity, increasing the combined total investment to US$9.4 billion [€ 8.14 billion]”, commented Hyphen CEO Marco Raffinetti. Germany and Namibia agreed in August to establish a hydrogen partnership. Germany, the first country to set up a joint hydrogen plan with Namibia, will provide up to €40 million.
German multinational MAN Energy has announced that its gas-powered, four-stroke engines are “H2-ready” and operable in stationary mode with a hydrogen content of up to 25% by volume in a gas-fuel mix. “At the same time, we are working on future concepts that will enable hydrogen fuelling of up to 100% as soon as it becomes available in large quantities,” commented Gunnar Stiesch, head of Engineering Engines at MAN Energy Solutions.
The German government and the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have discussed ways of establishing a framework for launching new action plans in the energy sector, specifically for green hydrogen and artificial fuel projects. “Launching the Emirati-German Bilateral Task Force on Hydrogen and Synthetic Fuels is a significant step that supports the UAE’s initiative to achieve climate neutrality by 2050,” commented Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority. The UAE wants to step up cooperation with German companies, including Siemens Energy.
The German Bundesrat, a legislative body that represents Germany's 16 states at the federal level, approved an ordinance regulating in detail how the costs of a hydrogen network are determined. “By creating the necessary legal and planning certainty, non-discriminatory network access for all potential network users will enable effective competition in the hydrogen market. This means legal certainty for potential investors in the infrastructure. This is important because without transport pipelines an important prerequisite for the planned market ramp-up of hydrogen technologies would be missing,” the German government wrote on Friday.
The Port Authority of Valencia (PAV), together with the Valenciaport Foundation, and the Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) have signed an alliance to promote the use of hydrogen in collaboration and with the support of the European Union. “In this agreement, both entities will focus their efforts on hydrogen generation initiatives, storage stations, use of this energy in terminals and machinery, supply and transport in their hinterland, among others,” PAV wrote on Thursday, adding that the “Port of València will be the first port in Europe to incorporate hydrogen technologies to reduce the environmental impact of its operations.”
Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor announced that Pre-FEED (Front End Engineering and Design) study contracts have been awarded to develop a 600 megawatt H2H Saltend low carbon hydrogen production plant, “one of the world’s first at-scale facilities to produce hydrogen from natural gas in combination with carbon capture and storage.” The company said that the study would also be used to support the delivery of a further 1,200 megawatt of low-carbon hydrogen production. “This hydrogen will be principally used to fuel the Keadby Hydrogen power station, which could be the world’s first large scale facility to use 100% hydrogen to generate power. These projects bring combined hydrogen production capacity of 1.8 GW, accounting for a third of the UK government’s 5 GW low carbon hydrogen production goal,” the company wrote on Thursday. The Keadby Hydrogen power station is being developed in partnership with SSE Thermal. Equinor’s H2H Saltend hydrogen plant and the Keadby Hydrogen power station are Equinor’s first two UK hydrogen projects. The focus is on the Humber region, the largest CO2 emitting industrial cluster in the UK.
Italy’s oil and gas major Eni and Paris-based industrial gas business Air Liquide have entered into a partnership to invest in the development of infrastructure necessary to allow the expansion of hydrogen mobility in Italy. “Firstly, the collaboration will include a feasibility and sustainability study for the development of the low-carbon and renewable hydrogen supply chain supporting the fuel cells vehicles market for heavy and light mobility. The partners will also identify the strategic locations for the positioning of hydrogen refueling stations in Italy,” Eni wrote on Thursday.
A research team led by Seattle City Light, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Sandia National Laboratories are conducting two studies exploring the potential of shifting from fossil fuel to clean hydrogen as fuel to power medium-and heavy-duty vehicles. These efforts are supported by two awards from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) totaling $2.12 million (€ 1.84 million) to help meet emission reduction goals set by Seattle City Light and the Port of Seattle. For now, the focus is on forklifts, drayage trucks and even cranes, but the institutions are also researching the option to use hydrogen to power cruise or cargo ships while they’re being loaded and unloaded. This option, however, is conditional on an adequate hydrogen supply, the institutions wrote in a press release on Friday. In the second study, the institutions are also researching the use of hydrogen “for propulsion for tugboats, commercial fishing vessels and passenger ferries,” while accommodating “a significant portion” of drayage trucks and cargo handling equipment serving the port. “Optimizing the system could avoid costly electricity transmission upgrades, while deploying new clean energy vehicles and equipment, and potentially even providing back-up power to essential city services in the event of temporary power loss,” commented Philip Jensen, PNNL engineer and project manager.
Australia’s Emerald Coaches, a Queensland private passenger transport operator, told pv magazine it is replacing 120 diesel-powered buses with hydrogen fuel cell electric buses in 2022. “Under the e-Mission zero project, the entree fleet will be replaced by hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles producing zero emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the federal government’s net zero emissions targets,” the company wrote in a press release. It also explained to pv magazine that the investment will total $100 million (€64.10 million), adding it will be “Australia’s first private passenger transport company to introduce hydrogen powered buses.” According to Emerald Coaches, the hydrogen fuel cell electric buses will refuel in 3 minutes and will have a range of 800 km.
Melbourne-based renewables company Patriot Hydrogen has signed a joint venture with Singaporean renewable fuel technology company CAC-H₂. “Under the deal CAC-H₂ will become the lead technology provider, supporting Patriot Hydrogen’s projects to develop, build and commission Waste to Energy Plants – Patriot to Hydrogen (P2H) units. CAC-H₂ will be the exclusive technical and mechanical advisor and supplier for the modular, portable P2H units, which are designed to produce syngas, hydrogen, green energy, and biochar throughout Australia,” the company wrote on Wednesday. The joint venture is another example of collaboration between companies in Australia and Southeast Asia.

The company said it was working on the permitting and grid-connection processes and expects to complete the preparatory work by the end of 2023
The plant will rely on the solar hydro power plant technology developed by Australian technology company RayGen, which features concentrated PV technology that generates heat as a by-product, which is captured and used for thermal storage. Electro-thermal storage comprises water-based pit thermal energy storage, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbines and industrial chillers.

“A field of sun-tracking mirrors, known as heliostats, focus the sunlight onto a receiver containing an array of PV Ultra modules,” a spokesperson from Photon Energy told pv magazine. “The mirrors have two-axis tracking drives which are self-powered by a small solar panel and battery.” The mirrors are completely wireless and there is no field wiring. Photon Energy uses sophisticated control algorithms with optical imaging to ensure the heliostats remain on target.
The modules are made with gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cells manufactured by Germany's Azur Space Solar Power GmbH, a manufacturer of multi‐junction solar cells for space and terrestrial concentrated photovoltaic applications. “Measuring just 10 cm x 10 cm, this module generates approximately 2.5 kW of electricity and 5 kW of heat – equivalent energy to a rooftop of solar panels and a rooftop of solar hot water panels,” the spokesperson went on to say. “The module is almost 2,000x more electrically powerful than a normal solar panel, as it is approximately two times the electrical efficiency of a standard solar panel and under almost 1,000x sun concentration.”
The front surface of the module is covered by small multi-junction GaAs cells and the rear has a heat sink that captures the heat using treated water as coolant. The module is manufactured by RayGen in Melbourne, Australia.
“Our current receiver is over 400 modules, and can generate over 1 MW of electricity and 2 MW of heat,” Photon Energy said. “Note the electricity is generated directly, and the heat is captured as a by-product of cooling the panels.” The towers are 45 m high and of a similar scale to a cell phone tower. According to the company, these are easy to install and replicate.

As for the storage unit, Photon Energy said the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) turbine will be provided by Swedish conglomerate Atlas Copco. “This turbine uses a working fluid that boils at moderate temperatures – in our case, the working fluid boils at less than 90 degrees Celsius,” the company spokesperson said. “The industrial chiller is a standard industrial chiller.”
The facility includes two insulated water-based thermal storage pits or reservoirs. One of the reservoirs is kept at a temperature of 90 degrees Celsius and the other at close to 0 degrees Celsius, and the temperature difference is used to generate dispatchable electricity using the ORC turbines.
The project's LCOE is estimated at less than US$0.072/kWh. “The specific LCOE of the technology depends on the application, location and other factors,” the spokesperson emphasized. “We’re demonstrating economic project returns – better than pumped hydro – in a market where solar-only and solar-plus-battery projects are increasingly challenged.”
The proposed approach is similar to that of pit thermal energy storage, which is typically used for the district energy market in Northern Europe. With this technology, hot water is stored in insulated pits during the summer and, in winter, the heated water is circulated through the district to heat up residential and commercial buildings.
RayGen has been operating the technology for more than six years in a 1 MW pilot project at Newbridge, Victoria and is currently building 4 MW of solar PV generation and 3 MW/50 MWh (equivalent to 17 hours) of dispatchable storage capacity at Carwarp in the state’s northwest.

The Carwarp facility is due for completion in mid-2022 and RayGen expects it will be able to satisfy the Low Emissions Technology Statement stretch goal of providing firmed renewables for under $100/MWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/05/insolight-unveils-20-1-efficient-translucent-photovoltaic-panel-for-agrivoltaics/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",Insolight unveils 20.1%-efficient translucent photovoltaic panel for agrivoltaics,"Swiss startup Insolight – founded by three researchers from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne – recently developed a new photovoltaic module for agrivoltaics applications. This move represents a significant change in the company's strategy, as it previously specialized in concentrating PV module technology.
“We move to crystalline silicon due to its lower costs,” R&D engineer Laetitia Anglade told pv magazine. “The basic structure of the module is the same as that of our previous product and we just switched from expensive III-V multi-junction solar cells to conventional monocrystalline PERC products.”
The “Theia” panel has a nominal power of 106 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.1%. For comparison, the CPV module previously developed by Insolight had a 30% efficiency and power output of 160 W.
The new product measures 1,141 mm x 595 mm x 50 mm and weighs in at 15 kg. The open-circuit voltage is 44.8 V and the short-circuit current is 3.0 A. Its frame is made of anodized aluminum alloy and its junction box has an IP 67 rating.
Image: pv magazine
The panel can be used with operating temperatures between -40 C and 85 C. The power temperature coefficient is -0.32% per degree Celsius. The solar cells are covered with protective glass and optical lenses to concentrate and direct sunlight onto them at around two times the intensity of standard solar glass.
The module was recently deployed at a large–scale pilot facility in Valais, Switzerland. The project was developed by Insolight's partners – Swiss research institute Agroscope and energy company Romande Energie. The agrivoltaics project occupies a surface of 165 m2, with the land used for to grow raspberries and strawberries under pots. With this configuration, the Theia modules, based on Insolight optical micro–tracking technology, purportedly offer dynamic light adjustment while ensuring steady solar power production.

“The pilot plant was developed to replace and improve the protection used over crops against weather conditions, while producing energy at the same time,” the three companies said in a joint statement. “It allows Agroscope to study the impact of light conditions on crop development.”
Agriscope will analyze the agronomic data to gauge the control algorithm of the photovoltaic modules, irrigation and nutrient supply.
“At the same time, Romande Energie will evaluate the solar electricity production of the installation during the four years of the project,” the consortium said.

According to the investment bank, utility-scale solar, both thin-film and crystalline silicon, as well as wind have, in the United States, the lowest LCOE of all sources considered, as in last year's report.
The LCOE of unsubsidized large-scale PV based on crystalline silicon is estimated at $0.030-$0.042/kWh and that of grid-parity thin-film solar plants at $0.028-$0.037/kWh. For comparison, in 2020 Lazard reported that crystalline silicon achieved $0.031-$0.042/kWh and thin-film $0.029-$0.038/kWh.
The LCOE for residential PV is indicated at $0.147-$0.221/kWh and that of commercial and industrial rooftop solar at $0.067-$0.180/kWh.
Wind is still the cheapest electricity source with an LCOE of $0.026-$0.050/kWh, which is slightly lower than $0.026-$0.054/kWh last year. The cost decline for utility-scale solar, however, continues to be higher than that for onshore wind, Lazard emphasized.
Combined cycle gas has the lowest LCOE of $0.045-$0.074/kWh among conventional sources and that of coal and nuclear is $0.065-$0.152/kWh and $0.131-$0.204/kWh, respectively.
“When US government subsidies are included, the cost of onshore wind and utility-scale solar continues to be competitive with the marginal cost of coal, nuclear and combined cycle gas generation,” Lazard said. Including these values, solar reaches an LCOE of $0.027/kWh and wind of $0.025/kWh, while coal and nuclear power achieve $0.042/kWh and $0.024/kWh, respectively.
As for the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) in the US market, Lazard reports that unsubsidized storage projects operating on the spot market and with a capacity of 100 MW/100 MWh are able to deliver a value of $0.160-$0.279/kWh, while facilities with capacities of 100 MW/200 MWh and 100 MW/400 MW can reach $0.146-$0.257/kWh and $0.131-$0.232/kWh, respectively. Solar-plus-storage with a capacity of 50 MW/200 MWh is estimated to reach $0.085-$0.158/kWh.
In the residential segment, solar-plus-storage installations are said to achieve $0.416-$0.621/kWh and for the commercial segment this value is estimated at $0.235-$0.335/kWh.

With two different sizes – the 210mm ‘G12’ introduced by Zhonghuan Semiconductor, and the smaller 182mm ‘M10’ format produced by Longi – now well established in manufacturing, the industry is looking for ways to differentiate between the two.
Results from various field tests published throughout this year have been able to demonstrate an advantage for either format. New findings published this week by Chinese manufacturer Trina Solar reveal that the 210mm format, used in the company’s Vertex module series, achieved an energy yield as much as 1.6% higher than products based on the 182mm product, over a six month period.
The modules were tested at a site in Yinchuan, China, which has a dry, temperate climate,  and a second site in Changzhou, China, where conditions are subtropical with hot, rainy summers and high humidity. At the Yinchuan site, data from April to September 2021 showed a 1.2% energy yield advantage for the Vertex modules, based on monofacial modules installed on fixed-tilt racking at a height of 1 meter. For bifacial modules, the advantage increased slightly to 1.3%. And at the Changzhou site, the Vertex modules reached a yield 1.6% higher than the 182mm products.
Trina Solar’s analysis of the results found that better performance in low-irradiance conditions (200 watts per square meter) was key to the Vertex module’s advantage.
Higher currents in the larger format products are one of the key differences between the two products, and earlier results presented by JA Solar (which is backing the 182mm format) found that this resulted in a higher operating temperature, and therefore lower energy yield, for the 210mm products. This was not the case in Trina’s field testing, however, with no measurable temperature difference between the two at either site.
Closer analysis of the two test system layouts and components would be needed to understand the reasons for the different operating temperatures (the JA Solar test site is also located in Yinchuan, with similar conditions). For the time being, modules based on both wafer formats will be available on the market. Further field testing, as well as standardization and the development of other system components to suit the characteristics of either format and optimize costs, will show whether either has a real advantage overall or in particular applications.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/05/long-duration-thermal-storage-system-based-on-silica-sand/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",Long-duration thermal storage system based on silica sand,"Magaldi Green Energy, a unit of Italy-based dry bottom ash handling system provider Magaldi Power Spa, has developed a thermal storage system for long-duration storage based on a fluidized sand bed.
The Magaldi Green Thermal Energy Storage (MGTES) can be charged with renewable electricity or thermal energy such as waste heat generated by industrial thermal processes. Its discharge phase consists of the production of green thermal energy — steam or hot air — which can be used directly in industrial plants or for the generation of electricity using steam turbines. 
“Our storage technology can be used in the steam section of existing thermoelectric power plants based on the Rankine cycle or combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) plants,” Letizia Magaldi, executive vice president at Magaldi Green Energy, told pv magazine.
The system consists of a blower, a fluidization air blowing system, a fluidization air suction system, an air filter and fan, an air pre-heater, and an integrated thermal energy storage module. Silica sands are the system's storage media.
The fluidization system is the core of the technology and is claimed to have high thermal diffusivity. The manufacturer ensures it is well insulated and that thermal losses are lower than 2% per day. The absence of convection and the insulation of the tank are said to limit the heat exchange with the outside of the casing, thus minimizing energy losses. The system is discharged by reversing the integrated heat exchanger within the fluidized bed and the stored energy is released as superheated steam.
The system's operating temperature can reach up to 1,000 degrees Celsius and its roundtrip efficiency is reportedly over 90% for heat production and between 35 and 45% for electricity generation.
Magaldi Green Energy claims the MGTES has a 30-year lifetime and describes it as a customizable solution with different capacities. “By varying the mass of solid particles contained in each module, it is possible to configure a storage capacity between 5 and 100 MWh,” it further explained.
The system Capex is estimated by the company at around $65,000/MWh. “We expect to reduce costs by at least 50% over the next 10 years from economies of scale and design improvements,” Magaldi stated.
*The article was updated on November 5 to reflect that the system Capex is $65,000/MWh.

Longi Green Energy filed a report with the Shanghai Stock Exchange that said U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had detained a total of 40.31 MW of  modules it exported to the United States between Oct. 28 and Nov. 3. The border action was taken under a Withhold Release Order (WRO) issued by CBP in late June.
Longi said the detained modules accounted for roughly 1.59% of its total 2020 export sales volume to the U.S. market. It said it established a tracing protocol last year and would be able to prove that the detained modules used silicon that meets U.S. requirements. It also said that module shipment to the U.S. are proceeding normally.
“The U.S. Customs WRO has not had a significant adverse impact on the company’s operations for the time being,” the Longi said. “The company will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of the WRO on the company’s U.S. shipments.”
It did not respond to a reporter’s request for an additional statement.
The Longi filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange was careful not to mention allegations of forced labor in the silicon supply chain, which is the focus of the WRO. It mentioned, instead, unrelated tariffs dating back to 2011 and said that the recent detention was in response to what it referred to as “the Temporary Detention Order.”
Beijing has long denied that any forced labor exists in China. It has passed legislation that penalizes companies for cooperating with U.S. and other governments’ efforts to ban imports of goods produced with forced labor. In the United States, laws that are intended to combat forced labor date back to the 1930s.
Longi said that starting in the second half of 2020 it had established and improved management measures to respond to “temporary detention orders (WRO),” including “product traceability and system construction, external agency certification, and supplier management.”
On June 24, the Biden administration ordered a ban on U.S. imports from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. over forced labor allegations. The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies, and what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
The three other companies added to the U.S. economic list included Xinjiang Daqo New Energy, Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals, and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material.
Industry analysts believe that Hoshine provides around 60% of the world’s metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) used in the solar industry. The silicon provides feedstock material used in the polysilicon refining process.
In August, reports first emerged that CBP was detaining solar modules that they suspected contained material subject to the WRO. Reports said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. Canadian Solar was also said to have had four testing samples detained, and Trina Solar was reported as having had six testing samples detained in July.

Redback Technologies CEO Patrick Matweew said the addition of an inverter to the Brisbane-based company’s range of products marks a major change in the company’s strategy.
Redback inverter offerings have until now been confined to hybrid inverters as part of its battery storage systems. This has now been expanded with the introduction of the Redback Smart Inverter series.
“Based on the great success we have had since 2015 with our smart home battery solutions, coupled with the fact that there is no affordable Australian brand in the market, we have decided to expand our portfolio to include grid-tied PV inverters,” said Matweew. “Every household has different energy needs, so we made a conscious shift to ensure we have an Australian solution for every customer.”
The Redback Smart Inverters are single-phase solar inverters in 5, 6, 8 and 10 kVA (kW) output with the company claiming a maximum efficiency of up to 97.5%. All come with a smart meter and wi-fi dongle as standard and allow for home batteries to be added in the future. They are all compliant with the new AS4777.2 (2020) standard.
Redback has also expanded its Smart Battery range, adding two new larger capacity models to its SB-Series.
In addition to the existing SB7200 7.2 kWh offering which was unveiled earlier this year, Redback has introduced the new SB9600 which has a nominal storage capacity of 9.6 kWh and the larger SB14200 with 14.2 kWh storage capacity. Both the SB9600 and SB14200 have a 4.5 k active power output rating, while the SB7200 offers 3.3 KW rated active power with the company claiming a maximum efficiency of 96.60%.
The company said the units, which feature batteries from China-based manufacturer Pylontech, are compatible with most solar systems, can be remotely monitored and all three models can provide backup supply in a power outage, where a backup circuit is connected and battery energy is available.
“The batteries are also modular units, meaning they’re lightweight, easy to install and operate and as with all Redback solutions, the Smart Home Battery Systems are designed in Australia and are built to withstand Australia’s harshest conditions,” said Matweew. “The new SB9600 and SB14000 have been developed and designed to be affordable for Australian households and with our latest addition of a 10-year warranty attached to the battery system, owners will have peace of mind for years to come.”
The new Smart Batteries will be available in Australia later this month, though the smaller 7.2 kWh Smart Battery is available now and is in stock in Australia. The new inverter series is also expected to be available in Australia later this month. The launch of the new products coincides with a rebranding of Redback, which includes a new logo and colour scheme. Gone is the iconic redback spider, replaced by an orb reminiscent of the sun.
Matweew said building a stronger connection between the company’s Australian heritage and its purpose and vision was the main driver behind the decision to rebrand.
“The Australian sun is such an important aspect of our landscape; our new branding takes these iconic colours and incorporates them, along with the open road to Australia’s clean energy future. This ties in with our purpose to power a cleaner tomorrow,” he said. “That is the key message – we want to give Australian households and small businesses an Australian option, one that is designed for our local conditions, that is robust and affordable, and there clearly is a gap in the market right now.”

Solar modules that last 50 years with very little degradation will significantly increase the value of solar power projects. In an example below, we see how the discounted cash flow from a project’s electricity generation increases by 46% when shifting the project from today’s standard 25-year lifetime to a 50-year time scale. This low degradation value results from the near perfect seal that a pure glass-glass encapsulated solar panel offers compared to a standard glass-plastic backsheet product.
We will have solar panels that are guaranteed to last 50 years with little degradation. In fact, these panels are likely being installed right now.
In recent conversations with Meyer Burger’s CEO, Erfurt Gunter, it was mentioned that the company’s glass-glass bifacial solar panel showed virtually no degradation during its durability testing. But a number had to be chosen for the warranty, so the company’s power production warranty states that Meyer Burger will replace the solar panel if its generation falls below 93.2% of its original capacity after 30 years.
The U.S. Department of Energy funded 50-year glass-glass solar panel research in 2018, and recently funded two projects looking at inverter failure and operations and maintenance as plants reach the half century mark.
 
The program, Towards50, is led by Dr. Roger French. French has been publishing papers on this research, and told pv magazine USA that degradation levels below 0.2% per year suggest that the possibility of 50-year solar panels is very real. We will cover these papers in depth in later articles.
Running the numbers
Investors pay for the “net present value” of full earnings, minus all costs, subtracting an estimation of figure interest rates from those earnings. The point to remember is that investors pay for this value at the moment they buy the asset, decades before that cash arrives.
Thus, when calculating the discounted cash flow of a solar power project, this value can be predicted and sold. In our case, a solar power project that generates 1,000,000 kWh per year of electricity that is sold at 4 cents/kWh with a 2% electricity inflation rate, generates a discounted cash flow of $677,357 in the project’s first 25 years.
If the site were to continue running for another 25 years, that would add $316,357 in discounted electricity revenue to the value of the project. This represents a 46.8% increase over the first 25 years of the project. A substantial fraction of this money would be paid to the solar developer when construction is complete.
There will be arguments from investors on what discount rate should be used, and what should be paid for the project’s net present value, as we attempt to forecast several decades into the future of a complex world.
However, an electricity inflation clause which protects investor revenue can be added to any solar power purchase agreement. This clause also protects the energy buyer’s savings by guaranteeing that the inflation is always lower than actual electricity inflation.
There are multiple indications  that investors are already banking on 50-year timeframes for solar power projects. A power grid interconnection’s value goes far beyond the current 25 year lifetime of solar panels. In fact, the value goes on in perpetuity.
This was recently shown when a Portuguese renewable auction drew record low bids. Local commentators suggested that the reason the bid price was below the hard costs of a solar power project was that while the electricity contract was short – 15 years – the land and interconnection rights were indefinitely long. Investors clearly were betting that they could make up for their low bid prices over the long term.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Jenny Chase has likened the value of an interconnection on the power grid to “gold dust” sprinkled atop the value of a solar power plant’s original power purchase agreement.
This author has seen long term solar land lease agreements offered to Midwest farmers with 25-year contracts, including a developer’s option on a second 25-year extension of the original land lease period. Most other electricity generation assets have 40-year lifetimes and longer. And  nuclear power plants in the U.S. are now seeking the opportunity to run for 80 years.
So, what will you be doing in 2071?
