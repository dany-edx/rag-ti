https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/05/chinese-pv-industry-brief-increasing-polysilicon-prices-and-new-supply-deals/,"INVERTERS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ASIA,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"MARCH 5, 2021",Chinese PV Industry Brief: Increasing polysilicon prices and new supply deals,"Last week, polysilicon and wafer prices grew significantly in China, according to Taiwanese market research company PV Infolink.
The average polysilicon price increased by 9% over the previous week, according to the analyst. High-quality polysilicon was priced at RMB 105 ($16.2) per kg this week compared to RMB 96 a week earlier. Polysilicon for multi-crystalline modules was priced at RMB 63 per kg.
As for the wafers, both Longi and Zhonghuan raised the prices of both their 158.76mm and 210mm wafer products by 9.5%. Longi's M6 wafer (166mm, 175um) will be sold at RMB 3.7 pcs in March, which compares to RMB3.4 in February. Longi's M10 (182mm, 175um) was priced at RMB 4.44 pcs, compared to RMB 4.05 last month. Zhonghuan raised the price by 10%, 9%, and 8% for its M12 (210mm, 175um), M6 (166mm, 175um) and G1 (158.75mm, 175um) products, respectively.
Monocrystalline wafer manufacturer Wuxi Shangji Automation announced on Friday that the company had secured a long-term order for 52,700 metric tons of polysilicon from July 2021 to June 2024. The price for the supply agreement will be based on monthly negotiation.
Inverter maker Goodwe announced it would provide Korean energy developer GS Global with 100 MW of inverters for a project planned in the Korean market. The company will supply its products from the HT 100 KW – 225 KW string inverter series. In 2020, Goodwe was among the top five inverter suppliers by shipment in the Korean market.
Solar glass provider China Glass has issued a profit warning despite posting rises in revenue and gross profit for 2020. The RMB 72.7 million ($11.2 million) net profit returned for 2019 was boosted by RMB 221 million of state compensation after the company was forced to relocate its production facilities. With no such public windfall last year  — and the payment difficulties of Covid-hit customers raising the company’s estimated impairment-from-trade-receivables figure more than RMB 100 million ($15.5 million) to RMB123 million — China Glass said on Wednesday it expected to post a loss of RMB 100 million for 2020. The company recently turned down a HK$1.64 billion ($211 million) takeover approach from rival Xinyi Glass.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/05/dutch-startup-develops-offshore-floating-pv-platform/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 5, 2021",Dutch startup develops offshore floating PV platform,"Dutch startup SolarDuck has developed an innovative offshore floating solar solution that is purportedly ideal for offshore conditions.
“We are targeting megacities and large companies in the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, South East Asia, and in general markets with high solar radiation in the global Sun Belt,” CEO Koen Burgers told pv magazine.
The floating structure is designed to handle coastal sea conditions and hurricane-force winds. It is also optimized for offshore sites in estuaries, natural harbors, as well as near-shore sites.
“We have developed a near-shore concept, which can cope with waves that can be more than 3 meters high and hurricane winds,” Burgers said.
The company is now testing the system in the North Sea, where waves can be much higher.
“This kind of project, however, requires a stronger design and more expensive electrical cables and has larger efficiency losses,” Burgers said.
Offshore lessons
The company's basic floating platforms are triangular structures measuring 16 x 16 x 16 meters. They resemble offshore floating wind platforms or floating oil platforms. They can be flexibly connected together to form large plants.
“The idea is based on our offshore heritage,” Burgers said. “Our company is a spinoff from the research department of the Damen Shipyards Group in the Netherlands, a company which uses the best of industry practice to design a reliable solution which is able to cope with the harsh maritime environment.”
Each platform is placed on floating pillars, Burgers noted.
“It is more or less a semi-sub structure that is used in offshore floating wind projects,” he explained. “What we did was connecting these platforms in a smart way and by elevating the platforms you get much less wave resistance” he explained. Despite the similarity with offshore wind platforms, the floating structure designed by the Dutch company is claimed to be much lighter.
The platforms allow the company to place PV modules more than 3 meters above the water surface.
“Our structure elevates all PV and electrical parts above the waves,” said SolarDuck CTO Don Hoogendoorn. “This avoids that waves will impact the panels, which causes micro-cracks.”
The distance from the water surface also ensures that the modules and other components stay dry. And the company claims that the large size of the platforms is favorable from a power output perspective, as the platforms move around less, which ensures more stable power output.

 
This particular configuration enables the use of conventional PV modules without the need for specifically designed products. “As far as possible, we try to use proven commercial products with the highest durability, because in this way you can utilize the latest developments in the solar industry,” Hoogendoorn added.
Chinese manufacturer Astronergy supplied the modules for the first pilot projects. Dutch materials specialist DSM is providing its high-performance polyolefin Endurance backsheets, which have been fitted to the modules.
“We are currently measuring the performance of both glass-glass and glass-backsheet solutions,” Hoogendoorn said.
The first pilot projects will be assembled at Damen Shipyards, with Norsk Hydro Extrusion providing the aluminum extrusions.
“We want to use components that allow us to scale our technology fast,” Hoogendoorn added. “This is why we are working together with these leading parties.”
The triangle
The company claims the triangular shape of the floating structure can handle waves and dynamic loads.
“We designed it with the offshore safety standard in mind,” Hoogendoorn said. “Due to triangle shape and large size of the platform it is relatively stable and this enables safe operation and maintenance services at sea.”
When platforms are too small, they move with the waves, which makes maintenance and cleaning at sea difficult. Furthermore, the triangular shape is purportedly the most beneficial ratio between strength versus mass compared to other shapes – especially due to waves, which cause the highest torsional loads on PV plants.

Hoogendoorn also said that, due to its triangular shape of the platforms, offshore PV plants can be adapted to specific customer requirements.
“We also designed a shape that looks like a diamond,” he stated. “We are flexible in adapting the design and can eventually create a lot of plant shapes.”
The floating structure is not able to follow the sun in a tracking configuration as it will always maintain the same position. “Key in designing a reliable offshore solution is that it needs to be robust and simple,” Hoogendoorn added. “Therefore we designed it with a fixed east-west orientation”
The company claims the technology is also particularly competitive from a capex and opex perspective.
“The structures may be a bit costlier than other offshore technologies, but are designed with a lower [levelized cost of electricity] in mind, since the technology is more reliable and maintenance-friendly,” Hoogendoorn said.
Each triangle can be fully standardized to the same size, in order to bring costs down. Eventually, local robotized production will enable mass production. The company is currently aiming at building standard projects with a capacity of 10 MW, but projects of this size may eventually be grouped and form floating complexes of up to 500 MW.
“With these triangles, we set the standard to build utility-scale offshore floating solar plants,” Hoogendoorn said.
Pilot project
SolarDuck has secured €350.000 from the Dutch province of Gelderland to implement its first pilot project, in partnership with Dutch hydrogen producer Voyex.
“The first full-scale demonstrator will be launched in April on on-shore water and a second pilot project will be built in the Belgian North Sea early next year,” Burgers explained. “This fits very well with our long-term ambition to use the electricity and use it to increase value.”

The company will deploy its first real offshore PV plant on the Waal, a major waterway connecting the port of Rotterdam to Germany. SolarDuck will supply four linked platforms fitted with 39 solar panels each. The project will have a total installed capacity of 65 kW and will be connected to a 10 kW electrolyzer operated by Voyex.
The project will be built at a cost of €1 million. The two companies plan to disclose more details after the official launch. Both of them have the long-term ambition to produce hydrogen using floating solar islands at sea, in order to supply the shipping sector and other heavy-duty applications.
“Since its establishment in April 2019, SolarDuck has been developing rapidly,” Burgers concluded. “To further accelerate this development, the company is currently in preparation of a funding round.”

The Spanish Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Reyes Maroto, announced on Thursday that the government intends to create a public-private consortium led by car manufacturer SEAT-Volkswagen and Spanish energy company Iberdrola to set up the first EV battery factory in Spain.
“The project will allow the development of a set of actions that guarantee that the necessary infrastructure, facilities and mechanisms exist in Spain to independently and competitively manufacture electric vehicles,” Maroto said.
No time frame nor specific investment figures for the project were provided, but the minister ensured that it would be “the first battery factory in Spain” and located close to the SEAT factory in Martorell, near Barcelona, in the region of Catalonia.
The project will be part of Spain's Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation (PERTE) initiative, which aims to accelerate the transition to electric cars.
The agreement coincides with the negotiations between the government and Volkswagen for the manufacture of electric cars in Spain and comes a few days after Wayne Griffiths, president of SEAT and Cupra, announced that the manufacturer was in talks with the government to draw up a plan of electromobility focused on the manufacture of small electric cars, predictably in the SEAT Martorell factory. This battery factory could be one of the main sources of support for the project.
The regional government of Catalonia is currently supporting a project to build a battery production and recycling plant, Battery Hub, which is looking to secure €6.8 billion of the €140 billion that Spain will receive from the Next Generation EU plan.
The regional government of Valencia also recently announced the creation of an alliance of companies led by the inverter manufacturer Power Electronics in which Ford, Stadler, Zeleros, Iberdrola, IDOM and battery manufacturer Ampere Energy are also participating. Press representatives from Power Electronics told pv magazine that “production is expected to start in 2024” and that it was intended to carry out the project in any case, although “logically, the injection of Next Generation funds would streamline the entire process.” 
Several gigafactory projects are already underway in Europe. Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt is planning to build two manufacturing facilities in Sweden and Poland. The company is also planning a 50-50 joint venture with Volkswagen to establish another 16 GWh battery cell factory, in the German state of Lower Saxony. Furthermore, Italian start-up Italvolt wants to build a €4 billion EV battery manufacturing facility in Italy. The site for the project is currently being identified; the factory’s initial capacity is expected to reach 45 GWh.
Another gigafactory is under construction by U.S. electric car maker Tesla near Berlin, Germany, and another is planned by French battery cell producer Verkor in Rodez, about 150 km northeast of Toulouse.

Cutting the carbs that go into the making of Coca-Cola should prove a much less contentious topic.
Dongen, a small village 100 km south of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, hosts Coca-Cola's Dutch beverage factory, supplying 85% of its liquids to the country. Over the next two years, the factory is slated for carbon neutrality, in line with the Coca-Cola European Partners' pledge to become CO2-neutral by 2040. Dongen would be the sixth site out of the 47 Coca-Cola operates in Europe to achieve that.
To this end, Dutch power utility Eneco has entered into a partnership with the fizzy drinks maker to supply local renewable energy from the de Wildert solar project, which is currently being constructed just 300 meters away from the factory. The 13 MW plant will be ready to supply power by 2022, the company said. The solar park has been constructed to provide several industrial off-takers directly in the plant's proximity, Eneco added. Additionally, power will also come from the municipality-owned 14 MW de Spinder wind power plant.
“Coca-Cola European Partners aims to be climate neutral and to use local energy sources,” Hans Peters, chief customer officer at Eneco, said. “It's a great ambition to which we at Eneco are delighted to be able to contribute. With the delivery of solar and wind power from the immediate vicinity of Dongen, we are taking important steps together towards a carbon neutral production location. Moreover, a portion of this wind power will remain available for local residents. It's a partnership to be proud of.”
Coca-Cola received renewable power from Eneco before but will need a top-up on the back of swapping its gas-powered equipment for electrical appliances. Vehicles such as forklifts and road sweepers on the factory grounds have been changed for electric-powered models. Factory management is replacing gas-powered heating equipment with full electric heat pumps and swapping the old gas shrink furnace for an electric furnace to shave off those last carbs.
“It is vital that we continue to invest in sustainability, particularly in these times,” Jaap Wassink, vice president and country director of Coca-Cola European Partners Nederland, said. “We are committed to emerging from this crisis stronger, and reducing our environmental impact continues to be one of the most important challenges confronting our company.”
Beverage companies have been frequent customers of renewable energy lately. A number of beer breweries in Europe and around the world have decided to develop solar and sometimes even sizeable storage projects on their factory sites or entered into corporate PPA supply deals.

The projects are expected to have a capacity ranging from 300 to 1,000 kW and are intended at powering KTDA's factories located across Kenya. “A typical factory with an installed capacity of 600 kW solar PV can have annual daytime demand of 1,594,172 kWh, which is about 50% of the total demand,” KTDA specified in the expression of interest issued to pre-qualify potential developers. “The intention is to aggregate between five and ten projects which the successful IPP will then develop.”
Interested IPPs will have time until March 30 to express their interest.
Another Kenyan utility, Nyahururu Water and Sanitation Company (Nyahuwasco), kicked-off a tender for the construction of a solar power plant at one of its water treatment facilities in mid-February. A few weeks earlier, Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) issued a tender to add solar and wind power generators to 23 existing diesel mini-grids across the country.
By the end of 2019, Kenya's total installed solar capacity stood at 95 MW, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Only 2 MW of PV was newly deployed last year.

Queensland-based solar installer Horan and Bird has designed a racking system that fits in a company van, negating the need to use trailers and providing a safe, secure and simple solution for transporting solar modules.
The racking system comprises an aluminum frame fitted with opposing channels into which the solar modules slide. A full-length latch is then dropped down from the top of the rack to secure the modules in place. The prototype can be adjusted to fit different size frames, has space for more than 20 modules and has been designed to fit inside a standard van.
Horan and Bird corporate services manager Nicola Howie told pv magazine the racking system had been designed and manufactured in house by the Horan and Bird team.
“We worked with an engineer but the boys in our operations team fully designed it and integrated it,” she said, adding safety had been the key driver behind the design.
“Land transport is our biggest risk in the industry. It’s not installing the solar panels, it is land transport,” she said.
“We’ve been installing solar for more than 10 years and we saw our biggest claims relating to trailers; shoulder claims, neck claims, back claims from lifting trailers with panels in them to connect to a van.
“Also, on the road. We do a lot of highway travel and the trailers are super unsafe. That’s why we went down the path of a fully integrated van.”
Howie said the company has fitted the racking system into only one van but plans to eventually upgrade the entire fleet of 10 vehicles.
“This is our first,” she said. “We wanted to integrate one and make sure it’s viable and it is. We are really happy with it and now we are in the process of transitioning the rest of the fleet.”
The unveiling of Horan and Bird’s racking system is timely after video footage emerged earlier this week showing a driver in Brisbane narrowly avoiding a serious incident after two solar modules flew out of a trailer in front of them.
The driver was filming while travelling along a major highway in Brisbane on Wednesday when the incident occurred.
Dashcam video uploaded to social media by Queensland Police shows two solar panels flying out of a trailer being towed behind a ute and smashing in front of the car. The driver of the ute remained oblivious.
Horan and Bird group manager and company founder John Horan said safety during transportation remains a major issue for the industry.
“Land transport is one of the most significant risks for a solar company and driving around with trailers on the back, especially on the highway is risky,” he said.
“Some people are saying this racking system may not be as efficient as getting a forklift and throwing a pallet into a trailer but to be honest, what is efficiency when it comes to safety?”
Horan and Bird, which has installed more than 26,000 solar systems equating to 150 MW of solar since 2009, said the new racking system also provides the added benefit of less rubbish on job sites.
It also protects the solar modules from damage during transportation, reducing the risk of stress-related microcracks at cell level, which can affect both energy output and the system lifetime of a solar PV system. Microcracks also have the potential to produce hot spots.
“That is one of the reasons that we did it, but it is not the main reason,” Horan said. “But it is an issue in the industry and is something we were conscious off.”
The racking system has already attracted “significant” interest from other installers, he added.
“It’s unbelievable. We didn’t design this to sell it but so many people want one. We cannot believe how many people want to do it themselves now.
“They know how dangerous it is, driving around with trailers and pallets, but we’re not a manufacturing company, we’re a solar company. Someone else can probably build them cheaper than us.”

Reportedly, Teesta Solar Limited and Korotoa Solar Limited, two subsidiaries of Beximco Power Company Ltd, will install the solar PV power projects, totaling 200 MW and 30 MW, respectively, alongside Chinese partners, TBEA Xinjiang Sunoasis Co. Limited and Jiangsu Zhongtian Technology Co. Limited.
Islamic banks and financial institutions from Dubai, Malaysia and Bangladesh are expected to subscribe to the $400 million bond. A portion of the funds will also be used to expand the group’s textile division, Beximco said.
“When we sought funding from Islamic banks in Dubai and Malaysia for solar power plants. They said they can only invest if Islamic shariah complaint bond is launched,” a Beximco official said.  With the Sukuk bond, he said both shariah compliant and traditional banks, and financial institutions may invest.
Company officials added that all the work, except from importing equipment for the solar power projects, has already been completed. The plants are expected to start operation later this year.
In Bangladesh, low-cost financing is available from the government, in addition to donor sponsored funds, for setting up small scale solar power projects. However, for large scale projects, project developers must depend on banks to obtain financing. As such, the roll out of many large scale solar power plants has stalled in Bangladesh, because they have failed to secure the required funds and land.
In response, the government has long been trying to develop its stock market, and particularly its bond market, to lower dependence on the banking system for such large scale projects.
To date, the country has installed 750 MW of renewable electricity plants, and a number more are under construction. The government has also planned aggressive efforts to raise power generation from renewables during the 2021-2025 period, with a target of 30 GW by 2041.

The board of directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) approved a loan of $ 27.2 million for the design, construction and operation of a 200 MW solar photovoltaic plant in Kom Ombo, in southern Egypt.
The $156.4 million project is being developed by Saudi energy giant ACWA Power, which won the related tender in October 2019. The company submitted the lowest final electricity price offer of $0.02752/kWh.
In addition to the AfDB's financing, structured in the form of a senior loan, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Arab Bank and the OPEC Fund for International Development will contribute to the funding.
“We are delighted to support this project which will offer one of the lowest generation tariffs on the continent,” said Kevin Kariuki, AfDB vice president for power, energy, climate and green growth. “The project supports Egypt's energy transition and contributes to achieving its ambition of 20% renewable energy by 2022.”
Construction of the project is expected to create some 800 jobs. The electricity produced by the Kom Ombo solar photovoltaic power plant will be sold to the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA). The plant will be located in vacant arid land 60 kilometers north of the city of Aswan, adjacent to a 26 MW PV plant developed by the New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) and also approximately 17 kilometers north of the 1.8 GW Benban solar complex, where ACWA Power has already developed 120 MW of solar.

German project developer Maxsolar has completed an 11.5 MW photovoltaic, ground-mounted system on a former gravel dump in Austria.
The owner of the facility is the country's largest power provider Wien Energie, which is itself owned by the City of Vienna.
The plant is relying on 25,600 modules installed on an area of 12.5 hectares, including 400 vertically mounted bifacial modules. It is expected to generate around 12 GWh per year, which would be enough to supply almost 5,000 households with power.
Between the modules, 150 Jura sheep will replace the mechanical grass cutters as walking lawnmowers between April and October. This avoids the development of dust and stone chips, which can occur with conventional mowing. In addition, the soil is protected and fertilized in a natural way, which benefits the biodiversity of the photovoltaic power plant.
The sheep, in turn, benefit from photovoltaics, as the modules protect them from sun and rain. “We are advancing climate protection in the city and are showing that ground-mounted systems can also be optimally designed for the environment and nature,” explained Michael Strebl, managing director of Wien Energie. “One of the central questions of the energy transition is how the expansion of ground-mounted photovoltaic systems has the most positive effect on environmental protection, agriculture and nature conservation,” added Maxsolar representative Thomas Hager. 
Wien Energie announced in 2018 a plan to invest around €100 million in solar and €15 million in charging stations for electric vehicles.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/05/solar-surpasses-wind-in-india/,"MARKETS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 5, 2021",Solar surpasses wind in India,"From pv magazine India
The installed solar capacity in India has overtaken wind to emerge as the nation’s top renewable energy producer as of January 2021, according to a report by data analytics company GlobalData.
Solar PV, including ground-mounted and rooftop, reached 38.8 GW in January, compared to 38.7 GW of wind, as per the report, which quoted figures from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
The report expects solar PV to maintain its lead with the government’s focused policy push providing the growth impetus. It estimates solar PV to further grow to an estimated newly-built capacity of 107 GW between 2021-2030 against wind’s likely 64 GW.
Wind energy led India’s renewable transformation for more than a decade. “In a span of six years starting in 2011, solar PV could only reach 40% of the total wind installed capacity in 2016. However, its installation capacity reached on par with wind by the end of 2020 and then overtook by the end of January 2021,” said Ankit Mathur, practice head of power at GlobalData.
The report cites abundant solar PV resources spread across the various states, declining equipment and development costs, and a smaller gestation period as the other reasons for this exponential PV growth.
Cost has played a key role in solar getting preference over wind. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar has dropped 85% compared to wind’s 65% fall, it stated.
The solar PV sector is poised to attract new investments as the government plans to provide domestic solar manufacturing a renewed thrust post-Covid-19, Mathur said. This will further strengthen project development activities and consolidate the domestic manufacturing capabilities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/05/simulating-pvs-silver-future/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 5, 2021",Simulating PV’s silver future,"Despite significant progress in reducing demand for the precious metal, silver continues to account for a significant chunk of the cost in PV cell manufacturing. And as demand for solar continues to rise, the overall availability of silver may become a serious issue in the coming decades if reductions in its use do not continue at pace, with some models predicting silver demand from the PV industry could exceed supply as soon as 2030.
Over the past decade, the PV industry and research community have made much progress in reducing the amount of silver required per cell, introducing various methods to reduce the amount of silver content in metallization paste without losing conductivity, and printing ever thinner lines onto cells.
On the printing side, Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) estimates that over the past two decades, the width of metallization ‘fingers’ printed onto cells has reduced by 7 microns per year on average. But the difficulty of pushing any amount of paste through such tiny screen structures means that further reductions, beyond the currently achievable limit of around 19 microns, represent a major challenge.
A few approaches to silver-free metallization have caught the industry’s eye in recent years, and substituting either aluminum or a mix of copper and nickel are promising approaches. Manufacturers, however, seem likely to cling on to silver paste as the most efficient metallization material, and strategies to continue to reduce the amounts required will be of value to the industry for years to come.
With this in mind, ISE has developed a system to model the effectiveness of any screen architecture in reference to the properties of a given silver paste. The model allows researchers to calculate a value it calls the ‘screen utility index’, to quantify the printability of different screen architectures in relation to available types of paste. The theoretical backing of this value, along with simulations and experiments to validate, are found in the paper A model for screen utility to predict the future of printed solar cell metallization, published in Scientific Reports.
“This data will allow the industry to improve their decision-making process for novel screen configurations without requiring complex mathematical modeling of the process mechanics,” the ISE scientists state. “The goal of the presented approach is to further improve the metallization of Si-solar cells in mass production in terms of increased cell efficiency and reduced production cost. Especially, the reduction of silver consumption per cell by an improved fine-line screen printing process is crucial when facing the predicted silver production crisis.”
One of the study’s key findings is that for manufacturers to keep reducing the thickness of screen printed lines, new materials with higher tensile strength will need to be investigated, as the pressure required to push paste through a gap so small will be too much for the stainless steel or tungsten commonly used today.
Suggestions for new materials here include fiber glass and carbon fiber materials, and note that carbon nanotubes would represent the finest possible wire with the highest possible tensile strength, and while they have not been used in any application comparable to a screen printing mesh, recent developments with the materials could place an industrial process within reach in the next few years. “The ultimate tensile strength of one of these potential wire or fiber materials needs to be higher than the minimum requirement for the desired screen utility index,” the scientists explain. “…New technologies for the mass production of very thin and strong wires or fibers have to be developed in order to prevent an upcoming dead-end of ultra-fine line metallization of Si-solar cells.”

“These scenarios are not predictions, so they cannot be assessed in terms of accuracy. Instead, they show alternative plausible pathways,” researcher Marc Jaxa-Rozen told pv magazine.
The group assessed scenarios from scientific studies published after 2010, including 1,360 outlooks from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and 190 non-IPCC scenarios. They found that the first ones tend to be more conservative about the future growth of photovoltaics.
“However, it is important to keep in mind that the IPCC scenarios are not intended as forecasts of technology growth,” Jaxa-Rozen said.
The scientists found that the analyzed scenarios diverge significantly in forecasting solar uptake.
“Some uncertainty in scenarios until now was attributed to techno-economic parameters. For a given energy model, different cost assumptions can more than double projected PV generation,” they said. “Across multiple models with consistent parametric assumptions, structural choices on power system modeling can similarly shift PV generation by a factor of two.”
Machine learning
The scientists analyzed the forecasts via spectral clustering and topic modeling. Their proposed statistical learning framework considers the types of organizations behind the scenarios, the models that were used, and a series of structural assumptions.
“The results indicate that general properties of the models and publications are associated with a large portion of the variation in projected PV outcomes,” the academics said. “On the basis of these properties alone, the scenarios can be classified into quintiles in terms of PV capacity growth with 73% accuracy.”
The research group used XGBoost, a decision-tree ensemble machine-learning algorithm that uses a gradient-boosting framework. They analyzed a subset of 1,392 scenarios based on three groups of indicators, including the share of PV in total primary energy demand (TPED), the TPED itself, and total energy-related CO2 emissions.
Their analysis showed that European organizations tend to predict a significantly higher compound annual growth rate (CAGR) than their Asian and North American counterparts. They found that academic assessments tend to consider the widest range of uncertainties, while scenarios issued by corporate organizations usually forecast higher CAGR. They also found that scenarios based on analytical methods have higher CAGR than optimization or simulation models, while the non-IPCC scenarios have a higher mean CAGR than IPCC scenarios.
“This difference equates to an installed PV capacity that is on average higher by a factor of 3.7 in non-IPCC scenarios by 2050,” the researchers said. “The difference between IPCC and non-IPCC scenarios is more pronounced at the near-term 2030 horizon and it is equivalent to an average installed capacity higher by a factor of 4.5 in non-IPCC scenarios.”
Regional patterns
The scientists also used the analytical framework to evaluate a subset of 116 scenarios outlining PV cost assumptions. The analysis was based on the costs of utility-scale solar, and not on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). It showed a general trend between projections for higher capital costs and lower projected CAGRs, but with substantial variations caused by other scenario factors. It also showed that IPCC scenarios tend to report higher PV costs and that differences emerge in regional PV deployment patterns.
The Swiss group also noted that international organizations tend to predict stronger PV deployment in Asia, relative to the region's TPED, but comparatively low levels of PV development in Africa. The IPCC scenarios show a wide range of regional outcomes, including more optimistic pathways for PV growth in Africa and some pessimistic pathways in Asia.
“The main design focus for IPCC scenarios is on the type and ambition of climate mitigation policies, and technology has been somewhat less of a focus,” Jaxa-Rozen said. “The detailed modelling of PV technology, grid integration, and PV-specific policies is relatively recent in the IPCC scenarios, and remains an active direction of research.”
The scientists presented their findings and described the analytical framework in “Sources of uncertainty in long-term global scenarios of solar photovoltaic technology,” which was recently published in Nature Climate Change.

Australia continues to demonstrate its appetite for solar, with data provided by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) showing more than 2.66 million rooftop solar power systems had been installed across the nation by the end of 2020, with a collective capacity of more than 10 GW. However, that rate of uptake has given rise to concerns about recycling and minimizing the impacts of end-of-life solar PV systems in Australia.
While solar modules are designed to last, with an average life span of 25 years, eventually they are going to become inefficient and need to be replaced. Increasingly, industry experts are starting to ask what is going to be done with the solar modules when they are due to be decommissioned.
Professor Peter Majewski from the University of South Australia (UniSA) said it is estimated more than 100,000 tons of solar modules will enter Australia’s waste stream by 2035. The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has forecast that by 2025, New South Wales alone will generate between 3,000 and 10,000 tons of waste solar panels and battery storage systems each year. That will increase to between 40,000 and 71,000 tons per annum by 2035.
Majewski, who is leading research at UniSA’s Future Industries Institute (FII) to help establish a lifetime stewardship scheme for Australia’s PV industry, said it is imperative end-of-life strategies are put in place long before solar waste peaks.
“We have time to plan for this and ensure the processes are in place, but we have to start acting now, as the right practices may take some time to implement,” he said. “There are good stewardship programs in place for products such as paint and tires in Australia, and we would like to see a similar system in place for solar, where the disposal process is pre-planned as an integral part of the product lifecycle.”
The federal government has acknowledged the concern, offering a AUD 2 million ($1.5 million) grant as part of the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund to develop and implement an industry-led product stewardship scheme for PV systems. It is expected that the scheme will encourage shared responsibility throughout the supply chain to manage the impacts of PV modules through their life cycle and support the development of an efficient and innovative domestic PV recycling industry.
While retired solar panels are relatively safe and stable, they are classified as e-waste, meaning they cannot be put into landfill in Victoria. With similar bans likely to follow in other states, the need for alternative solutions is clear. One major challenge facing the solar industry is the low recycle value of PV panels, coupled with the high energy requirements of the currently available collection and recycling processes.
“There is only a little over AUD 5 in recyclable materials in each panel at current market value,” Majewski said. “The high volume of panels will eventually offset this low value to an extent but at the moment, we can’t expect market forces alone to drive recycling, and investment is needed to establish a waste management scheme and to improve the technology available for that process.”
The UniSA team is currently working on developing both policy and technological solutions to PV’s end-of-life problem, and Majewski believes the integration of both dimensions will be key to a successful stewardship scheme.
“Regulation around collection and recycling targets will be important to drive the process initially, but developing the best disposal techniques is essential, and this may even influence manufacturing techniques and what goes into the panels to start with,” he said.
End-of-life management for PV isn’t the only challenge facing the renewables industry, and a similar disposal problem exists in relation to the blades of wind turbines, which are large and notoriously difficult to recycle.
“These blades are the size of an airliner wing, and they have been built to withstand hurricane-force winds so they are a big challenge when they get to the end of their life,” Majewski said. “As with solar panels, that disposal challenge requires planning and preparation, but approached the right way it doesn’t have to be an insurmountable problem, and we are beginning to look at strategies for how to deal with these blades as they come offline.”
