According to Chilean articles shared by Corfo, the companies will be supported once they install the committed electrolyzer capacity. The companies are Enel Green Power (US$16.9 million for 240MW of electrolyzer capacity), Air Liquide (US$11.7 million for 80MW), Engie (US$9.5 million for 26MW), GNL Quintero (US$5.7 million for 10MW), CAP (US$3.6 million for 20MW), and Linde (US$2.4 million for 20MW).  The selected proposals are expected to attract investments of US$1 billion and produce more than 45,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. The Chilean government, which accepted 50% of the proposed projects, aims to have the six green hydrogen projects up and running by 2025.
Spain launched its first hydrogen mobility program, with renewable giant Iberdrola producing green hydrogen for commercial use for the first time in the country. “This week the first of eight state-of-the-art hydrogen fuel cell buses built by CaetanoBus arrived at a Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) depot. At the same time, Iberdrola has already begun to produce green hydrogen at its Zona Franca facility, where these city buses will soon be supplied,” Iberdrola wrote last week. After a period of testing without passengers, the vehicles will enter service in 2022. “The start-up of the Zona Franca hydrogen plant, which has been completed in less than a year, will enable the creation of a green hydrogen hub in one of the country's most important industrial areas.”
Romania's gas TSO Transgaz has called for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on Jan. 25 to endorse the company’s plans to make investments in hydrogen, including joining the European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) group. “Being part of the European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative can create new business development opportunities both nationally and internationally,” wrote the company in mid-December. Transgaz also wants to team up with the Investment Fund of the Three Seas Initiative (I3M) to set up a company investing in hydrogen-ready and low-carbon infrastructure projects. The Three Seas Initiative (3SI or TSI) is a forum of 12 states, in the European Union. Transgaz should have 51% of the shares of the new company. This was not the only hydrogen development in the country. Romania Insider, an online magazine, reports that state-controlled electricity producer Hidroelectrica is pondering green hydrogen production on an island in the Danube.
Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries announced that its liquefied hydrogen carrier, Suiso Frontier, has departed from Kobe for Australia. It is set to return in February with what is expected to be the world’s first international liquefied hydrogen delivery. The carrier, which can transport 75 tons of liquefied hydrogen in one trip, was certified earlier this year. In Suiso Frontier, the hydrogen is cooled to –253°C, shrinking to 1/800 of its original gas-state volume. According to Reuters, the AU$500 million (US$362 million, €320 million) pilot project was originally scheduled to ship its first cargo of hydrogen extracted from brown coal in Australia in spring 2021 but had reportedly been delayed because of the pandemic. The project is backed by the Japanese and Australian governments. Australia’s AGL, which is supplying brown coal, is working with several companies, including Fortescue Future Industries to explore the option of repurposing coal-fired power stations in Australia to generate 100% renewable green hydrogen.
A research team studying the potential of nanoparticles to store hydrogen published its findings in the American Chemical Society (ACS) journal ACS Nano, wrote German accelerator center DESY on Monday. “A team led by DESY’s Andreas Stierle has laid the foundations for an alternative method: storing hydrogen in tiny nanoparticles made of the precious metal palladium, just 1.2 nanometres in diameter,” reads the press release. Palladium can absorb hydrogen like a sponge, but the release has so far posed problems. The researchers are trying to overcome the issue, resorting to smaller palladium particles. “To ensure that the tiny particles are sufficiently sturdy, they are stabilised by a core made of the rare precious metal iridium. In addition, they are attached to a graphene support, an extremely thin layer of carbon… This results in a regular, periodic structure.” According to the findings, the hydrogen sticks to the nanoparticles' surfaces. “The nanoparticles can be pictured as resembling chocolates: an iridium nut at the centre, enveloped in a layer of palladium, rather than marzipan, and chocolate-coated on the outside by the hydrogen. All it takes to recover the stored hydrogen is for a small amount of heat to be added; the hydrogen is rapidly released from the surface of the particles, because the gas molecules don’t have to push their way out from inside the cluster.” The team includes researchers from the Universities of Cologne and Hamburg.
Rederi AB Gotland, Sweden’s oldest passenger shipping company, is participating in a new research project led by researchers from Uppsala University to develop and secure sustainable solutions for hydrogen in ferry traffic. “The project aims to present a complete, sustainable and reliable system for fossil-free hydrogen to be implemented by 2030 and will thus study the entire supply chain from electricity production to propeller,” the company wrote last week. The project will also investigate the possibility of using oxygen, a by-product, to oxygenate the seabed. The Swedish Energy Agency has awarded a two-year grant of more than SEK 3 million (€0.29 million) to the project. OX2, Linde Gas, Uniper, and Bassoe Technology are also participating. On Dec. 16, Rederi AB Gotland launched its ship concept for future Gotland traffic. It should be Sweden's first large-scale hydrogen-powered vessel for both passengers and cargo. Using gas turbines in combination with steam turbines, the vessel should continue operations with the same speed as today. “In addition, the multi-fuel function of the gas turbines prepares them to handle other types of fossil-free fuels as technology develops and different fuels become available,” wrote the Swedish company earlier this month.

More than a half of the planned investment will be used to develop on-site power facilities for the factory, including 5.1GW of renewables coupled with energy storage.
In a Dec. 27 filing with the Shenzhen stock exchange, the manufacturer said the plant will be able to produce 200,000 tons of industrial silicon, 150,000 tons of polysilicon, 10GW of solar cells and 3GW of modules a year. The manufacturing facility will be built in two phases.
To hedge against higher power prices, Risen plans to allocate CNY 25.2 billion ($3.9 billion) to install 3.5GW of solar and 1.6GW of wind, as well as an on-site energy storage facility. The filing did not say whether the entire operation of the manufacturing plant will be powered exclusively by clean energy.
Risen operates several manufacturing facilities in China and is currently developing a 3GW cell and module factory in Malaysia. According to its website, its module production capacity has already reached 19.1 GW.
The manufacturer launched its first high-power product in May 2020 and showcased its most powerful n-type solar panel with a power output of up to 703.6W earlier this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/28/a-solar-cell-you-could-make-on-the-moon/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ESTONIA,EUROPE",MARK HUTCHINS,"DECEMBER 28, 2021",A solar cell you could make on the moon,"Satellites and space exploration have long provided a niche for certain solar technologies, most often those which are highly efficient but otherwise too expensive for more run-of-the-mill applications – the James Webb space telescope launched on Dec. 25, 2021, is already generating power from its 2kW deployable solar array.
Further into the future, solar will continue to be a key technology in powering long-term space missions and even the establishment of a human presence on the Moon, Mars or even further afield. Such missions might seem fanciful or even unnecessary today, but finding useful materials for them is the task given to a group of scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA)’s materials and processes team.
This group, working with Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia (TalTech), is investigating a tiny iron pyrite crystal as a new solar cell material. The chief reason for their interest in this material, rather than its efficiency or potential cost effectiveness, is its availability in raw material form both on the Moon and on Mars. “We're looking at these microcrystals in the context of future lunar settlement,” explains ESA advanced manufacturing engineer Advenit Makaya. “Future moon bases will need to ‘live off the land' in order to be sustainable, and the iron and sulfur needed to produce pyrite could be retrieved from the lunar surface.”
Remote sensing, and explorations as far as back as NASA’s Apollo missions have provided a good idea of what is available on the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. Makaya further noted that the project’s scope is exploring the technical possibilities of lunar settlement and in-site resources and that concerns such as the tradeoff between transporting mining equipment into space rather than finished equipment would be addressed further down the line. ESA launched a call for ideas related to the project, and accepted a proposal from TalTech to investigate the iron pyrite solar cell material.
“Our aim is to develop technology for pyrite microcrystal growth and to use them in a monograin layer solar cell, where each tiny crystal would work as an individual solar cell,” explained TalTech scientist Taavi Raadik. “The amount of power generated by one miniscule solar cell is small but in the normal-sized module there would be billions of them – and in principle there is no limitation in terms of their size and shape. Additionally, we have the goal that all necessary source materials should be possible to harvest on the moon in-situ.”

The material has so far only been associated with very low solar cell efficiencies and is of little interest in other applications. The researchers on this project note, however, that a lunar base would have few space constraints for a solar installation, and that the lunar south pole has already been identified as a region where solar power would be almost continuously available.
TalTech and ESA will jointly fund a Ph.D. thesis investigating the iron pyrite solar cell material and in particular its suitability for reliable, long-term use in the harsh environments outside of Earth’s atmosphere.
ESA’s project will continue searching for opportunities to investigate possible resource utilization on missions into space. “This is only one of a range of in-situ resource utilization methods that ESA has been researching for the moon or further afield,” said ESA’s Advenit Makaya.

Now 95 experts from more than 30 international research institutions have designed a database to systematically record findings from peer-reviewed papers on metal-halide perovskite solar cells.
In recent years, research on halide perovskites has boomed resulting in a flood of data scattered over an inaccessibly large and ever-increasing number of papers. In spring this year, when the researchers started writing their paper titled An open-access database and analysis tool for perovskite solar cells based on the FAIR data principles, published in the journal Nature Energy, more than 19,000 publications had already been entered in the Web of Science under the keyword “perovskite solar”.
The Perovskite Database Project is open source and provides an overview of the rapidly growing knowledge as well as the open questions in this exciting research field. The researchers have manually gone through every paper found in the Web of Science with the search phrase “perovskite solar” up to the end of Feb. 2020 (that is, over 15,000 papers) and extracted data for over 42,400 PV devices with up to 100 parameters per device.
These devices represent almost every device someone has thought worth the effort to describe in detail anywhere in peer-reviewed literature, displaying the halide perovskites’ huge potential for solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. The database also sheds light on the remaining problems in this field related to, for example, stability, scalability, and reliability; as well as open questions related to the best material combinations and manufacturing processes, and discussions regarding key standards and metrics.
Apart from organizing all historical data according to the FAIR principles, so they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, the Perovskite Database Project also provides means to upload new experimental data and features interactive graphical data visualization tools that enable simple and interactive exploration, analysis and filtering.
The database, graphics, and analysis tools are made available to the community and will continue to evolve as an open-source initiative. The researchers argue that this approach of extensively capturing the progress of an entire field, including sorting, interactive exploration, and graphical representation of the data, and that it will be applicable to many fields in materials science, engineering, and biosciences.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/28/stepping-up-in-2021-2-solar-workers-rights-and-leading-by-positive-example/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",BECKY BEETZ,"DECEMBER 28, 2021",Stepping UP in 2021: #2 Solar workers’ rights and leading by positive example,"2021 saw increasing calls for supply chain transparency, including EU draft legislation published on corporate due diligence and accountability to improve upon the currently available voluntary measures, which have been described as largely ineffective.
Meanwhile, in the first two months of 2021, leading European and U.S. trade associations and analysts spoke out against forced labor in China’s Xinjiang province, where 40% of the world’s polysilicon is currently manufactured.
In response, The US Solar Energies Industry Association launched a Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol, in April, which offers guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.”
Following this, on June 24, the US Government decided to ban products from four Xinjiang-based solar manufacturers over alleged forced labor allegations. This decision has affected global supply chains as companies seek to find new suppliers.
Xinjiang sanctions and the PV supply chain: Due to forced labor concerns, a ban on imports from Xinjiang to the United States appears likely. This could be another blow for polysilicon producers hit by industrial accidents and the threat of floods in the third quarter of 2020. Chinese polysilicon prices have surged more than 50% in a matter of months. Consequently, wafer prices have skyrocketed, bringing increasing costs to the solar cell and PV module segments. In the face of price hikes, some projects are now postponed until the first half of 2021.
Leveling the playing field: For a truly successful clean energy transition, the solar industry must also address other toxic issues that continue to arise, including workers’ rights.
Why human rights protection is pushing up module prices: The solar industry typically sees itself as being supportive of the environment, humanity, and human rights. Even large Chinese PV manufacturers publish statements to this effect, particularly if they are listed on Western stock exchanges. But what do human rights have to do with the solar industry? What connections exist, asks Martin Schachinger of pvXchange, and how are they important to the future success of the European PV market?
Polysilicon from Xinjiang: a balanced view: As of March, the United States and Europe were considering sanctions on polysilicon from Xinjiang, China, due to concerns over forced labor. The U.S. government has already barred entry for all cotton products and tomatoes from the region. However, as BloombergNEF analyst Jenny Chase writes, there is no evidence that forced labor is used in polysilicon production in Xinjiang – in fact, the economics might point against it.
Unchained: Political moves shift solar supply: PV module supply chains to the U.S. industry are in flux, and not for the first time. Moves to take action alongside stimulus measures aimed at clean energy are changing the way in which U.S. developers and installers source modules, writes David Wagman, senior editor of pv magazine USA.
Solar ethics, forced labor: The U.S. solar industry has condemned all forms of forced labor and we are committed to ensuring that solar products coming into the U.S. do not contain anything made using forced labor.
Toward traceability: Supply chain auditing has long played an important role in the PV industry, ensuring contracted standards are met and quality is maintained in manufacturing. And with a growing movement calling for ethical and sustainable practices across the solar supply chain, the process could soon take on a new dimension.
Getting on the front foot: For the effective rollout of the global energy transition we urgently need, the time has come to ensure that all aspects of solar and energy storage supply chains are transparent, sustainable, and just. But how can this be achieved? And are there tangible business advantages to be reaped? As part of our Q2 UP Initiative focus on workers’ rights, pv magazine has compiled a five-step guide for best practice in supply chain management.
SEIA seeks supply chain transparency: As ethical concerns around the solar supply chain grow, the U.S.-based Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has a new tool for improving transparency, backed by a traceability protocol. In late April, SEIA released the protocol, which it said would improve supply chain transparency and help ensure that solar components headed for U.S. projects are “made ethically throughout the solar value chain.” pv magazine USA’s David Wagman takes a closer look.
Webinar: Supply chain transparency on the rise – Where is the solar industry?
Op-ed: Greening solar supply chains – As solar energy experiences record growth, investors, customers, and regulators are increasingly asking for more disclosure and transparency on how solar supply chains are managed throughout product life cycles.

In its latest release of Electric Monthly Update, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects 78GW of generating capacity additions in 2022 through 2023. A majority of the additions will be large-scale solar and energy storage projects, forecast to add 62% of the total figure at 49GW. These totals do not include capacity added by smaller-scale distributed rooftop solar project
Dependent on configuration and charging sources, both solar and now energy storage may be eligible for the federal Investment Tax Credit, which is scheduled to phase down by 2024. The credit was extended to 26% in 2021 and 2022, will step down to 22% in 2023 before falling to 10% in 2024 onward.

Utility-scale solar is expected to add 49% (38GW) of capacity. Since 2020, the sector has added more capacity (19GW) than wind (11GW), and that trend is expected to continue. In 2022, solar PV is forecast to add 21GW to the grid, and wind is pegged for 16GW.
Battery storage is set for big gains as well, with EIA estimating 10GW capacity to be added over two years. Over 60% of this capacity is expected to be co-located with solar PV projects. Battery growth is expected to grow 300% from 2020 through 2021, with 1.5GW installed last year, and an estimated 4.5GW this year. Falling battery prices, favorable economics when deployed with solar, and value-adders like grid flexibility and resilience services are driving this growth, said EIA.
Three states comprise more than 52% of the 49GW of solar + storage expected to come online in the next two years. California leads the way with 11GW, followed by Texas with 10GW, and New York with 4GW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/28/what-cop26-means-for-solar/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 28, 2021",What COP26 means for solar,"From pv magazine 12/2021
The 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the UNFCCC undoubtedly represents a global shift toward sustainability. Not only did the summit acknowledge the critical role of nature in climate action and the importance of acting on deforestation, but agreements were also reached to address non-CO2 emissions such as methane. Perhaps most importantly – despite significant argument – the need to move away from fossil fuels (starting with coal) was, for the first time, enshrined in a climate agreement.
The 2021 UNEP Production Gap Report warned that governments currently plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 C. The gap between commitments and the action needed remains high, but while the final language may have been toned down from the “phase-out” of coal to “phase-down,” given that it has taken 26 years of arguing to get something so necessary made official, it remains an achievement.
COP26 saw more than 40 countries – including major fossil fuel users Poland and Vietnam – promise to end all investments in new coal power generation and scale up the deployment of clean power technologies. It was also agreed that emissions plans would be revisited next year instead of in five years, which opens the door to further action in short order.
Agreement on the rules around international carbon markets also moved forward. Richard Cockburn, head of energy at law firm Womble Bond Dickinson, said that “COP26 has been important for the signals which it sends to governments and markets around the world. In this light, investors are under no illusion that the future lies in low-carbon and zero-carbon energy technologies and widespread carbon pricing now looms closer. The climate summit may not have provided the concrete and immediate action demanded by so many but it seems to have set a floor for a pathway unlikely to be overturned.”
And consensus on action is accelerating. Thirty-three new countries announced net zero targets at COP26, which may not yet put the world on a path to emissions reduction of 45% by 2030, but has proved that net zero is now mainstream.
The impact these agreements have on trillions of dollars in private finance could accelerate a low-carbon future. There are several net zero alliances across asset managers, insurers, banks and pension funds, but at COP26, the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) announced that signatories with $130 trillion of assets under management have committed to a net zero future – an increase of 25 times in the last couple of years. GFANZ states that these commitments from more than 450 companies across 45 countries can deliver the estimated $100 trillion needed over the next three decades to reach net zero.
“The speed of the global net zero transition cannot be realized without an equally ambitious implementation agenda,” said Julian Havers, E3G’s lead on public banks. “In support of acceleration, Johnson, Biden and Von der Leyen put forward a new paradigm of sustainability finance – spanning both public and private investments – to mobilize the trillions needed to keep 1.5 degrees within reach. Moving out of Glasgow and into 2022, the political stage is set for changes in the ways clean investment projects … [are] financed.”
One of the most obvious actions any investor can undertake is to refocus their investments away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy. There is a huge gap to be filled, with IEA and IRENA roadmaps showing solar and wind contributing 70% of generation by 2050. It’s going to be a challenge – a joint study by the Global Solar Council and the Global Wind Energy Council estimates that by 2030, there will be a 29% shortfall in the projected wind and solar capacity required to keep the world on course for 1.5 C. Their concern is such that they have established the Global Renewable Energy Alliance to drive the policies necessary to fill that gap and support industry in integrating solar throughout the value chain.
“The goal is to promote the value chain from the supply chain to customers and end users and involves many leading global corporates which are taking radical sustainability approaches,” said Global Solar Council CEO Gianni Chianetta.
Benedikt Ortmann, global director of solar projects at BayWa r.e., believes that solar and wind can achieve 45% decarbonization by 2030 if the right elements are put in place.
“We must see targets at national level supported by enabling policy and similar commitments ‘on the ground’, and thereby ensure projects of both wind and solar can be realized at much greater pace,” Ortmann said.
The Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda also recognized the need for urgent action, and while its focus is on new technological approaches, it too demands the deployment of clean energy. Representing 70% of the global economy, the intention is to replicate the cost curve achieved by solar in more immature technologies in power, road transport, steel, hydrogen, and agriculture. One of the first projects announced under its auspices is the UK-India led “Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid” (GGI-OSOWOG) to build off-grid power, mini-grids and connect international grids to enable higher use of renewable energy.
The reality is that today’s technologies allow the rapid reduction of emissions if political will and finance combine. “For governments looking to show they are acting now to raise their climate ambition and accelerate their NDCs, solar PV and wind are go-to technologies that are economically competitive and reliable today,” said Chianetta.
The economic potential is also huge. Bertrand Piccard, chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, said that there are thousands of potential solutions for policymakers. “Raising ambitions does not represent an unmanageable risk, but rather an economic opportunity to be taken with audacity,” he said. “The good news is that the technologies exist and they are just waiting to be implemented.”
There is a role for new solar technologies, too. This means sector coupling, new processes, and techniques, for example the use of solar in e-mobility.
“We need e-mobility PV solutions that can be manufactured at scale using automated manufacturing processes rolling off gigawatts of PV,” said Power Roll CEO Neil Spann. “And we also need solutions that can be manufactured anywhere in the world using materials that are abundant and easily accessible, produced in the same regions where they are consumed: in Thailand for tuk-tuks and in Glasgow for the shipping industry. Anywhere and everywhere.”
