Hertz has reported a 50% to 60% decrease in maintenance costs for its EV fleet, compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. “It’s probably a slightly higher expense on tires, but not much more,” said Stephen Scherr, the CEO of the car rental company, during a recent second-quarter earnings call. Hertz initially ordered 100,000 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles last year, followed by a 65,000-unit deal with Polestar just months later. It said its adoption of EVs has resulted in a major spike in interest. “We’ve recorded over 160,000 transaction days using Tesla cars, booked at premium rates that are typically $30 to $35 in excess of comparable average rates. Customers are enjoying the Tesla EV experience,” said Scherr.
Nissan is preparing to launch a new rental plan for its EVs, in response to shortages of battery raw materials. As reported by the Financial Times, the manufacturer of the Nissan Leaf plans to operate a subscription scheme under which customers in Japan will be allowed to sign up on a monthly basis. However, the Japanese carmaker hopes they will rent its EVs for years before returning them. The initiative will allow Nissan to keep its EVs inside the country, where the batteries can be reused in stationary storage applications or recycled for precious metals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, which are in increasingly short supply.
BYD has achieved its highest monthly vehicle sales to date. The Chinese EV heavyweight's July figures rose 22% from June, when it sold more than 134,000 New Energy Vehicles (NEV), including battery EVs and hybrids. It continues to enter new markets with passenger car models outside of China. Most recently, BYD partnered with Shlomo Motors to launch its NEVs in the Israeli market. Under the terms of the agreement, Shlomo Motors will provide sales and after-sales services to passenger car customers throughout Israel, with the first shipment scheduled to arrive in the third quarter of this year.
Ingka Group, which owns IKEA stores, has revealed plans to expand its EV charger network with more than 1,000 new charging points by the end of 2024. Last year, the group reached its goal of providing EV charging stations in all of its stores throughout the world where parking is provided. It is now looking to expand the network through a partnership with Norway-based operator Recharge. Specifically, Ikea Sweden will add 700 new charging points and Ikea Norway will install more than 300 new charging stations. More than 300 of the charging points will deliver fast charging, allowing for EVs to be fully charged in 15 to 45 minutes. The charging stations will be available to customers and employees, and will be used to charge IKEA home delivery trucks.
Nexeon has raised more than $200 million to fund battery materials production. The UK battery developer plans to use the funds to mass produce tens of thousands of metric tons annually of its silicon-based anode materials, which are used in lithium-ion batteries. Nexeon said that its technology has four times more energy density by weight than conventional graphite anodes, ensuring a dramatic improvement in performance.
Sakuu, a 3D-printed solid-state battery developer, has revealed that it has opened a new engineering hub in California. The multimillion dollar buildout follows the recent opening of its pilot facility, which is now producing batteries for customers. The new facility will allow Sakuu to scale its 3D printing battery platform, so it can eventually open gigafactories around the world, with a total energy output goal of 60 GWh by 2028. The new facility will showcase two of Sakuu’s flagship products. Its Kavian platform can rapidly print ultra-high energy density solid-state batteries at scale, in custom shapes and sizes. And its non-battery manufacturing platforms can produce medical devices, IoT sensors, and other cutting-edge electrical devices. Earlier this year, Sakuu announced the benchmark energy-density achievement of 800 Wh/L in its first-generation non-printed lithium metal battery.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/08/us-senate-passes-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022-an-industry-reacts/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 8, 2022",US Senate passes Inflation Reduction Act of 2022: An industry reacts,"From pv magazine USA
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 passed in the Senate yesterday in 50-50 split with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, called the bill a “defining legislative feat of the 21st century” and “the boldest climate package in US history” on the Senate floor before the final vote.
The bill aims at lower energy costs for Americans, energy security, decarbonization of all sectors of the economy, environmental justice, and resilience in rural communities. Lowered consumer energy costs will be targeted through direct incentives for energy efficient and electric appliances, clean vehicles, rooftop solar, and more. It contains $9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs, focused on low-income households, to electrify appliances and make energy efficient retrofits. It also ends the uncertainty around investment tax credits as it extends the ITC for 10 years at 30%.
Expecting passage of the bill in the Senate, solar industry leaders were quick to share their reactions.
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said the following on the Senate’s passage of this historic legislation:
“Today is a monumental day for America’s clean energy progress and global climate leadership. With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in the Senate, solar and storage companies are one step closer to having the business certainty they need to make the long-term investments that decarbonize the electric grid and create millions of new career opportunities in cities and towns across the country.
“This legislation is the most transformational investment America has ever made in our climate future, and we are thankful to our members, the clean energy community and every one of our solar champions in Congress for their work to get us to this historic moment. The solar industry has set a goal to account for 30% of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030, and this legislation will be a catalyst for reaching that target. Now the work can begin to build out America’s clean energy economy with historic deployment, domestic manufacturing, investments in low-income communities, energy storage, smoother interconnection, and so much more.
“The United States is poised to lead the world’s clean energy transformation while lowering costs for families. We look forward to seeing President Biden sign this bill and kick off this new era of American leadership.”
Dan Shugar, Nextracker CEO and founder, said, “Nextracker strongly supports the Inflation Reduction Act, which will immediately increase hiring at our US factories. Together with our colleagues in the clean energy industry, this action will add over 500,000 jobs.
Accelerating solar’s use in the grid will lower bills for electricity customers while reducing emissions by 40%. Energy independence and decoupling from overseas inflation factors has never been more important. We urge the House to quickly pass this landmark legislation for President Biden’s signature.”
Michael Parr, executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance said, “The Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance applauds the Senate Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These energy provisions are good news for the US economy. They will put the US in a strong competitive stance in solar manufacturing and pave the way for investments across the American solar supply chain, accelerating the growth already under way in US solar manufacturing. This will mean more good manufacturing jobs, strengthened US energy independence and reduced carbon emissions.” He added, “We encourage the House to pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 without delay and get it to President Biden’s desk.”
George Hershman, the CEO of SOLV Energy, a leading utility-scale solar installer, made the following statement:
“I am thrilled that the Senate has taken decisive action to strengthen American energy independence and help families combat rising costs. With the passage of this once-in-a-generation legislation, the Senate has sent a strong message to the world that America is serious about investing in clean energy, spurring innovation, and bringing new opportunities and jobs to communities across this country. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 takes serious action to grow the clean energy economy, puts more money in the pockets of American families and gets us one step closer to tackling the damaging impacts of climate change. I am urging the House of Representatives to take swift action and send this bill to the President’s desk for signature as soon as possible.”
Ted Bloch-Rubin, chair of the WATT Coalition said “We are thrilled the Senate has passed the Investment Reduction Act and that once again Congress has specifically identified Grid-Enhancing Technologies as an important solution set for clean energy integration.  GETs can double capacity for renewable energy on the existing grid – with the support for wind and solar deployment in this bill, we’ll need all the delivery capacity we can get. The WATT Coalition hopes that the House passes the bill, and the President signs it into law very soon.”
“The Investment Reduction Act is a powerful market signal to develop more renewable energy across America, and we cannot allow the grid to be an obstacle to the energy transition,” said  “The WATT Coalition urges governors and public utility commissioners to push utilities to make long-overdue investments in grid optimization and flexibility. Funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act can ensure that local ratepayers see less upfront costs, while upgrades pay for themselves with systemwide benefits. Wind and solar projects are ready to break ground – state leaders can make sure that the grid is ready for them to plug in,” said Rob Gramlich, executive director of the WATT Coalition. 
The bill next goes to the House where it is expected to pass, possibly by the end of this week.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/08/basf-inks-virtual-ppas-for-250-mwh-of-solar-wind/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 8, 2022","BASF inks virtual PPAs for 250 MWh of solar, wind","Germany’s BASF has entered into virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for 250 MW wind and solar power. It aims to offset the carbon-intensive, grid-supplied electricity it uses at more than 20 of its manufacturing sites in several US states.
The chemical giant will purchase 100 MW of power generated by Dawn Solar. An additional 150 MW of renewable energy capacity will be added through transactions with EDF Energy Services.
Previously, BASF had signed several PPAs with EDF to power some of its facilities with solar and wind, including one where it had acquired New Jersey’s largest solar project and the largest PV project ever built on a superfund site in the United States.
With the new agreements in place, the share of renewable energy in BASF’s total North American electricity consumption will rise to more than 25%. The company’s goal is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% compared with 2018 by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
“These agreements help us reach our clean energy goals in areas where the local electric utility does not supply adequate renewable power,” said Tobias Dratt, president of BASF North America. “At the same time, our financial commitment enables the realization of large solar and wind power projects and adds clean energy to the grid.”
Big deals
BASF has been stepping up its game in line with its decarbonization plans. Last year, it announced a deal though which it acquired a 49.5% stake in Vattenfall’s 1.5GW Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm in the Netherlands. In July, together with Germany-based storage specialist Man Energy, BASF unveiled a plan to build a 120 MW, high-temperature heat pump for steam production from renewable energy at its Ludwigshafen site in Germany.
Its latest deals reflect the growing momentum for corporate PPAs as companies strive to reduce their carbon footprints and meet sustainability targets. But as demand continues to grow faster than supply, PPA prices have been rising for more than two years now.
In the United States, average PPA prices for solar and wind energy projects have increased 30% since July 2021, with solar PPAs up 8.1% in the second quarter this year, according to a recent report by LevelTen Energy.
“Supply won’t catch up until the roadblocks that renewable developers are facing are lifted, and that could take months or years,” said Gia Clark, senior director of Developer Services at LevelTen Energy. “Potential solar tariffs and very real inflation are the latest obstacles making it harder and more expensive to build new projects and put PPAs out on the market.”
And while the demand for PPAs has surged in recent years, so did the variety of formats they assume. Historically, the leading business model for the corporate purchase of renewables were physical PPAs, although the virtual PPA market is now said to be the “fastest-growing” transaction structure, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute.
Virtual PPAs are multi-year bilateral renewable energy contracts that do not involve the physical delivery of energy from the vendor to the customer. Therefore, they are a good fit for multi-use customers, as no specific supply points are involved. In addition, virtual PPAs operate as a hedge against varying electricity prices, as they are essentially a contract for differences. The parties agree on a fixed price and if the wholesale energy price is lower than the agreed one, the offtaker pays the project owner the difference.

It said that its analysts expect India to install about 20 GW of solar this year, including 16.5 GW of utility-scale capacity and 3.5 GW of rooftop PV.
Rajasthan accounted for 54% of all PV installations in the January-June period by adding 4.5 GW of capacity. It was followed by Gujarat with 1.5 GW and Tamil Nadu with 860 MW.
India had cumulatively installed 114 GW of renewables  capacity by the end of June, according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Solar energy accounts for 51% of all renewables installations, followed by wind energy at 36%, bio-power at 9%, and small hydro at 4%.
“The country’s capacity addition in the utility-scale domain has been commendable, and it is on track to achieve nearly 97% of its 60 GW target,” said JMK Research. “On the other hand, in rooftop solar, just over one-quarter of the 40 GW target is likely to be achieved. By December 2022, this segment is expected to fall short of its target by 25 GW.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/08/magnesium-superionic-conductor-for-lithium-free-solid-state-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,JAPAN",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Magnesium superionic conductor for lithium-free solid-state batteries,"Magnesium is a promising alternative to lithium for cost-effective, high-capacity solid-state batteries, mainly due to its abundance, but the poor conductivity of magnesium ions (Mg2+) in solids at room temperatures has held back its practical application. Researchers at Tokyo University of Science (TUS) have addressed this decades-long roadblock by developing a novel Mg2+ conductor with a practically applicable superconductivity of 10-3 S cm-1.
Mg2+ has poor solid-state conductivity because divalent positive ions (2+) experience strong interactions with their neighboring negative ions in a solid crystal, impeding their migration through the material. To address this, the researchers have exploited a class of materials called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).
“MOFs have highly porous crystal structures, which provide the space for efficient migration of the included ions. Here, we additionally introduced a “guest molecule,” acetonitrile, into the pores of the MOF, which succeeded in strongly accelerating the conductivity of Mg2+,” said Masaaki Sadakiyo, the TUS junior associate professor who led the study.
The team used a MOF known as MIL-101 as the main framework and then encapsulated Mg2+ ions in its nanopores. In the resultant electrolyte, Mg2+ ions were loosely packed and could easily migrate. To further enhance ion conductivity, the research team exposed the electrolyte to acetonitrile vapors, which were adsorbed by the MOF as guest molecules.
The team then subjected the prepared samples to an alternating current (AC) impedance test to measure ionic conductivity. They found that the Mg2+ electrolyte exhibited a superionic conductivity of 1.9 × 10−3 S cm−1. The researchers believe this to be “the highest ever reported conductivity for a crystalline solid containing Mg2+.”
To understand the mechanism behind this high conductivity, the researchers carried out infrared spectroscopic and adsorption isotherm measurements on the electrolyte. The tests revealed that the acetonitrile molecules adsorbed in the framework allowed for the efficient migration of the Mg2+ ions through the body of the solid electrolyte.
These findings, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, reveal the novel MOF-based Mg2+ conductor as a suitable material for battery applications. But they also provide critical insights into the development of solid-state batteries, which continue to attract interest and big investment from the automotive and energy storage industries.
“For a long time, people have believed that divalent or higher valency ions cannot be efficiently transferred through a solid. In this study, we have demonstrated that if the crystal structure and surrounding environment are well-designed, then a solid-state high-conductivity conductor is well within research,” explained Sadakiyo.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/08/study-finds-100-renewables-would-pay-off-within-six-years/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Study finds 100% renewables would pay off within 6 years,"As renewables come to represent a larger portion of the worldwide energy mix, and as targets are put in place to increase it further still, there are plenty of worries over the cost that radically changing our energy systems will entail. And the intermittent nature of wind and solar also creates concern about insufficient supply and possible blackouts.
The latest energy system models from Stanford University researcher Mark Jacobson, however, show that for 145 countries, the energy transition too 100% wind, water, solar and storage would pay for itself within six years, and ultimately cost less than continuing with the current energy systems.
“Worldwide, WWS reduces end use energy by 56.4%, private annual energy costs by 62.7% (from $17.8 to $6.6 trillion per year), and Social (private plus health plus climate) annual energy costs by 92.0% (from $83.2 to $6.6 trillion per year) at a present-value cost of $61.5 trillion,” Jacobson said in his most recent paper. “Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than business as usual.”
He described the model in “Low-cost solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy insecurity for 145 countries, which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science. It builds on Jacobson’s previous work by adding new countries, more recent energy consumption data from all regions, and calculations to deal with uncertainty in the future price of battery energy storage, the role batteries will play, and the development of newer technologies such as vehicle to grid. But despite these uncertainties, Jacobson is certain that technological barriers don’t present a major roadblock for the transition.
“(About) 95% of the technologies needed to implement the plans proposed are already commercialized,” he states.
The study also finds that, while jobs would be lost in the mining and fossil fuels segments, 28 million more jobs would be created than lost overall. Only Russia, Canada and parts of Africa are expected to see net job losses as a result, as these regions economies depend heavily on fossil fuels.
Though the study provides clear evidence that a full transition to 100% renewable energy is both technically and economically possible, Jacobson warns that plenty of uncertainty remains.
“Many additional uncertainties exist. One of the greatest is whether sufficient political will can be obtained to affect a transition at the rapid pace needed” he said. “However if political will can be obtained, then transitioning the world entirely to clean, renewable energy should substantially reduce energy needs, costs, air pollution mortality, global warming, and energy insecurity while creating jobs, compared with BAU.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/08/new-research-shifts-sodium-batteries-from-risky-liquid-to-safe-solid/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2022",New research shifts sodium batteries from risky liquid to safe solid,"A team of researchers from Deakin University’s Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) have used computer modeling and simulations to progress the design of a new type of solid-state polymer electrolyte, showing its potential use in various types of polymer-based solid-state batteries, particularly sodium and potassium batteries.
Rechargeable batteries paired with sodium metal anodes are considered to be one of the most promising high-energy and low-cost energy-storage systems. However, the use of highly reactive sodium metal and the formation of sodium dendrites during battery operation have caused safety concerns, especially when highly flammable liquid electrolytes are used.
New research, published in the journal Nature Materials, suggests that by using polymer as the ion conductor rather than the flammable liquid solvents currently used in lithium-ion batteries, the energy storage is greener, safer, and less expensive. Lead researcher Fangfang Chen said the team used a computer-to-lab material design strategy, applying modelling and simulations to find the best compositions for polymer electrolytes.
“This work has been devoted to developing new polymer electrolyte chemistries that can be used with high-energy metals that are more abundant and less expensive than lithium, such as sodium and potassium,” she said. “The new materials can contribute to a more sustainable, greener future battery technology, as well as providing society with safer, high-performance energy storage devices.”
Chen’s research partner, Professor Maria Forsyth, said the work expands upon current knowledge of electrolyte systems and provides an alternative to the dominant lithium-ion technology.
“Lithium-based technology is expensive, in-demand and increasingly scarce, so breakthroughs that provide alternative, inexpensive, and safe energy storage options are of major significance,” she said. “We can now offer an alternative path to realising polymer-based solid-state batteries. This is a significant milestone, and this process will act as a design criterion for further development in this field of research.”
In July, researcher Xiaoen Wang said they had developed solvent-free solid polymer electrolytes based on a perfluoropolyether-terminated polyethylene oxide-based block copolymer for all-solid-state sodium metal batteries.
“Most industries that develop sodium batteries generally use carbon-based electrode and liquid electrolyte, which has low capacity and also can fuel a fire if the battery overheats,” Wang said. “We are taking a different approach, using reactive sodium metal as an anode to increase battery capacity and in the process are developing safer electrolytes to ensure the safety of sodium batteries.”
A key component in the electrolyte – a fluorine-containing class of polymer – was developed by Cheng Zhang and Professor Andrew Whittaker from the University of Queensland’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology. Originally used for biological applications, this is the first time the polymer has been used in solid-state sodium batteries.
Wang said one drawback of current sodium batteries is that they do not last as long as lithium batteries and have a lower energy density. However, in pairing them with the new polymer electrolytes, the researchers believe that sodium batteries could offer close to 1,000 cycles, comparable to current lithium-ion batteries.
The research team said small-scale testing of the batteries has been successful, with upscaling and prototyping coming soon. Wang said with further research, opportunities could be on the horizon for use in stationary energy storage such as solar or even in electric vehicles.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/08/do-we-have-enough-engineers-to-conduct-interconnection-studies/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Does America have enough engineers for interconnection studies?,"The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) said in a statement to the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last year that that “few experts are available to hire” who can conduct interconnection studies for utility-scale projects.
The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) similarly reported to FERC in late 2020 that it has “experienced delays in performance of interconnection studies by outside consultants.” FERC cited both comments in a recent notice about a proposed rule to improve generator interconnection procedures.
With hundreds of gigawatts of large-scale solar and storage projects awaiting interconnection studies by grid operators and utilities across the country, the availability of experts to conduct those studies is a key issue. Kalyan Chilukuri – vice president for energy resources integration and interconnection for Electric Power Engineers, LLC – shares his insights on the topic.
pv magazine: How does an electrical engineering (EE) bachelor’s degree with a power engineering focus prepare you for interconnection studies?
Kalyan Chilukuri: Typically, a master’s degree in electrical engineering with a focus on power systems is required to ensure sufficient fundamental knowledge to enter the power systems studies field. The graduate engineer needs a good understanding of control theory and power systems analytical methods, and a good foundation in power systems and the individual components that make up the system. Interconnection studies are only one area that power systems engineers can go into—meaning the already reduced pool of talent (power-focused EEs) diminishes further as there are many non-interconnection related positions available to power system engineers/graduates.
The challenge now is not in recruiting sufficient graduates but in training them. While external training programs can address the gaps in knowledge of tools and/or specific power systems fundamentals, knowledge of the ISO/RTO system and processes/procedures requires time, experience, and close mentoring from senior engineering staff. Attracting and retaining senior engineers ensures no single engineer is overwhelmed with training duties. Given that we have a small set of senior engineers with the requisite expertise in this area, closer partnerships between consultants and ISOs/RTOs may be required to help address this training gap.
pv magazine: How far does an EE bachelor’s degree with a software engineering focus get you?
Chilukuri: Expertise in software engineering is helpful for developing automation scripts but we find it is more useful for graduates to focus on developing the fundamental knowledge of planning and operating power systems, and building skills in Python coding through online training.
pv magazine: What job experience would a person with the relevant education need to develop expertise in interconnection studies?
Chilukuri: Any job that allows the graduate to learn a mixture of power system planning concepts, exposure to classical planning tools and electromagnetic transient (EMT) analysis tools, knowledge of renewable energy technologies and their control systems, and ultimately knowledge of the various ISO/RTO systems, processes, and procedures.
pv magazine: Are there enough opportunities for individuals with the relevant education to develop further expertise in this area?
Chilukuri: We don’t have a finishing school per se (editor’s note: engineering finishing schools are common in India) to develop the deep expertise required, other than on-the-job training. As indicated earlier, this puts some strain on senior engineering staff that need to do their day job as well as provide training and mentoring.
Regional differences in terms of how the systems operate as well as different approaches to interconnection studies and methods makes it difficult to be an expert in many different areas at once. Expertise gained is specific, and it takes time to develop expertise to span a larger footprint.
pv magazine: Is there any way to facilitate interconnection study analyses?
Chilukuri: Perhaps a finishing school (six months long or so) may be able to take graduates with a master’s degree and help them develop sufficient expertise so that any training needed on the job is around nuanced knowledge of the specific system.
pv magazine: Are we graduating enough electrical engineers with a power engineering focus?
Chilukuri: We aren’t graduating enough power-focused EEs to compete within our own industry (transmission, distribution, generation, markets, etc.) and to adequately supply interconnection teams. Not everyone wants to specialize in work related to interconnection studies, and traditional employers such as ISOs/RTOs, utilities and specialist consultancies are now starting to compete with large tech firms that are building internal teams. The compensation differences between traditional employers and these tech firms makes it difficult to retain senior talent, placing more strain on an already strained staffing situation.

Then we decided to increase the project size and reach other territories in central Ghana.
This year, Huawei's special edition looks at technical challenges to a power system mostly run by inverter-interfaced power sources. The leading topic: Smart PV and Storage – Anytime for Anyone, is achieved by a high degree of digitization, a new business division within the Huawei corporation and strong network of partners.

The project will spread across 12 sites and will see the deployment of PV plants ranging in size from 80 MW to 100 MW and each of these plants should be linked to around 50 MWh of storage. We already started construction on two 100 MW facilities. By the end of this year, we're looking to connect to the grid the first 200 MW. And another 200 MW should be deployed each year.
We are adding storage in compliance with grid requirements, as our grid code is very strict. We are using Huawei Smart Energy Storage System with a minimum capacity of 2 MWh. We are using bifacial modules with nominal power ranging from 450 W to 650 W and inverters from Huawei with a power of 200 kW. We consider ourselves lucky to have Huawei’s setup here. Huawei’s string inverter solution, in fact, is an ideal solution for sites with logistics issues. For example, if you have issues with a string inverter, you just isolate that string and the plant keeps operating without any problem. However, I would like to stress that there were no particular issues of this kind for our projects in Ghana, in particular at the two sites where we already began work. The real issue we have in Ghana right now is long delays in importing PV components and with Huawei, we had the chance to import all the equipment for the two projects under construction in just two months. Once you get the equipment, no more real and technical issues prevent a smooth construction of a project.
The funds are currently provided by local lenders. The projects under construction are currently being built at a cost of $700 per kilowatt installed. Its levelized cost of energy should be between $0.06 and $0.07 per kilowatt-hour. The energy produced by the facilities will be sold via power purchase agreements to private clients and the national utility.
We are planning to bring in new innovations during the development of the whole project. For example, in the first of our two plants under construction we used modules with the power of 450 W and for the second we decided to utilize bigger and more powerful modules of 650 W. And as for the inverters, in the first project we used 185 kW devices and in the second we are using 200 kW products supplied by Huawei. We look at trends in the market and we adapt.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/08/synergy-eyes-system-security-as-work-begins-on-australian-big-battery/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Synergy eyes system security as work begins on Australian big battery,"Western Australia’s state-owned energy generator and retailer, Synergy, said the first of more than 600 lithium iron phosphate battery units that will make up the Kwinana Big Battery have been installed at the project site, about 30 kilometers south of Perth.
The project’s engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, Italy-based energy storage specialist New Horizons Ahead (NHOA), is delivering the project in partnership with Perth-based subcontractor GenusPlus Group. It said the installation of the battery units will take approximately eight weeks. Once completed, the 100 MW/200 MWh battery will be connected to the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), the state’s main grid, and will have the capacity to power the equivalent of 160,000 homes for two hours.
Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the battery will support the integration of more renewable energy into the grid, smooth fluctuations in demand and renewable energy supply and substantially contribute to grid security and stability.
“Increasing energy storage over the next decade will be crucial to addressing system security risks, such as high levels of rooftop solar generation, and ensuring reliable power supply to Western Australia’s main electricity grid,” he said. “Synergy is also implementing a battery management system, to optimise its performance and longevity.”
Synergy, which will operate and manage the battery energy storage system, said it is a major component of its future asset mix and a demonstration of the gen-tailer’s commitment to the delivery of safe, reliable and affordable energy.
“Increasing levels of large-scale and rooftop intermittent renewable generation has led the rapid transformation of the energy sector, presenting a range of opportunities related to how electricity is produced, managed and consumed,” the company said. “The battery project will enable Synergy to optimise the use of its existing generation assets and provide network and system services to increase system security, providing a more sustainable, reliable and effective power supply to the wider region.”
Synergy said the Kwinana Big Battery would allow for renewable load shifting, absorbing excess energy from rooftop solar when demand is low and discharging during peak periods, helping to provide long-term system stability. It is also intended to provide learnings towards other large-scale battery storage projects earmarked for the next five years.
The state government has plans to deploy 1,100 MW of new energy storage projects as part of a AUD 3.8 billion ($2.6 billion) new renewable energy infrastructure package announced in June this year. Premier Mark McGowan said large-scale battery storage will help support the uptake of more renewables in the South West Interconnected System as Western Australia transitions toward net-zero emissions.
“This project is just one part of our massive investment in renewable energy infrastructure,” he said.  “The big battery forms part of our commitment to net zero emissions by 2050.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/08/green-car-dealership-powered-by-renewable/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Green car dealership powered by renewable,"TC Chevy in the US state of Oregon, which sells state-of-the art electric vehicles, has decided to power its dealership with green energy using elevated solar trackers.
The company chose dual-axis solar trackers manufactured in Oregon by Stracker Solar. Stracker reports that its pole-mounted trackers generate up to 70% more solar energy annually than same-sized fixed rooftop, carport, or ground-mount systems, translating to what they estimate to be a 55% to 65% lower carbon footprint as well.
“We believe in cutting-edge technology,” said Derek DeBoer, owner of TC Chevy. “Our cars and trucks feature the latest designs and manufacturing practices, and we wanted a solar power system that does the same. The fact that the Strackers are the most efficient and impressive solar solution currently available has sealed the deal.”
One of the advantages of the pole-mounted design is that the trackers and panels can be mounted above a parking lot or building. At TC Chevy, the trackers will tower above the parking lot with each of the five dual-axis solar trackers carrying an array of 28 Longi 445W bifacial solar panels on a 20 foot tall pole. They will also feature high-power LED display lighting that will illuminate the display lot. The complete five-Stracker system is expected to produce 140,000 kWh solar power per year, which will reduce an estimated 99.2 metric tons of carbon annually or the equivalent to the carbon sequestered by 117 acres of US forests every year.
“We are very aware of the local sentiment towards clean energy and sustainability,” said DeBoer. “We thought it was time that an auto dealership goes beyond just selling electric vehicles and takes the lead in implementing clean energy measures.”
Site work is starting on the premises in early August, with trenching and laying conduit for the solar trackers. The installation of the Strackers is planned for late August.
Stracker Solar reports that its trackers are patent-pending low-maintenance, all-steel dual trackers with a 120 mph wind rating, 50-year structural and 30-year production warranties, and UL 3703 listed.
