North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev made the announcement on his Facebook account.
The tendered project is expected to be built at a cost of around €35 million, Zaev said, without providing further details.
He revealed, however, that around 62.5 MW of the three solar plants totaling 110 MW tendered in 2020 are already grid-connected. The three plants are all located at the former Oslomej coal power plant near Kičevo, in the west of the country. One, tendered in April 2019, has a capacity of 10 MW and is already operational. Construction of that plant was assigned to Turkish contractor Girishim Electric.
The other two 50 MW facilities were tendered in February. The plan to convert the now closed 125 MW capacity coal plant to solar was announced by ESM in September.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, North Macedonia had only 26 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2019. Thermal power plants account for 842 MW of North Macedonia’s total power generation capacity of 1.41 GW, with hydroelectricity and wind accounting for 553.6 MW and 36.8 MW, respectively.

ClearVue has begun installing the company’s transparent solar PV integrated glass units (IGU) on-site at the $7.45m grains research precinct at Perth’s Murdoch University.
The greenhouse will utilise ClearVue’s transparent solar glass technology, which is designed to preserve glass transparency while generating electricity. Data supplied by the company indicates the technology delivers a minimum of 30 watts per square metre while maintaining 70% transparency.
The IGUs feature solar PV cells around the edges of each unit. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and spectral-selective coating on the rear external surface, which allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and UV light to the edge of the IGU, where it is harvested by solar cells.
ClearVue CEO Ken Jagger said the company expects the greenhouse will generate greater market awareness of its building-integrated PV (BIPV) technology when it becomes operational.
“We are starting to see strong interest globally for the ClearVue product from greenhouse suppliers, growers and other protected cropping end-users,” he said.
“We expect the fully constructed greenhouse to lead to an even greater market awareness of our technology and product.”
The main construction of the supporting greenhouse structure was completed in December and the installation of glazing is expected to be finished within the coming weeks ahead of commissioning with plant trials due to start in March or April.
The greenhouse is being built adjacent to two recently completed polycarbonate research greenhouses that form part of a larger research precinct.
The project is the first commercial-scale demonstration of ClearVue’s PV IGU technology in a protected-cropping agriculture setting and the company is confident it will perform well.
ClearVue’s data sheet indicates traditional greenhouses experience a temperature range of +/-6° from optimum temperature while its technology delivers a temperature range of +/-2° from the optimum temperature, providing an increased growth rate of up to 20-30%.
“We look forward to updating the market once the greenhouse is commissioned in the next few months, and as the larger research aspects of the project progresses,” Jagger said.
When work began on the greenhouse in December, Jagger said the project marked a “major milestone for the company”.
Jagger said the trial results would not only help facilitate the commercial application of the technology across protected-cropping agriculture markets, but also across high-rise commercial buildings.
While BIPV is yet to enjoy the same widespread deployment as building-applied PV (BAPV), it has been identified by the Australian PV Institute (APVI) as one of five key avenues for increased market penetration of PV.
The APVI said the multi-functionality of BIPV meant it had huge potential.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/15/solarev-city-concept-can-cut-both-costs-and-emissions/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,ASIA,JAPAN",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 15, 2021",‘SolarEV City’ concept can cut both costs and emissions,"A new study from Japan develops a model for cities to maximize their use of rooftop PV electricity, using the batteries in electric vehicles to balance the grid. Applied to nine different Japanese cities (Kyoto, Hiroshima, Korimaya, Okayama, Sapporo, Sendai, Niigata, Kawasaki and the special districts of Tokyo), the model suggests that if properly implemented, such a system could bring about significant reductions to both pollution and energy costs.
In the model, researchers led by Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies assume that 70% of rooftop space in each city is available for PV installations, that all private vehicles in the city are converted to electric vehicles, and that half of the battery capacity of these vehicles is available to help balance the grid. Factors such as population density – and both rooftop space and vehicle ownership per capita, industries operating in each region and the local climate, led to variability in what this model could achieve, however it demonstrates benefits for all regions analyzed.
For the nine Japanese cities included in the study, the model could meet between 53% and 95% of total energy demand, reduce CO2 emissions (from vehicle use and electricity generation) between 54% and 95%, and cut costs by between 26% and 41%. The researchers suggest that given these disparities, the concept may be most applicable to cities in lower latitudes. Full details of the model are published in the paper SolarEV City concept: Building the next urban power and mobility systems, currently an accepted manuscript in the journal Environmental Research Letters.
The group noted that factors not included in the model could also lead to even higher overall cost savings – such as the potential for batteries to provide other ancillary services to the grid, and potentially lower maintenance costs for electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines.
The group states that the scenarios in its model should be realistic based on implementation by 2030, and calls on Japan’s government to implement supportive policies over the coming decade, including financial support for EV purchases along with support for vehicle to home and vehicle to grid schemes, tighter regulations on CO2 emissions, and changes to Japan’s current system of network fees for use of distribution lines.
“We demonstrated that coupling PV with EV in the SolarEV City concept could be a highly cost-effective strategy to decarbonize the urban energy and transport system,”. The idea can be a basis for the next urban systems for developed and developing countries alike, and should be further explored by policymakers, researchers, industries, and communities. That should also help to fulfill SDG 7, which is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. It aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Particularly, at the time of recovery from COVID-19, our society is in the right moment to get a start in this direction.

Repsol Technology Lab, a unit of Spanish oil producer Repsol, is participating in a pioneering project to produce green hydrogen from floating PV in Cantabria, northern Spain. The Cantabria Sea of Innovation Cantabria Cluster (SICC) is leading the Bahía H2 Offshore project.
It has a budget of €4.5 million and will be completed in December 2023. The project will occupy a water surface owned by the Santander Port Authority (APS) and the developers will focus on the design and construction of a prototype plant for offshore hydrogen and green ammonia production, powered by floating solar arrays.
The green fuel will be used for vessels and equipment in the Port of Santander. In this phase, the technological solutions will be tested in the port area, but they will eventually be applied in locations far from the coast.
The SICC is also supporting the OceanH2 industrial research project led by Acciona, whose objective is to design and validate the first offshore green hydrogen generation, storage and distribution project in Spain. The project will combine wind and floating PV technology and will be based on different implementation scenarios for offshore hybrid electricity generation systems, in order to identify those with the greatest development potential.
After the study has been completed, Acciona will conceptually validate the solution on a laboratory scale and integrate it into an Internet of Things platform that, based on intelligent monitoring, will facilitate the operation, maintenance and management of the plant. The project will be developed simultaneously in six autonomous communities of Spain, including Madrid, the Canary Islands, Andalusia, Cantabria, Navarra and Catalonia.
Natural gas distributor Redexis will lead an investigation into the technologies and will supply renewable hydrogen from the sea. It will handle the design of the hydrogen transport systems by pipeline, as well as the loading, transport, and discharge systems of hydrogen via ships. It will also oversee temporary storage at the port, land supplies of hydrogen, and supplies of hydrogen to ships.
In addition, it will conduct a comparative analysis of the technologies, with a focus on conceptual design, scale, technological maturity, integration conditions, and estimated costs. It will also identify the requirements in terms of energy regulations and industrial-marine safety guidelines, in order to establish an offshore green hydrogen production, storage and logistics chain.

Huawei will provide state-of-the-art application of information and communications technology (ICT) and digitization technology, including artificial intelligence, big-data, cloud computing, and network for Chint’s intelligentization and digitization in areas of smart renewable energy, smart city, and smart manufacturing to improve energy service levels.
Polysilicon maker Xinte Energy Co., Ltd, a unit of TBEA Xinjiang Sunoasis Co., Ltd., which is itself part of TBEA New Energy Industry, may soon be listed on a Chinese stock exchange. TBEA said it is now preparing a new financing platform for the initial public offering (IPO). The listing is in line with its strategic and long-term development. At the end of 2020, Xinte had an annual polysilicon production capacity of 72,000 MW, which makes the company among the largest producers in China.
China Shuifa Singyes Energy Holdings Co Ltd on Monday agreed to pay RMB147 million (US$22.7 million) for a 20 MW solar project owned by Jiangxi Xinqing Photovoltaic Power Co Ltd in Dunhuang, northwestern China. In an update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today, the company said it held engineering, procurement and construction orders for 540 MW of solar project capacity in Shandong, Guangdong and Hebei. The orders, due to start and finish this year, are worth RMB2 billion (US$309 million), according to China Shuifa Singyes.
PV glassmaker Xinyi Solar has signed three deals to buy glass and production equipment from de facto parent company Xinyi Glass. The six-month deals will see Xinyi Solar invest up to RMB305 million in 115,000 tons of float glass for back glass production, RMB4.4 million in 30,000m2 of architectural glass for construction and RMB59.8 million in production equipment from Xinyi Glass subsidiary Wuhu Jinsanshi.
Irico New Energy Co Ltd’s planned RMB2.3 billion (US$356 million) H-share issue raised only HK$1.44 billion (RMB1.2 billion). As a result, the RMB500 million cash injections planned for each of the company’s Xianyang photovoltaic glass relocation and technical innovation and Irico Yongneng 2 GW photovoltaic module projects have been scrubbed. Irico’s Yan’an photovoltaic glass and Hefei photovoltaic glass phase II projects will receive RMB500 million each, as previously announced, with the balance going to company capital. Irico also announced it had reached an agreement with the Shangrao City government to construct its ultra-thin and high-transmissivity photovoltaic glass project there. The first phase of the 10-glass-furnace facility will see three production lines installed to feed what the company described as the “booming demand of the photovoltaic glass market.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/15/what-happens-to-floating-pv-when-the-water-surface-freezes/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 15, 2021",What happens to floating PV when the water surface freezes?,"Sungrow Floating, a unit of Chinese inverter maker Sungrow, built a 500 kW floating PV array on a water surface located in Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, in Northeast China, where temperatures in winter can reach -20 degrees Celsius. The plant covers around 90% of the water surface of a lake and the company has explained what happens to the PV system during freezing times.
“The lake freezes for about four months from November to March each year,” Kane Wang, manager of system solution department at Sungrow Floating, told pv magazine. “During the freezing period of lake water, the entire array will be frozen.”
The ice layer may be squeezed and uplifted where it is thicker, and the floating PV system is fixed on the surface of the ice layer, Wang noted. The anchorage construction in extremely cold areas is usually installed before temperatures reach the freezing point. “If the installation is required in the freezing period under special circumstances, the corresponding ice-breaking plan shall be adopted first, and the ice shall be removed before construction,” Wang explained. “At the same time, the influence of floating ice and frost heaving on the floating array should be considered in the design of anchorage system.”
When using concrete piles or gravity anchors as underwater anchoring material, the frost heave resistance of concrete should also be considered. When using a shore anchor, it is necessary to consider the squeezing and floating effects of freezing on the anchor. These are different from those of an anchoring system in non-freezing areas.
Wang also highlighted that extremely cold areas are often accompanied by high snow loads, which necessitate special anchoring materials, relatively slow construction efficiency, and a higher project cost than that of conventional floating PV projects. “Then the technical requirements for the floating system are more important,” he added. “For instance, a larger buoyancy-weight ratio should be considered in the design, and the floating body can be flexibly adjusted base on the difference of snow load in each area.” The quantity of the floating body can be increased or reduced based on the local snow load to realize the adjustable buoyancy per unit area so as to achieve the optimal system cost, he pointed out.
Sungrow Floating says its products comply with the key requirements of extremely cold and freezing areas. “The product materials need to be able to resist extreme low temperature so that brittle cracking or fracture will not occur,” the manager stated. “The structure design also needs to consider the influence of frost heaving.” That means that the entire array structure needs to have enough strength to resist freezing, and needs to be verified by a series of freezing tests and temperature cycle tests.
The selected components must also have the ability to resist heavy snow loads and sufficient safety buoyancy must be considered. “Finally, in terms of the anchoring system, it is necessary to consider the impact load of the floating ice on the array as well as the safety of the anchoring construction during the freezing period and temporary anchoring measures to ensure that the floating system will not have failure and accident damage,” Wang said.
Furthermore, he specified that the low temperature during the freezing periods will increase the power generation of the floating system. The plant was commissioned in 2018 on a water surface of around 5,000 square meters. It relies on Sungrow inverters ranging in power from 60 to 80 kW and solar modules with power output between 275 and 315 W provided by an unnamed manufacturer.

TIU Canada, a Ukraine-based IPP for merchant power stations, wholly owned by Canadian investment fund manager Refraction Asset Management and Refraction 1 Fund, alleges its 10.5 MW solar plant at Nikopol had been illegally disconnected from the grid.
The power plant operator claims that the Nikopol solar plant's substation is on the premises of the metal processing site Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant (NFZ). The latter had informed TIU Canada in December 2019 that it needed to disconnect the solar generator from the substation for “repairs”. The disconnection reportedly followed on March 2020, with TIU Canada claiming that NFZ had no right to disconnect its power station under Ukrainian law. With the generator offline for almost a year, the damages are allegedly somewhere in the tune of €1.5 million. The site has still not been reconnected.
It would not be the first time solar power companies struggle with legal practices in Ukraine. While the market experienced substantial growth in 2018 and 2019, reaching well above 1 GW of annual installations, the government rowed back on the €0.1502/kWh feed-in tariff remuneration scheme earlier this year, fearing rapidly rising costs. On top of that, the Ukrainian grid appeared unequipped to accommodate the sizeable solar PV capacity added each year. What followed was an extensive curtailment of renewable energy generators. The government entity tasked with compensating the loss of power generation, Guaranteed Buyer, now reportedly finds itself in troubled waters, unable to keep up with payments.
Whether TIU Canada's disconnection is directly connected to the Ukrainian energy market's eventful spring is not entirely clear. The timing of the events, however, aligns rather well. Also, the substation's 10-month repair period does raise questions — even during a pandemic.
The case has gone on trial in Kyiv's Commercial Court after a series of preliminary hearings last months. TIU Canada says that the matter's outcome is a test of the Zelensky administration's commitment to protecting foreign investment and ultimately attracting more solar companies to develop new projects in Ukraine. TIU Canada says it operates 54 MW of solar power in the country, has invested around $65 million in the sector, and employs about 30 people. Depending on the legal proceedings, these efforts could be jeopardized, the company claims.

The 80 m x 80 m installation will be built by late summer and will be tested for at least a year. The solar panels will be installed at a height of less than 3 meters above the water surface, the company said, without providing additional technical details. Equinor will then assess the plant's power production to determine how harsh weather conditions and rough waters affect its performance. The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate is currently reviewing the project for approval.
“If we succeed here, we can succeed anywhere,” said Hanne Wigum, the head of the Equinor's solar and wind tech unit.
Alexander Thogersen, vice president of engineering at Moss Maritime, also noted that the concept has been in development for the past three years.
“The concept has been substantially matured, both technically and economically,” he added.
Equinor and Saipem signed an agreement in March to jointly develop a “floating solar panel park technological solution for near-coastal applications.” Equinor announced its intent to enter the solar energy business in February 2017, when it launched a $197 million fund dedicated to renewables. It rebranded as Equinor in March to reflect its transition into clean energy. In November 2019, it agreed to take a 9.7% interest in solar developer Scatec Solar for $82.4 million.
Saipem recently expanded into the renewable energy business. In November, it secured two contracts worth €750 million to build wind farms in the United Kingdom and Taiwan.

“We produced the first series entirely in Ukraine and a second series was produced by Chinese manufacturers,” the company's CFO, Ilia Kotov, told pv magazine. “But we continue negotiations with manufacturers in Ukraine and are ready to cooperate with European manufacturers.”
The product carries a 25-year performance guarantee, measures 560 x 560 mm, and weighs 3.9 kg. It is based on nine monocrystalline cells with five-busbar (5BB) technology and is covered by 4 mm of tempered glass. Its open circuit voltage is 5.63 V and the short-circuit current is 10.12 A. “A square meter of solar tiles costs $250 in retail before serial production and cost optimization reductions,” Kotov explained. “The power of the tiles per square meter is 180 watts, which equals the cost of $1.38/W.”
Kotov also stated that the company's strategic market is Europe, including countries that are now experiencing a boom in renewable energy for private households such as Poland and Finland. “We are also preparing to enter the US market in cooperation with a local panel manufacturer,” he added.
A first pilot project for self-consumption was built in Ukraine for an outpatient clinic in Tishki village. Solar tiles with a total capacity of 6 kW were deployed, which the company claims enable energy cost savings of around 60%. “Now we are monitoring the work of the solar station online,” Kotov said.
The company is based in Mykolaiv, in the homonymous administrative region in southern Ukraine, and is currently planning to develop other PV products, including solutions for commercial buildings based on large PV modules and leak-proof sunshade systems.

They claim it can be used to produce spectrally selective PV modules with potential applications in agrivoltaics, greenhouses, and photo-bioreactors.
They presented their findings in “Spectral engineering of ultra-thin germanium solar cells for combined photovoltaic and photosynthesis,” which was recently published in Optics Express. The device is an enhanced amorphous germanium (a-Ge:H) solar cell that can confine light in an ultra-thin absorber.
“Due to the strong optical confinement and the high absorption coefficient of a-Ge:H the absorber thickness can be reduced to ∼5-10 nm while still achieving an efficiency of 5% for an opaque solar cell,” the academics said. “We chose amorphous germanium instead of amorphous silicon as absorber material because of its higher absorption coefficient for wavelengths above 500 nm.”
The technology only relies on plasma-enhanced vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering, which are well-established, industry-proven thin-film deposition methods, the group said.
“At the moment we prepare a project, in which the spectrally selective solar cells will be scaled up to small module size,” researcher Norbert Osterthun told pv magazine. “These modules will then be tested in greenhouse environments in Almeria and Oldenburg, representing the conditions of two very relevant regions for greenhouse cultivation in Europe.”
The spectrally selective cell uses the so-called “green gap” and the infrared (IR) part of the spectrum, which are not used by plants for photosynthesis.
“Our cell only absorbs green and infra-red spectral part of the sun light, while transmitting blue and red light that is absorbed in the process of photosynthesis by chlorophyll,” Osterthun added.
The research group built the cell with a transparent conductive metal-oxide-metal-oxide (MOMO) multilayer.
“The nature of the MOMO allows for the dual-use as an optical filter and as an electrical contact,” Osterthun said, noting that it is based on a Fabry-Perot-resonator, which is the most basic optical resonator known for its color filtering properties. “The transmission of the spectrally selective solar cell can easily be adjusted to the requirements of the plants by only changing layer thicknesses of the reflector,” Osterthun added. 
The cell purportedly exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 1.6% and 2.3% with a blue transmission between 16% and 4% and a red transmission between 48% and 34%.
“Three different silver thicknesses were studied in the MOMO reflector by adapting the silver layer thickness, the ratio between light for illumination of algae or plants and for photocurrent generation can be changed,” the academics said. “The solar cell shows huge potential for combining photovoltaics with photosynthesis to reach new applications of solar cells on bio-reactors, greenhouses, or agricultural land.”
