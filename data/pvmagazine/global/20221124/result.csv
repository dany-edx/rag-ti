US developer Atlas Renewable Energy has switched on a 300 MW solar power plant in Campeche, Mexico. The $340 million La Pimienta solar project will sell electricity to Mexican state-owned power utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) under a 15-year power purchase agreement.
“La Pimienta is composed of more than a million solar panels, which are spread across 651 hectares,” the company said in a statement, adding the solar park is currently Mexico's second largest operational PV facility. “La Pimienta represents the first large-scale solar renewable energy investment in Campeche, with the participation of high-caliber institutions including the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB), National Bank of Public Works and Services (Banobras), MUFG Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC) and Société Générale.”
The country's largest operational PV plant is the Villanueva project consisting of the Villanueva I (427 MW) and Villanueva III (327 MW) facilities. It is located in the Mexican state of Coahuila and is part of the 1 GW capacity allotment that Enel won in Mexico’s first energy auction, which was held in 2016.

The company's World Container Index (WCI) shows that freight costs fell by 7% this week, for the 39th consecutive week of decline, and by 74% from the same week in 2021.
“The latest Drewry WCI composite index of $2,404 per 40-foot container is now 77% below the peak of $10,377 reached in September 2021,” said the consultancy. “It is 36% lower than the five-year average of $3,768, indicating a return to more normal prices, but remains 82% higher than average 2019 (pre-pandemic) rates of $1,420.”
Asier Ukar, the managing director of PI Berlin S.L., told pv magazine that container shipping costs ranged between $1,500 and $2,000 before the pandemic. “At the peak of the pandemic and post-pandemic, it reached $20,000,” he said.
Freight costs currently represent about 4% of a module's total costs, he noted. In August 2021, panels cost around $0.27/W and their share of free-on-board (FOB) module pricing was around 20%.
“Shipping costs now more or less $3,500, which means more or less around $0.01/W for a container with 620 modules with each a capacity of 400 W,” said Ukar. “Due to the Covid-19 crisis, most of the ports in the European Union and the United States were congested and the containers did not arrive at the port on time, which led to a reduction in the quantity and a consequent increase in prices.”
He added that he does not expect shipping costs to rise in the short term.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/24/cop27-was-a-crucial-step-forward-for-hydrogen-heres-why/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,EGYPT,EUROPE,KAZAKHSTAN,NAMIBIA",,"NOVEMBER 24, 2022",COP27 was a crucial step forward for hydrogen – here’s why,"With the COP27 climate summit over, progress has been made in helping hard-to-abate sectors of the global economy reduce their emissions. This is particularly the case when it comes to green hydrogen, with the EU announcing partnerships with Kazakhstan, Egypt, and Namibia to import renewable hydrogen – an important development which arguably has not received the attention it warrants.
Though hydrogen is no silver bullet to solve all of our problems, when applied correctly it has a critical role to play in transitioning our heaviest-polluting and most power-intensive industries. The iron and steel industry alone is responsible for 11% of global CO2 emissions, according to UK-based sustainable policy group Carbon Brief, and relies on coal furnaces at more than 60% of steelmaking sites. Alternatives such as electric arc furnaces can use recycled metals combined with hydrogen – or natural gas plus carbon capture – to reduce emissions but this has not yet become commonplace.
Image: Hystar
To contextualize this, analyst Wood Mackenzie says net-zero production of steel would require the annual production of 52 million tons of green hydrogen by 2050. With such huge quantities required, the fact the EU is recognizing the important role that developing countries can, and unquestionably will, play in realizing this figure is pivotal for our industry and the global transition more broadly. No wonder that 30% of the EU’s primary steel production could be decarbonized by 2030, based on the use of renewable hydrogen.
The three deals signed at COP27 will pave the way for hydrogen development for two reasons. Firstly, they are a clear indicator that the EU recognizes the potential of renewable hydrogen not just on its net-zero merits but also as an effective economic lever to drive international trade and cooperation with other states – ensuring the green transition does not come at the cost of economic growth.
Secondly, it is a clear acknowledgement that the transition must not be an inequitable one that further disadvantages developing countries to the benefit of those which already have the strongest economies. Rich in raw materials and existing industrial capacity, developing countries have the potential to be global bastions of green hydrogen and are already seizing the initiative. Kazakhstan is now building one of the world’s largest green hydrogen production facilities while Chile is already one of South America's leaders in clean hydrogen and aims to become one of the world's top three exporters by 2040.
These targets may have previously seemed unrealistic; now they are anything but. The rapid growth our industry has seen cannot be understated. Even as the most abundant element in the universe (making up approximately 75% of normal matter) production of hydrogen has long been expensive because the energy carrier has only been found in compound form and, therefore, requires huge amounts of energy to harness it. This has meant industries such as shipping and large scale manufacturing have remained fossil-fuel reliant. However, the developments at COP27 are a clear sign that the winds are changing to reflect the progress our industry has made in recent years.
At Hystar, we have developed the world’s most efficient PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzers, which produce up to 150% more green hydrogen than conventional systems. In the context of the 52 million tons of green hydrogen needed by 2050, such breakthroughs will have a significant impact on hydrogen commercialization. Such drastic savings, and ongoing technological breakthroughs, are paving the way for green hydrogen, in particular, to emerge as a clear and indisputable long-term solution within the energy transition. Major industry names Equinor and Yara have both joined Hystar’s HyPilot project, which will qualify our technology in field conditions.
Simply put, the idea that green hydrogen commercialization is anything but inevitable is one that should be quickly dispelled. Hydrogen’s potential to tackle pollution at scale, and now at cost, should be embraced equally by those who wish to see a cleaner planet and those who wish to see this achieved in an economically pragmatic way.
When it comes to the role of hydrogen in developing countries, its potential to further utilize renewable energy sources will be revolutionary for helping such nations grow their own green industries and promote energy security beyond just the West. By signing the COP partnerships, the EU has sent a clear signal that it recognizes these merits and will work to ensure they are attained.
This is where our efforts to commercialize hydrogen should be focused. Agreements like these will support developing countries and create durable supply chains. Focusing our attention on this will ensure that hydrogen commercialization occurs effectively and sustainably. It is only by optimizing hydrogen in heavy-polluting industries and using it as a key lever for economic growth that decarbonization can be achieved globally.
The widespread commercialization of renewable hydrogen is imminent and COP27 made that abundantly clear to those who still had any doubts. Green hydrogen has a vital role to play in realizing the global transition, decarbonizing the heaviest polluting industries and driving greener economies across the world.

The new provisions include a new auction scheme for solar projects above 150 kW in size and a bonus for PV installations at high-altitude sites across the Alps.
“For the first time, auctions will be held for large photovoltaic installations,” the Federal Council said in a statement. “The aid will be awarded to producers offering a given amount of solar energy at the lowest price. These auctions are intended for photovoltaic installations that are not intended for self-consumption, such as those built on hangars or barns.”
It said that PV systems deployed on infrastructure assets such as dam walls and noise barriers often have higher costs and will probably not be competitive in the auction. The new auction mechanism will replace the country's feed-in tariff scheme, which expires at the end of this year.
“Special auctions can be carried out for this type of installation in order to allow their construction,” said the Federal Council.
By the end of December, Switzerland had reached a cumulative installed solar power capacity of 3.65 GW. This was enough to cover around 6% of its total electricity demand. The Federal Office of Energy recently revealed that the country deployed around 683 MW of PV in 2021. Trade group Swissolar said this positive trend will continue in 2022, with predictions for between 850 MW and 900 MW of annual capacity additions.

“Our new residential solar energy storage battery pack can be flexibly scaled up to 10 kWh,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “It can be combined with BENY PV components, microinverters, and EV chargers to form a complete solar energy, battery storage and EV charging solution.”
The modular device measures 450 mm x 400 mm x 200 mm and has a weight of 32 kg. When stacked in a four-device configuration its size reaches 700 mm x 400 mm x 200 mm and the weight increases to 104 kg.
The battery has a storage capacity of 2.5 kWh and a nominal voltage of 48 V. Its operating voltage ranges from 44.8 V to 57.6 V.
The lithium-ion system uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has an ambient operating temperature range of -20 C to 60 C. It also features an IP54 protection level, convecting cooling, and can purportedly operate for more than 5,000 cycles.
“The modular design of the battery pack is easy to transport, and the wiring is simple and easy to install,” the spokesperson went on to say.
Based in Wenzhou, China, Beny Electric recently launched a micro-inverter series for residential and commercial PV systems.

The agreement marks Masdar’s entrance into the country and builds on a memorandum of understanding signed by the two parties in October 2021 to explore opportunities for public-private investment and development of solar and wind power projects in Turkmenistan.
“We hope that this document will mark the beginning of a new stage in the development of the electric power industry of Turkmenistan through the construction of solar and wind power plants, in which has accumulated a large and rich experience,” said the deputy chairman of the cabinet of ministers of Turkmenistan, Charymurat Purchekov. The location for the new 100 MW park was not provided.
Masdar CEO Mohammed Jameel Al Ramahi said: “We welcome the signing of the JDA and hope the 100 MWac project will be the first of many Masdar projects in Turkmenistan.”
This is not the first large scale renewable energy project under development in the country. In July, Turkmenenergo signed an agreement with Turkish developer Çalik Enerji Sanaýi we Tijaret A.Ş. for the construction of a 10 MW hybrid wind-solar park, with 3 MW of solar. That plant is located near the recently completed artificial lake Altyn Asyr.
“The first solar-wind power plant in Turkmenistan will generate clean energy, providing reliable and uninterrupted power supply to consumers in the settlements that will appear around the Turkmen Lake in the Central Karakum Desert,” the local government said in a statement released at the time. “The document prescribes to begin construction work in July 2022 and to hand over the facility in full readiness for operation in January 2024.”
According to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Turkmenistan had no solar or wind capacity installed as of 2021. Its total renewable energy capacity in 2021 was 2 MW, all from hydroelectric power. The country has significant natural gas resources, but has potential to be a solar powerhouse: receiving in excess of 3,000 hours of sunshine a year in some parts, and boasting an average of 300 sunny days a year.

Insurance provider Sompo will provide defect warranties for used solar panels that general trading company Marubeni will then start selling in 2023.
The partnership will establish a system under which used PV modules will first be inspected by Marubeni for performance and reuse feasibility and details placed on a information management platform. Marubeni will collect information on the panels’ history from the time of disposal. It will verify the traceability and authenticity of this information using blockchain technology, according to a company statement.
If Marubeni judges the used modules’ quality is adequate for reuse, Sompo will then issue them with a warranty for second-use, called a defect warranty by the partners. The companies did not disclose the duration of this warranty.
Marubeni plans to start selling the second-life panels in 2023. “This marks the first time in Japan that a defect warranty for used solar panels has been provided through a platform,” it said in a statement.
Some of the panels that do not pass reusability inspection will be recycled instead, and will be acquired and recycled through a subsidiary, Sompo Risk Management. The recycling process will be executed in collaboration with Marubeni's information management platform. “Reuse and recycle through the scheme are expected to lead to the recycling of raw materials and a reduction in the amount of industrial waste sent to landfills,” the statement says.
The information management platform was established in June 2021 as part of a resource recycling scheme by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment.

It said it used in-depth analysis of various existing datasets on resource potential, grid infrastructure, land use, and topography to create each MSR.
“This dataset fills an important research need by closing the gap between comprehensive datasets on African variable renewable electricity (VRE) potential on the one hand, and the input needed to run cost-optimization models on the other,” IRENA said. “It also allows a detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved in exploiting excellent, but far-from-grid resources as compared to mediocre but more accessible resources, which is a crucial component of power systems planning to be elaborated for many African countries.”
The model uses various parameters to select a geographically referenced subset of sites within each country. These include resource strength, population density, elevation, slope, land use, protected areas, and distance from roads.
The siting process defined the expected levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of each MSR by also including additional costs for substations, transmission lines, and road construction costs for grid connection.
“The MSRs were then ranked from lowest to highest expected LCOE,” IRENA said. “This allowed to screen out a high-ranking sub-selection of the MSRs in each country based on LCOE.”
The dataset offers 10,905 MSRs for solar PV across Africa with an estimated total capacity of 4.9 TW.
“It is seen that the most attractive locations (in LCOE terms) for solar PV plants tend to cluster near existing grid infrastructure, whereas the most attractive locations for wind power plants are spatially much more widely distributed,” the scientists said.
IRENA presented the dataset in “An all-Africa dataset of energy model ‘supply regions' for solar photovoltaic and wind power,” which was recently published in Scientific Data.
“Several improvements to the dataset are under consideration for the future,” concluded IRENA.

The procurement concluded with an allocated capacity of only 45.5 MW, which was assigned to on-shore wind power
The Spanish government expected to allocate 1.8 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of wind power in the 3.3 GW procurement exercise. PV projects were to be given 12-year power purchase agreements (PPAs), and were to have been built within two years.
“The contracted capacity has been distributed between two successful bidders at a weighted average price of €42.78/MWh, with a maximum of €45.12/MWh and a minimum of €39.88/MWh,” Miteco said in a statement. “The auction, held in compliance with the scheduled calendar until 2026, has taken place in a scenario marked by the war in Ukraine, which has had an influence on the bids and the results.”
In the first two auctions, held in January and October 2021, Miteco assigned 2.90 GW of solar and 3.25 GW of wind capacity. The second auction awarded a total of 3.12 GW, or 95% of the 3.3 GW on offer. About 2.258 GW went to wind projects, and 866 MW to solar, at an average price of €30.56 ($31.07)/MWh. The auction marked the first time in history in which solar did not cover all of the offered capacity.
Through the third auction, held in October, the Spanish authorities allocated 177 MW, of which only 31 MW to distributed solar PV, and the remaining to biomass. The auction aimed to contract 140 MW of distributed solar power, for installations of less than 5 MW with at least three local partners. The remaining 380 MW were allocated to other renewable sources, 220 MW of which were reserved for solar thermoelectric, 140 MW for biomass and 20 MW for other technologies.

Australian renewable energy developers Sunshine Hydro and Energy Estate have announced a new joint venture that will focus on the development of “several” large-scale pumped hydro energy storage projects in the Australian state of Victoria, with plans to integrate green hydrogen production and new renewable generation capacity.
The two companies, which announced plans earlier this year to develop a renewable energy “super-hybrid” project in Queensland, also confirmed they would be investigating other long-duration energy storage technologies, including flow batteries, solar thermal, compressed air, and hydrogen storage.
Sunshine Hydro Chair Michael Myer said the new venture was formed in response to the accelerated closure of Victoria’s coal-fired power plants and the support given by the state government for new sources of clean energy generation as part of its ambition to reach 95% renewables by 2035.
“Our aim is to replace the dispatchable capacity which will be lost once the coal-fired power stations in the Latrobe Valley retire and support the development of a green hydrogen industry in Victoria,” he said. “If the last few months have taught us anything it is that we need a lot more long-duration energy storage, not just to keep the lights on but to keep energy prices down. As we rapidly electrify and move away from fossil fuels, we need to all understand that building new large-scale deep energy storage is vital – for consumers and industry.”
The new venture builds on the existing partnership between the companies in Queensland, where they are jointly developing a “super-hybrid” project that will incorporate 1.8 GW of wind generation and 600 MW of pumped hydro with 18 hours of storage. The Djandori gung-i project, being developed in central Queensland, will also include 300 MW of hydrogen electrolysers, 50 MW of liquefaction, and a 50 MW hydrogen fuel cell. The two companies said they have secured the land for the Queensland project and expect to make a final investment decision in 2025, with energy production likely to start from 2028.

“The cars will be parked between the vertical rack systems,” Luxor Solar KK CEO Uwe Liebscher told pv magazine. “The goal of this system is to show the durability during winter, and the additional energy yield due to the reflection of the snow. Niigata, on the other hand, is known for being a high snow load area, with up to 2-3m of snow in winter.”
The south-oriented system features Luxor Solar's own heterojunction solar modules, as well as mounting systems from German vertical PV specialist Next2Sun and inverters from Japan's Omron. The vertical array will supply electricity to a rice processing factory next to the system. The city of Nagaoka supported the project with JPY 2 million ($14,390).
Luxor Solar KK is now building a similar project on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, where there are higher snow loads.
“Together with Next2Sun, Luxor Solar KK is selling a vertical rack system, that is customized for Japan, where we have stronger winds and higher snow loads than in Europe,” said Liebscher.
He claimed that vertical PV is the ideal solution for a land-constrained country like Japan.
“A vertical installation uses only a minimum space of the farmland while maintaining more than 85% of the light reaching the crops, ensuring an optimal balance of solar and farming, which is crucial in Japan,” he said. “This allows us to build agrivoltaic systems on utility crops farmland, like for wheat, potatoes or rice, on a big scale.”
Luxor Solar and Next2Sun contributed to Japan's first vertical PV project this year. They supported the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies and Japanese engineering contractor Ryoeng to deploy an agrivoltaic system with a vertical design in Nihonmatsu, Fukushima prefecture. It adapted the array design to comply with domestic wind speed standards.

The ACCC has started directly contacting Australians with faulty solar batteries in their homes. It is now urging households to check serial numbers, as it has expanded its national recall to include new models.
The affected batteries may include products from LG, SolaX, Opal, Redback, Red Earth, Eguana, and VARTA, said the ACCC. So far, about 2,900 batteries have been replaced or removed from the properties of consumers, while 1,400 batteries have been switched off to minimize the risk overheating while households wait for replacements or refunds.
LG and SolaX are still trying to trace around 3,000 additional recalled batteries. LG will replace recalled batteries manufactured between 29 March 2017 and 13 September 2018, free of charge. Alternatively, consumers can opt for refunds and have the recalled batteries removed from their properties at no cost. Households that will have higher electricity bills due to the loss of their batteries will also be compensated by LG, said the ACCC.
“Unfortunately, since October 2019 there have been nine reported incidents involving these types of batteries in Australia resulting in property damage and one injury,” said ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard.
LG has also told the ACCC it has identified about 10,000 additional batteries that are at risk of overheating. To address this risk, LG will install diagnostic software to identify and shut down dangerous batteries, which will then be replaced for free. Electrical safety regulators are currently assessing LG’s proposed diagnostic software remedy, said the ACCC.
The fire risk of lithium battery makeups has been a divisive issue in the industry, with some labeling it anti-renewable “fear mongering,” but experts like UK Newcastle University Professor Paul Christensen believe the risks require serious consideration. In Australia, awareness of lithium battery risks rose when Neoen’s Victoria Big Battery caught fire during commissioning in 2021.

The results include a 31.3% efficiency for a 1-square-centimeter device fabricated by the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) and the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), and a 22.4% efficiency rating for a 26-square-centimeter perovskite mini-module obtained by EPFL and North China Electric Power University (NCEPU). The results also include a 24.5% efficiency rating for a 20-square-centimeter perovskite/perovskite two-junction, two-terminal mini-module made by Nanjing University and Renshine Solar, and a 47.6% efficiency rating for a four-junction, wafer-bonded concentrator cell based on Group III-V cell technology, with the cell fabricated and measured by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE). 
In Version 60 of the tables, released in June, the researchers added 15 new results. The group has seen major improvements in all cell categories since 1993, when the tables were first published. The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
The next print edition of pv magazine – due out on December 6 – will visit Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and we will include coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
