https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/02/south-africa-gets-8-5-billion-to-phase-out-coal-boost-renewables/,"MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH AFRICA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021","South Africa gets $8.5 billion to phase out coal, boost renewables","South Africa‘s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced today that France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United State will provide $8.5 billion in funds to help the country achieve the new carbon emission targets that were presented in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) brought to the COP26 conference in Glasgow, UK.
“The highly concessional finance that will be mobilised through this partnership will accelerate investment in renewable energy and the development of new sectors such as electric vehicles and green hydrogen,” the president said in a statement released. “This will provide a significant boost to investment and growth while ensuring Eskom can access resources to finance repurposing of coal-fired power stations due for decommissioning over the next 15 years.”
The funds should be allocated through multilateral and bilateral grants, concessional loans, guarantees and private investments. A task force will now seek to identify initial sources of financing for the electricity and coal mining sectors, as well as financing options for the development of electromobility and green hydrogen.
“The details still need to be worked out by a joint task force, but the funds are intended to expedite South Africa's transition away from its coal dependency through growth in clean energy,” Chris Ahlfeldt, an energy specialist at Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services, told pv magazine. “It will likely be allocated through private investments and includes support for workers affected by the transition away from coal. It will also be interesting to see how much of these funds will be used to assist Eskom’s with its spiraling debt which is currently over three times larger than the entire US$8.5 billion pledge.”
The country's troubled power utility Eskom last year took its first steps to “repurpose” its coal power plants, but most of its generation fleet is still represented by coal power assets. The Covid-19 pandemic had helped the utility to temporarily resolve power supply issues, but the current economic recovery and the increasing energy demand is forcing it to resume load-shedding, which occurs when it cuts power supplies because demand on the network is too much for it to handle.
Meanwhile, the fifth round of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP) concluded last week has shown that large scale wind and solar power plants are already able to outperform coal in the country. The procurement exercise's lowest bid of ZAR 0.34425 ($0.02279) was submitted for a 124 MW wind facility planned to be built in Hantam, in the Northern Cape region, while for the solar technology the lowest price was ZAR 0.37479 ($0.02481), which was offered for six 75 MW solar parks expected to be constructed in Tokologo, an administrative area in the Lejweleputswa District of the Free State region.

The decentralized production of hydrogen occurred at a pressure of up to 100 bar using biogas which included all related impurities. “We [have demonstrated] that a chemical looping system can be integrated into an existing biogas plant,” said Viktor Hacker, from the institute of chemical engineering and environmental technology at TU Graz. “High-purity hydrogen for fuel cells is produced from real biogas; not only in the laboratory but actually on an industrial scale.”
The university said the biogas in question consisted of methane from pig manure; the glycerol phase liquid by-product of biodiesel production; maize silage typically used for cattle feed; and grain residues. “The 10 kW plant diverts about 1% of the biogas flow ([of ]about 30 liters per minute) and mixes it with steam,” TU Graz stated. “The mixture flows into the plant's reactor. There, the biogas is reformed and syngas produced. This gas subsequently reduces iron oxide to iron. Then steam enters the reactor, which reoxidizes the iron back to iron oxide. This releases hydrogen with a purity level of 99.998%.”
The researchers told pv magazine: “Instead of the 1%, the researchers would also be able to channel the entire biogas flow of the biogas plant (about 480 cubic metres per hour) through a correspondingly up-scaled chemical looping plant. This would lead to a 3 MW hydrogen production plant.” Rouge H2 said it is now open to orders from the biogas industry. The researchers forecast a price of €5/kg for the hydrogen produced by their process, but added, pressure-related complexities make the application mostly useful to power tractors and forklift trucks.
The Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), subsidiary of Australian iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group, has signed a multibillion-pound hydrogen supply deal with British construction equipment maker JCB and Ryze Hydrogen. “JCB and Ryze will purchase 10% of FFI’s global green hydrogen production,” The Australian company said on Sunday. “FFI’s green hydrogen production is anticipated to grow to 15 million tons of GH2 [green hydrogen] per year by 2030, accelerating to 50 million tons per year in the next decade thereafter.” Fortescue said it expects to become the biggest supplier of green hydrogen to the U.K. JCB and Ryze will manage green hydrogen distribution and development of demand in the U.K.
The British government is also trying to send signals promoting corporate partnerships with international players. Last week, Leeds-based Atome Energy signed an agreement with Paraguay’s Itaipu Binational Technology Park relating to the planned location of a 250 MW green hydrogen and ammonia facility. “Atome intends that production will be ramped up from an initial 50 MW unit, commencing [at the] end [of] 2024, with significant potential local end markets,” read a press release re-published by the British government. The U.K. wants to import green and gas-plus carbon-capture-fired blue hydrogen and to promote the nation's technologies abroad. Ramin Navai, the British ambassador to Paraguay, said: “We are very excited about this news. The future production of green hydrogen and ammonia would be a great bilateral achievement, with the U.K. providing its expertise and Paraguay providing its clean energy from Itaipu.”
Fortescue is also making a huge green hydrogen production investment in Argentina. “Fortescue has already started prospecting works in the province of Rio Negro with a view to the production of green hydrogen on an industrial scale, which will require an investment of $8,400 million [€7.26 billion],” wrote the Casa Rosada office of the Argentinian president, after a meeting on the sidelines of this week's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. That development marked the first major hydrogen announcement made at the global event. According to Argentinian president Alberto Fernández’s office, Rio Negro is expected to reach a production capacity of 2.2 million tons per year by 2030. News about Australian export capacity went hand in hand with local developments as Australian media reported Emerald Coaches, a regional service in central Queensland, has decided to switch its fleet of diesel buses to hydrogen fuel cells, in what local journalists described as an Australian first.
Kazakhstan’s state-owned energy company, KazMunayGas, and German multinational chemical company Linde have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop clean energy projects in the central Asian nation. “The first stage of cooperation will focus on exploring the opportunity of producing hydrogen and ammonia using natural gas as [a] feedstock (blue hydrogen and blue ammonia) and/or water electrolysis (green or blue hydrogen and green or blue ammonia),” read a press release published yesterday, which added the two companies will first proceed with a feasibility study.
The Florida-based Mitsubishi Power Americas storage solutions unit of the Japanese car giant, and Detroit-headquartered natural gas pipeline business, DT Midstream, have signed a strategic joint development agreement (JDA) to promote and develop clean hydrogen projects across the U.S. “The JDA focuses on [the] production, storage, transportation and use of hydrogen and other commodities,” Mitsubishi Power Americas wrote yesterday. “Opportunities include offering hydrogen in liquefied or compressed form for multiple applications such as power generation and transport as well as steelmaking, refining and fertilizer manufacturing.” The partners intend to create inter and intra-state pipelines. Mitsubishi Power has previously announced developments in Utah and North Dakota. “This collaboration will add to the ‘hub and spoke’ hydrogen infrastructure we have been creating with partnerships throughout North America,” said Mitsubishi Power Americas senior VP David Hunt. DT Midstream has approximately 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) of transportation pipelines. The companies did not reveal financial commitments or investment figures.
Canada's Hydrogen Optimized has announced the demonstration of the world’s highest-current water electrolyzer since the 1980s. “The operation of a 50,000 ampere RuggedCell unipolar electrolyzer represents a breakthrough in large-scale green hydrogen production technology and a direct pathway toward the commercialization of single electrolysis modules rated up to 100 MW,” the company wrote today.

A team of Engineers from Australia’s Newcastle University have developed and patented a thermal energy storage block, approximately the size of a large brick, which its inventors say is ideal for large-scale solar storage and repurposing coal-fired power plants.
The blocks, made largely from aluminum and graphite, are said to have a life expectancy in excess of that of PV without any degradation. One of the thermal block’s inventors, Erich Kisi, told pv magazine Australia that the idea for this new class of thermal energy storage materials, called miscibility gap alloys (MGA), came approximately 10 years ago when the team at Newcastle University were working on a thermionic converter (TIC), which generates electricity from the heat of concentrated sunlight when they “had the realisation that without thermal energy storage, the device would not generate at night, much the same as PV.”
The aluminum particles, given structural integrity by powdered graphite, provide the latent heat which melts and solidifies for many thousands of cycles. Though, not only aluminum particles, says Kisi, “We have many systems that operate at different temperatures. Aluminum is part of our core product that gives a concentration of energy release at 660 C. Other systems are available for temperatures of 420 C, 577 C, or even 1,085 C.”
Each block weighs around 6 kg and can store approximately 1 kWh of energy, so it is not a technology geared for domestic use.
“It is most efficient when used at a very large scale. For example, a good size for a pilot plant is between 20-50 MWh of stored energy. One area where it will be deployed is with solar to capture power that can’t otherwise be generated or dispatched due to inverter, grid or demand limitations when generation is at its peak (between 9am and 3pm) … Other areas include turning retired power stations into grid scale energy storage and dispatch facilities and the enabling of renewably generated power to be used 24/7 for industrial process heat.”
Kisi is also the CEO of MGA Thermal, the company with the patent which is now manufacturing these blocks with its Swiss partner E2S Power AG for piloting programs to repurpose European coal-fired power plants.
“Our partners E2S are working closely with European power utilities to undertake large scale piloting,” said Kisi, who was tight-lipped about project specifics and the cost of individual energy storage blocks.
Materials and recycling
Graphite has the highest strength of any natural material, and its mining has been increasing in recent times in particular thanks to its use in lithium-ion batteries.
While Australia is not particularly known for its natural graphite reserves, Kisi says Australia does have good stores, but that what is more exciting is that “many new green technologies emerging have graphite of sufficient quality for our needs as a by-product of another process.”
What is more, Kisi told pv magazine Australia that it is possible use recycled graphite and metal particles from various sources in the production process. This means thgat the graphite segment of the coming tsunami of lithium-ion battery waste could be repurposed into this thermal energy storage solution.
Currently MGA Thermal is manufacturing 100 blocks a day, though Kisi believes the company will be producing 1,000 blocks a day within the next nine months, and has ambitions for 10,000 blocks a day “shortly thereafter and so on.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/02/gcl-poly-says-staff-at-state-company-gave-misleading-responses-to-investigation-into-problematic-pre-payment/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CHINA",MAX HALL,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",GCL-Poly says staff at state company gave misleading responses to investigation into problematic pre-payment,"Trading in the stock of Chinese polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly was restored yesterday morning after the company explained, on Friday, how it had met the necessary requirements in a market update which also revealed more details about a 2019 project pre-payment which prompted former auditor Deloitte to walk away from the business.
GCL on Friday said “junior representatives” of state-owned Sinomec Refinery & Chemical Corp, which had accepted a RMB510 million (US$79.7 million) pre-payment from it, for a silicon production project, had inaccurately told Deloitte investigators a large slice of the money had been moved on, because they wanted to dissuade the manufacturer from cancelling the project contract.
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, which refused to sign off GCL Poly's 2020 accounts after discovering the pre-payment, subsequently walked away from the solar manufacturer. GCL explained the matter on Friday by stating a subsequent, second investigation into the affair prompted staff at the parent company of poly project lead contractor Sinomec to dismiss the claims which had previously been made to Deloitte.
Pick up the November edition of pv magazine on Friday to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyberattacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
“Some of the more junior representatives [of Sinomec] had previously told Deloitte that the SOE [state-owned enterprise] lead contractor had transferred a significant portion of the pre-payment to the sub-contractor in order to increase the apparent cost of terminating the EPC [engineering, procurement and construction] contract,” GCL told the Hong Kong exchange on Friday. The polysilicon and solar wafer maker offered no explanation as to why that claim had been made.
Deloitte investigators had been told, in interviews with staff from Sinomec and sub-contractor for materials supply Shanghai Chuanghong Technology Co Ltd, that the former had paid “more than RMB400 million” (US$62.5 million) from the pre-payment to the latter. Shanghai Chuanghong, which had originally been brought in by Sinomec had, in turn, paid around RMB200 million to an unnamed Japanese supplier for “certain raw materials,” the interviewees told the auditor.
The latest revelation about the pre-payment emerged as trading in GCL-Poly shares resumed on the Hong Kong stock exchange this morning, following a seven-month halt caused by the lack of accounts for 2020.
Explaining the economic rationale behind the Sinomec pre-payment, GCL said on Friday, it had not had enough cash to finance a production base for its innovative, less-energy-intensive granular polysilicon material in 2019 but then signed an EPC contract with Sinomec after the latter offered to do the work in return for just the pre-payment, which amounted to around a quarter of the project's expected cost.
By the second half of last year, GCL said on Friday, the granular silicon technology had advanced enough to separate out parts of the production process such that the associated facilities could be constructed by separate EPCs, and that change was one of two factors which persuaded GCL to end the contract with Sinomec and instead choose separate lead contractors, to protect its confidential technology. The second factor, GCL said, was that the manufacturer had generated enough cash from two fundraising exercises to turn to other providers by that point.
The GCL-Poly board at the time cited granular silicon production as one of the reasons behind its HK$4.2 billion (US$540 million) shares issuance in January, but had stated paying down debt and “general corporate purposes,” had prompted a similar, HK$264 million (US$33.9 million) exercise in June last year.
Deloitte refused to sign off GCL's 2020 figures when it uncovered the pre-payment which, it subsequently emerged, had been signed off by Jiang Wenwu, general manager of the GCL business responsible – Jiangsu Zhongneng – despite the fact Jiang only had clearance to authorize deals worth up to RMB100 million under GCL policy.
GCL also revealed on Friday, Jiang, who stepped down as a director of the business on June 18, had not been general manager of Jiangsu Zhongneng since March 2020.

The parent company will take advantage of a ruling laid down by the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) in 2011 that permits renewable energy projects to be the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) at the development stage, provided they meet criteria such as holding a service contract from the Department of Energy.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
“The PSE showed great foresight in creating this program for RE [renewable energy] companies,” said Solar Philippines founder Leandro Leviste, quoted in a press release issued by the company today. “Through this offering, we hope to give the public a new option to invest in RE, and expand RE in the Philippines.”
The developer did not reveal how much it hopes to raise from the planned IPO, stating only that the proceeds would fund the initial, 225 MW phase of a project its backer has predicted will be the biggest in South East Asia.
That first stage, said Solar Philippines, would already constitute the nation's largest solar field, with plans to extend capacity to 500 MW through “further financing,” in future, and to eventually expand the project even more, “beyond this capacity.”
The developer said it hopes to begin construction at the former ranch site in Peñaranda, in the province of Nueva Ecija, this year, with the project “operational,” with an unspecified generation capacity, next year.
Solar Philippines added, the Nueva Ecija facility is one of five large solar plants it hopes to install next year, alongside a 63 MW project in Batangas being developed with utility the Korea Electric Power Company; a 200 MW field at Tarlac taking shape with the Prime Infra business of port handling magnate Enrique K Razon Jr; and two further arrays, with a combined generation capacity of 140 MW, planned in Batangas and Cavite.

Solar analyst firm Roth Capital Partners said in a note to clients that it believes LONGi may be the next module manufacturer to be the subject of U.S. Customs and Border Protection action under a Withhold Release Order (WRO) issued in June.
“While detainment appears to have not yet happened, we believe it is imminent,” Roth said in a note obtained by pv magazine. The note said that LONGi had been informed that shipments currently on the water were expected to be detained at five ports. “Look for this to impact LONGi in a broad-based way,” the analyst’s note said.
The note said that Trina recently slowed or even stopped module flow “meaningfully” and changed terms on customers, in some cases increasing prices by around $0.10 per Watt.

According to a recent report from Norwegian business intelligence firm Rystad Energy, increasing module and shipping costs may cause the delay or cancellation of as much as 56% of the solar generation capacity currently planned worldwide next year.
South Korea seems to be no exception, although it can count on a strong domestic solar panel industry that has recently increased its effort to enhance production capacities.
“Currently, there is no official index for solar panel prices in Korea,” Kyungrak Kwon, renewables program director at Seoul-based NGO Solutions for Our Climate, told pv magazine. “However, according to industry interviews, it is understood that the panel price has increased from 10% to 15%, or from KRW340 to KRW400 per Watt ($0.289-0.339), over the past six months.”
According to him, this price hike may affect, in particular, small and medium-sized solar energy projects that have participated in the country’s renewable energy certificate (REC) scheme within the last six months. “If a developer participates in the solar power bidding market organized by the Korea Energy Agency, the installation must be completed within six months,” he further explained. “If the module price increases within that period, losses will occur due to the confirmed bid price.”
In the latest tender held under the scheme by the agency, 2 GW of PV was allocated at a final average price of KRW136.128 per kWh ($0.115). “It is difficult to know the exact number of projects halted by the supply chain disruptions in Korea,” Kwon added. “However, currently, about 1-1.2 GW of solar power in Korea is supplied every quarter, and 80% of these projects are small and medium-sized, with less than 1 MW [generation capacity], so these projects are expected to be most affected.”
He also explained that Korean manufacturers are currently predicting that supply chain disruption will continue at least until the second quarter of next year. According to him, module prices may not decrease within two years, if China's current issues with lack of power and raw material supply will not be resolved.
When asked if the Korean industry may be capable of responding to the supply bottlenecks by increasing capacity, Kwon said that the largest Korean manufacturer, Hanwha Solutions, announced in a recent conference call that, considering the reduction in production in the second half of the year, the internal target for module sales was lowered from 9 to 8 GW, although it has a total production capacity of 10 GW. “This can be understood as reflecting the recent increase in raw material prices,” Kwon emphasized. “Two months ago, Hanwha Solutions announced that it plans to expand production capacity of n-type solar modules by investing KRW1 trillion ($849 million) in Jinchoen plants by 2025, but I understand that this is not a strategy to respond to the recent supply bottleneck.”
South Korea reached an installed solar power capacity of around 15.6 GW as of the end of December 2020. The newly installed PV capacity for 2020 was around 4.1 GW.
The country currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.

And as scientists make real progress solving their well-documented challenges with long-term stability, the industry is beginning to picture what large-scale production of this technology could actually look like – either integrated into silicon cell manufacturing as a tandem device, or as a standalone perovskite solar cell.
In India, meanwhile, recent investments point to big plans for a major solar manufacturing hub that will rely on many of the latest technologies. A group of scientists led by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, put these two together to conduct a techno-economic analysis of the opportunity to manufacture perovskite solar cells in their region of the country.
The group carried out the analysis based on a 100 MW production line, manufacturing perovskite solar modules utilizing a carbon-based electrode. This approach is less often seen in research devices, which commonly rely on metal electrodes. IIT states that while carbon electrodes typically achieve lower module efficiency, they can be produced at a lower cost and show an advantage in terms of stability.
Results of the analysis are published in the paper Costing Analysis of Scalable Carbon-Based Perovskite Modules Using Bottom Up Technique, published in Global Challenges. The group calculated two different manufacturing processes – low-temperature and high-temperature processing.
The group finds that for the high-temperature processing route (module A), a manufacturing cost of $0.2106/W could be achieved, and the low-temperature route (module B) could go as low as $0.1548/W. The calculations are based on module efficiencies of 12.77% and 13.57, respectively, which the group says represents 75% of the highest reported lab efficiencies for each technology.
In terms of the final cost of energy, they present calculations for various product lifetimes between 10 and 25 years and taking into account performance degradation rates similar to those assumed for today’s silicon PV technologies, finding that module A could reach a levelized cost of electricity between $US$ 0.034 and 0.016 kWh, while module B could go as low as $0.030 and $0.014 kWh.
That these figures are already competitive with silicon PV production, comparing a theorized 100 MW production line with the several hundred gigawatts of silicon manufacturing and associated economies of scale already in operation, shows the potential for perovskites to achieve low manufacturing costs.
The group at IIT, however, notes that there are still several issues in perovskite production that will need to be ironed out for its techno-economic analysis to become a reality, and that changing material costs would also dramatically affect its modeling. “…economies of scale will help to bring the costs down,” they conclude. “The techno-economic framework helps researchers assess the feasibility of similar emerging technologies or this technology with the updated process, efficiency, stability and raw material prices in the future.”

Dubbed Ingecon Sun Storage 100TL, the inverter has an efficiency of 98.8% and a European efficiency rating of 98.1%. The device also features maximum DC voltage of 1,100 V and an input voltage range of 570-850 V.
It measures 920x705x315mm, weighs in at 80kg and, according to the manufacturer, can ensure high power density despite its small size. “This three-phase converter has a nominal power of 100 kW, which is capable of supplying up to 50 degrees Celsius of ambient temperature,” the company explained. “This makes it the optimal solution for solar self-consumption systems with batteries on an industrial scale.”
The new product can operate at an ambient operating temperature comprised between -25 degrees Celsius and 60 degrees Celsius and at an altitude of up to 3,000m. It also features IP65 protection and a cooling technique based on forced ventilation. “This new product features, as standard, wifi and ethernet communications, protection against short-circuits and AC overloads, a DC disconnector and type-II surge arresters against DC and AC overvoltage,” the manufacturer stated.
The inverter comes with a standard five-year warranty which is extendable up to 25 years. It is claimed to be compatible with all battery technologies, including lithium-ion, lead-acid, flow, and nickel-cadmium storage systems. “In addition, thanks to Ingeteam's Energy Management System (EMS), in solar self-consumption installations with batteries on an industrial scale, it is possible to control the operation of both the photovoltaic inverter and the battery inverter while establishing communication with a wattmeter at the point of connection with the grid and to the electric vehicle charging point,” the company emphasized.
The new product will be presented at the Genera trade show, which will be held in Madrid between November 16 and 18.
*The article was updated on November 3 to specify that the new product is a battery inverter.

The company on Friday announced the meeting details for votes on a sale of seven solar projects with a total generation capacity of 190 MW, and on a further two projects with an aggregate capacity of 93 MW, will be issued by the end of this month, rather than by last Friday and Sunday, respectively.
The larger of the two proposed deals, announced on August 24, concerns the sale of projects to state-owned China Power Investment Xinjiang Energy Chemical Engineering Group Akesu Co Ltd, for RMB538 million (US$84 million). The second planned transaction was announced on October 6 and relates to the sale of two more solar projects, to the Zhonghe Huineng Co Ltd subsidiary of state-controlled China National Nuclear Power Co Ltd, for RMB415 million (US$64.8 million).
Pick up the November edition of pv magazine on Friday to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyberattacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The latest of the two proposed deals is partially complicated by the fact the solar project companies in question, subsidiaries of Shunfeng, owed Kangfu Leasing a combined RMB571 million (US$89.2 million) at the end of 2020. Shunfeng had agreed to construct the projects, in October 2015, and then arranged to sell the farms to Kangfu before leasing them back. The project companies, however, have been unable to meet the rent since some point after December 2019, with Shunfeng blaming an inability to collect income owed to the project businesses, including state subsidies for clean energy which are three years in arrears. The cash owed Kangfu will have to be settled before any sale of the two solar farms completes.
Shunfeng needs to pay down a string of creditors and missed a deadline on Monday last week to settle a corporate bond worth RMB255 million (US$39.8 million). According to a stock market update to the Hong Kong exchange made by the company on October 6, Shunfeng has owed: True Bold Global Ltd HK$172 million (US$22.1 million) since November 27, 2019; Sino Alliance HK$351 million (US$45.1 million) since the end of 2019 and HK$800 million (US$103 million) since the end of last year; is on the hook for RMB330 million (US$51.5 million), since March 31 last year, for a 2015 corporate bond; and has owed Chongqing International Trust Inc RMB666 million (US$104 million) since September 30 last year.
The developer must also find HK$175 million (US$22.5 million) for Rainbow Fort Investments Ltd by the end of this month and HK$300 million (US$38.6 million) for China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd by the end of the year.
Shunfeng said it would allocate RMB365 million (US$57 million) of the expected RMB415 million from the proposed two-project sale to Zhonghe Huineng to paying down debts, with RMB50 million (US$7.8 million) kept back for working capital.
The proposed sale would entail a loss of RMB69 million (US$10.8 million) on the book value of the two solar farms and would leave Shunfeng with 480 MW of remaining solar generation capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/02/flexible-bipv-panel-with-410-w-output-from-italy/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",Flexible BIPV panel with 410 W output from Italy,"Italian solar module manufacturer Verditek Solar Italy, a unit of U.K.-based cleantech company Verditek plc, has developed a building-integrated PV (BIPV) flexible solar module with a power output of 410 W that can be installed directly on curved surfaces without the need for additional structural support.
“Our Lightweight VSG01M panel is the result of years of research and development and can be used on surfaces that were previously never considered suitable for solar power,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Despite its low weight of only 3kg per square meter, the product shows the same efficiency and reliability as traditional glass-backsheet panels.”
The monocrystalline module has a power conversion efficiency of 20.1% and is able to operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V. Its open-circuit voltage is 51.5 V and the short-circuit current is 9.7 A.
The panel has dimensions of 1,973x996x1.5mm and a weight of 4.9kg. Its temperature coefficient is -0.37% per degree Celsius. The product comes with a 20-year linear power output guarantee and a 10-year product guarantee. Its output is guaranteed at 85% of the original efficiency for 10 years.
In the module, the solar cells are placed into a lightweight polymer laminate panel, which is claimed to provide an anti-scratch, anti-glare protection to the product. The flexible module can bend up to 35% using standard 160µ-thick crystalline cells.
“The module is being produced at the company's 80 MW factory near Milan,” the spokesperson went on to say, noting that the new product is less than 3mm thick and can be applied to a surface to minimize or eliminate wind load. “We work where conventional PV cannot.”

The energy crisis in China has affected solar project costs in India as the latter is heavily dependent on Chinese components for its PV installations.
Manjesh Nayak, co-founder and chief financial officer at Oorjan Cleantech, says PV project costs in India have gone up 10-15%, causing an increase in power purchase agreement (PPA) tariffs for solar electricity of around INR0.20-0.30 ($0.003-0.004).
“The shortage of coal, and power-rationing in China has heavily impacted [Chinese] production lines and schedules, leading to upward pressure on the prices of solar hardware and uncertainty around delivery timelines. Since the Indian solar hardware brands are heavily reliant on Chinese imports, like solar cells, wafers, and inverter hardware, the domestic hardware industry has also got negatively affected,” said Nayak.
Trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather and more will be discussed on Tuesday, November 9, at pv magazine‘s virtual Roundtables USA 2021 event. Join us as solar experts discuss the big issues next Tuesday. For more information and to register free for the event, click here.
The Indian price increase comes at a time when PV developers are rushing to complete projects delayed by Covid lockdowns and also trying to take advantage of a duty-free window of opportunity between the expiry, at the end of July, of a safeguarding levy applied on Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese imports, and the application of basic customs duty on solar products, which will be introduced from April 1. 
“Consumers are caught in a catch-22 situation because of the proposed 40% basic customs duty back in India, and the [raised] GST [general sales tax] rates on one hand, and the uncertainty on the Chinese supply side on the other,” said Nayak. 
The solar developer has called for an urgent geopolitical intervention to ease the pressure on installers, such as by easing imports from non-Chinese original equipment manufacturers and deferring application of the customs duty on solar.
India has recently ramped up coal-fired power to avoid the sort of industrial black-outs which have been applied in China, with domestic coal supply increased despite the heavy rains in August and September which hindered mining activity; a steep rise in demand for electricity driven by the Covid-19 recovery; and increasingly more expensive coal imports.
The cost of imported coal is relevant as domestic supplies of the fuel can meet only 60-65% of annual demand in a nation which still depends on the polluting fossil fuel for around 70% of its power generation. The ramp up in coal production and use will have come at an awkward moment for the representatives India has sent to the COP26 climate change summit which opened in Glasgow this week.
“Power demand in India increased from August 2021 onwards as the country recovered from the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic,” stated a recent report issued by ratings agency Care Ratings. “Power demand has been surging since June 2021, with peak demand crossing 200 GW in July 2021. Power consumption for the period August 2021 and September 2021 increased from 106.6 BU [billion units] per month in 2019 ([a] pre-Covid year) to 124.2 BU per month in 2021. While power demand grew, the coal-based power plants (in India) could not stock up on the coal inventory ahead of the monsoon season due to a sharp increase in the international coal prices, as well as freight rates. This put pressure on these power plants to meet the increased power demand as the country ramps up … economic activity with increased vaccination and complete opening up of businesses, post the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April 2021.”
Pinaki Bhattacharyya, managing director and chief executive of Canadian-owned developer Amp Energy India, said the situation requires the Indian government to accelerate the deployment of renewables instead, and said the authorities should help renewable energy generators by reversing the planned increase in taxes and duties to enable them to immediately deploy the 20 GW backlog in project capacity and make much-needed power available. 
“Also, it should be a wake-up call for discoms [electricity distribution companies] and corporates to immediately sign renewable PPAs and PSAs [power sale agreements], and [for] consumers to tie up long-term [renewables generation] capacity at predictable prices as a hedge against increasing coal prices and short-term power markets … as the renewable energy costs will keep rising, so now is the right time to lock in long-term renewable power.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/02/storing-hydrogen-with-aluminum-hydrides/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",Storing hydrogen with aluminum hydrides,"A team of scientists from the U.S. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories has proposed to use aluminum hydride (AlH3) to store hydrogen. This solid-state metal hydride, which is also known as “alane,” is commonly used for rocket fuel, explosives, as a reducing agent in alkali batteries, and as a hydrogen source for low-temperature fuel cells. 
According to the researchers, this material is able to overcome the challenge represented by the thermodynamic limitation of hydrides in storing hydrogen. “Many high-capacity metal hydrides suffer from poor thermodynamics of hydrogen uptake after initial release, which necessitates extreme hydrogen pressures to regenerate,” the scientists explained. “Such a limitation is often tied to their metastable nature and hinders their real-world applications.”
At room temperature, aluminum hydride is a metastable crystalline solid and when it goes through an endothermic reaction it decomposes
to generate aluminum and hydrogen gas. The research team developed a nanoconfined material with improved thermodynamics and placed it within the nanopores of a highly porous bipyridine-functionalized covalent triazine framework, which they called AlH3@CTF-bipyridine. 
This configuration made it possible to convert bulk metallic aluminum into alane at 60 degrees Celsius and at a hydrogen pressure of only 700 bar, which compares to 6,900 bar in conventional processes. “This pressure is readily achievable in commercial hydrogen fueling stations, although further improvements are necessary to achieve rapid fueling,” the scientists further explained, noting that current processes used to produce alane are carried out under “extreme conditions.”
The academics found that the alane they developed offered more stability. They observed that intrinsically stable radicals and tiny alane clusters interact chemically with the nanopores of the confining framework, which creates thermodynamic conditions that are completely different from those of bulk metallic aluminum. “Nanoconfinement is a really interesting approach for stabilizing metastable hydrogen-storage materials, particularly given the wide palette of potential host materials,” said LLNL materials scientist Brandon Wood.
A full description of the technology can be found in the study Defying Thermodynamics: Stabilization of Alane Within Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Reversible Hydrogen Storage, which was recently published in Angewandte Chemie.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/02/zinc-ion-battery-that-stores-solar-energy/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",Cambridge scientists develop Zinc-ion battery that stores solar energy,"University of Cambridge researchers have developed a photo-rechargeable zinc-ion battery that is able to harvest and store solar energy. “These cells were conceived as a low-cost energy harvesting and storage solution for off-grid communities in developing countries,” Professor Michael Volder told pv magazine.
The battery was built with a photocathode made of vanadium dioxide (VO2) which is used to harvest light and store zinc ions and zinc oxide (ZnO) as a charge transport layer. Vanadium dioxide was chosen for its bandgap energy in the visible light spectrum and the remarkable fast charge-discharge kinetics. Previously, the authors had implemented photo–batteries in cells with a surface of around 100cm2 and a 64cm2 optical window that allows light to reach vanadium oxide and recharge the battery.
Under the proposed configuration, electrons are extracted to the conduction band of the VO2 photocathode and then transported to carbon fiber (CF) through a zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which is also intended at blocking holes.
“This combined action of electron extraction and blocking holes in VO2 leads to photocharging,” the researchers said, noting that the ZnO layer is used for charge transport and VO2 for energy storage.
The ZnO layer was coated on the current collector and the VO2 photocathode was synthesized directly on the ZnO layer.
“This improved charge separation and the interface between active materials, resulting in a 2.8 times higher photo-conversion efficiency compared to materials where the VO2 is physically mixed with an electron transport material,” the academics said.
The battery showed an efficiency of around 1.2%, which compares to around 0.6% in similar batteries manufactured with other photocathode materials. It also exhibited capacity retention of around 73% after 500 cycles.
“The next step is to test these batteries under real-life conditions,” Volder said.
The researchers described the device in “Vanadium dioxide–zinc oxide stacked photocathodes for photo-rechargeable zinc-ion batteries,” which was recently published in Royal Society of Chemistry’s Journal of Materials Chemistry A of the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Researchers recently published a paper in which they seek to understand how far we can go with wind and solar.
The research analyzes 39 years of hourly wind and solar generation data across 42 countries. An evaluation of “perfect” transmission without energy storage finds that the most reliable renewable electricity systems are wind-heavy and satisfy countries’ electricity demand in 72% to 91% of hours (or in 83% to 94% of hours by adding 12 hours of storage).
The research found, however, that even in systems which meet more than 90% of demand, “hundreds of hours of unmet demand” may occur each year.
The research quantified the power, energy, and utilization rates of additional energy storage and demand management, (curtailment), as well as the benefits of regional aggregation. The models evaluated three levels of excess generation and storage (none, three hours, and 12 hours).
Notably, the researchers concluded that wind and solar generation resources that were sized at 1.5 times along with three hours of energy storage would meet all but 200 hours of demand scattered throughout any given year.

Prior research by Calderia suggested that the United States could reach a dependable power grid made up of 80% wind and solar power with approximately 12 hours of energy storage. This 80% model would require no additional power grid transmission resources.
The models found that countries with larger land areas can (obviously) build wind+solar power grid systems with greater reliability. For systems without integrated energy storage, the ability to meet energy demand increased by 7.2% for every factor of 10 increase in land area.
When three or even 12 hours of energy storage are added, patterns begin to emerge.
The top left of the above chart shows a standard volume of generation with no energy storage. It shows a clear linear increase in reliability associated with the country’s area. But, in cases where three or 12 hours of energy storage are added, generating capacity increases by 50%, and reliability increases dramatically.
In fact, when looking at the lower right box with 12 hours of batteries and 1.5x standard generation, the ability of wind and solar to meet electricity demand brings all of the nations analyzed in the study above 97%; several countries were modeled as meeting 100% of demand.
The research suggested a trade-off point exists for excess generation and energy storage as a 10% increase in excess annual generation is equivalent to 3.9 hours of storage.
The paper showed that even with energy storage, gaps in the schedule of heavy wind plus solar systems still find periods where dispatchable resources will be needed. And though it is easy to suggest fossil-based facilities as a solution to these down times, it will become economically challenging to do so, as the mined volume of those fuel sources – coal and gas – declines.
Additionally, technologies like hydrogen, vehicle batteries, nuclear, and hydro will be needed to fill in the weak spots. If we do figure out how to limit our political squabbling and build intra- and international transmission, we will achieve maximum renewable energy resource utilization.
If we do find that “oversizing” wind and solar deployment beyond currently defined standard system sizing is in fact the best way to size things, then the word “oversize” is a misnomer.
When these projects are generating electricity in amounts greater than the power grid’s demand, entrepreneurial spirits and asset owners no doubt will seek ways to make better use of these resources.
Generally, it would not make sense to place expensive hardware — such as hydrogen electrolyzers or bitcoin mining rigs — at renewable generation project sites to run “only” when the sites are overproducing.
It would make sense, however, to place energy-hungry industries near renewable generation, with the intention to run on both grid power and on summertime peak generation power which otherwise would have been curtailed. In this way, we can bring down average electricity prices for these facilities, and create a valuable resource out of necessary, seasonal excess.
