The energy group kicked off monocrystaline PV module production in July 2021 with an initial capacity of 15 MW per year. However, demand for European products prompted it to expand the manufacturing line and increase its capacity threefold.
“The power capacity of photovoltaic installations in Poland is already approximately 12 GW, while government plans assumed a capacity of 10 GW of energy from the sun only in 2040,” said Adam Sikorski, CEO of Unimot. “It's a trend we've been observing throughout Europe, so our goal is to offer our Polish-made panels throughout the European market.”
Unimot Group sells panels under the Avia Solar brand, but it also offers private-label solutions. It targets companies that want to manufacture photovoltaic panels under their own brands.
The company’s production line manufactures solar panels with M12 cells. Avia Solar's PV modules will be sold in versions ranging from 350 Wp to more than 450 Wp. The modules will feature components from the likes of 3M, Interfloat, and DOW.
Unimot Group, which is a leading independent importer of liquid and gaseous fuels in Poland, says it will not rule out the further expansion of its PV manufacturing line.

Scientists from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the Brazilian Center for Electric Energy Research (Cepel) have analyzed the environmental impact of PV plants with single-axis trackers and fixed tilt trackers, using systems in northeastern Brazil as a case study.
The team analyzed two PV systems. The first (S1) has polycrystalline modules mounted on single-axis trackers, with a total installed capacity of 1,033.25 kW. The second (S2) consists of polycrystalline modules mounted on fixed-tilt trackers, with a capacity of 52.20 kW. The modules for the systems come from Malaysia. The study assumes that the trackers, inverters, and transformers are manufactured in Brazil.
The researchers used the life cycle assessment (LCA) technique to analyze the environmental impact. The team focused on three LCA categories: global warming, land use, and water consumption.
The LCA for systems S1 and S2 encompasses the production, distribution, construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), and decommissioning phases. It does not include the grid connection, electricity transmission, and consumption phases.
The researchers acquired figures on inputs and outputs from the international Ecoinvent database and processed in them with SimaPro 9.0 software. The LCA reflects the environmental performance of the systems in the production of 1 kWh of electricity.
“To quantify the difference between the environmental performances of the two PV systems for the generation of 1 kWh, we first calculated the difference between their performance with respect to each of the three categories in percentage terms,” the researchers explained. “We then averaged these results and obtained that the environmental impact associated with 1 kWh generation by S2 (with fixed tracker) is approximately 17% higher on average than that of S1 (with single-axis tracker).”
In particular, the impact of system S1 is 24% lower in the global warming category, 20% lower in land use, and 7% lower in water use. The S1 system emits the equivalent of a total of 44.64 g of carbon dioxide per kWh, with the production phase accounting for 95% of the emissions. Module production accounts for more than 70% of emissions, trackers for 17%, and electric motors for only 0.04%.
The researchers concluded using PV systems with single-axis trackers should be prioritized in Brazil, despite their higher cost,” the scientists said. “The deployment of this more costly technology “can be supported by public policy … through economic incentives.”
The researchers published their findings in “Environmental lifecycle-based analysis of fixed and single-axis tracking systems for photovoltaic power plants: A case study in Brazil,” in Cleaner Engineering and Technology.

Switzerland's Meyer Burger has signed a long-term wafer supply contract with Norwegian wafer manufacturer Norsun. The contract provides for rising purchase quantities as Norsun expands its wafer production capacity, in line with Meyer Burger's growth plans.
Meyer Burger aims to expand its annual PV cell production capacity to 3 GW by 2024. At the beginning of January, the Swiss solar manufacturer said that it would invest €400 million ($430 million) in the expansion of its cell and module capacity in Germany and the United States.
Norsun produces its wafers in a plant in Årdal, western Norway, powered by hydroelectric capacity. Wafer production is very energy-intensive and the use of hydropower significantly reduces the ecological footprint of PV modules. The Oslo-based company currently has a production capacity of 1 GW.
“The agreement with Norsun is an important step in strengthening the independence of European supply chains,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Meyer Burger.

They have found that 34.3% of the devices experienced their first failures after 15 years.
“I would say this failure rate is acceptable, even good,” researcher Christof Bucher told pv magazine. “One assumes the inverter must be replaced once in the lifetime of a PV system.”
The survey includes inverters from Fronius, Huawei, Kostal, SMA, SolarEdge, and Sputnik. However, the scientists said that the analyzed devices are not representative of the current PV market, as they were purchased many years ago.
“The oldest inverters investigated in this study are from the early 1990s,” they said.
The survey includes data from 1,195 PV systems with 2,121 inverters and 8,542 optimizers. The biggest share of the inverters used in these systems had power ratings between 10 kVA and 15 kVA.
“A large part of the data was collected with the help of people who know the history of the PV systems well,” the scientists explained, adding that incomplete, unanalyzable data records were deleted. “The survey gave respondents the opportunity to add their own comments to the technical data.”
In order to analyze the TTF, the research group used the Kaplan-Meier estimator, which is commonly used to estimate the survival function from figures that are censored, truncated, or have missing values. The survival curve shows which percentage of the population is still alive after how many years.
“The Kaplan-Meier estimator can be adjusted for different influencing factors, for example to the year of commissioning, the inverter manufacturer or the nominal power ratio,” the researchers explained.
The scientist said the survival curve considers how many inverters are still under observation in the corresponding year of operation. That could help assess when a certain percentage of the inverters will have their first expected malfunctions.
“However, because only little data is available for old inverters, the uncertainty in the survival curve increases with increasing inverter life,” said the scientists.
The survey showed that more than 65% of the inverters did not present yield-relevant faults by their 15th year of operation. The scientists said the TTF mainly depends on the manufacturer and a device's location, with outdoor installations having shorter TTF rates. They said the overall reliability of an inverter is proportional to the reduction in the number of power electronic components. In inverters with power optimizers, the first fault often occurs earlier than in devices without optimizers, according to the scientists.
“The inverters and optimizers in this study represent a broad, albeit not representative, cross-section of the inverters and optimizers used in PV systems on buildings in Switzerland and Europe,” they explained.
When they first announced the survey in July, the researchers said the causes of the failures and defects had not been precisely recorded. They said at the time that the “the rule of thumb that inverters should run without faults for around 15 years” had been confirmed by their findings.
The research project will run until the end of 2025 and extended to other systems.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/08/sodium-aluminum-battery-for-renewables-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 8, 2023",Sodium aluminum battery for renewables storage,"Scientists from the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have designed a molten salt battery based on an anode made of molten sodium (Na) and a cathode made of aluminum (Al) and sodium tetrachloroaluminate (NaAlCl4).
They described the novel battery as a low-cost, grid-scale solution for long-duration renewable energy storage and said the use of NaAlCl4 offers extra accessible capacity hidden in acidic chloroaluminate. They said the proposed battery chemistry relies on the sixth and second most abundant elements on Earth.
“This enables higher specific capacity and average discharge voltages than previous Na-Al batteries, utilizing two distinct cell reaction mechanisms in one battery,” the researchers said, noting that this second reaction, on top of the neutral molten salt reaction, is the crucial factor for the device's higher voltage and capacity. “Specifically, after 345 charge/discharge cycles at high current, this acidic reaction mechanism retained 82.8 percent of peak charge capacity.”
The researchers assembled Na-Al full cells in the discharged state in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. They then closed the cells with stainless steel endcaps and sealed them hermetically by tightening a set of eight screws in a star pattern.
“The system design allows only sodium to move through the solid-state electrolyte to charge the battery,” they explained. “This flat cell design allows the cell capacity to be increased by simply using a thicker cathode, which we leveraged in this work to demonstrate a triple capacity cell with sustained discharge of 28.2-hours under laboratory conditions.”
Th research group found that the battery achieves a high areal capacity cell of 138.5 mAh cm−2 at a high current density of 4.67 mA cm−2. The scientists said the battery could potentially achieve an energy density of up to 100 Wh/kg at a cost of $7.02 kWh.
“We have eliminated the need for nickel, a relatively scarce and expensive element, without sacrificing battery performance,” said Li. in reference to another advantage offered by the new battery design. “The aluminum cathode charges more quickly, which is crucial to enable the longer discharge duration demonstrated in this work.”
They presented the battery tech in “Unlocking the NaCl-AlCl3 phase diagram for low-cost, long-duration Na-Al batteries,” which was recently published in Energy Storage Materials.
“We showed that this new molten salt battery design has the potential to charge and discharge much faster than other conventional high-temperature sodium batteries, operate at a lower temperature, and maintain an excellent energy storage capacity,” said researcher Guosheng Li.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/08/european-solar-ppa-prices-rose-by-11-4-in-q4/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"FEBRUARY 8, 2023",European solar PPA prices rose by 11.4% in Q4,"High development costs and a volatile regulatory environment contributed to an 11.4% increase in solar PPA prices in Europe in the fourth quarter, according to a new report by LevelTen Energy.
Prices rose by 30% in the United Kingdom and by 20% in Italy, said LevelTen Energy.
“It is likely that public auctions have contributed to the sharp rise in prices in the UK,” said Frederico Carita, developer services senior manager at LevelTen Energy. “More capacity going to government auctions means less is available for corporate buyers, leading to higher PPA prices.”
The prices of solar PPAs reached €76.84/MWh, up 60% year on year. Spain has remained in the range of €45/MWh, making it the second-cheapest country above Finland, which reached €40/MWh.
Despite rising prices, buyer demand continued to grow in 2022, said LevelTen Energy. It analyzed 125 PPA price offers for 94 projects in 16 countries. All of its figures are based on the prices developers are offering for PPA contracts, rather than transacted PPA prices.
“PPA prices continue to rise in Europe due to inflation, supply chain constraints, rising interest rates and, of course, regulatory uncertainty,” said Plácido Ostos, energy analyst for Europe at LevelTen Energy. “Spain continues to stand out from the rest due to fundamental factors such as robust solar resources and relatively high land availability, so it is not surprising that it remains a very strong PPA market.”
In emerging European markets, the supply of solar energy also grew.
“PPA buyers looking to avoid hyper-competitive markets should consider markets like Greece and Hungary, which together produced an impressive 21% of the Q4 volume,” said Carita.
Despite strong demand, regulatory uncertainty contributed to a shortage of PPAs, according to the report.
The latest edition of pv magazine, hot off the press today, is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
“From price caps on renewable generators to capping gas prices, policymakers are increasingly relying on imposed measures to keep wholesale prices artificially low, often at the expense of generators,” said Kristian Lande, LevelTen Energy's senior director. “For the renewables sector, these measures pose a serious risk of hurting investor appetite, which is the last thing the continent needs as it works to accelerate its transition to clean energy.”
The report showed that the availability of wind PPA contracts fell as developers applied for siting and construction permits for projects. In 2022, wind investments fell by 47%, according to WindEurope.

Extended power outages are a rising threat to community resilience, due to the rise of extreme weather events and an aging, centralized US electric grid. AEP Ohio has therefore contracted Eaton to help build a solar microgrid to support its Tussing water booster station.
A microgrid can operate fully independently, or on “island” mode, to provide continuous power throughout long-term outages. The water booster station’s microgrid includes 100 kW of onsite solar generation and 440 kWh of battery energy storage. The Eaton project is fully commissioned and is expected to reach operations this quarter.
The microgrid supports the city of Columbus, Ohio, in reducing emissions by 45% and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. It was funded partially through AEP Ohio’s Smart City program.
“Climate change is already impacting quality of life in central Ohio, and the challenges stemming from its very existence will only continue to grow more frequent and more common in the years ahead,” said Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther. “We have an obligation to strengthen the resiliency of our infrastructure and to meet these challenges head on.”
The EPA said as much as 40% of operational costs for drinking water is tied to energy use. The new microgrid is an example of supporting this critical infrastructure more sustainably while remaining cost-effective.

In 2021, Australia set the “Solar 30 30 30” target to reach 30% module efficiency and AUD 0.30 ($0.21)/W at the utility scale by 2030. Now, researchers from ANU in Canberra have revealed that they have reached the first “30” by achieving a 30.3% efficiency.
The perovskite and silicon tandem solar cell have ultra-high efficiency, while also enhancing the operational stability of the solar cells, said the team. Their work builds on a previous record set by ANU researchers in 2020, and was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which committed AUD 40 million to achieve the Solar 30 30 30 stretch goal.
Researcher The Duong said the team relied on the strengths of widely used silicon cells and perovskite cells, which are made of materials with a specific crystal structure revered for efficiency, but notoriously unstable.
“With these tandem solar cells, the perovskite top cell can efficiently absorb the blue light and transmit the red light to the silicon bottom cell, producing significantly more energy from sunlight than each individual device,” Duong said.
Alone, the highest recorded efficiency for silicon cells is currently 26.81% in lab circumstances, but for commercially available modules it sits closer to 20%.
“Surpassing the 30% mark is significant,” said Duong. “That’s currently considered the efficiency threshold for the commercialisation of tandem technology like that used in our study. The current predictions are that tandem solar technology will be in mass production by 2026. However, more work is still needed to upscale and ensure the technology can be stable in the field over 25 to 30 years.”
The ANU team is now working to improve the efficiency and stability of the solar cells. They have published their findings in Advanced Energy Materials.
