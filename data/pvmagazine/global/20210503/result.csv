German storage system provider Fenecon has unveiled a storage system for residential and commercial applications equipped with a self-learning energy management system that takes into account power consumption and weather forecasts.
The system is claimed to be able to keep battery capacity free for midday on sunny days, in order to prevent curtailment and, thus, loss of power yield. For this purpose, energy is automatically distributed in advance to charging stations for electric vehicles, heat pumps or other controllable systems. Customers of time-variable electricity tariffs should also be able to use the control system in a targeted manner. In addition, the control is said to prevent solar power from being fed into the grid at peak times.
According to the manufacturer, customers are also allowed to use its OpenEMS platform to access a large number of other energy services and applications – such as community or flat-rate offers for green electricity if their own solar electricity does not cover their needs, at times.
The modular battery package has a size of 506x365mm and a storage capacity of 8.8 kWh to 22 kWh. The high-voltage batteries, the battery management module, and the intelligent control box can be plugged together. With a total height of only 1,710mm in the highest allowable design with ten battery modules, there is still space for the wall-mounting of the inverter – which weighs 24kg – even in low-basement rooms. A total of three such towers can be connected to one another in order to increase the capacity to up to 66 kWh. 
In addition to the energy management system, the new product contains DC surge protection for the photovoltaic strings; internet access; all battery outputs; and the communication interface to the inverter, additional battery towers, heat pumps, or charging stations.
According to Fenecon, all connections are pluggable and suitable for outdoor use. This means that neither the box for the battery management system (BMS) nor the box for the self-learning energy management system, have to be opened for installation. 
The company also claims that the installation and commissioning of the system usually takes less than an hour. The three-phase inverter, developed in collaboration with an unnamed partner, has a photovoltaic connection for up to 13 kW and an output of 10 kW. The hybrid unit combines solar and battery inverters in one device.
Fenecon states the battery is suitable for all new photovoltaic systems and the retrofitting of existing systems. A combination of DC and AC-coupled connections is also possible. In the event of a power failure, the integrated power disconnection allows uninterrupted and powerful emergency power operation, with solar recharging.
“A storage system for the energy transition must intelligently integrate photovoltaic systems, wall boxes, heat pumps and electricity tariffs into a central management system – and optimize self-consumption,” said Ludwig Asen, head of product management at Fenecon, describing the idea behind the storage solution.

GCL has been in cross default since $500 million of three-year senior notes failed to be settled upon maturity at the end of January. The company stated, in early February, the holders of almost 92% of the debt had signaled their intent to agree to swap their investments for new three-year notes and the company is now awaiting confirmation of that in the court of Bermuda, where the company is registered for tax reasons.
The manufacturer last week said it expects a directions hearing related to the debt restructure to be heard on the island nation on Thursday, with creditors set to sign up to the plan on June 4. If that progresses as expected, GCL said, it anticipates the debt restructure being signed off on June 11.
GCL has said it is conducting an investigation into a RMB510 million ($78.8 million) pre-payment to a contractor in September 2019 in connection with a silicon manufacturing project which never took shape. Auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu has held up the solar company's 2020 annual accounts over the payment.
The poly maker on Friday announced the latest solar project sell-off by its GCL New Energy developer operation. In the latest, third phase of an agreement with state-owned Guangdong Jinyuan New Energy Co Ltd and State Power Investment Corp Guizhou Jinyuan Weining Energy Co Ltd, GCL will sell five Chinese solar farms with a total generation capacity of 183 MW to the public bodies. The company estimates it will make a net gain of RMB50 million on the book value of the projects, which it expects to generate a net RMB660 million ($102 million), as well as removing a further RMB1.63 billion ($252 million) of liabilities from its books.

The achievement, confirmed by Germany's Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin for Longi's monocrystalline, n-type, bifacial product, marks the first time a device of such scale has breached the 25% barrier.
Longi already holds the record of 24.06% for the front side of a mono, p-type PERC cell, set in January 2019.
“It is our target to promote the continuous upgrading of the entire PV industry … with higher efficiency and more sustainability,” said Li Hua, vice president and head of solar cell R&D for Longi. “The improvement of cell conversion ratio is the main focus for the development of PV technology. Longi will continue to concentrate [on] the development of advanced technology and industrialization of these technologies, take the lead [on] new technologies, and contribute innovation power for the realization of [the] “two carbon” goals of China,” added Li, referring to the ambition of having the nation's carbon emissions peak this decade and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.
Longi is the world's biggest solar manufacturer, by market value and sales revenue, and shipped 24.5 GW of panels last year to generate revenue of RMB54.58 billion ($8.43 billion). At the turn of the year, the company boasted annual production capacities of 85 GW, 30 GW and 50 GW for its mono wafers, cells and panels, respectively.

The test was conducted on a floating structure with 64 modules on a 1:13 scale, in an artificial ocean basin in which waves, wind, and currents can be simulated in real-time. The model of the floating array was equipped with sensors that collected wave information, movement and loads in the mooring and connection points. Moss Maritime is using these data to calibrate its numerical model, which will later be used to design and optimize the real installation.
The first test, Sintex experts stated, showed the floating system design for offshore location is able to withstand the simulated, difficult environmental conditions of the Norwegian Sea, where the model should be applied for a pilot project under development by Equinor off the island of Froya, near Trondheim.

“Today's concepts are mostly designed for lakes and hydropower reservoirs and many of them would fall short if they were exposed to waves,” said  Øyvind Hellan, vice president for research, ships and ocean structures at Sintef. “Our goal is to expand the pilot plant to become a full-scale research and development facility.”
This installation should be an 80mx80m floating array with panels installed at a height of less than three meters above the water surface. Its anchoring system is claimed to give the installation enough freedom to cope with the waves.
Equinor intends to measure the plant's power production to assess how harsh weather conditions and rough waters affect its performance. “If we succeed here, we can succeed anywhere,” said, in January, Hanne Wigum, the head of Equinor's solar and wind tech unit.
Equinor and Saipem signed an agreement in March to jointly develop a floating solar panel park technological solution for near-coastal applications.

New Delhi manufacturer Gautam Solar has started panel production from a new manufacturing line at its Haridwar factory, in the state of Uttarakhand.
The INR200 crore ($27 million) group has more than doubled its annual solar panel manufacturing capacity, from 120 MW to 250 MW, at Haridwar—a boost that makes it the third-largest solar manufacturer in North India.
Speaking to pv magazine, managing director Gautam Mohanka said the bigger capacity at the Haridwar plant has already become operational. The plant is producing mono PERC and polycrystalline solar panels with power outputs of up to 400 W. The company’s move to mono PERC is in line with the global trend.
“The global market at the moment is witnessing some fluctuation in rates, perhaps due to the shortage of raw materials as the supply chains aren’t functioning properly,” said Mohanka. “We are also seeing that the poly panel is being phased out and the mono PERC wafer is becoming more popular and we might see the same trend catch in India as well, in the near future.”
The MD said the company may consider producing 500 W-plus solar modules in future.
Gautam Solar has four factories in Haridwar manufacturing solar panels, batteries, electronics, and other structures. The panel production capacity expansion has been driven by rising demand from solar projects which mandate domestically manufactured components. 
“We have been witnessing a steady increase in demand for our solar panels for a while now, hence increasing the manufacturing capacity became vital,” said the Gautam Solar boss. “The same has been executed at our Haridwar facility. If things go according to plan, we will soon increase the production capacities at our other facilities as well. This has been made possible in the wake of the government’s decision to make India a solar manufacturing hub and reduce its dependency on other countries for importing solar equipment. We appreciate this decision and firmly believe that it will help create a powerful, self-subsisting, and aatmanirbhar [self-reliant] Bharat [India].”

“The standalone system is connected to storage systems with a combined capacity of 159 kWh, provided by Sungrow, and is equipped with Sunport's S1 flexible module NH1S,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, noting that the PV system is not entitled to a feed-in tariff under Japan's renewable energy incentive scheme and is being subsidized through a regional support scheme of the Nagano prefecture.
The PV system is intended for 100% self-consumption and is powering a factory of an undisclosed manufacturer. “The manufacturing facility had a colored steel tile roof and, in order to ensure the waterproofing, we could not use a mounting system,” the company spokesperson further explained. “Considering the low load bearing [nature of the system], the customer decided to use our light and flexible module.”
The manufacturer used its S1 MWT monocrystalline PERC Flexible Module. This product is available in four versions with power ratings ranging from 75 W to 90 W and a power conversion efficiency between 14.3% and 17.1%.
The frameless module has a size of 1,810x290x1.4mm and a weight of 1.3kg. It is manufactured with 30 half-cells, sized at 162.75mm, a white backsheet, and a POE encapsulant. Its connector is MC4-compatible and its junction box has an IP 68 rating.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V. The manufacturer offers a 25-year power output guarantee for 82.36% of the initial yield, and a 12-year product guarantee. The module's temperature coefficient is -0.36% per degree Celsius.
“The S1 panels supplied, were in a long and narrow shape which can be inlaid in corrugated steel tile with back glue and this not only saved support cost but also made the installation more stable and reliable,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “And based on metal-wrap-through (MWT) technology, no bus-bar and welding strip exists on the front side of the panels.”
In September 2017, Nanjing Sunport Power Corp Ltd announced the opening of its first, 1 GW solar module manufacturing facility in China, following a significant investment in Dutch equipment manufacturer Eurotron’s complete back contact solar module manufacturing line in 2013.
The Chinese manufacturer focuses purely on metal-wrap-through (MWT) module technology, working with both multi and mono products.

The Rambla Morales desalination plant near Almería, Spain, has been abandoned since 2011. However, it is now set to resume operations by fall 2022, according to a new document from Servicios Hídricos Agricultura y Ciudad SL, a subsidiary of Aqualia.
The project to restart the facility will provide 20 cubic hectometres of water per year to the surrounding area, which includes the municipalities of Almería and Níjar. With this water, 3,000 hectares could be irrigated, which is the equivalent of 10% of the irrigable area of the entire province of Almería, or 60% of the irrigable area of Níjar.
The objective is to start producing and supplying desalinated water in early 2022. The “Mar de Alborán” desalination plant is seen as a potential solution to the water deficit in the area, where the aquifers are over-exploited and have low levels with high salinity, which means that demand for irrigation water cannot be covered by existing natural water sources.
The project includes the construction of a PV plant that powers the installation, thus making it more sustainable to preserve the environment in which the desalination plant is located, the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park. The facility is expected to be ready in the summer of 2022. The company estimates a total investment of €99.2 million ($119 million).
Lucas Díaz, the director of Aqualia in Andalusia, Extremadura and the Canary Islands, said that the project to start up the desalination plant will be “very complex.” However, he added that Servicios Hídricos is working hard “to turn this infrastructure into a technological benchmark that promotes the economy of the area, guaranteeing water for irrigation and municipalities, based on sustainability, caring for the environment and social commitment.”

In the procurement exercise, the agency intends to allocate 2,050 MW – the largest amount ever tendered by the Korean authorities to date – across five project categories: installations of less than 100 kW; projects ranging in size from 100 to 500 kW; PV arrays with a capacity between 500 kW and 1 MW; solar plants with an installed power of 1 to 20 MW; and, for the first time, solar parks exceeding 20 MW in size.
Selected projects will be awarded a fixed rate under a 20-year contract under the country's renewable energy certificate (REC) scheme and will sell electricity to local power distributors.
The tender's final results are expected to be announced on July 16 and the winning bidders should be awarded a final contract in August.
There are currently no domestic content requirements embedded in the tender but, starting from this year, projects relying on solar PV modules with a low carbon footprint are being prioritized.
In the two tenders held in 2020, the KEA allocated 1.2 GW and 1.41 GW, respectively, while in 2019 it contracted 350 MW and 500 MW. In 2017 and 2018, total allocated capacity was 600 MW in each year. Overall, South Korea‘s authorities should tender 4 GW of solar this year.
The country reached an installed solar power capacity of around 15.6 GW as of the end of December 2020. The newly installed PV capacity for 2020 was around 4.1 GW.

“With Silicon Joule, we can use today's battery manufacturing and recycling facilities to reduce vehicle emissions and put renewable energy storage into homes in high volumes right now,” said the company's CEO, John Barton.
Gridtential's flagship product is the lead-acid battery Silicon Joule 24V U1 — Deep-cycle Gen2 Battery, which it defines as the world's first factory-ready, single-block, 24V, deep-cycle lead battery, and an alternative to lithium-ion batteries.
The 12-cell device measures 198x137x189mm and weighs 9.96kg. It has a nominal voltage of 24 V and a cycle use of 28.8 V, or 2.4 V per cell. The battery also features a maximum discharge current of 45 A and has an expected cycle life of 750 cycles.
Its gravimetric energy density is 40 Wh per kg and its volumetric energy density, 77 Wh per kg. The cycling temperature range is between -30 and 50 degrees Celsius.
The product is claimed to be ideal for personal mobility vehicles such as golf carts, scooters, and e-bikes, as well as for telecom backup and renewable energy storage in homes and offices.
AGM batteries are usually built with a special glass mat separator that absorbs the electrolyte solution between the battery plates. The Silicon Joule 24V U1 battery is manufactured with silicon wafers that are claimed to replace lead grids, to reduce battery weight.
“In conventional battery designs, electrons flow across the battery plate and high current is concentrated at the top contact,” the U.S. start-up explains on its website. “In Gridtential’s bipolar design, current flows through each silicon wafer evenly, making it a highly efficient conductor with a current path length equal to its thickness.”
The silicon wafers are said to reduce lead use by 40% and the battery weight by 30%. “Plus, they maintain the thermal stability and 99% recyclability of the conventional technology, creating a clear safety and sustainability advantage over lithium-ion,” the company said.

Hydrogen from electrolysis for under AUD 2 ($1.54) a kilo? Australian entrepreneurs Ian and Tony Schirmer have developed a missing link in the race to low-cost hydrogen. Their CQSola industrial solar power controllers connect PV generation directly to the terminals of electrolyzers – no double DC-to-DC conversion – to save the 9-15% loss of power going to hydrogen that those processes incur.
That’s on top of the 21%+ additional power CQSola claims its device can help solar farms to generate by ensuring that each panel works to its maximum capacity, unhampered by its neighbours in a typical string arrangement.
pv magazine Australia originally covered the solar optimizer devised by the Schirmers back in August 2019. Electrical engineer Ian is a former products and services innovation manager at Ergon Energy, and he is relentlessly questing to improve clean energy performance. His son, Tony, brings business, cloud systems, and coding expertise to the mix.
Late last year, the startup was feted by the office of the Queensland Chief Entrepreneur, and since then has discovered further potential applications of its direct-control and monitoring device that will greatly improve the economic case for solar-generated hydrogen.
The revelation came about when CQSola was “contacted by a representative from the Asian Development Bank who was scouting out new technologies for green hydrogen production,” Ian tells pv magazine Australia. The ensuing discussion prompted the Schirmers to investigate their technology through a green-hydrogen lens.
“We discovered that we can hook it up from the solar panels directly to hydrogen electrolyzers, cutting out a whole heap of machinery and electronics in the middle,” he says.
Since hydrogen production and re-energization are notorious for losing power at every conversion turn, reducing the number of processes involved is an obvious way to ensure more green energy is captured, and lower the cost per kilo.

Ian adds that because electrolyzers are a form of energy-storage, “you charge the electrolyzer to get hydrogen and discharge that to get energy.” The technology could also enable battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) to be directly charged from the DC side of solar farms, again reducing the loss of energy through conversions.
The Schirmers say it was a natural progression for CQSola to begin working on the design of high-voltage electrolyzers, by “hooking existing electrolysers up in series to get a higher-voltage electrolyzer.”
“The problem,” adds Tony, “is that at the moment the control for that system doesn’t exist.” It would generally be achieved via a DC busbar, but “to get the power onto the DC busbar you need to have a DC-to-DC conversion and a DC-to-DC conversion on the actual charge controller,” he says, noting that they've built all that into their controller. “Essentially when you connect our product in a string, you’re creating a busbar with a charge controller on it and taking out those big conversion losses.”
CQSola has plans to partner with an electrolyzer manufacturer to enable higher-voltage equipment, with the aim of more efficiently producing hydrogen from the same amount of renewable energy.
As a solution for driving greater efficiencies in the green hydrogen value chain, the CQSola controller was recently endorsed in an industry webinar by Stephen B. Harrison founder of Europe-based sbh4 Consulting which specialises in all aspects of hydrogen production.
As part of the “EQ World Hydrogen Large-scale Electrolysis” webinar, aired in mid-April, Harrison posited that efforts to improve the performance of PV modules have plateaued in terms of return on R&D effort. “We need to look at other weak links in the photovoltaic chain” in order to economically feed mega- and giga-scale electrolyzers, he said.
Greater productivity of solar infrastructure will be one of the most significant contributors to lowering the cost of hydrogen.
Harrison singled out CQSola as “a very, very clever power-management device” that “solves a lot of the problems of solar farms” to give “20-30%, maybe even a 40%, uplift in power generation.”
Increasing productivity of solar farms and reducing losses in conversions from solar to electrolyzer by the percentages CQSola says are achievable using its technology, could make cents – perhaps enough to cross the H2 for under $2/kg rubicon.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/03/solar-101-working-the-angles-to-maximize-your-solar-systems-output/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 3, 2021",Solar 101: Working the angles to maximize your solar system’s output,"From pv magazine USA
In the first articles of our “Solar 101” series, (Is my roof ready for solar?) and (Attaching your solar system to your roof) we discussed how the age and physical characteristics of a roof can affect the design and payback of a prospective solar system. We considered weather concerns and panel setbacks to estimate the number of solar panels that will fit on a roof.
Now, we will take a look at the relationship between a panel’s latitude, pitch, and azimuth to its solar electricity output.
In a perfect world, solar panels always face the sun at a perpendicular angle. But most prospective solar buyers are stuck with pre-existing realities: a home they already own, and a roof with preexisting conditions. Partial shade, a less-than-ideal azimuth, or a less-than-ideal roof pitch are often the norm for a residential installation. But that begs the question: To what extent will these factors affect my system’s return on investment?
Most of us are looking to maximize electricity generation on an annual basis. Thus, the best azimuth is due south and the ideal pitch is roughly equal to your home or business’s latitude. We can test this hypothesis using the U.S. Department of Energy’s PV Watts tool to estimate solar electricity generation.
Here is what it looks like:

PV Watts is not a perfect tool; It is a rough guide, but it is close enough for our purposes. If you live in a region with heavy snow, dust, tree cover, or other sunshine-blocking variables your electricity production will be lower.
Let’s start this analysis with a completely average town – Normal, Illinois – as our test site. For this analysis, we adopt the default variables in PV Watts, changing two variables: the Tilt (deg) of the roof and the array type to fixed (roof mount).

A rule of thumb for optimizing the angle of your solar panels is to mount them at an angle equivalent to the site’s latitude, facing due south. The latitude of Normal, Illinois, is 40.5°.
As you can see in the chart below, the peak generation from this roof is not exactly 40.5°, but is somewhere between 35-36°. According to this “Normal” data, a panel’s pitch can range anywhere from 20° to 50° and still generate more than 97% of its peak potential.

One interesting observation from this chart is that if your solar panels are horizontal (corresponding to the far left of the chart) or 90° vertical (at the far right), your system will still produce a decent amount of electricity. Compared to the maximum output value of 5,623 kWh/year, a flat roof produces 15% less and a vertical wall of solar panels produces 38% less. Not optimal, but not useless.
Keep in mind that horizontal panels on a flat roof will collect dirt. That’s why at least a few degrees of pitch are needed to allow rain to rinse off dust and pollen. A slight angle will also prevent rainwater from settling on the solar panels and leaving a residue as the water evaporates. One study has shown that panels in very dusty environments with infrequent rain resist dust deposition best when angled at around 26%.
Now let’s consider the direction that the roof surface faces. This factor is called the “azimuth” and refers to the direction the roof surface faces relative to the North Pole, which is located at 0°. This makes due south 180°, west 270° and east 90°.
Returning to our completely average city of Normal, Illinois, we’ll keep the system’s roof angle at 40.5° for our calculations.
As you can see in the table, the Normal house facing due south can generate 5,608 kWh. When facing due east, that value falls to 4,350 kWh, a 22% loss. When facing due west, we get a similar result: 4,303 kWh, a 23% loss.
But that’s Normal, Illinois. Generation losses due to azimuth become less pronounced as we approach the equator. For instance, in San Diego, California, (latitude 32.7º) a default system modeled using PV Watts fell from 6,314 kWh to 5,511 kWh. That drop was just under 13%.
In the case of San Diego, elevated land to the east blocks some sun, at least compared to the beautiful open ocean to the west. This means a due south solar system actually, slightly, underperforms in terms of electricity generation. We found that the peak value was somewhere closer to an azimuth of 197-198º.

Other factors will affect your roof’s solar generation, including shadows from trees, neighboring houses, and even your own house’s features. Make sure that your solar contractor accounts for all these factors when giving you a quote and a financial model.
