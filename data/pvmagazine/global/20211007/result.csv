The company, which operates a 1.5 MW factory in Cantú, in the northern Italian province of Como, claims that the tiles can be used to replace conventional roofs, or they can be integrated into existing rooftops. The BIPV products are fabricated with 4 mm, double- laminated safety glass.
“Slides, brackets and drains placed on the back enable an easy and quick installation” GruppoSTG Technical Director Sofia Tiozzo Pezzoli told pv magazine. “The color of the front glass can be chosen depending on the project.”
Tiozzo Pezzoli said that the tiles are produced to integrate the stratification of the safety glass with interposed photovoltaic cells. They are available in three different variants. The TG-EGM45ST tile was conceived for rooftop coatings and is available in black and white versions, as well as a colored variant with power outputs of 245 W, 240 W, and 220 W, respectively, and efficiencies of 16.17%, 15.84%, and 14.52%.
“The third version is available in different colors,” Tiozzo Pezzoli said. The 45-cell monocrystalline product measures 1,010 mm x 1,500 mm x 9 mm and weighs in at 34.5 kg.

A smaller 24-cell version of this variant is the TG-EGM24ST, with power outputs of 135 W, 130 W, and 120 W, respectively, and efficiencies of 17.65%, 17.0%, and 15.69%. Its size is 765 mm x 1,000 mm x 9 mm and it weighs 17.3 kg.
The second variant is the TG-SPL-BA tile, which is designed for solar facades. The 45-cell devices are also available in black, white, and colored versions, with a power of 295 W, 290 W, and 265 W. Efficiencies include 19.54%, 19.21%, and 17.56%. They measure 1,000 mm x 1,510 mm x 9 mm and weigh 34.5 kg. The smaller 24-cell version, the TG-SPL-AA, measures 1,025 mm x 1,000 mm x 9 mm and weighs 23 kg.

The first two products in the series are encapsulated with EVA film and the third one with PVB. All of the products have an operating temperature coefficient of -0.38% per degree Celsius and feature an IP68 enclosure. They all come with 25-year linear power output guarantees and 10-year product guarantees.
“The company is currently investing in more R&D and the commercialization of new BIPV solutions through new strategic partnerships,” Tiozzo Pezzoli said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/07/rwe-signs-deal-with-greek-utility-aiming-for-2-gw-of-coal-mine-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"OCTOBER 7, 2021",RWE signs deal with Greek utility aiming for 2 GW of coal-mine solar,"The RWE Renewables subsidiary of German utility RWE, and its PPC Renewables counterpart of Greece’s Public Power Corporation (PPC) last night agreed to form a joint venture to co-develop renewables projects in Greece.
Under the arrangement, RWE will hold 51% of the joint business, and the PPC the balance.
A press release issued to announce the arrangement stated: “PPC Renewables will contribute nine solar projects [with] up to a combined [generation capacity] total of 940 MW (870 MWac), and which are located in northern Greece’s west Macedonian region, within the boundaries of the former Amyntaio open pit lignite mine.”
The statement added: “RWE Renewables has secured a Greek photovoltaic project pipeline of similar size for the purpose of including it in the joint venture,” without offering further detail of the source of the latter projects. pv magazine has learned, however, the RWE Greek solar projects are part of a portfolio under development by Athens-based public limited company Idea. 
The press release stated the PV projects concerned are in various stages of development, with operations to start from 2023-25.
Speaking to pv magazine in June, an RWE spokesperson chose not to provide further information regarding the policy mechanisms supporting the Greek investment. 
The clean energy arm of the PPC has secured contracts for three solar farms with a total generation capacity of 230 MW in previous rounds of Greece's renewables tenders. All three facilities concern the same western Macedonia site, for which the PPC landed premium top-up payments – on top of the wholesale power price – of €0.04911/kWh for 200 MW of the capacity plus payments of €0.06488 and €0.05382/kWh for the two 15 MW slices of the solar field which make up the balance of the 230 MW power plant.
The RWE-PPC joint venture can be expected to participate in future rounds of the public tenders, which offer successful bidders premium payments under 20-year contracts. With the Greek utility's clean power operation already working on a 50 MW unsubsidized solar farm in southern Greece, there is also the possibility the new business could venture into commercial PPA-driven project development.
The new partnership is set to be another boost for the Greek energy transition, with the government having committed to phase out coal from its electricity generation by 2025 and the PPC aiming to develop 3 GW of solar capacity in the nation's former mining regions.
RWE's renewables unit can inject much-needed capital and technical expertise into the Greek market, and the PPC can offer local knowledge and well established relationships with stakeholders and clients, given the state-owned generator is Greece’s largest and oldest electric utility. PPC Renewables chief executive Konstantinos Mavros, the driving force behind the new partnership, has welcomed RWE to his country adding, the PPC is looking “forward to co-developing projects of unprecedented scale.”
The German clean power developer recently told pv magazine the company’s “first strategic focus is on the development and implementation of solar farms,” before adding: “We always have an eye on developments for energy storage facilities and hybrid projects across all European markets, wherever it makes economic sense, including Greece.” That suggests the initial ex-coal mine ambition could be expanded into other areas of Greece's energy transition.
Katja Wünschel, chief operating officer for onshore wind and solar photovoltaics in Europe and Asia-Pacific for RWE Renewables, has said “European collaborations, like our partnership with [the] PPC, are essential to making the energy transition happen.” Greece also offers the German company the chance to build out a solar portfolio which stretched to 229 MW in operation at the end of last year, with just 56 MW of it in Europe.

Nam-Gyu Park, whose group was the first to report a long-term stable perovskite solar cell, in 2012; and Sang Il Seok, whose group laid the groundwork for higher efficiency perovskite devices, are among the seven winners of the optoelectronic award founded by British industrialist Lord J Arthur Rank, who was head of the Rank film group.
Park, professor of chemical engineering at Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, South Korea; and Seok, whose group presented the first inorganic-organic hybrid perovskite heterojunction solar cell to operate differently from perovskite-sensitized solar cells, were joined in the honor by Michael Graetzel, professor at Switzerland's Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL); Akihiro Kojima, of chemical manufacturer Zeon Corporation; Science Robotics editor Mike Lee; Tsutomu Miyasaka, founder of photoelectric conversion start-up Peccell Technologies and a fellow of the research
center of advanced science and technology at the University of Tokyo; and Henry Snaith FRS, co-founder and chief scientific officer of perovskite solar manufacturer Oxford PV.
Pick up your copy of the October edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
Graetzel, who directs the laboratory of photonics and interfaces at EPFL, pioneered research on energy and electron transfer reactions in mesoscopic systems and their use to generate electricity and fuels from sunlight. His dye-sensitized solar cells led to the advent of perovskite solar cells and the professor was recently ranked top of a Stanford University list of 100,000 leading global scientists.
Kojima studied the optical properties of organic-inorganic layered perovskite compounds in 2004, before receiving a master of engineering in photo-optical engineering from Tokyo Polytechnic University, and undertook research on applying organo-metal halide perovskite compounds to dye-sensitized solar cells as visible light sensitizers from 2005 to 2010, when he received a doctor of philosophy in multidisciplinary sciences from The University of Tokyo, before Joining Peccell Tech.
Lee conducted research at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Intra-European fellow and later completed his doctoral training at the University of Oxford. He was also a co-founding editor of Nature Electronics.
‘Tom' Miyasaka's research specializes in photo-electrochemistry and hybrid photovoltaic cells, especially halide perovskite devices, and his achievements include the Chemical Society of Japan Award, the PVSEC Hamakawa Award and the Clarivate Analytics Citation Honor Award, all in 2017; the Japan Society of Applied Physics Achievement Award, in 2019; and last year's Ichimura Academic Award.
Park's group is now undertaking research on materials and device engineering for high efficiency perovskite solar cells and are developing high-efficiency technology along with long-term stable, large-area processing technologies for commercialization, and Seok and his colleagues hold the world record for the most efficient perovskite solar cell, at 25.5%, as certified by the U.S' National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Snaith discovered perovskites could produce extremely efficient solar cells when integrated into a simple thin-film device which would be easy and cheap to manufacture and his Oxford PV business is working to commercialize perovskite cell production.
The two, biennial Rank Prizes recognize achievements in optoelectronics and nutrition, reflecting the business interests of the philanthropist after whom they are named, who also headed the Hovis food group.

The consortium said it is currently testing the production of panels with a size of 300 mm x 300 mm via a technique based on Rotcool Light Induction Tooling (LIT) technology, which purportedly reduces production times by a factor of four. Roctool said LIT technology consists of a standalone solution to manufacture composites parts.
“It offers a full and accurate control over the parameters amongst which temperatures and pressures – including vacuum through the composite material,” the company said. “Its automation is delivered by a specific control unit, with the ability to connect to previous and next process cells.”
The tool is designed for production projects with difficult requirements involving temperature and pressure controls.
“Proposed as a turnkey solution, the LIT can be seamlessly integrated into current or future production lines,” said Roctool. “Its controls are fully compatible with potential specific automation around the process, and its software can export quality control data in order to optimize the production rate or the product’s performances through designed iterations. CEA noticed the relevance and performance possible thanks to these increasingly innovative and eco–responsible processes.”
CEA-Liten said in a separate press release that “several series of panels are still being tested to verify their performance and mechanical resistance, and aging tests of at least 1,000 hours are also being carried out.” It added that the first module prototypes will be unveiled between the end of this year and the beginning of 2022.
The partners did not reveal any additional technical details about the manufacturing process or the materials that will be used. The research project is part of the asyPOC initiative, which is 100% financed by the authorities in France's Auvergne-Rhône–Alpes region.

India could cut its overall cost of electricity in half and reach net zero before 2050 by developing a 100% renewable energy power system, according to a power system modeling study by Wärtsilä and the Finnish Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology.
The modeling shows that increasing the share of renewable energy in the overall installed power capacity from 25% today to 100% by 2050 could cut the cost of meeting electricity demand by 48%, from INR 6,000 ($81)/MWh in 2020 to INR 3,120/MWh in 2050. This cost, also referred to as overall system cost, includes the levelized cost of electricity generation, the cost of energy storage, transmission interconnections, and the costs of curtailing surplus renewable generation.
Renewables, when paired with flexible generation technologies (thermal balancing power plants and energy storage), can improve the affordability of electricity while ensuring the reliability of system operations, according to the study. 
Power demand in India is expected to increase to 5,921 TWh (with 1,023 GW of peak demand), up 340% from 1,345 TWh in 2020. The modeling confirms that India can affordably meet this increased load through renewable energy, aided by low-cost solar. 
However, the study states the total system capacity must be scaled up to an unprecedented degree to serve this increased load through mid-day peaks and to charge energy storage resources such as batteries to offset intermittent renewable energy generation. It projects that 4,000 GW of installed capacity is needed for a 100% renewable system, a 10-fold increase in the overall power capacity in 2020. Solar would make up 76% (3,076 GW) of this total installed capacity by 2050. This would also be supported by a total wind capacity of around 410 GW by 2050, combined with hydro and carbon-neutral gas.
To achieve the projected solar share, new PV installations must rise by 885%, from 7 GW a year today, to 69 GW a year by 2035, rising to 79 GW a year between 2035 and 2050, according to the study.
Wärtsilä’s modeling shows that flexibility through energy storage is key to achieving the cost-optimal renewable baseload system – to shift generation when it is surplus, during the day, to times when renewables are not available, during evening or the night. Thermal balancing power plants, backed by battery energy storage, must also be deployed to manage sudden surges in demand or drops in renewable generation.
The modeling shows that India would need about 99 TWh of storage capacity and a total of 187 GW of fast-start load-following gas engines by 2050 to provide rapid grid balancing. Storage capacity includes storage in the form of both batteries and gas storage, mainly in the form of sustainable fuels (green hydrogen, and methane, for example). Together, these technologies could form the backbone of a reliable, cost-optimal power system for India.
“Increasing renewable energy could also generate major new revenues from hydrogen production, creating a technology market worth $39.8 billion,” said Wärtsilä and the Finnish Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology.

The US Energy Department’s Sandia National Laboratories has created a global archive of concentrated solar power (CSP) documents, which it is making fully accessible to the public.
Sandia has been studying utility-scale solar power since the 1960’s. Its National Solar Thermal Test facility was commissioned in 1978, spurred by the oil crisis of 1973. Documents detailing the design, construction, and research conducted at the multi-megawatt CSP facility had been shelved in backrooms and basements.
CSP uses large mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver tower to generate electricity. Sandia’s team has spent the last few years cataloging the history of the technology, organizing reports, blueprints, photos, among other items.
“A lot of ‘what if’ questions can be answered if you look at what was documented back in the day,” said Ken Armijo, project lead and CSP researcher at Sandia. 
In addition to tens of thousands of Sandia documents, the lab sourced information from collaborators in Australia, South Africa, Germany, and the U.S. Department of Energy.
Armijo said that successful research projects are often shared widely in the research community through peer-reviewed papers, presentations, and reports, but unsuccessful projects are often be shared more quietly and reluctantly. The knowledge of failures can be lost when a researcher retires, which may lead to the repeat of mistakes by new researchers. The archive aims to serve to address these knowledge gaps.
Some of the projects in the archive include the Solar One, a Sandia-led 10 MW CSP project that delivered power to Barstow, California from 1982 to 1986. It was upgraded in 1995 to the Solar Two, which used a high-temperature molten-salt receiver to store heat and convert it to electricity after the sun set.
Now, the lab has received a $25 million award from the DOE to build a third-generation, particle-based CSP plant with expanded storage capacity. Documents from the archive could inform the construction of the plant.
The archive project is funded by the Department of Energy Solar Technologies Office and was kicked off by Chuck Andraka, a retired Sandia engineer. Sandia said it is interested in creating archives for other renewable energy technologies, as well.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/07/doping-delivers-improved-performance-for-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 7, 2021",Doping delivers improved performance for perovskite solar cells,"From pv magazine Australia
Researchers at the University of Queensland (UQ) have said that advances in nanomaterial technology have allowed them to manufacture perovskite-based solar cells that are as efficient as conventional silicon-based cells, but without the high costs and complex manufacturing processes.
While silicon-based solar cells continue to dominate the market, perovskite solar cells have attracted enormous attention because of their high-efficiency potential and low-cost production. However, the technology still has some drawbacks, including poor long-term stability.
The UQ research team, based at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, have used titanium carbide nanosheets doped with cesium (Cs) to fabricate perovskite solar cells, which they claim deliver a PV efficiency of up to 21.57%, with “excellent thermal stability.”
“Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveal that cesium plays an important role in improving perovskite crystallization and thus leads to enlarged crystal grains, long-lived carrier lifetimes, and reduced charge recombination,” the academics said.
Research team leader Professor Joe Shapter said the results, published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, show that the efficiency and thermal stability of the doped cells significantly outperformed those that were not doped.
“The PSCs that had doped cells showed a remarkable solar conversion efficiency that exceeded 21%,” he said. “This gives us hope that solar energy can continue to develop and improve as one of the most effective renewable and sustainable energy technologies.”
Shapter said the research, which involved scientists from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland and Griffith University in Queensland, addresses an urgent need for alternative energy sources that are capable of providing efficient and reliable energy production.
“Silicon-based solar cells remain the dominant first-generation product making up 90% of the market, but demand was high for cells that could be manufactured without their high prices and complexity,” he said. “Our research contributes to intensive efforts to develop various types of solar cells with the aim of realising efficient, stable and low-cost replacements for present silicon-based technology.”
The findings come with solar module manufacturing giants LONGi Green Energy, JinkoSolar, Trina Solar, JA Solar and Risen Energy warning that rising material costs – including the price of polysilicon, which is used in an estimated 98% of solar PV cells – could trigger a solar panel shortage.
In an open letter published earlier this week, the Chinese-based manufacturers said their output is expected to fall as rising costs, an ongoing shipping “crisis”  and government-imposed restrictions take a toll on the supply chain.
The Chinese government has ordered silicon metal refineries in the country to cut output to about 70% amid a power crisis.
“The raw material supply gap is serious,” the companies said in the statement. “This imbalance will break the supply chain and seriously endanger the healthy and sustainable development of the industry. Prices are also soaring.”
The manufacturers said the price of solar-grade polysilicon has surged in recent weeks by 9.1%, while the price of solar glass has also climbed, up 18.2% year on year. There has also been a 35% increase in the cost of adhesive films used in the production of modules.
The manufacturers said the capacity shortage will make it difficult for customers to meet installation targets, warning that many signed orders will be lost.
“The … industry has been caught in a difficult situation,” they said.
The companies said they are actively coordinating resources and making every effort to “stabilize supply,” but they implored customers to considering postponing projects and to avoid the end-of-year “rush to install.”

A Vermeer? A Delacroix? No, it's actually Bisol's Supreme Monocrystalline PV Module BDO 360-365 Wp, writes Blake Matich. Ana Gorinšek, Bisol Group's head of marketing, said the inspiration behind the module's presentation at Intersolar 2021 is the sense of craftsmanship the company has for the PV canvas, from which it guarantees 100% power output for 25 years with a 0% effective degradation rate.
It may not be as eye-catching as a Vermeer, but it's just as obsessed with sunlight.
Hangzhou-based inverter maker Solax is expanding its product range with the addition of utility scale string devices. At the Solax booth, pv magazine met Luan Kuqi and other members of the team.
Kuqi is heading the company’s European expansion and is seeking after-sales specialists to drive further growth, as finding qualified staff is increasingly becoming a challenge for solar companies.
Huawei is launching its latest product for the utility-scale sector. With the application of 210 mm high-current PV modules, the string current will reach 20A, and conventional inverters generally face DC current limitations.
The latest Huawei Smart PV Controller SUN2000-215KTL-H3, therefore, supports the maximum MPPT current which is 100A and can connect up to 5 strings. So it can effectively solve the problem of DC current limitation.
Come check it out at booth B5.510!
K2 Systems has its first flat-mounted PV product coming out in December, and Middle East and North Africa regional sales manager Mohamed Abdelzaher walked pv magazine‘s Tristan Rayner through the company's new, all-aluminum Dome 6.0 system.
Designed for high wind loads and equatorial-adjacent regions, and reportedly offering savings of around 10% over the fixed tilt range by K2, the Dome 6.0 can lie completely flat or be tilted up to 10 degrees, in portrait or landscape orientation, and be either fixed or ballasted.
Abdelzaher said he expects the product to be a best seller in his region where, on the Gulf Coast, winds of up to 180kph can occur.
As more and more EVs hit the roads, there will be more electric vehicle batteries available for sustainable reuse, writes Blake Matich. Spanish second life EV battery company BeePlanet Factory is doing just that, taking used EV devices from its partners Nissan and Mercedes-Benz, and giving them a second life in PV, wind and off-grid power installations.
In the residential sector, second-life, 5-10 kWh batteries remain highly efficient, according to BeePlanet Factory product engineer Alfonso Urrizburu, who said the same was true of the 40 kWh-1 MWh range used for commercial and industrial applications. Until now, the reused batteries have been stored in cabinets produced by Rittal (see the photo above) and deployed in France and Spain, but Urrizburu says the company plans to expand its distribution next year and produce its own range of high-density batteries, enabling more of the Rittal battery cupboards to be racked in a container.
When it comes to the (relatively small) fire hazard of lithium-ion batteries, of course, there is even more research needed into device reuse, however Urrizburu says that though “it may be counter-intuitive, the batteries are actually safer than stationary ones,” pointing to the record of automotive batteries already on the market.
The off-grid uses of reused batteries are another boon. Urrizburu highlighted Spanish power company Iberdrola's use of BeePlanet's second-life devices for fast-charging systems in grid dead spots, such as on the highway between Madrid and Valencia.
Here's another pro show tip, this time from our own Blake Matich: In Halle A6, beware the angry-looking giant husky.
The dog's owner, Aionrise, a U.S. company that manufactures solar modules in the Caucasian state of Georgia, has trained the Sherlockian-proportioned hound to pose for photos with visitors to Intersolar 2021, including myself and fellow pv magazine editor Tristan Rayner.
Italian equipment supplier Ecoprogetti’s booth has been packed to the rafters for the whole show but our Mark Hutchins somehow managed to corner marketing manager Michele Caddeo today. (He's a tenacious one, that Mark, like a dog with a bone, as Michele could probably testify.)
Here's what Mark had to report: “Michele told me business is good, with many customers requiring entire new solar production lines to be able to process new and enlarged wafer formats.
“The latest tools for production on show at the Ecoprogetti booth include a combined cell cutter and stringer – cutting a whole step out of module production; and an automated system for junction box potting – which is one of the final production steps to still be carried out manually, at least until Ecoprogetti came along.”
Mingling with attendees at Intersolar can bring unexpected insights, as Tristan Rayner has discovered. Naturally, some curious attendees are looking to see the cutting edge of new developments for their own homes. Other professionals, such as large solar developers are exploring options, and there are also those spotted by pv magazine minutely inspecting, and photographing, what the competition has to offer.
One surprise conversation Tristan had was with a Polish developer looking to more or less immediately source modules, on a “very short timeframe.” Why? Because Chinese supply is constrained or simply unavailable, and European manufacturers aren't keeping up: There is huge demand and material delays.
Frank Tafani and Christy Glykol, sales managers at French solar manufacturer Recom, suggested their 750 MW panel production capacity is dealing with the situation despite the challenges. Normal delivery timeframes are being extended by two months or more, and the ability to provide accurate pricing and availability is difficult, with every day presenting new difficulties. Recom hopes a new facility due online in the first half of next year will supply larger, 550 W modules.
Over at Spanish manufacturer Eurener, sales director Pasquale Zazo said he’s never had more interest in modules, with last year's 200-220 MW of production sure to be exceeded this year, despite shortages of some key materials. Production has been increased where possible, Pasquale said, although delivery timeframes have extended from a normal 2-4 weeks out to 6-7 weeks, as the crunch continues.
There was better news at heterojunction panel supplier Hevel. Anton Usachev, deputy CEO for corporate communications at the Russian company, said Hevel is experiencing no delays and capacity can match demand. The smaller percentage of the market held by HJT – compared to PERC products – is not experiencing the issues of the wider industry, he said.
Pictured on the right is a happy, proud Martin Moldenhauer, procurement officer at ccc-wallbox, writes Marian Willuhn.
On the left is the reason he's beaming so broadly. Ccc-wallbox has enclosed its EV charger not in nasty plastic, but in a special natural fiber, flax, and natural resin mix. The casing is produced in a carbon-neutral manner and is said to pose no harm to the environment. There is no plastic inside the charger, either, as a smiling Moldenhauer explained.
“We don’t go electric because we hate the V8,” he said, “but because we want to become sustainable. To do that, we must think of the materials we are using.”
That attitude gets a huge thumbs-up from pv magazine‘s UP Initiative.
pv magazine publisher Eckhart Gouras, right, welcomed Pranav Mehta to the our booth at Intersolar Europe today.
Pranav is chairman of the National Solar Energy Federation of India, a key industry body aiming to advance solar energy in the nation.
As a key spokesperson for Indian solar, Pranav spoke about the strategic importance to the country of a vibrant PV manufacturing market and, as the nation emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, said we can expect important developments on the PV production front.
Blake Matich brings us this culinary delight.
Due to the flammability of lithium-ion and the need for longer-duration storage, alternatives and complementary battery energy storage systems are a hot topic and this is particularly true when it comes to stationary storage. The lightweight advantage of lithium-ion makes it ideal for EVs, and the sooner large scale stationary storage alternatives become available at scale, the more critical raw materials required for lith-ion batteries can be used to transition the transport sector.
Enter Swedish battery storage manufacturer Nilar. Of particular interest is the company's Hydride battery which, despite its bi-polar design, is far more stable … than manic.
As Nilar application engineer Alexander Klasson told me, the nickel plates are “laid horizontally on top of each other, like the layers of a lasagne … so instead of cables, the current goes through the entire pack.” In effect, the whole stack is the cable.
What is really interesting, is the stability and sustainability of the device. Unlike lithium-ion, Hydride batteries are not flammable, thanks to their water-based electrolyte. Klasson said the Research Institutes of Sweden tested the system by putting packs inside a chamber and setting them on fire.
What is more, Klasson spoke of a new technological feature: gas chamber holes which run through the layered cell plates. “The electrolyte dries as it ages and degrades,” he explained, “leaving excess hydrogen behind.” The gas chamber holes allow an oxygen hose to be attached which “restores the battery by creating a whole new water electrolyte,” refreshing 120 cells at once.
The battery, set for release next year, is slightly too heavy for EV application but seems a promising alternative to lithium-ion.
Chinese solar manufacturer Jolywood is already the market leader for n-type panels, currently operating around 3 GW of cell and module capacity, and expecting to reach beyond 4 GW by the end of the year, writes Mark Hutchins.
And with other PV manufacturing giants launching n-type products this year, Jolywood is scaling up to ensure it keeps its place at the top table: European sales director Cathy Huang this morning discussed plans to bring a massive 16 GW of new cell and module capacity online, in two phases over the next couple of years.
The bulk of the new fabs will be in China, but Jolywood is also building out new production capacity in Indonesia, to meet demand there and in the U.S.
Like many on the show floor this year, the company has been hit by rising prices across its supply chain, and expects them to remain an issue indefinitely – with high shipping prices a particular concern. Those issues will affect module suppliers regardless of technology, said the manufacturer, however Jolywood estimates prices for its n-type TOPCon modules will add up to just €0.02/W above those of mainstream PERC modules – and it expects to achieve significant savings by reaching its ambitious new production scale alone, with more savings and improvements planned for the new lines as well.
Our Marian Willuhn has headed over into an adjacent hall at Intersolar and found it looks more like a motor show.
A surprising amount of cars fills the B6 hall, writes Marian. Though the crowds have come to see solar panels and batteries, the display of shiny new EVs is attracting a lot of interest. And who can blame them, as there are lots of fancy innovations mustered.
Charging point manufacturer Alfen offers lots of flexibility and says its products be used with any “back office,” by utilities and system integrators.
Flexibility is also on offer at Smappee, where grid operators can adapt charging power according to their needs. At home, the Smappee system could help homeowners use as much of their own solar power as possible.
And if charging needs to be fast and more than grid friendly, Huber+Suhner have a solution. The company improves charging cables with a cooling agent and, without its tinkering, charging at 500 A for long periods could lead to a painful surprise when disconnecting the cable.
The shortages which have delayed solar installation in Europe are set to continue for the rest of the year, according to two representatives of analyst IHS Markit at Intersolar, whose names will be familiar to pv magazine readers.
pv mag print chief Jonathan Gifford quizzed IHS executive director of clean energy technology, Edurne Zoco, and associate director Cormac Gilligan, about the prospects for European solar. The responses were none too encouraging.
“The issues are lower utilization rates, strong demand, and the high cost of inputs,” said Zoco. “This combination is what is making prices quite volatile.”
Her colleague added: “At the same time, there is no certainty about how long these restrictions will last, whether just for Q4 or into 2022.”
The low utilization rates mentioned, in China, are linked to reduced electricity supply, as directed by the authorities, with some industries in badly-affected provinces having been forced to reduce output by up to 90% in September, compared to their August figures. In the solar world, polysilicon and glass makers have been among the segments hit by such restrictions.
“In Q4, a large proportion of [module] production is allocated for China, and will absorb much of this constrained supply of modules,” added Zoco. “Therefore, the availability of modules outside of China could be restrained.”
With solar manufacturers keen to show off their new products, Michael Fuhs dropped by the Longi Solar booth, where technical service manager Vitor Rodriguez showed off the company's new Hi-Mo N panel.
The n-type TOPCon module offers one per cent more absolute efficiency than its p-type PERC predecessor, Rodriguez said, adding the panel features “a new cell technology.”
The Longi rep said first-year degradation has been reduced to a, guaranteed, less than 1%, as compared with 2% for the p-type version.
Even with an added cost that is likely to come in at around €0.02/W for the shiny new model, throw in the raised efficiency and that still means a strong business case for utility scale solar farms, according to Rodriguez, especially with reduced balance-of-system costs.
The Longi agent confidently predicted the n-type module will be available next year. Whether that will hold true in the face of the current electricity shortages across Chinese factories remains to be seen.

The solar conference is back and so is the marketing, points out Tristan Rayner, who can't seem to break his apparent fascination with what might be termed ‘the rear side' of the solar business.
Everyone is trying to conjure up a memorable tagline and German business Premium Mounting Technologies is no different, says Tristan.
The image above speaks for itself and pv magazine feels a double salute is due to the company's marketing department. Not only did its creative geniuses hit upon the idea of sponsoring the loos, they also avoided the temptation of indulging in far less savory wordplay about the company's initials, or anything to do with mounting. Sadly, pv mag‘s blog editorial staff has no such scruples.
Somebody sensible, please drag us up out of the gutter.
Critical raw materials were the focus of a virtual presentation this morning at Intersolar, given by Deborah Jones, director of research at the French National Scientific Research Council at the Charles Gerhardt Institute for Molecular Chemistry and Materials, in Montpellier.
As part of Intersolar 2021's Green Hydrogen Forum, Jones spoke about “Science supporting the path to sustainability,” with a particular focus on the materials needed for fuel cells and hydrogen technologies – such as electrolyzers and other components used for green hydrogen production.
“Recycle, reduce, replace equals sustainability” said Jones, who discussed research into replacing rare elements such as iridium and platinum, and the pivotal need for more studies, writes Blake Matich. Iron, for instance, is a great substitute for platinum in cathodes but nevertheless, “the only way to stabilize iron-based cathodes is a small amount of platinum.”
Other issues, such as the persistence of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the environment – such as those used by PEM electrolyzers – is a serious “future sustainability consideration,” said the speaker, especially as “hydrocarbon ionomer alternatives have not yet proved sufficiently close to the properties of PFAS.”
“We should restart and regain the research into alternatives, such as novel hydrocarbon ionomers,” added Jones, who said she was confident science can find ways to make the materials required for the energy transition, sustainable.
We popped over to the Huawei booth just before the lights came down on day one of the show yesterday, to say thanks for sponsoring this here blog, and our correspondent Cornelia Lichner was given a tour of the company's new inverter offering.
At a popular booth, Hariram Subramanian, chief technology officer of the Huawei development center in Nuremberg, showed us the latest features of the company's large scale solar devices. The new 215KTL H3 inverter can be used for large PV modules with power outputs ranging from 500 to 800 W. It has four MPP trackers, to which up to 19 strings can be connected.
The model anticipates a development that transmission system operators are increasingly concerned about. As more and more conventional power station rotating masses disappear, the network loses stability. Together with storage systems, however, inverters can replace those masses. The new inverter from Huawei not only outputs a clean sine curve, it can also actively dampen resonances in the harmonics, and thus influence the grid. Together with a storage system such as Huawei's new Luna 2000 2.0 MW, which has a capacity of 2,000 kWh, the inverter can create and shape the grid and thus be an anchor in the event of disruption, providing grid companies define the way such systems could help, that is. A short circuit ratio of 1.2 is an important indicator for this, added Subramanian. A new type of DC circuit breaker in the Huawei device also prevents the power plant causing network disturbance.
In another piece of good news, the new inverters are said to be saving expense by offering higher power density, and that cost saving will not be eaten by price increases, Subramanian said. And all the components on show at Intersolar are readily available despite the shortages which have dogged other manufacturers of late.
You can never accuse pv magazine of failing to dig down into the real issues of the day to come up with the solid gold information you and your business need – and our boy Tristan Rayner has come up with the goods again.
Tristan has spotted, for those of you arriving at the Messe West metro station for today's show, that there's a free bus – the number 99 – which offers a shuttle service to the trade show entrance at Messe Ost.
Plus, and please keep this info under your hat, there's a hot rumor doing the rounds that you can sneak into Intersolar using the southern entrance to the venue, providing you already have your show pass.
Intrepid pv magazine newshound Tristan Rayner is in the … No, wait, let me rephrase that. Erm… okay, I'll just let Tristan explain:
One of the emerging topics at Intersolar this year is floating PV. While strongly present in Asia, and with progress in the U.K. and the Netherlands, Germany's floating PV is being described as still in “kinderschule.” So said Peter Kroger, at Prymian Group, which provides cables for the solar market, including for floating PV, with Peter wisely noting: “Water and energy are a difficult mix.”
Frank Czernie, from TUV Rheinland, explained the industry has more than one problem with water: Component failures are increasing – from cables to connectors – especially in the hard, acidic waters of old mine sites, for example.
Yet another problem is soiling; bird life in water is rich, varied, and very capable of “covering” a floating panel. Cleaning is a great deal harder than it is on land.
German solar module cleaning companies are still in the test phase and Hycleaner CEO Andreas Grochowiak said he has a solution he's tested in Bilbao, using the battery-powered ‘Black Solar Facelift,' with more testing to come.
Over at solar cleaning company Helios PV, managing director Hermann Staudinger said his company would be having a first test to clean floating PV with its ‘Agile' cleaner, another battery powered device, with partner Zimmerman helping provide a test as soon as this month.
More experienced is Pol Duthoit, co-founder of Solarcleano, who cleaned his first floating PV installation to the west of London back in 2018. Duthoit says the industry has a long way to go: it may only take an hour for someone to learn how to operate a robot cleaner on a solar park on land, but learning how to clean floating PV panels can take “months and months,” with the battery-powered SolarCleano F1 the machine of choice, of course.
Why? It’s all in the float. It’s too easy to miss a spot while the panels bob up and down on the water. Duthoit noted one system from French floating PV manufacturer Ciel et Terre was particularly difficult to treat, with its floats moving more than others, from Baywa re, for example.
And there's time for just one more insight: Cleaning floating modules is around 30-40% slower than fixed panels, partly due to just how much soiling (read, poop) is present on the panels. “Sometimes you can’t even see the color of the panels due to the amount of white residue,” was how Duthoit put it, somewhat politely.
pv magazine‘s Michael Fuhs managed to battle through the crowd surrounding German developer Baywa re's booth to chat to Friedhelm Enslin, head of sales for the exhibitor's installer business.
Friedhelm said the cost of even home solar panels has risen €0.05-0.08 per Watt over the last year, thanks to well-documented supply chain issues and a rising polysilicon price.
That adds to the difficulty for installers, who can face a nervous wait between quoting for a home solar job and taking receipt of the panels, not to mention begging the question: ‘How far can prices rises until solar becomes too expensive for business clients?'
The good news is that Baywa at least still has modules for customers, unlike some other engineering, procurement and construction businesses, although Friedhelm pointed out, component shortages are also affecting solar system parts such as energy meters and storage systems, which means customers of the German business may have to prepare for a three to four-month wait for the most in-demand items.
Baywa, the sales rep said, is doing its utmost to shoulder the burden so its customers don't have to."
https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/07/sunpower-buys-us-solar-system-provider-for-165-million/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"OCTOBER 7, 2021",SunPower buys US solar system provider for $165 million,"From pv magazine USA
SunPower Corp. said it will double down on its residential business and will weigh options for its Commercial & Industrial Solutions business, including new ownership.
As part of its focus on residential, the company acquired residential solar provider Blue Raven Solar for up to $165 million in cash. The move is intended to help SunPower expand in the Northwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.
Under terms of the deal, Blue Raven CEO Ben Peterson will join SunPower’s executive team, and the company expects to build on Blue Raven’s current employee and contractor relationships.
Blue Raven was founded in 2014 and, according to a statement, has achieved 93% revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) with a direct-to-consumer sales and installation model. Blue Raven currently books more than 90% of its volume in 14 states. Those states account for around 5% of SunPower’s sales. SunPower said this creates “a significant net-new geographic coverage opportunity.”
SunPower said it plans to combine its products and digital marketing tools with Blue Raven’s direct sales model to accelerate its growth strategy. In addition, SunPower said it expects that Blue Raven’s volume will help expand its financial products and “significantly” increase its 2022 loan volume.
The acquisition highlights SunPower’s focus on growing its residential and light commercial business. It said it is exploring options for its Commercial & Industrial Solutions business including new ownership.
It said the realignment would optimize capital deployment for residential and light commercial and enable Commercial & Industrial Solutions “to better take advantage” of community solar, front-of-meter storage, and “infrastructure legislation tailwinds.”
