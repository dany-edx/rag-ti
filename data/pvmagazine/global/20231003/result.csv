The alternatives offer comparable or superior performance at a significantly lower cost, according to the Chicago-based company. It achieved this by evaluating “millions of combinations” of different elements for their suitability in industrial applications.
Hystar has unveiled plans for a fully automated 4 GW electrolyzer factory set to be delivered in Høvik, Norway, by 2025, with construction commencing in early 2024. The company is also expanding its operations to North America, with a new location scheduled for 2024 and a multi-gigawatt factory scheduled for 2027. It is starting the hiring process for its North American headquarters as part of this expansion. In addition, the PEM electrolyzer specialist is in talks with key stakeholders in the United States and Canada to establish its first gigawatt factory on the continent, with ambitions to surpass its European plans within the decade.
Air Liquide and Trillium Energy Solutions have agreed to collaborate in the US heavy-duty hydrogen fueling market. They will focus on hydrogen supply and refueling infrastructure to accelerate the heavy-duty hydrogen transportation ecosystem. The partnership's initial phase involves deploying hydrogen stations along a strategically significant trucking route.
Daimler Truck says that a public road-approved prototype of the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck covered 1,047 km with one fill of liquid hydrogen. The test “has successfully demonstrated that hydrogen fuel-cell technology can be the right solution to decarbonize flexible and demanding long-haul road transportation.” The truck completed the run fully loaded, with a gross combined vehicle weight of 40 tons under real-life conditions. Ahead of the run, cryogenic liquid hydrogen at minus 253 degrees Celsius was filled into two 40 kg tanks mounted on either side of the truck chassis.
InterContinental Energy has secured $115 million in equity investment from GIC and Hy24, a clean hydrogen investor. This funds will expedite the deployment of InterContinental Energy’s portfolio of projects and support the company's vision to scale up the green hydrogen economy and drive large-scale market adoption of green fuels. InterContinental Energy is actively developing a portfolio of green hydrogen projects in Australia and the Middle East, strategically located in coastal deserts.

Heineken Spain and Engie España have inaugurated a 30 MW solar thermal plant in Seville, Spain. The project boasts a storage capacity of 68 MWh and is purportedly Europe's largest industrial CSP facility.
The venture required a €21 million ($21.9 million) investment, co-financed with FEDER funds and managed by the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE). Spanning 8 hectares, the plant is poised to slash the brewery's factory fossil gas consumption by more than 60%.
The solar thermal plant involves the integration of thermodynamic concepts and CSP technology in an industrial facility. This effectively doubles the production capacity of superheated water for industrial use, enhancing energy reliability and availability. It also uses water as a heat transfer medium, eliminating the need for synthetic oils that could pose environmental risks.
The plant's construction extended beyond initial projections, taking 12 months to complete – nearly twice the originally estimated time frame, according to Engie.
Heineken and Engie's partnership operates under a Thermal Purchase Agreement (TPA) framework. Heineken assumes responsibility for energy consumption and provides the land, while Engie commits to delivering fully renewable energy at a predetermined rate. Upon the agreement's 20-year term expiration, ownership of the solar thermal plant will transfer to Heineken.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/03/the-race-for-100-solar/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,CHILE,CHINA,DENMARK,EL SALVADOR,GERMANY,GREECE,INDIA,JORDAN,NETHERLANDS,PORTUGAL,SOUTH KOREA,SPAIN,TAIWAN,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 3, 2023",The race for 100% solar,"The perennial top three countries – China, the United States, and India – continue to account for some two-thirds of global utility scale solar generation capacity. Look beyond those simple totals, however, and you find some impressive relative results by many of those countries in the remaining one-third.
Wiki-Solar
From Wiki-Solar’s comprehensive database of more than 22,000 utility scale solar projects around the world, it is possible to derive a wide range of comparators, including site performance ratios, average yield, and land utilization. This article looks at national achievements and rates of progress.
Firstly, we have assessed the nominal annual output of the large solar capacity in each country and compared it with national electricity consumption. On that basis, five countries now meet more than 10% of their electric power demand from utility scale solar. Most of these figures would be significantly higher if rooftop and other small scale solar arrays were factored in.

Chile tops the list, thanks in part to its exceptional yield from so many high-altitude desert sites. El Salvador and Jordan feature strongly, with solar contributing substantially to their more modest electricity demand. Spain carries the banner for Europe while Australia has progressed strongly after a slow start.
The UAE owes much of its elevated position to a single huge project, the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. India may be only number three, in terms of total generation capacity, but leads the United States and China in relative terms, with 8.6% of its electricity from utility scale solar, and 13.2% from overall solar capacity.
An extended list which shows most of the countries with significant utility scale solar capacity is available on the Wiki-Solar website. There you will find Germany, with 3.2% of its electricity demand met by big solar, a few places above China, which sits at number 29, with 2.6%
The rate of progress is another key indicator. We have evaluated this by looking at the change over the five-year period from 2017 to last year.
For comparison, we have extended this rate forward until utility scale solar would meet 100% of electricity demand. This is, of course, a theoretical exercise. No nation would, in practice, generate all of its power this way and neither the growth of solar nor the trend in electricity consumption will continue as a straight line. The results of the exercise are, nonetheless, illuminating.

Chile again tops the list and would need just 25 years to achieve that notional 100% utility scale solar coverage. Spain has seen outstanding renewed growth in recent years, taking it to number two on this list, with El Salvador and Jordan not far behind. In theory, the top ten countries for solar progress would all reach 100% solar, from utility-scale alone, before the end of the century.
Again, the full list is available online and features a strong European contingent – Portugal, Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark – just outside the top ten. Some countries where recent progress in utility scale solar has been slow would need several centuries to reach 100%, by this measure.
The large solar power stations we are considering here are not, of course, for individuals or households. Another measure of comparative achievement is relative solar generation capacity per person.

Inevitably this is quite similar to the first table above but this time the UAE and Australia leapfrog Chile. The United States has a much higher ranking in this table because its power consumption per capita – from all generation sources – is substantially higher than most other nations. Again, the full table is available online.
Wiki-Solar has accurate site footprints for the majority of utility scale plants, enabling us to assess the land area typically used for big solar sites in different parts of the world. When this number is related to the land area of each country, it is no surprise to find that land usage is seldom an issue.

The most that any country currently devotes to utility scale solar is just over one tenth of 1%. Only two, relatively small and energy intensive countries – Taiwan and South Korea – would need to allocate more than 3% of their land for PV, even to achieve the theoretical 100% solar paradigm.
The full list shows the United States down among the countries that would need to devote around 0.5% of total surface area for 100% solar. The use of building-mounted systems and the growth of agrivoltaics, of course, means that the land allocated can also be productive for other purposes.
The expression “nominal output” refers to the design or expected annual output of solar power stations. Actual output in practice will vary with solar radiation and other climatic and site factors, such as grid constraints.
The 100% solar paradigm is used for illustrative and comparative purposes. A 100% renewables scenario featuring wind, hydro, and biomass alongside solar is more realistic.
National power consumption figures are mainly taken from French data company Enerdata and the International Energy Agency; population data is mainly taken from the United Nations. Utility scale solar figures come from the Wiki-Solar database. For consistency, generation capacity is quoted in MW/TW (AC) to enable direct comparison between PV and concentrating solar power plants and other forms of generation.

The system consists of an overhead installation equipped with glass PV modules composed of multiple PV cells interspersed within them, which the researchers said ensure a high level of transparency. The modules have a tilt angle of 30 degrees, are south-oriented and are installed on an elevated canopy situated 4 m above olive trees with an average height of 2 m.
The olive grove features a high planting density with a distance of 3.5 m between rows of trees and 1.5 m between individual trees. The panels are installed with a row spacing of 1.7 m to prevent shading. “This particular design allows the harvesting machine, which can have a maximum height of 3.5 m height, to pass over the olive trees,” the academics explained.
The scientists said the system must ensure high levels of transparency in order to avoid a negative impact on the olive yield. “Transparency, in this context, refers to the proportionate area of the module that is unoccupied by PV cells,” they explained. “This value is then multiplied by the optical transmittance of the glass to calculate the overall transparency of the module.”
Through a series of simulations, the research team assessed the transparency levels of the system for three different olive cultivars and nine representative olive cultivation locations. It considered indicators such as PV capacity, energy generation, avoided CO2 emissions and job creation.
The analysis showed that the transparency levels vary between 0.57 and 0.71, and that the lowest values can be observed in locations with higher solar radiation such as Egypt and Tunisia.
“Optimizing the model by considering only the months corresponding to the olive growth cycle can reduce the required transparency, thereby increasing the installed PV capacity by up to 3.5%,” the academics added, noting that in those locations where the incident solar radiation in winter is lower, the transparency decreases more compared to the annual average and to other sites with a more uniform radiation distribution throughout the year, such as Egypt or Morocco.
They presented the system in the study “Potential of agrivoltaics systems into olive groves in the Mediterranean region,” published in Applied Energy.
“Future works should assess the impact of suppressing ultraviolet (UV) light on olive growth when PV modules are installed above olive trees, as the glass encapsulant absorbs this specific portion of the solar spectrum,” they concluded.

After construction began in June 2021, the 204 MW (DC) Edenvale Solar Park celebrated reaching its rated power output late last week. Japanese oil giant Eneos and trading company Sojitz each own a 50% stake in the Edenvale solar project, which will supply a portion of its energy to Queensland’s Gregory Crinum coking coal mine, owned an operated by Sojitz.
The Edendale Solar Park sits on approximately 428 hectares near Chinchilla, west of Brisbane. The project has deployed roughly 400,000 solar panels and was constructed by Spanish-headquartered Gransolar, which is believed to also hold its operation and maintenance contract.
In the joint Eneos and Sojitz announcement, the pair said that “Edenvale represents the largest solar project in Australia to be undertaken by Japanese companies.”
Back in 2021, when construction on the project began, the partners said Edenvale would sell 70% of its output to “a local electricity retailer at a fixed price” while the remaining 30% would be supplied to Sojitz’ nearby Gregory Crinum coal mine. In the latest release, the numbers are not so definite, with the announcement simply saying “a portion of the energy produced” would go to Gregory Crinum coal mine. Sojitz has had a long involvement with Queensland’s mining industry.
The project marks Eneos’ first solar project in Australia, and earlier this year the company opened a green hydrogen demonstration plant at Bulwer Island in Brisbane. The scale of the project is relatively small, producing just 20 kilograms of green hydrogen a day, but it is part of Eneos’ broader strategy to establish a green hydrogen supply chain in Australia and eventually begin exporting to Japan.
“To establish the supply chain, Eneos continues to gain expertise in renewable energy development in Australia,” the company said, pointing back to Edendale as part of this approach.
Edendale was initially developed by Singapore-based DPI Solar 3, but DPI’s stake was bought by Eneos in 2021 via its joint venture holding company with Sojitz, Sapphire Energy Pty Ltd.
Edendale is connected the transmission grid via Powerlink’s existing Orana substation within the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone.

The model is based on a reinforcement learning algorithm and is claimed to be particularly suitable with limited accumulated data.
“Reinforcement learning is an algorithm that independently maximizes rewards through trial-and-error within a given environment,” the academics explained. “This is the first attempt to use a reinforcement learning for solar irradiance prediction model.”
In the study “Solar irradiance prediction using reinforcement learning pre-trained with limited historical data,” published in Energy Reports, the researchers explained that the learning data was set for the first two weeks of the year, while the prediction period was set for the remaining part of the year.
As inputs for those two weeks, the scientists used real data from Cape Town, South Africa, based on four metrics – sky cover, temperature, humidity, and out-of-atmosphere solar irradiance. They then compared the analysis made by the model with that of two reference models based on long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.
“The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning,” the research group added. “It introduces a memory cell state to the RNN. The memory cell state demonstrates superior performance in managing long sequence inputs.”
On a monthly average, the researchers found that the proposed model had a prediction error 0f 31.5 W/m2, which represented a 7% variation from the actual data. In comparison, the two LSTM models used in the experiment showed an average error of 57.4 W/m2 or 12.8% and of 40.5 W/m2 or 9.2%, respectively.
Furthermore, the researchers ascertained that, with the proposed model, approximately 82.8% of the points were distributed within 10% of the upper and lower errors of the actual results. With the two LSTM models, these values decreased to 71.9% and 78.8%, respectively.
“The proposed model displayed more optimized performance with only two weeks of learning data when compared to previous studies which typically required several years’ worth of weather data for learning,” the researchers concluded. “In particular, the long-term performance of the model was improved by learning the out-of-atmosphere solar irradiance as an input.”

Toledo Solar Inc. (TSI) has reached a settlement in a lawsuit brought by First Solar in May.
First Solar initially filed a lawsuit against Toledo Solar, a thin-film solar module manufacturer, which, according to court filing  sold Malayasian-made First Solar modules under the Toledo name, claiming they were made in America.
First Solar stated that Toledo falsely claimed that it manufactured the solar modules that Toledo had provided for installation on the Ohio Governor’s mansion in Columbus, that Toledo falsely represent that the modules were made by Toledo in Ohio, and that Toledo advertised on social media that it manufactured certain solar modules in Ohio.
Details of the settlement are confidential; however, Toledo Solar announced a new investor-led independent board of directors and leadership team. The company said the change is to “re-affirm Toledo Solar’s commitment to US energy security by manufacturing high-quality American-made CdTe solar panels in Ohio for the residential, commercial, and industrial markets.”
Lead investor Sean Fontenot is the board’s new chairman. He noted that First Solar’s lawsuit came as a surprise.
“The recent First Solar complaint was a very concerning surprise. We are finalizing gathering all of the facts around this and expect to resolve the matter shortly. From our perspective, First Solar and Toledo Solar are critical partners in several critical industry programs that are important to the Government’s US Energy Security policies for American-made solar products, and we are re-dedicating our commitment to making sure this continues.”
Tom Pratt has been appointed interim president, treasurer, and secretary by Toledo Solar’s board of directors.
“I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with the Board of Directors for Toledo Solar and the impressive team, both technical and administrative, that is working hard to bring Toledo Solar’s innovative products to market,” said Pratt.

Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE), Italy's energy agency, has allocated 58 MW of renewable energy capacity in the country's 12th renewable energy auction, for projects above 1 MW in size.
The GSE awarded 48 MW of solar capacity across seven locations and one wind project with a capacity of 10 MW MW. The PV projects range in size from 3.5 MW to 9.9 MW.
The developers offered a maximum discount ranging from 2% to 2.1% from the auction ceiling price of €0.065 ($0.068)/kWh. The lowest bid came in at €0.0636/kWh and was offered for a 9.7 MW solar facility in the province of Campobasso, southern Italy.
The bids were slightly higher or equal to those in the 11th renewable energy auction and all other previous actions.

IM is a manufacturing technique for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mold and has the ability, according to the research group, to enable the development of in-mold plastic solar cells with improved performance and stability.
“Due to their very thin layout, flexible solar cells can be sensitive to mechanical abrasiveness and, therefore, might require additional protection and integration strategies,” the research group explained. “Embedding a printed solar module into a plastic part simplifies integration challenges, while providing additional mechanical protection, shape adaptability, and streamlined contacts for connections.”
The researchers first created modules in roll-to-roll printing, using a photoactive blend known as P3HT:O-IDTBR. This blend was chosen due to its morphological and thermal stability, which are relevant to the later injection molding process.
“OPV product development demands photovoltaic materials with high morphological stability under thermal stress, such as the P3HT:O-IDTBR blend,” the academics emphasize. “In that respect, higher performing materials with such stability are urgently needed.”

The scientists inserted the modules horizontally into an injection mold of polyether copolymer-based thermoplastic polyurethane. This material was chosen due to its low process temperature, broad substrate compatibility, and flexibility. The injection was done using a 120 mm × 120 mm × 2 mm cavity insert, at a 90 mm −1s speed.
“From the selection of 64 roll-to-roll printed modules, 32 of them were injected, and the other 32 modules were kept as references,” the researchers explained. “On average, the IM-OPV modules retained 98.1 of the original performance. Only 2 samples failed, and 28 samples preserved over 90% of the original performance, which sets the yield of the IM process close to 90%.”
As for mechanical and operational stability, the scientists found an average of more than 35% increase in the maximum stress point in the IM-OPV samples. The first fracture on the control devices occurred at 10–30% of strain, whereas this value jumped up to 70–150% on the IM-OPV modules. In addition, a power conversion efficiency retention of more than 90% was found after 50,000 cycles in the molded modules.
“This work represents the first demonstration of in-mold plastic solar cells and opens new possibilities for organic photovoltaics to enable specific applications that require simultaneous high optoelectronic and structural performances,” the researchers said. “We believe that future focus on injection plastic materials could further extend the benefits of in-mold photovoltaics in regards to structural and device stability, or even providing additional optical functionalities.”
Their findings were introduced in the paper “Injection Molding Plastic Solar Cells,” published in Advanced Science. The researchers come from the Eurecat Technology Centre of Catalonia, the University of Pardubice and the Centre for Organic Chemistry in the Czech Republic, as well as from French nano-metal producer GenesInk and Spanish injection molding provider Aitiip.

It is being developed by local company Parker Bangladesh Ltd. and Japan's Sumitomo Corp., with the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) purchasing electricity from it at a rate of $0.1010/kWh over 20 years.
The government has also approved tariff rates for a joint venture between state-owned Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh Ltd.

The company is currently cooperating with Sweden’s Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in the development of a pilot reactor process where hydrogen plasma acts as a quartz reductant to remove oxygen from the silicon dioxide.
“It also acts as a refining step because of the very high temperatures in the plasma section,” Green14 CEO, Adam Podgorski, told pv magazine, noting that green hydrogen represents an alternative to the use of coal and chlorine as the processing reactants in conventional solar silicon production.
Green14 used a plasma spray process that requires an output of 85 kW in a lab-scale setup with the aim of simulating bulk silicon production from quartz in the presence of hydrogen plasma as a reductant and refining mechanism. The process collects silicon on plates in the plasma plume.
According to Podgorski, the process is able to deliver silicon at 5N to 6N purity levels (99.999% to 99.9999%). He said these results were validated by Norwegian research institute SINTEF and Czech plasma technology provider PlasmaSolve.
“Our pilot aims to repeat this 6N purity at scale and push it even further before integrating it into post-processing steps,” said Podgorski.  The hope for the pilot reactor is to achieve “high purities on timescales of seconds rather than the hours that it takes for Siemens polysilicon.”
The startup plans to build a 25-kilotonne plant in Northern Sweden, equating to an annual wafer capacity of 10 GW. “We have a letter of intent (LOI) in place from key customers and we are working on more,” said Podgorski, without providing further details.
When asked about green hydrogen sources, he said that Sweden has several large renewables-driven hydrogen electrolysis projects underway, such as H2 Green Steel.

In a joint statement during their recent quarterly meeting in Brussels, the board members of SolarPower Europe addressed current market dynamics, which they described as a “perfect storm” caused by excessive demand, leading to a drop in PV module prices and other system components.
The board proposed three solutions to address the situation. First, they suggested that the European Union should adapt its aid rules in the Temporary Crisis Framework (TCTF) to allow member states to support factory operating costs.
Second, they called for the creation of demand for European PV products, which could be achieved through European “resilience auctions” under the EU's Net Zero Industry Act.
Lastly, the statement called for the establishment of a financing instrument for European PV products, suggesting the creation of a “Solar Manufacturing Bank” to provide cost-effective financing.
SolarPower Europe emphasized that these initiatives could be launched promptly with the right political will. However, the board explicitly rejected the imposition of tariffs, stating that trade barriers would hinder expansion and result in a lose-lose scenario.
“Tariffs are not a good answer to the current challenges in the European solar industry; there are better and, above all, faster instruments for the development of European solar production,” said Gunter Erfurt, board director of SolarPower Europe and the CEO of Meyer Burger. “Instead of sanctioning the entire industry through tariffs, we must incentivize solar installations that originate from resilient European solar production. This way, the deployment of solar energy can continue undisturbed while the European solar manufacturing can grow steadily. In the coming weeks, the EU has the chance to implement the basic principles of this resilience system in its planned Net Zero Industry Act.”
SolarPower Europe President Aristotelis Chantavas said that trade barriers might not be the most effective approach. Instead, he urged the European Union to look to the US Inflation Reduction Act as a model when shaping its industrial strategy. Under this program, the US authorities have allocated approximately $400 billion (€380 billion) in investment incentives for various emerging industries. The energy sector, including the solar industry, received incentives of $250 billion to encourage more investment and the establishment of production facilities across the United States.
