Suggestions mooted by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) include how to taper down CfD financial support to expose generators more to the wholesale electricity market; reducing the length of payment contracts; and applying the subsidy as a price floor, rather than ceiling.
Under the CfD regime, clean power generators agree a strike price, via an auction, which determines the income they will receive from the sale of the electricity they generate. The power is sold on the day-ahead wholesale market and when the market price is below the agreed strike price, the government makes good the difference. When power prices are above the strike price, generators bank the receipts before returning the difference to the government.
The government has committed to holding the fourth round of its CfD allocation program in “late 2021” and the procurement exercise will see generators, including solar plant owners, compete to secure capacity by offering the lowest strike prices. After that, the government says, it will be time to consider whether changes should be made to how the system functions.
In a potentially worrying sign for investors and project owners, opinion is being sought about how renewables facilities could survive without CfD backing, especially with the deployment of assets such as energy storage facilities, which could supply more flexibility to the grid.
With BEIS stating it is keen to learn lessons from the merchant solar and PPA-driven projects cropping up in the U.K., the department voiced concern about ‘price cannibalization‘, which occurs when clean power facilities drive down electricity prices so low investors are deterred from backing future generation facilities.
Such an outcome would leave renewables developers entirely beholden to government subsidy amid the push to attain a net zero energy system by mid century, according to the consultation document published by BEIS in mid-December. For that reason, the energy department is considering how it could expose renewables generators to wholesale electricity prices. Approaches such as using seasonal wholesale prices, rather than day-ahead figures; capping CfD support during periods of low, but positive power prices; and using the CfD strike price as a minimum, rather than maximum level of income have been suggested. Tying the strike price to a carbon value, or revenue level, rather than to the wholesale electricity price, is also under consideration.
BEIS stressed any initial changes related to wholesale power price exposure would be likely to be limited to better incentivizing the integration of renewables rather than bringing in sweeping changes, and suggested such market forces might make generators more willing to add storage or hydrogen production, and maximize the strategic location and maintenance down times of their facilities.
The fact-finding exercise – which runs until March 8 and, as a ‘call for evidence' is not bound by the requirements of a more formal official consultation – also asks whether the CfD regime should incentivize grid flexibility services, hybrid plants with a mixture of renewable and storage technologies, projects consisting of geographically dispersed facilities linked as virtual power plants, or overseas assets which could help the U.K. zero-carbon goal. The document also asks whether project extensions or plans to repower generation sites should qualify for CfD support and also moots the possibility of removing part-built projects from eligibility.
Another suggestion is whether the regime should be amended to ensure the optimal geographical mix of generation sites, given the government's attempts to ‘level up' the economic performance of the nation outside London.
For once, the BEIS document at least acknowledges the importance of solar in the U.K. energy mix, stating: “As we build back better from the coronavirus pandemic … shovel-ready projects, particularly onshore wind and solar can drive this deployment [of clean power facilities] almost right away.”
Wind is still tagged as the dominant renewable energy source for the U.K. in the 12 low-carbon future energy mixes published in the introduction to the document, with solar accounting for 15, 40, 80 or 120 gigawatts of generation capacity, depending on technology mix and energy demand.

According to a group of international scientists, however, several challenges and knowledge gaps must be addressed to fully unleash the strong potential that this storage technology is promising.
In the study Enabling large-scale hydrogen storage in porous media – the scientific challenges, published in Energy & Environmental Science, the academics, which are all part of the GEO 8 association of European geoscientific research organizations, stressed that there is an urgent need for implementing interdisciplinary research to make the development of underground hydrogen storage safe and efficient.
According to them, there is limited experience with underground hydrogen storage in porous geological formations to date and similar solutions have only been applied in small scale projects for town gas storage in France, Czechia, and Germany. Although some knowledge and good practices may be taken from underground storage of natural gas (UGS), compressed air (CAES), and CO2 subsurface storage (UCS), there are several unique issues that should be considered when it comes to hydrogen.
“Firstly, hydrogen has very different physical and chemical properties compared to other geologically stored fluids, such as CH4, air or CO2“, the research group explained. “Secondly, hydrogen may react with the subsurface minerals and fluids, potentially affecting the storage operations.” Furthermore, hydrogen may be responsible for the growth of hydrogen consuming microbes in the subsurface, and hydrogen containment may be compromised by the stress produced by repeated injection-reproduction cycles.
Specific characterization of the storage sites is needed in order to ensure safe and economic hydrogen injection and reproduction. “Uncertainties related to potential leakage, as well as other risks such as induced seismicity and the loss of hydrogen due to microbial activity need to be investigated and quantified, and new monitoring programs require investigation and calibration,” the group emphasized. “This perspective outlines the scientific challenges of hydrogen storage in deep saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon fields, in order to spark a discussion within the multidisciplinary energy research community.”
The main challenges associated with this technology relate to the fluid flow behavior of hydrogen in subsurface reservoirs, geochemical reactions caused by hydrogen injection, biotic reactions caused by excess hydrogen, and the geomechanical response of the subsurface to hydrogen storage.
Previous studies on the matter have shown the potential for large scale seasonal underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in geological formations in Canada, and that of hydrogen storage in salt caverns. The best locations for UHS are salt caverns, deep saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas deposits, and lined or unlined rock caverns.

South Korean multinational electronics company LG Electronics has launched, on the German market, the Home Energy Package, a hybrid system combining a heat pump, a PV system, and battery storage to provide residential buildings and small businesses with heat and electricity.
The system consists of photovoltaic modules from the LG Neon series, the three-phase ESS Home 8/10 battery storage system and the Therma V air-water heat pump. An energy management system is integrated to enable users to achieve maximum self-consumption.
The system can be controlled via an app developed by the South Korean manufacturer.
Customers can choose from different model variants for the PV modules, storage tanks, and heat pumps so that the system can be adapted to their respective electricity and heat requirements. “We are the only manufacturer on the German market to offer a sustainable, sector-coupled system without joints in terms of hardware and software,” said Kyuwon Heo, business development team leader at LG Electronics.
The system comes with a ten-year guarantee for the storage tank and, if the entire package is purchased, the heat pump. Furthermore, the modules are covered by a 25-year guarantee.
The company said that the system can be easily integrated with other LG products, including charging stations for electric vehicles.

EDF Renouvelables, the renewable energy unit of French energy company EDF, has begun construction of its first floating photovoltaic power plant in France, on a water reservoir at the Lazer hydroelectric plant in the southwestern department of Hautes-Alpes.
The facility will cover an area of 24.5ha, which corresponds approximately to two-thirds of the surface of the water reservoir, for a total capacity of 20 MWp. The project is expected to be commissioned in the spring of 2022 and will double the production capacity of the hydropower plant.
“Thanks to this innovative technology, the same water reservoir will produce hydroelectricity and solar electricity. Combining these two renewable energies is an additional advantage in contributing to the renewable energy development objectives set by the government,” said Nicolas Couderc, director France of EDF Renouvelables. “The Lazer floating solar power plant is also contributing to the success of EDF's solar plan.” This plan is aimed at making EDF one of the leaders in photovoltaics in France, with a 30% market share by 2035.
 
Started in 2017, the Lazer project was developed through a dialogue with the territory and the local communities, according to EDF. Numerous technical and environmental studies have been carried out to ensure the preservation of the site’s biodiversity and the continuity of electricity production from the Lazer hydroelectric plant. 
The installation of the anchors necessary for the installation of the floating panels will be carried out in spring 2021 and will be followed by the installation of the floats and the photovoltaic panels. According to the French group, the work will mobilize 40 people on the site for a period of 13 months.
The project will be larger than a utility scale floating project built in France by independent power producer Akuo Energy. That plant has a capacity of 17 MW and was deployed near Piolenc, in the Vaucluse department of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region of southern France.

Dutch solar developer Naga Solar Holding BV announced this week the creation of the joint venture Ampyr Solar Europe (ASE) with Belgian company AGP Group and U.K.-based merchant commodities firm Hartree Partners. The three companies will have, each, a one-third stake in the joint venture, said Henny Pelsers, CEO of Naga Solar, in an interview with pv magazine. The goal is the development, construction and operation of photovoltaic plants with a total output of more than 4 GW in Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. All the projects will be financed through power purchase agreements (PPA).
Naga Solar has been involved in project development in Germany and the Netherlands for many years. “But in the long term, project development alone will not be an economic business model. That is why we no longer only want to plan photovoltaic projects for investors in the future, but rather transform ourselves into an independent [power] producer (IPP),” Pelsers stated. “And [we] will keep and operate a large part of the planned PPA projects in our portfolio.” The AGP Group will contribute with its experience in the development of large photovoltaic power plants and Hartree Partners will bring its knowledge of electricity trading and PPAs to the joint venture.
The 4 GW of PPA projects is distributed 50% to Germany and a quarter each to the Netherlands and the U.K. In the Netherlands, the company is currently still in the process of developing photovoltaic projects that are funded through the SDE+ program. In the next few years, however, the market there will also move more towards PPAs, Pelsers is certain. In Germany, however, the project pipeline is already growing rapidly. “About 60% of the 2 GW of planned PPA projects are located in Bavaria and the rest in the eastern federal states,” Aravinda Perera told pv magazine. He is the managing director of Naga Solar Deutschland GmbH, which has its headquarters in Frankfurt am Main. The first projects should go online this year.
The largest project in Germany will have an output of around 100 MW and photovoltaic plants with a maximum capacity of 50 MW should be built in the Netherlands and the U.K. The photovoltaic projects in the U.K. come from the development pipeline of the AGP Group, while the planned projects in Germany and the Netherlands come from Naga Solar.
Pelsers sees increasing demand for power purchase agreements – both from energy suppliers and businesses. With Hartree's experience behind it, the joint venture will offer different types of PPAs. The standard term is 10-12 years; for smaller projects it could be as little as five years. “Since we work with the well-known banks, we can offer attractive financial conditions and at the same time the financing of the projects is secured,” Perera explained.
“The aim of the joint venture is to have all photovoltaic projects ready for construction and partially realized by 2023, or already on the grid,” he continued. “The grid connections are secured and the development plan is often already in place.” This year, Ampyr Solar Europe intends to build at least 200 MW of the PPA-linked projects or at least make them ready for construction. Another 400 MW will follow in the subsequent year.
A solar park with 21 MW in Bavaria should be one of the first projects implemented by the new joint venture. Naga Solar had signed a contract for the finalization of the approval process, including the substation, with the Clean Energy Future Fund of Aream GmbH in mid-January. With the new substation, the grid connection of up to 60 MW should be possible and Naga Solar already has further projects in the pipeline for this. The first 21 MW should be grid-connected by the end of the year.
“In order to continue to generate strong, consistent returns from the solar industry, we believe investors need to deploy capital earlier in the development process and embrace new technologies like batteries and hydrogen,” Pelsers affirmed.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/03/improving-pv-panel-performance-with-luminescent-solar-concentrators/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",Improving PV panel performance with luminescent solar concentrators,"Researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands have developed a series of measurement protocols for assessing the performance of luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) with the aim of helping this technology reach commercial maturity.
The LSCs can be used as photonic devices in the production of fine chemicals in photomicroreactors, in dynamic “smart” windows to control light entering room spaces, for distribution of color-tuned light for enhancing plant growth in greenhouses, and they can also be utilized for improving the efficiency of photovoltaic panels.
The LSCs consist of luminescent materials that are also known as luminophores, which are groups of molecules that emit light when illuminated. These materials, which can be coated on the surface of a polymer or glass plate, or used as a dopant of the polymer or glass plate acting as a lightguide, are able to capture direct and indirect sunlight at one wavelength and re-emit it at a longer wavelength.
If applied to PV, luminophores are able to capture high-energy photons that the photovoltaic panels cannot absorb and re-emit them as photons of lower energies. “The downshifted photons have energies that can be efficiently exploited by a mounted PV cell coupled to one or more edges or faces of the lightguide, thus harvesting the spectrally converted and optically concentrated photoluminescence photo transported there via total internal reflection,” the academics explained.
The LSCs can be integrated with finished PV modules with no need of modifying their electronic structure. “In addition, their aesthetic potential, color and shape tunability, combined with their ability to enhance PV response to diffuse light, may provide new opportunities for innovative product design concepts deployable in a variety of market segments as diverse as architecture, agriculture, transportation and other infrastructures,” the Dutch group explained, adding that the perfect match of the technology would be with building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).
The integration of LSCs and PV devices, however, remains difficult to analyze, as experiments that are being conducted worldwide are not presented in a uniform manner and all descriptions related to luminophores, lightguide materials, panel size, surface and edge modifications differ significantly. “Research groups working on LSCs tend to fall into two main camps in how they view LSCs, inevitably leading to the use of inconsistent metrics for their characterisation: LSCs are regarded either as a particular class of PV devices or as purely photonic systems,” the researchers said.
The lack of a universal standard for comparing the performance of these devices is what is currently keeping this technology in “relative obscurity,” according to the researcher, and the protocols that are now being applied, which are the same used for the PV technology, are inappropriate for LSCs. “It’s great that LSCs improve the efficiency of PVs, but this has led to a problem with standards,” the academics stated. “Progress has been slowed by the lack of standard reporting methods for LSCs, meaning it has been impossible to compare data collected for the past 40 years.”
The TU/e team believes that all standard measurements on LSCs should be carried out using an absorbing background or a mounting preventing reflections of unabsorbed light or luminophore-emitted light from re-entering the devices. Furthermore, the size and shape of the LSC should be described and the thickness of the lightguide should be thoroughly reported. Moreover, a clear indication of the manufacturer and type of light source, detector and integrating sphere used should be provided. A detailed checklist of the key metrics, measurements and experimental parameters should also be added.
“Currently, LSCs lack proper identity, and that’s not good for the technology,” said research co-author Michael Debije. “The field of LSCs has been around for 40 years, but has failed to gain industrial momentum.”
The proposed standards are presented in the study Laboratory protocols for measuring and reporting the performance of luminescent solar concentrators, published in Energy & Environmental Science.

Spanish-Japanese renewable energy company Univergy has announced that it will begin construction of a 120 MW agrivoltaic project with Australian partner New Energy Development (NED) in New South Wales (NSW) this year.
Located on the NSW and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) border, the Wallaroo Solar Farm will likely commence construction in summer with the installation of 260,936 panels at 460 Wp each, an onsite substation and a battery storage system. The panels will be positioned on single axis tracking structures and will generate around 260,000 MWh of solar energy annually.
Key to the $170m project is its agrivoltaic symbiosis. The 163 hectare property currently operates as a sheep farm and will continue to do so once the solar array is erected. The symbiotic relationship between solar panels and vegetation means that the sheep will have more to chew on than ever before. With the panels situated at a maximum elevation of 2.3m and with 5m between each row there will be more than enough space for the sheep to graze.
Moreover, the site is to feature approximately 22,000 permanent native plants, including six species to provide ground cover and 19 species to provide a vegetation screen which will also double as a bee haven. Native species like the Fan Flower, Grevillea, Goodenia, Jug Flower and Native Daisy all great attractors of bees, birds, butterflies and other species. The plants themselves also ensure the site will require a minimum of maintenance thanks to the better drainage from deep native rooted plants.

Univergy Solar’s executive president ,Ignacio Blanco, said, “Australia is a market with enormous potential for the development of clean energy, which makes it a strategic country for Univergy. The development of this first 120 MW park together with our partner New Energy Development, has improved our know-how in this market and we are confident of being able to expand our presence in the country through the development of future projects.”
In a statement to local residents, NED provided an update on what they described as a 100 MW development capable of producing clean renewable energy for approximately 48,000 NSW and ACT homes annually for the next three decades. NED also informed locals that they would be able to purchase said green energy at a discounted rate through the Localvolts Electricity Exchange, a peer-to-peer platform for the buying and selling of energy.
At this stage NED is currently preparing the project’s environment impact statement (EIS) and is seeking NSW State Significant Development status.

The renewable energy arm of Italian utility Enel installed 803 MW of PV and 2.28 GW of wind power worldwide last year and intends to keep growing at a faster pace as part of its strategy to reach a total renewable capacity of around 145 GW by 2030. “We are not targeting M&A and we want to grow organically,” Bernabei stated during the conference. “We can count on a huge pipeline and we want to take care of it.” Enel Green Power is looking to expand its cooperation with third parties to accelerate development and grow its ownership model by attracting other investors.
This growth should materialize in its traditional markets such as North America, Latin America and Europe, especially in Italy, Spain and Romania. “We are monitoring other European markets such as France and Germany and we are interested to see if, sooner or later, we will have opportunities to invest in these markets,” he told pv magazine. “However, we don't have a plan in the short-term, and perhaps in the next three years, we will do something, but we have not defined yet any clear development.”
pv magazine asked EGP's new CEO about the possibility of building big solar plants in Italy as it did in other international markets, thus making a move that would make the utility's solar business compete with its own conventional energy business. “If we don't do photovoltaics in Italy, someone else will do it,” he affirmed. “The history is already written and coal will be phased out in Italy by 2025 and this transition must be done in a very well planned and ordered way and can not be sudden, but we don't have to be afraid about it.” Bernabei, however, didn't provide a timeframe for the realization of large-scale PV plants in his homeland.
Enel has committed to shutting down its coal power plants in all parts of Italy by 2025. “In some cases, the solutions are already being defined, and in other cases not,” Bernabei explained, adding that the company is working with system operators and the Italian government to reach the 2025 objective. “But this is feasible and there are different solutions on the table.” Important decisions will have to be taken this year if this schedule is to be maintained, he added. “We want to reach an agreement with all the stakeholders, as final decisions do not depend only on one of them.”
Bernabei also commented on the poor outcome of Italy's recent auctions for large-scale solar and wind, which were characterized by high prices and lower than expected allocated capacity, and highlighted the difference with Spain, where the most recent auction delivered 2 GW of allocated PV at very low prices. “The issue is not that the auction is less attractive in Italy than in Spain; the main issue for Italy is that there is a bigger difficulty in getting the projects authorized,” he stated. The auctions' rules, on the other hand, exclude projects on agricultural land, forcing developers to plan their facilities on unused surfaces in urban or industrial areas.
“We know each of every PV project in Italy, either ours or those of our competitors, and we know that the real challenge is securing approval.” The average time it takes to receive final approval for a solar energy project in Italy could be as long as five to six years.
The PPA segment is targeted as a possibility but mainly in the US market, where bilateral power purchase deals are a consolidated business model. “In Europe, we have some other tools, as we can also count on local auctions, other types of bilateral contracts and, for the residual merchant exposure, we can count on the integration of our retail portfolio,” Bernabei stated. “PPAs are an interesting tool if they create value with respect to other alternatives that we have.”
When asked by pv magazine about the sustainability of recent record-low bids in the solar auctions held in Portugal, Abu Dhabi or in the Spanish auction itself, Bernabei said the levelized cost of electricity is decreasing and noted that there is clearly an industrial reason why these results could be achieved. “Consider, however, that in some cases, there could also be newcomers that want to enter the market and are available to pay a premium for it,” he explained. “If you look forward, it is obvious that there is a limit in the sustainability of these prices, and as soon as the prices decrease in these auctions, you have to think carefully about what is happening.” He specified that in some cases this sustainability threshold has already been surpassed. “When it happens, we have to explore if there are some other strategic reasons for this to happen.”
pv magazine also asked if Enel Green Power was planning to scale up the capacity of its heterojunction solar module factory in the southern Italian city of Catania, to a gigawatt size as other manufacturers are planning to do in France and Germany. Under the current market conditions and regulatory framework, a similar expansion would be difficult to carry out, Bernabei explained. “For strategic reasons, Europe works very well when it comes to battery manufacturing or in a very well structured way when it comes to hydrogen, for which an alliance and a clear strategy were created,” he emphasized. “These initiatives will make it easier to create a supply chain in Europe.”
The solar industry, however, is not included in the six chapters of the European Commission's strategic supply chain agenda, making major plans and investments difficult. “Companies that want to invest in solar manufacturing in Europe are unable to access the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) framework and the Commission should devote more attention to the PV industry and make it a strategic asset for the European industry, as we are investing a lot in Europe,” he added. “This would help Europe to become more independent from China and from Asia, as we have the required know-how,” he also stated, citing the recent efficiency records achieved by EGP. “But if you want to scale up module capacities in Europe, we need some kind of support,” he affirmed. “We have the efficiency, but what we need now is the scale.”
Enel is also investigating opportunities that could be offered by the recovery fund initiatives and working at the European level to gain political support and recognition of the European PV industry's strategic importance, Bernabei explained.
Coming to hydrogen, Bernabei said he didn't believe in CO2 capture technologies and that the production of blue hydrogen with gas and CO2 capture, as well as that of grey hydrogen produced with gas alone are not being contemplated in the company's future strategy. “CO2 capture technologies have been tried in the past and multilateral European funds were also devoted to this purpose, but the efficiency of the processes to capture and store CO2 has never reached 100%,” he said. Furthermore, the storing of the CO2 may have low social and environmental acceptance by the communities that live close to a storing site, which contributes to making these projects too complex, big and difficult to realize. As a result, Enel will only bet on green hydrogen for its future plans.
Bernabei also clarified that Enel doesn't intend to enter the upstream manufacturing business for the components needed for hydrogen production, although it will push for innovative solutions by cooperating with startups and other partners within the framework of its “open innovation” model. “We will test different types of electrolyzers and different business models around the world,” he said. “For example, electrolyzers can play a role in the ancillary market.”
During the media brief, the Italian executive also spoke about the company's strategy on wind, hydropower and storage, although the latter was only briefly mentioned. “Batteries could be a risk mitigator for renewables as they can reduce curtailment,” he said, speaking about the Romanian market. As for the hydropower business, Enel Green Power will invest mostly in repowering, as around 99% of future power generation capacity is expected to come from other renewables. “By investing in repowering we will have a more efficient capacity,” he stated. “And we will extend the useful life of these assets.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/03/what-role-will-battery-storage-have-in-bidens-america/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",What role will battery storage have in Biden’s America?,"From pv magazine USA
Anyone who followed last week’s confirmation hearing for Jennifer Granholm to become secretary of energy, will remember that a hefty portion of the hearing focused on the United States’ place in the electric vehicle (EV) marketplace, and in the battery world overall.
(Read our coverage of the hearing.)
Energy and battery storage are set to be the lynchpin of a transition to a carbon-free economy and greater adoption of renewable energy. Even so, most experts say that the U.S. is significantly behind much of the world in usage and manufacturing. This reality will need to be quickly addressed by the Biden administration. pv magazine spoke with Kurt “Chip” Breitenkamp, vice president of business development at NanoGraf, who offered insight into how the administration might tackle the battery and storage challenge.
Already, the Biden administration has created significant battery and EV demand through the “Made in America” executive order signed in late January. The order directs the federal government to replace its entire existing vehicle fleet with EVs.
“If we believe that electrification is going to be the future of the new green economy, we can’t be reliant on other countries,” said Breitenkamp. “I think we learned that lesson from fossil fuels over the last 50 years.”
Breitenkamp said that the demand created by the federal government will create upstream demand for batteries and the materials used to construct them. That, in turn, will create a much more dynamic American battery market. From there, the hope is that corporations and other entities will recognize the capacity of battery manufacturing and look to invest still further in the technologies.
The biggest challenge to achieving this reality is the middle part of the “smiling curve”: manufacturing and production capacity. While a major focus of research and development is on battery technologies and massive potential demand exists for these technologies, domestic manufacturing capacity is virtually non-existent.
“There isn’t a single U.S. company that can make a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery right now,” said Breitenkamp.
Making those batteries requires the supplies to go with them, and that means developing an American battery production supply chain.
One of the biggest issues involves cobalt, which primarily is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has a dubious supply chain. But Breitenkamp asserts that this may not be the most difficult obstacle to hurdle.
Instead, he said that battery manufacturers are increasingly moving their chemistries away from cobalt. If the United States were able to set up an effective market for battery and electronic recycling, that would greatly reduce the country’s reliance on new, mined cobalt. To date, battery recycling has been underdeveloped but the potential for greater expansion exists, according to Breitenkamp.
He cited the opinion of JB Straubel, co-founder and former CTO of Tesla and now CEO of Redwood Materials, who said that thousands of tons of cobalt exist already in the U.S. in the form of unused electronics.
“The reality is that China has shipped us enough cobalt in the form of finished products that, if we recycle that, we might have enough cobalt without having to worry about that being part of the U.S. supply chain,” Breitenkamp said.
As for nickel, graphite, and lithium, the United States may have to turn to Canada and countries in South America, where the resources are plentiful. For example, considerable nickel and graphite resources exist in Canada, which is especially important given that China historically has dominated graphite production. As for lithium, the resource is plentiful in South America, especially in Chile.
Breitenkamp raised the idea of a trade treaty, similar to the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, that the United States could pursue with Canada and South American lithium-producing countries to create a resilient and equitable supply chain.
