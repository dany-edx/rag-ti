CPIA vice president and secretary general Wang Bohua made the prediction during a speech to the organization's annual conference on Wednesday and also confirmed PV statistics from 2020. Wang said China added 48.2 GW of generation capacity last year, a year-on-year rise of 60% to take the cumulative figure to 253 GW. Polysilicon output rose 14.6% on 2019, to 392,000 metric tons, said Wang, with the industry producing 19.7% more wafers, at 161.3 GW for the year; 22.2% more cells, for 134.8 GW; and 26.4% more modules, at 124.6 GW.
The State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) this week announced solar and wind projects accounted for 21.86 GW of the 27.55 GW of new generation capacity it added last year. The state-owned entity has set a more modest renewables capacity target for this year, of 15 GW. By the end of December, SPIC said, it had hit 29.6 GW of total solar generation capacity, together with a cumulative 30.9 GW of wind farms.
Solar manufacturer Longi on Tuesday revealed details of a contract to buy 91,400 metric tons of polysilicon from GCL-Poly subsidiary Zhongneng Silicon, with the supply set to start next month and run until the end of 2023 and prices to be calculated monthly. Based on the latest poly prices released by Taiwanese analyst PV Infolink, the deal would be worth around RMB7.33 billion (US$1.13 billion), a figure which Longi said would equate to around 31% of its operations costs during 2019. The deal will come as a boost to GCL-Poly, which suffered a cross default on Saturday after failing to settle US$500 million worth of Hong Kong-issued, three-year senior notes.
Module maker Risen will sell a 99 MWp, 1.4km agrivoltaic installation it developed in Hubei province to provincial state-owned entity Hubei Energy Group.
Manufacturer China Glass Holdings yesterday announced it has entered exclusive negotiations to buy a controlling stake in an entity seeking to establish photovoltaic and float glass production lines. Talks will continue with three unnamed entities about China Glass acquiring control of the target company, which appears to be linked to the glass manufacturing policy of an unnamed Chinese local authority. The sellers have signed a memorandum of understanding not to negotiate with anyone else for the remainder of the year. The board of China Glass recently advised its shareholders to rebuff a HK$1.64 billion (US$212 million) takeover offer from rival Xinyi Glass Holdings.

Africa has a lot of sunshine, which translates into an average annual solar irradiation of over 2000 kWh/m2. However, this potential is far from being exploited and many African countries remain heavily dependent on hydropower. For example, 90% of electricity production in Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia comes from this energy source.
In recent decades though, increasingly frequent droughts have severely affected hydropower production. For instance, in 2016, water losses due to evaporation in African hydroelectric reservoirs amounted to 42 billion cubic meters. This is why installing floating photovoltaic (FPV) panels at existing hydropower reservoirs could help offset hydropower generation during dry periods and reduce evaporation losses, while helping meet the increasing energy needs of Africa's rapidly growing population.
These are the conclusions of the study Assessment of floating solar photovoltaics potential in existing hydropower reservoirs in Africa written by experts from the Joint Research Center of the Commission European and published in January 2021 in Renewable Energy.
The paper provides an analysis of the potential of installing floating PV systems exceeding 5 MW in size on 146 of the largest operational hydropower reservoirs in Africa. According to the researchers, with 100% coverage of water surfaces (i.e. 29,222 km2), a theoretical installed PV capacity of 2,922 GW could be deployed – more than 250 times the cumulative installed photovoltaic capacity on the continent at the end of 2020. A figure that must also be compared to the 28 GW of hydroelectricity already installed in Africa, highlighted the authors.
Overall, the total electricity produced by the floating panels would be 5,293 TWh/year – 50 times more than the hydropower currently produced in these reservoirs. Since this 100% assumption seems unrealistic, the authors also analyzed what a 1% coverage of hydropower reservoirs with floating solar panels could provide.
According to their calculation, the production of solar panels would be 52.9 TWh/year, i.e. an increase of 50% of the annual production of existing hydroelectric plants (105 TWh/year). In addition, water savings could reach 743 million m3/year, increasing annual hydropower production by 170 GWh.

The solar plants, which will have a total generation capacity of 48.3 MWp, will supply power to five commercial offtakers in a project Yellow Door yesterday described as the biggest “private-to-private” renewables portfolio developed under Jordan's wheeling regulations, which permit use of the state grid to enable self-consumption.
The loans come in the form of a $15.6 million credit line from the private company-focused Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG) subsidiary of German state-owned development bank KfW, with DEG also contributing to a separate $10.6 million loan package for the project, supplied jointly by London-based development lender the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Up to $5 million will be loaned, via the EBRD, from Washington-based multilateral development lender the Global Environment Facility and the solar projects will have the chance to bank up to an additional €1.5 million ($1.8 million) of “results-based payments” from the Spanish and EU governments in return for the verified removal of carbon emissions, assessed by a system being developed by the EBRD. pv magazine has asked Yellow Door whether those payments would be repayable.
The energy offtakers will be the Umniah mobile telephone network owned by Bahraini state-owned parent Batelco; French supermarket chain Carrefour; the Jordanian Safeway supermarkets owned by Kuwait's The Sultan Center; garment manufacturer Classic Fashion and shopping center Taj Mall.
Yellow Door's shareholders include the private-sector International Finance Corporation arm of the World Bank, the Arab Petroleum Investment Corp established by 11 Arab states across the Middle East and North Africa; Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor; and Japanese brand Mitsui.
Lenders HSBC and the Jordan-based Arab Bank were also involved in the project financing deal.

“Despite the considerable challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic, we achieved the sales and earnings growth forecast at the start of the year in 2020,” said SMA CEO Jürgen Reinert on Friday.
According to its preliminary results, 2020 sales grew to reach over €1 billion, compared to the €915.1 million generated in 2019. At 14.4 GW, sales of its solar inverters were 26% higher year-on-year, and the company now has over 100 GW of installed inverter capacity globally.
SMA’s other financial results also appear to have recorded improvements, with EBITDA expected to be around €72 million – almost double compared to 2019. Like its sales, this figure is in the scope of the predictions it made at the start of least year, before the Corona pandemic took grip. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be around €44 million, leaving a profit of almost €30 million.
CEO Reinert attributes the positive results to the fact SMA quickly implemented effective infection control measures and worked closely together with customers and suppliers. This meant production was unaffected, and the company did not have to rely on state aid.
For the current financial year 2021, the SMA management board predicts further growth, with sales increasing to between €1.075 billion to €1.175 billion. EBITDA is also projected to grow to between €75 million and €95 million. The U.S. and European solar markets are expected to remain strong for the inverter manufacturer, as is the global energy storage market.
SMA has further said it will press ahead with its “Strategy 2025”, which involves the ongoing development of its inverter product range toward creating a system landscape for decentralized energy supply.
The board of directors assumes that lower production costs, further price declines and the use of economies of scale will boost the company’s profitability. Concurrently, the streamlining of its product portfolio, which focuses on higher margin products and systems, should see further improvements.
The figures and strategies will be presented at today’s Capital Markets Day, while the final results are expected to be shared on March 25.

The scientists have described the performance achievement as the highest efficiency rate in any tandem device based on perovskite and organic materials. It is the result of the near-optimal absorption spectral match between the two sub-cells of the device, they added.
The optical properties of front and back cells were matched with a cesium-based inorganic perovskite known as CsPbI2Br and the so-called PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend, which is particularly attractive for semi-transparency, imaging, and tandem device applications. Prior to their combination in a single tandem device, the CsPbI2Br sub-cell showed an efficiency of 9.20%. Based on PTB7‐Th:IEICO‐4F, it exhibited an efficiency of 10.45%.
“The hybrid tandem device designed in this study demonstrated improvement in long-term stability under humidity stress, which is due to the hydrophobicity of the organic BHJ back-cell layer,” the researchers added.
They said that inorganic perovskite/organic hybrid tandem devices have the potential to reach efficiencies close to 28% by improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and reducing energy losses in the sub-cells. The EQE is the ratio of the number of energy carriers harvested by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy incident on the cell itself. 
In 2017, UNIST researchers developed a new method for the production of inorganic-organic perovskite solar cells. They achieved record efficiency levels of 22.1% in small cells and 19.7% in cells measuring 1 square centimeter. This year, UNIST researchers achieved a conversion efficiency of 25.17% in a perovskite solar cell by minimizing the deformation for the microstructure of photoactive layers.

German solar PV panel manufacturer Aleo Solar is planning to start up a new production line at its factory in Prenzlau, eastern Germany.
The company did not provide details on the capacity of the production line, but said it will be dedicated to the manufacture of a new 400W solar panel series for rooftop PV applications that it plans to launch in the third quarter of this year. The panels will feature either black or white backsheets.
Aleo Solar, which has been manufacturing and developing PV products in the German region of Brandenburg since 2001, also aims to offer a smaller module that can be interconnected with its standard modules. Difficult roof areas, such as gable or hipped roofs, could thus be covered more efficiently with solar modules.
The photovoltaic manufacturer did not initially provide any further details on the specifications of the new module series. “As a German company, when building the new line, it is particularly important to us to strengthen the local market and create a particularly sustainable product,” says Aleo Solar CEO William Chen. Most of the equipment for the new line will come from Europe.

The challenge is not at all simple: climbing Nepal's Manaslu Peak, the world's eighth highest, in the middle of winter and in the midst of a pandemic.
For Alex Txikon, a 39-year-old climber from Vizcaya, Spain, this expedition has a special interest: if he is successful, it will be the first time anyone has reached the Manaslu summit in the middle of winter.
Txikon, who is accompanied by Simone Moro, Iñaki Álvarez and the Sherpas Cheppal, Kalden and Namja, has always defended the idea of sustainable and respectful mountaineering in the semi-virgin environment he usually crosses.
For this reason, he has been collaborating for years with the EKI foundation – a Basque association that has provided electricity supply (mainly photovoltaic solar) to educational, health, and social interest centers in developing countries since 2017.
The foundation is an initiative of Spanish photovoltaic company Solarpack, and specifically, its Vice President José Galíndez. Thanks to the support of Eki, Txikon now has two portable, folding photovoltaic systems that will allow the expedition to avoid using any type of fossil fuels during their ascent.
Txikon's expedition also aims to leave a positive mark on the local population. Via Eki, it will donate 50 isolated, photovoltaic powered lights for a school in the area.
Furthermore, the expedition will not use plastic bottles, thanks to a filtering system provided by the “startup” Aquadat. The team will instead use a 0.1 micron water filter system that removes harmful organisms, like 99.999% bacteria and protozoa. In this way, Txikon's team hopes to save 4,000 1-liter water bottles during the expedition.
Currently, the group is struggling to reach the summit. According to the Txikon Twitter account, the team is looking at alternatives to overcome a large crack that separates the camp at height 1 from the camp at height 2 – which is about 6,900 meters high. Although the weather forecasts are good, it is not guaranteed that they can reach the top.
To date, the Eki Foundation has participated in 31 projects, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In total, it has installed over 320 KWp worth of  small systems of between 1 and 40 KW in villages, health centers and socio-educational centers. According to the association, the number of beneficiaries numbers more than 220,000 people in countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, DR Congo and Cape Verde.

In 2020, the Gaïa group, a solar specialist based in the French overseas department of Reunion, deployed a 36 kWp solar PV plant on the roof of the Saint-Leu school, under the island's net metering scheme. 
The Reunion-based company also installed an air conditioning system with a cooling capacity of 72 kW, employing French energy efficiency specialist Sirea's expertise for the system's energy management and optimization.
Sirea provided its SmartEMS technology to control the air conditioning, based on the available photovoltaic energy. “We needed an energy manager compatible with the installation's different equipment, and which is flexible enough to offer tailor-made management as close as possible to the needs of the school,” said Étienne Bernard, director of operation at Gaïa Photovoltaic.
The control system managed by Sirea PLC and installed by the Gaïa team is based on four real-time measurement points: photovoltaic production, withdrawal and injection into the distribution network, consumption of cooling units, and building consumption.
The SmartEMS can both perform these operations, and control the setpoint temperatures of the indoor air conditioning units. According to the manufacturer, this intelligent device allows the user to manually start or turn off each of the 12 indoor air conditioning units, and to act on a set temperature range of between 24°C and 26°C. Thus, in the event of a photovoltaic deficit, the controller acts on the setpoint temperature. It also issues an order to turn off all air conditioning at 8:00 p.m.
It is claimed that the self-consumption controlled by this SmartEMS makes it possible to greatly reduce the electricity consumption taken from the network while providing controlled flexibility. In addition, due to its geographical location, this project takes advantage of a strong photovoltaic potential between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., year round, thus overlapping with the air conditioning needs of users.
Overall, the project developers believe that controlling air conditioning is a wise choice that allows the Saint-Leu school to set an example in terms of energy efficiency.

Nexwafe said this week that it has secured €10 million ($11.9 million) in a recent B-series financing round.
Existing shareholders and new investors took part in the funding round. The participants included Fraunhofer, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, GAP Technology Holding, Lynwood Schweiz, and Bantina Invest.
Nexwafe said that it intends to use the capital to advance the commercialization of its wafer technology and to begin pilot production. The manufacturer claimed that its EpiWafers technology could help module producers to achieve dramatically higher degrees of efficiency, without having to upgrade their production lines.
It has also claimed that its technology can enable the production of ultra-thin wafers. It has already demonstrated this on its pilot line in Freiburg, Germany. In addition to ultra-thin wafers, Nexwafe plans to use tandem architectures in the future.
The company is currently talking to potential partners about the commercialization of its wafer technology, it said. CEO Davor Sutija is overseeing these efforts, the company added.
In addition, Nexwafe announced a number of changes this week. Its board chairman, Peter Pauli, plans to resign, but will remain with the company as a shareholder. Bart Markus, who has been a member of the Nexwafe board of directors since 2019, is set to succeed him as chairman.
“Now, with this new funding and our new CEO at the helm, we will be able to take the company to the next level, both in technology readiness with the pilot line and in commercializing the technology,” Markus said.

This effect only relates to some types of semiconductor materials and occurs when a PV device provides an open-circuit voltage that is higher than the bandgap of the corresponding semiconductor, while exhibiting a very poor short-circuit current.
The materials that produce this effect usually have low power-conversion efficiencies. For this reason, they have never been applied in commercial PV production. However, the German researchers claim to have made some progress in overcoming this challenge with their novel “nanocomposite” cell architecture.
The academics used nickel(II) oxide (NiO) nanocolumns in Aurivillius, a type of layered perovskite. The structures were grown on single-crystal substrates made of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) via pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with single ceramic targets. In this configuration, the nickel oxide strips, which run perpendicularly to the cell layers, act as a fast lane for electron transport.
“This is precisely the transport that would otherwise be impeded by the electrons having to traverse each individual horizontal layer,” said researcher Akash Bhatnagar. “The new architecture actually increased the cell’s electrical output by a factor of five.”
They said the material used in the experiment can form the desired structure on its own, without external intervention.
“The nanocomposite thin films exhibit improved photovoltaic performance compared to both pure PbTiO3 and homogeneous Aurivillius phase thin films,” the scientists explained.
The research group will now start evaluating materials other than nickel oxide and assess the potential of the solar cells for industrial-scale production. They described their research in “Nanocomposites with Three-Dimensional Architecture and Impact on Photovoltaic Effect,” which was recently published in Nano Letters.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/05/blockchain-enabled-retail-ppas-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021",Blockchain-enabled retail PPAs in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Blockchain-enabled renewables marketplace WePower said this week that it has delivered its Elemental technology for retail power purchase agreements (PPAs) to Mojo Power. 
Mojo Power will use Elemental to set up Mojo Marketplace, which will allow small business and corporate customers to purchase locally produced renewable energy in the form of standard retail energy contracts in Australia. 
WePower CTO Kaspar Kaarlep told pv magazine Australia how electricity generated by the Robinvale Solar Farm in Victoria can now reach business customers.
“The initial wholesale PPA between Robinvale’s owners and Mojo is tokenized by WePower and stored on the Ethereum blockchain, so that it can be structured into smaller retail PPAs and made available to these customers,” he said. “(This forms a) direct contractual link between the generating project and the end customer’s energy purchase.” 
The technology allows WePower to form itself into the “connective tissue” between industry consumers and renewable energy generators, Kaarlep said. For consumers, this means easier access to energy in an online shopping environment, and for producers it means easier access to consumers. 
“With wholesale energy prices at historic lows due to the surge in renewable generation capacity in Australia, retail PPAs provide energy users with exposure to these low wholesale prices, effectively locking in savings over traditional retail energy for the life of the contract,” continued Kaarlep. 
Unfortunately, businesses that have already installed their own solar systems cannot contribute to the virtual power plant (VPP) at this time. But as Kaarlep noted, “they can supplement their retail PPA purchase with solar power generated behind the meter. Such behind-the-meter generation and storage can be readily incorporated into the retail agreement. Its contribution to the overall supply will be tracked by the marketplace alongside the external renewable project.”  
Mojo also has contracts with the Riverina Solar Farm in New South Wales, and several more large-scale solar farms throughout Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Generation from these farms will eventually be added to the Mojo Marketplace, along with multiple other agreements currently in the pipeline.

Financial firm Wells Fargo is partnering with Ameresco to install 30 MW of new onsite solar arrays on nearly 100 of its retail and administrative offices in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Texas.
“There may be opportunities to do more. The cost of [solar] technology has been coming down, and panel efficiency has been going up,” said Curt Radkin, senior vice president in sustainable strategy for Wells Fargo’s corporate properties group. “The  economics just make sense.”
For its first wave of projects, Wells Fargo selected states with relatively high power costs and/or favorable incentive programs for onsite solar, and locations where it has a lot of employees and customers. The bank’s new projects range from a 6 kW  rooftop array on a branch in Connecticut to a 6.5 MW carport and rooftop system at the bank’s Chandler, Arizona, campus.
Other larger projects will include a 5.5 MW combination rooftop/ground mount system to serve an administrative property in San Antonio, Texas, and a nearly 2 MW ground mount system next to a Wells Fargo campus in Des Moines, Iowa.
With the new strategy, RECs, which the bank has been using to meet its electricity needs since 2017, will make up a smaller part of its renewable energy play; installing behind-the-meter solar offers the opportunity to have a greater impact.
When the first wave of projects are completed next year, Wells Fargo is expected to overtake Bank of America as the leading U.S. financial services company helping to support new renewable generation capacity via its operations.

The solar auction held by authorities in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh this week was intended at allocating 6.4 GW of grid-connected solar power and was oversubscribed by 8.5 GW.
The procurement exercise saw five players, including Adani Green, HES Infra, NTPC, Shirdi Sai Electricals and Torrent Power, submitting bids for a combined capacity of 14.9 GW.
The auction results, which were revealed b consultancy JMK Research, show the lowest winning bid of INR 2.47($0.034)/kWh came from Torrent Power, which secured 300 MW capacity. Adani Green secured the biggest chunk of 3 GW across five locations (600 MW each). Shirdi Sai Electricals secured 2.2 GW, NTPC 600 MW, and HES Infra 300 MW.
JMK research cited the lack of international participation as the reason for the rise in final prices compared to the record-low prices of INR 1.99–2.00 achieved in previous auctions. “It could be partly due to lesser time for bid submission, because of which many players were not able to conduct detailed site assessment,” it said.
