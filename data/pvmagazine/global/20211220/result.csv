A new artisanal bakery could open in Senegal as early as the end of March, delivering fresh, tasty bread that is also produced CO2-neutrally with solar power.
The special thing about it: The bakery will be completely set up in a container and shipped to Senegal from Munich by the German start-up Solarbakery. The solar modules and the mounting system are then unpacked and installed on site. The equipment for the bakery and a carefully separated, insulated, and air-conditioned room will remain in the ship's container, which is almost 14 meters long and 2.45 meters wide. A battery storage system is also embedded in the container and is intended to provide enough power for the early shift.
The idea for Solarbakery came from Simon Zimmermann, who, together with a partner, had already deployed a container bakery in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Through this business, the company achieved sales of US$128,000 in the first fiscal year, but the power supply of the bakeries was still being ensured by polluting and expensive diesel power generators
As a co-founder of Solarbakery, Zimmermann was able to win over Torsten Schreiber, who had been working with Africa Greentec on the solar electrification of African villages and is now responsible for converting the bakery container for photovoltaic operation. For this, the bakery is given a solar roof with 144 modules totaling 52 kW. The company's third founder, Daniel Petruccelli, is a master baker. He changed the production process to that the majority of electricity consumption is incurred during the day, with the finished bread only briefly reheated in the dark before dawn. He also trains employees and works on new recipes.
Solarbakery is being financed by a crowdfunding campaign on the Conda platform. The target is €500,000, of which more than €300,000 have already been raised. While 17 days remain in the fundraising period, the campaign may be extended by two months if the goal is not achieved in the allotted time, Zimmermann said. The money will initially be used to deploy two bakeries. One is going directly to Senegal, where a production facility for further solar bakeries and Africa Greentec's mobile power plants are expected to be built in Dakar, Zimmermann added. A second bakery will initially remain in Germany as a demonstration model to convince investors to invest in the company or directly in a solar bakery.
In the future, Solarbakery wants to utilize three different business models. First, there is the construction of its own bakeries, which are then operated by partners in Africa at their own locations. Second, containers are to be sold as turnkey solutions in which buyers operate a bakery under their own name. “Aid organizations, for example, come into question,” said Zimmermann. The third variant is a lease model in which local entrepreneurs rent a bakery without large upfront costs and use the proceeds to finance the monthly installments. “But that only works when the processes are sufficiently standardized for a franchise.”
Solarbakery offers crowdfunding investors an interest rate of 4.5 percent over seven years and a bonus interest if the business develops positively. In any case, the interest in the idea is huge, Zimmermann beamed.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/20/baywa-re-wraps-up-major-virtual-ppa-with-finnish-packaging-giant/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,FINLAND,SPAIN,WESTERN EUROPE",BLAKE MATICH,"DECEMBER 20, 2021",Baywa re wraps up major virtual PPA with Finnish packaging giant,"Solar developer Baywa re has signed a 10-year virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Finnish packaging company Huhtamaki for two new solar projects in Spain. According to the partners, it is the biggest corporate solar VPPA for the packaging industry in Europe and the first for a Finnish company.
Huhtamaki, primarily a food packing business, has ambitions to “become the first choice in sustainable packaging solutions.” That goal includes reaching carbon neutrality and sourcing all electricity from renewables this decade, and the Finnish company is taking a big step in that direction with a VPPA which will see 200 GWh of solar electricity satisfy around 80% of Huhtamaki's annual European power needs. Given the company's 18 European manufacturing sites, across 10 countries, that is the equivalent of 89,000 tonnes of CO2 abated by the provision of enough clean energy to power almost 25,000 homes per year.
The power supply deal makes possible two new solar farms in southern Spain with an aggregate generation capacity of 135 MWp. Huhtamaki will buy the power from Baywa at a pre-determined price. BayWa said the VPPA has been structured “with an innovative price mechanism that benefits both parties during times of high electricity costs and [the] current supply chain challenges with PV modules.”
While virtual power purchase agreements have been somewhat criticized for being overly complicated in the past, the partners to this deal said it took only eight weeks to settle, from inception to signing, with BayWa re chief executive Matthias Taft noting the speed of the “milestone VPPA … demonstrates the collaborative relationship that has been established, and we look forward to continuing to work together.”
“Supporting Huhtamaki on its journey to achieving the company's sustainable energy goals represents another important milestone in BayWa re's own commitment to advancing the corporate energy transition that is so pivotal to meeting global climate targets,” said Taft.
Charles Héaulmé, president and CEO of Huhtamaki agreed, noting renewable energy agreements like these demonstrate making progress on climate targets is possible “in a short time.”
Huhtamaki's executive vice president of sustainability and communications, Thomasine Kamerling, added, while the BayWa deal is the company's first virtual power supply deal, the developer expects “to embark on other VPPAs shortly, with the next one in the United States. In addition, we are installing solar panels at our sites, where feasible, and working relentlessly to improve our energy efficiency.”
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) and VPPAs are increasingly attractive options for corporate energy purchasing. BayWa re's head of PPAs for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Daniel Parsons, said: “More and more corporations, from ever widening industry sectors, are sourcing renewables and putting PPAs in place to achieve carbon reduction targets while also securing savings against electricity price volatility. We are proud to be supporting Huhtamaki as they lead the way in the packaging industry and I hope it encourages other corporations to follow.”
Aside from helping companies reduce their carbon footprints and meet sustainability targets, the attraction of VPPAs is as a hedge against the kind of volatile electricity prices witnessed in recent times. A virtual power purchase agreement is essentially a contract for differences (CFD), in that the parties agree a fixed VPPA price and if the wholesale energy price is higher, the offtaker (in this case, Huhtamaki) receives the difference. If the wholesale energy price is lower than the VPPA tariff agreed, the offtaker pays the solar project owner the difference. The VPPA does not involve the physical delivery of solar electricity to Huhtamaki's load centers and instead operates as a hedge against varying electricity prices.
The buyer should also receive renewable energy guarantees of origin (GOs) for the solar energy purchased, plus the knowledge new renewable energy generation capacity would not have been possible without its involvement, an example of ‘additionality.'
Construction on the solar farms will start next year with an expected energy delivery date, to Huhtamaki, in the third quarter of 2023.

“We need to see policies that match the talk and, up to now, we don't have many policies that match the talk across the continent, apart from very few countries, such as Senegal,” KPMG‘s Martins Arogie told the Solar Roofs Central Africa event.
The event focused on the rooftop segment of the solar industry in Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sudan, and Zambia.
Buildings are key to our daily lives and significantly impact our health and wellbeing. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints and employ heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from construction to their use and demolition. pv magazine’s UP Initiative is focusing on the role solar and energy storage can play in greening the world’s urban spaces. Read our urban solar coverage here.
Arogie, a partner at the global accountancy firm, said governments need to provide up front incentives for customers to choose solar over diesel generators, as discussing the advantages of PV panels over the entire life of a solar rooftop was not enough of a pull. “Today, the average cost of investing in solar panels and batteries is a lot higher than the average cost of the initial cost of fossil fuel generators,” he said, adding: “The solar panels and batteries will cost less over the lifetime of both assets but customers don't look at lifetime duration. They look at initial expenditure.”
Metkel Z Abraham, chief operating officer of Ugandan solar roof and pump provider Aptech Africa, said: “The most important policy that we see now is tax exemption on solar products which has a big impact since the initial cost of solar products is expensive. Unfortunately, most countries in the central region [of Africa] don't have this policy.”
Abraham also called for installation standards and a requirement for capable, qualified solar installers.
Policymakers should join forces with the private sector to find a way to persuade banks to offer more affordable finance for solar projects, according to Brayson Hillary Kisamo, East Africa sales manager for Chinese PV manufacturer JA Solar. At the moment, he said, banks charge as much as 15-25% interest on loans for solar projects as they attempt to hedge against often wildly fluctuating local currencies.
Alda Manuel, renewable energy project manager for Angolan infrastructure and telecoms company Anglobal, said Africa needs its own supply chain of materials used in solar manufacturing, as well as wider adoption of feed-in tariffs for the owners of solar rooftops, and better availability of electric grid connections.
Manuel also pointed to the importance of preparing policy for the recycling of the waste materials that will follow the first wave of Central African solar installations, and said the government of hydro-dependent Angola is aiming to draw 70% of its electricity from renewables next year and is deploying carbon taxes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/20/high-energy-prices-mean-big-gains-for-smart-metered-belgian-pv-system-owners/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 20, 2021",High energy prices mean big gains for smart-metered Belgian PV system owners,"The energy regulator of Belgium's Flemish-speaking macro-region of Flanders, VREG, reported last week that residential PV system owners that agreed to install smart meters and leave the net metering scheme were currently benefiting from a tariff for power injection of around €0.11/kWh.
“This tariff is about €0.08 higher than that paid to smart-metered prosumers at the beginning of the year,” Dirk Van Evercooren, managing director of Flemish renewable energy association Organisatie voor Duurzame Energie (ODE) Vlaanderen, told pv magazine.
According to him, PV system owners operating under the smart meter regime are not only benefiting from the rising injection tariffs, which are linked to the offtake price of electricity, but also – and more importantly — from the high value of the kilowatt-hours they self-consume. “This is because the price for electricity has risen to a staggering €0.39/kWh in November,” he said.  
“Summing up these two gains and considering that high energy prices may stay at these levels for a while, the prosumers relying on smart meters may see the payback time of their installations more than halved compared to the numbers in January 2021,” he further explained, noting that the payback time of net-metered projects will also have declined over the same period, although less than that for smart-metered installations.
Prosumers under smart meters are receiving payments based on actual electricity usage and injection, while those that don’t have a digital meter and are still benefitting from net metering have no direct financial compensation for the injected electricity, but the financial equivalent of the injected kilowatt-hours is deducted from the household's electricity bill. “If the consumption of the net-metered prosumer is higher than PV power production, he will have to buy electricity from the grid at the normal rate,” Van Evercooren explained. “If the production is higher than consumption, he will get nothing for injecting power into the grid. His benefit, however, is still big, as all energy the PV system produces is substantially being treated as self-consumption.”
In theory, both prosumer categories are seeing big gains under the current high electricity prices scenario, but those of the PV system owners under smart meters are larger, as these were exempted from paying the grid fee introduced for residential prosumers by the Flemish authorities in 2015. “This fee was modeled to reflect a self-consumption level of about 28%, assuming that 72% of production is being injected and taken off within the same billing period,” he added. “Therefore, if you have a self-consumption rate higher than 28% and a digital meter, you don’t pay the prosumer tariff and therefore your business case can be better than the net metering case.”
According to figures from Flemish grid operator Fluvius, more than 277,500 PV systems are using smart meters in Flanders — almost half of all PV systems installed in the region. Overall, around 1.1 million residential customers have opted for smart meters since a new regulation was introduced.
“These figures are remarkable, because the loss of the net-metering regime due to the court ruling on 14 January 2021 caused a massive rupture in the acceptance of the digital meter, even among non-prosumers,” Van Evercooren said, referring to a ruling of Belgium's constitutional court, which canceled the 15-year grace period granted to residential PV system owners to keep operating under net metering despite the arrival of smart meters. “Currently, there is a campaign running to demonstrate the benefits of the digital meter and the energy transition in general,” he added, stressing that the smart meter regime is profitable for PV system owners, especially for those households with a high self-consumption rate.
Most of Flanders' installed PV capacity is represented by PV systems not exceeding 10 kW in size installed under a green certificate scheme which expired in 2014, or under the net metering regime.
Each of Belgium’s three macro-regions, including Wallonia and Brussels, has its own regulatory framework for solar and renewable energy. The country has the potential to reach 18 GW of solar capacity by 2040, according to a late-2017 report by grid operator Elia.

The 25MW/48MWh system, called the Giga Buffalo battery, will be supplied to energy utility Eneco and local developer GIGA Storage BV and co-located with wind and solar assets in the province of Flevoland.
Touted as the first large-scale energy storage project based on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry in Europe, the Buffalo battery is expected to become operational in October 2022. The system will be located close to the Wageningen University & Research and will be connected to the local Windnet smart grid.
As announced earlier this year, Eneco will use the battery to forecast supply-demand errors on the intraday trading market. The battery will also allow the addition of more renewables to the grid, regulate frequency and improve revenues. Together with Giga Storage BV, Eneco previously deployed the 12 MW Giga Rhino battery that relies on technology provided by NEC Energy Solutions at the same site.
The deployment of such utility-scale batteries could alleviate the increasingly serious bottleneck issues the Dutch grid is facing. Electricity transmission system operator Tennet has been issuing network congestion warnings caused by the “rapid growth of wind and solar farms” and has even considered offering large-scale solar power generators incentives to reduce their output or power down entirely.
In order to do its bit towards the government's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 49% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and 95% by 2050, the battery deployment will need to also pick up pace at the residential and commercial level. A recently published white paper from Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national and regional electricity and gas network operators, and the Netherlands' association of energy storage technology providers, Energy Storage NL, found that a faster phasing out of the net metering scheme combined with a rebate program for storage systems would make it possible to bring battery technologies to commercial maturity in the Dutch market as early as 2023.
According to the two associations, if these rules are not amended and no incentives provided for storage, residential and commercial batteries may not reach commercial maturity in the Netherlands until 2028. If, instead, a rebate scheme covering 30% of the costs for buying and installing a battery is introduced, storage could already become viable by 2023.

Renewables investor Magnora ASA, which derives revenue from oil production and processing, today announced it has raised its holding in Swedish tech company Evolar AB, from 40.7% to 50%.
Magnora originally acquired a 28.44% holding in Uppsala-based Evolar in November last year and said it has the cash on hand to exercise the third of three raised-commitment options which would give it ownership of 63.5% of the CIGS (copper-indium-gallium-selenide) thin-film technology developer.
Evolar is working on developing production equipment which would enable manufacturers of conventional solar cells to raise the performance of their products by applying a thin film of perovskite materials to the devices. Evolar's solution is intended as a bolt-on piece of equipment which would upgrade, rather than replace, cell production lines.
The investor said it had raised its stake to fund further development of the system.
In an update to the Oslo Stock Exchange in the second quarter of 2019, Magnora said it holds royalties related to the Western Isles floating, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) oil facility operated by Scottish energy exploration business Dana in the U.K.'s North Sea waters, and to Shell's planned Penguins oil and gas field in the northern North Sea. On the former project, Magnora said it is entitled to $0.50 per barrel of oil produced and offloaded and, at the latter, it anticipated income of around $16 million upon production of 4 million barrels of oil at the site.

Before choosing the perovskite material for the cell, the scientists tested hundreds of different perovskite mixtures and investigated, in particular, their thermal stability using a self-constructed, high-throughput screening platform.
The 20.9% efficient device was built without the ionic dopants or metal oxide nanoparticles that are commonly used to contact the cell, as these can be subject to secondary reactions at higher temperatures, they further explained.
The entire cell electrode was embedded in a sort of protective shell with a double-layer polymer structure, with the bottom side undoped and the top side doped with a non-ionic dopant, which is claimed to protect against degradation and, at the same time, ensures that the contact is maintained. “This architecture protects the very sensitive interface to the perovskite and, on the other hand, it shows exceptionally stable conductivity, even at elevated temperatures,” they emphasized. “The dopant-free polymer provides an acid barrier between the perovskite and the acid-doped polymer.”
Under standard illumination conditions, the cell was able to operate for 1,450 hours at elevated temperatures of around 65 degrees Celsius and, at the end of the testing period, it still retained 99% of its original efficiency.
“Long-term prediction is always difficult but the perovskite solar cell we have now developed could certainly be operated for more than 20,000 hours, under normal circumstances,” said researcher Christoph Brabec.
The cell was presented in the paper A bilayer conducting polymer structure for planar perovskite solar cells with over 1,400 hours operational stability at elevated temperatures, which was recently published in nature energy.
Looking forward, the academics say they want to improve cell efficiency. “With an efficiency of 20.9%, the tested cell does not yet fully exploit the potential. Twenty-four to 25% should be possible in the near future,” explained research co-author, Yicheng Zhao.

The Coal 2021 report, which includes data from 2019 and 2020; an estimate for this year; and forecasts out to 2024, stated the IEA overestimated the extent to which demand for coal slumped as Covid-19 savaged the global economy, and also destroyed the idea global coal demand may have peaked in 2018.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
While noting the rebound in coal demand in the U.S. and Europe as economies bounced back from the pandemic will not be sustained – and pointing out the shift to solar and other low-carbon power in countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines and Bangladesh – the IEA said the voracious appetite for the fuel in China and India will drive record demand highs next year.
The world's two most populous nations between them make up two-thirds of global coal demand, said the IEA, and provisions for coal in China's latest five-year plan, plus the Indian “government's goal of raising domestic coal production,” will ensure the world stays well short of the progress required to reach a net zero economy by mid century. That shortfall is likely to persist until at least 2024, wrote the report's authors, with China set to experience 1% annual rises in coal demand, and India set for 4% annual market growth in each of the next three years.
With both nations expected to have experienced record coal demand this year, in part because renewable energy projects have been unable to keep up with electricity demand during the post-Covid economic recovery, the global market for the fossil fuel is expected to hit a record 8.03 billion tons next year, before maintaining that level for the next two years, according to the IEA study.
The Chinese and Indian governments are not the only villains of the piece, though, according to the report, with “Russia developing more coal fields … and expanding export facilities” as part of its 2020 energy strategy; Indonesia and Mongolia also expanding export capacity; and with Australia remaining the world's biggest exporter of the metallurgical coal used to fire processes such as steelmaking.

“It is a proud moment for Tata Power to win this large-scale hybrid (wind and solar) power generation project,” Tata Power CEO, Praveer Sinha, said in a statement. “This will further promote the share of renewable power in the overall energy mix, thus strengthening our position as the market leader in the renewable space. It will also encourage other states to switch to green power to usher in an era of clean energy in the country.”
According to a recent report by JMK Research and Climate Trends, the total wind-solar hybrid capacity in India could increase by almost 80 times from currently only 148 MW to 11.6 GW by 2023. The tenders held by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for wind-solar hybrid projects without storage have so far attracted low tariffs of INR2.67/kWh (US¢3.7/kWh), which are comparable to plain solar tariffs.
In another report, JMK Research and Climate Trends found that the levelized cost of electricity generation for a hypothetical hybrid solar-wind-lithium-ion battery storage system for the Indian state of Tamil Nadu is currently INR 4.97/kWh ($0.068/kWh) and is expected to fall to INR 3.4/kWh by 2030. In comparison, the cost of electricity produced from new coal power plants in Tamil Nadu is between INR 4.5-6/kWh.

The Northern Territory (NT) government’s tender for a new and improved $45 million 35 MVA (megavolt amps) ‘Big Battery’ for the Darwin-Katherine electricity grid has been won by Swiss-headquartered Hitachi Energy. 
The Darwin-Katherine Battery Energy Storage System (DK BESS) is expected to generate cost savings of approximately $9.8 million annually and pay for itself within five years (or thereabouts). 
Hitachi Energy Country Managing Director, Bernard Norton, said “Hitachi Energy’s battery energy storage solution will be part of an intelligent electrical ecosystem and ensure full utilisation of solar energy generation and less reliance on fossil fuels.”
Before adding: “This battery energy storage system will allow greater penetration of renewable energy in the Territory, helping to ensure a sustainable, flexible and secure energy system for today’s generations and those to come.”.”
The DK BESS is set to be built at NT energy utility Territory Generation’s Channel Island Power Station and service the Darwin-Katherine grid that services 150,000 Territorians (one in six of whom have solar panels on their rooftops). The DK BESS is expected to unlock more capacity for residential and C&I PV. 
Territory Generation CEO, Gerhard Laubscher, said “The Darwin-Katherine battery is a cornerstone of Territory Generation’s Fleet Transition. It is key to unlocking flexibility in our fleet to better manage the increasing impacts of solar on the system.”
What is more, the DK BESS will reduce the Darwin-Katherine grid’s dependency on gas-fired spinning reserves and provide 58,000 tonnes of avoided emissions. 
“We’ve backed renewables and so have Territorians,” said NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner, “they know renewables deliver cleaner, cheaper and secure power. The cutting-edge technology in our Battery Energy Storage System will reinforce the Northern Territory as the solar capital and comeback capital of Australia.”
NT Minister for Renewables and Energy, Eva Lawler, added that “The awarding of the BESS tender is a huge step forward in our plan for 50% renewables by 2030 – it is the cornerstone of our Darwin-Katherine System Plan. Our electricity will be reliable and stable, while also being affordable for Territorians.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/20/california-to-require-solar-power-and-batteries-in-commercial-structures/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 20, 2021",California to require solar power and batteries in commercial structures,"From pv magazine USA
California has become the first state in the United States to require solar power plus energy storage to be integrated into all future commercial structures via its most recent update to building codes. Additionally, the new building code added a requirement that all new residential construction must be ready for the addition of energy storage.
The rules that the California Clean Energy Commission (CEC) voted to approve can be found in the 2022 Build Energy Efficiency Standards. The regulatory body estimates this requirement may add 280 MW of annual solar capacity, as well as 400 MWh of energy storage.

The highest level technical requirements for the solar plus storage systems specify that the solar portion should be sized to meet a target of 60% of the structure’s loads. The target energy storage component should be sized to reduce electricity exports to 10% of the total solar generation.
The batteries must have a usable capacity of at least 5 kWh, a round trip efficiency of greater than 80%, and greater than 70% nameplate capacity remaining after 10 years (warrantied) or 4,000 cycles.
In addition to the commercial requirements, new residential construction must also be battery-ready. This requires that new homes have a 225-amp busbar, four backed-up circuits (two of which must be the refrigerator and bedroom receptacle outlet), and also a subpanel or a split-bus main panel for those circuits.
The code requires battery systems to be capable of remote programming. The motivation behind this programmability requirement is the state’s goal of using distributed energy storage to ‘harmonize’ with the power grid. Many of these programmable modes also require solar power to be coupled with the battery system.
The Basic Control mode dictates that by default, the battery must be able to charge from a solar photovoltaic system. And when the solar system isn’t outputting enough to cover the onsite load, the battery must be able to step in.
The next level control is Time of Use. In this case, the battery shall be programmed to charge only by solar electricity, and discharge during the highest priced Time of Use hours of the day. The system should have the ability to be programmed for at least three Time of Use seasons.

The last programmable feature is the Advanced Demand Response Flexibility Control. The state describes this type of storage system as being capable of altering the charge and discharge periods in response to signals from the local utility or a third-party aggregator. OhmConnect has already used this type of system to help Californians earn millions of dollars through its energy demand management during grid events.
These control requirements would allow for the solar plus storage systems to be Virtual Power Plant ready. Companies like Sunrun, Tesla, Sonnen and others are already installing systems with these technical capabilities.
The utility noted that battery sizing design would be integrated with the existing energy efficiency designs that guide sizing of heating and cooling systems, solar, within the state’s sixteen unique ‘climate zones’.
This new legislation exists, of course, within an already complex and extensive body of solar-focused, clean energy legislation in California.
The code change follows the groundbreaking 2019 Building Energy Code update, which required all residential construction to include solar panels. This author believes that the requirement may significantly lower the price of new construction residential solar power. Naturally, all of these standards contribute to California’s goal of reaching a net zero carbon footprint by 2045, and ensuing carbon negative footprint in years following that milestone.
And, Monday of this week we saw the Public Utility Commission receive a recommendation for aggressive cut backs to net metering compensation. The group specifically cited energy storage incentivization as a substantial factor in their decision.
