The two companies will conduct proof of concept trials in various places, including Woven City, a human-centered smart city currently under construction in Japan's Susono City, Shizuoka Prefecture. The cartridge, 400 mm in length and 180 mm in diameter, weighs around 5 kg. “Woven City will explore and test an array of energy applications using hydrogen cartridges including mobility, household applications, and many future possibilities we have yet to imagine,” the company said.
Shaanxi Normal University in China led a research team in designing a high-quality N-doped graphene aerogel supporting ruthenium nanocrystal (Ru-NCs/N-GA) nanocomposites in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). “The reaction precursors of graphene oxide (GO) and ruthenium(III)-polyallylamine (RuIII-PAA) complex uniformly anchored in a graphene aerogel serve as the N source and Ru source,” the team wrote in the results, published in Chinese Journal of Catalysis. The researchers clarified that it was still a challenge to improve the catalytic performance of Ru-carbon nanocomposites. The final aim is to substitute platinum with ruthenium in electrocatalytic water splitting.
The US Department of Energy (DOE) released a notice of intent (NOI) to fund the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s $8 billion program to develop regional clean hydrogen hubs (H2Hubs) across the United States. H2Hubs will support DOE’s ongoing initiative to help drive down the cost of hydrogen production, transport, storage, and utilization across multiple sectors. “The selection of the regional H2Hubs will utilize cross-office collaboration and consider factors such as environmental justice, community engagement, consent-based siting, equity, and workforce development,” wrote DOE.
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and a Japanese consortium comprising Eneos and Mitsui, have signed a joint commercialization study agreement to build a clean hydrogen supply chain between the UAE and Japan. The idea is to transport blue hydrogen from ADNOC's Ruwais plant and convert it to methylcyclohexan (MCH). “The three companies will conduct a technical demonstration of a hydrogen production facility with an annual scale of 50,000 tons and a feasibility study to expand it to 200,000 tons per year,” the Japanese companies wrote. 
Masdar, the Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy company, has signed two implementation agreements with Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Energy. The first relates to the development of onshore wind and PV projects with a combined capacity of 2 GW. The second likewise covers 2 GW of integrated offshore wind and green hydrogen projects.
Petrolyn Chemie in Dubai has signed an agreement with three South Korean companies (Korea Electric Power, Samsung C&T and Korea Western Power) to build a $1 billion green hydrogen and ammonia production plant in the United Arab Emirates, Reuters reported. 
ACME Group and India’s Karnataka state announced a INR 520 billion (€6.25 billion) memorandum of understanding to invest in a green hydrogen and ammonia plant over the next five years. 
Lhyfe has received approval to start construction of its green hydrogen plant on a 10,000 square meter industrial site in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The 10 MW, 4 tonne-a-day project includes a public hydrogen filling station and a pipeline. It is expected to be operational in early 2024. “Future customers for this project are located in the immediate vicinity of the site and in the region,” the French green hydrogen producer said. 
Britain has announced new government funding for GBP 31 million to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, using hydrogen for off-road machinery and industrial applications. “British Steel in Scunthorpe will receive GBP 161,050 for a study into switching its manufacturing processes from natural gas to green hydrogen,” the British government stated.

French energy provider Volterres, a subsidiary of Lyon-based Sun'R, has developed a traceability tool for hourly electricity purchases that enables final clients to know which portion of the energy they buy comes from a renewable energy facility located in their proximity.
“Based on the blockchain to certify traceability on an hourly basis, the tool reveals in real time the nature of the energy sold to each consumer and which renewable power plants have contributed to this supply,” Volterres project manager Xavier Bottou told pv magazine France.
“In this way, consumers can follow the composition of their electricity supply in complete transparency, which strengthens the links with local renewable energy parks and therefore their social acceptance,” stated Volterres director Alexis Bouanani.
In the Toulouse area, the agglomeration community of Sicoval, a unit of the Saint Gobain group, and local energy cooperative SDEHG have already subscribed to this offer. The latter uses it to supply its network of 100 electric charging stations deployed in the territory. “This example illustrates a very interesting hourly consistency between the production of electricity during solar generation peaks and the consumption of these charging stations. Thus, certain new electricity-consuming uses, such as electric mobility, can offer relevant compatibility with decarbonized and decentralized means of production such as photovoltaics,” Bouanani affirmed.
 
According to Volterres, the offer is also attractive in terms of cost. “By talking to small businesses in [the department of] Haute-Garonne, we have seen that, for them, subscribing to a PPA is often extremely long and complicated,” Bouanani added. “We allow them to get electricity from the network at the same price as conventional electricity while being able to guarantee more virtuous sourcing.”
In order to strengthen the acceptance of the energy transition among individuals, Volterres also joined forces in May 2022 with renewable energy developer and producer ERG to offer a green and local electricity supply for residents near the Valley 2 East wind farm, which was inaugurated in 2019 and expanded in 2022.
This partnership allows eligible consumers to have access to energy produced locally, sustainably and at a preferential rate. The first 200 subscribers benefit from a €100 discount during the first year of supply, which means approximately 10% savings on the average annual electricity budget of a household.

Indian automaker Maruti Suzuki has set up a 20 MWdc solar power plant at its factory in Manesar, Haryana.
The carport-style PV power plant will produce 28,000 MWh of solar power per annum, contributing to 11.5% of its facility’s total electricity requirements, while helping to avoid 20,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. The power will be equivalent to the energy required to produce more than 67,000 cars per year.
Maruti Suzuki claims that the solar carport – which KEC International built with Cheetah monofacial series modules from JinkoSolar – is Asia’s largest such project. Upon completion, it will be able to accommodate about 9,000 finished vehicles.
With the 20 MWp solar plant at Manesar, Maruti Suzuki’s combined solar capacity across its plants in India now stands at 26.3 MWp. This includes its first 1 MWp solar power plant in Manesar, which was later expanded to 1.3 MWp, and a 5 MW carport-style solar plant at its Gurugram facility.

Households and small businesses in England and Wales can secure GBP 5,000 off the cost of replacing an oil or gas boiler with an air source heat pump or GBP 6,000 for a ground source device.
The GBP 5,000 discount is also available for the cost of installing a biomass boiler, although the government press release issued in May to announce the program added such devices would only be eligible “in limited circumstances,” without adding further details.
The government is aiming for price parity with fossil fuel boilers by 2030 and said the grants would help drive down costs between 25% and 50% against conventional boilers by 2025.
Greg Jackson, CEO of utility Octopus Energy, was quoted in the press release. He said: “Heat pumps are up to four times more energy efficient than gas boilers but they need to come down in price. The government’s new scheme will not only reduce the cost – often to the same price as a boiler – but it’ll kick-start an industry so that, sooner or later, we won’t need subsidies.”
The government has already brought in a five-year moratorium on the VAT applied to the cost of installing heat pumps and biomass boilers as part of a package of measures to help households through the current cost-of-living crisis.
Under the scheme, which applies to installations made since April 1, the heat pump installer completes the application and applies the discount.
The program will have a GBP 150 million annual budget until the end of March 2025.

The environment minister of the Navarra regional government, Itziar Gómez, announced last week in Brussels that the 160 MW project proposed by Spain's National Association of Photovoltaic Energy Producers (Anpier) to generate sustainable electricity by covering with solar panels the Navarra Canal, one of the country's largest artificial irrigation canals, was now moving forward.
According to her, the regional administration is currently considering the construction of a pilot photovoltaic array with an initial length of 9 km, which would ensure the supply of green electricity to cover the demand of 52% of the buildings of the regional government. The solar plant is expected to reach a total length of 198 km.
“We already have a preliminary economic feasibility study prepared by the Industry Association of Navarra for this pilot section, which should generate around 28.5 GWh a year,” Gómez said, noting that the study also assessed the plant construction and operation costs. “The project is economically viable.” He added that the project would also receive an unspecified form of support from the European Union.
Anpier said in September that the project was replicable in all channels with similar characteristics that exist in all the autonomous communities of Spain. “At Anpier, we have been supporting small and medium-sized photovoltaic installations and asked that they be implemented in places where distribution and transmission networks are more efficient, where existing infrastructures can be used, or in places that do not present natural heritage or without specific agricultural use, where the installations do not alter the natural habitats and farmland,” the association said.
Large scale solar projects on canals are proliferating across the world. Recent projects were announced in India, France, United States, and Pakistan, among others. These projects provide electricity without occupying land and reducing water evaporation.

For this, a bandgap of at least 1.55 eV is needed.”
The scientists built the cell using a three-stage co-evaporation technique and a high-temperature absorber deposition process. They also utilized cadmium sulfide (CdS) for the buffer layer, ITO and IOH contacts with a thickness of 180/310 nm, and silver alloying to increase the absorber bandgap energy.
As conventional transparent back contacts (TBCs), ITO contacts may cause the formation of gallium oxigen (GaOx) at the TBC/absorber interface, which is detrimental to the cell's fill factor. “ITO forms a similar amount of GaOx as IOH,” Keller emphasized. “What we found is that a fine-tuning of the sodium fluoride (NaF) supply, as well as using stoichiometric absorber composition, enables high fill factor values and most likely mitigates GaOx formation.”
“The ITO films used in this study effectively block sodium (Na) diffusion from the substrate, according to glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) measurements,” the researchers highlighted, noting that the origin for the increased sodium sensitivity for the ACIGS solar cell remained unclear.
The ACIGS cell with a band gap of 1.44 eV and with the ITO contacts achieved a power conversion efficiency of 10.4%, an open-circuit voltage of 817 mV, a short-circuit current of 19.3 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 63.4%. The same device with the IOH contacts reached an efficiency of 12.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 835 mV, a short-circuit current of 22.1 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 65.2%.
For comparison, a reference CIGS cell without silver with ITO contacts achieved a power conversion efficiency of 11.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 828 mV, a short-circuit current of 19.8 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 68.0%. The same device with the IOH contacts reached an efficiency of 10.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 828 mV, a short-circuit current of 18.6 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 67.9%.
“An efficiency of 12% is reached for the best cell with an IOH back contact,” the academics stated. “This is the highest reported value for a wide-gap chalcopyrite solar cell on a TBC. In addition, a very high infrared transparency is possible, due to the negligible free charge-carrier absorption (FCA) of the IOH (compare Figure 6) and the absence of an interlayer to improve the electronical properties of the contact.”
“We plan to try fabricating these devices in superstrate configuration in the future, which requires the usage of thermally stable buffer layers. In this way, only one glass sheet is needed, which would reduce the costs in a final module,” Keller further explained, adding that efficiency of up to 18% would be required to help the device reach commercial maturity.
The researchers presented the cell in the paper “Wide-Gap Chalcopyrite Solar Cells with Indium Oxide–Based Transparent Back Contacts,” published in RRL Solar.

“The frontside frameless design can improve the PV module’s drainage function so that the rain washes away the dust and reduces the dust sedimentation,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “This feature can reduce the frequency of cleaning operations and maintenance activities and also help avoid hotspots.”
The Full Screen panel is available in five versions with power output ranging from 450 W to 470 W and efficiency spanning from 20.85% and 21.78%. The open-circuit voltage is between 62.0 V and 62.8 V and the short-circuit current between 9.19 A and 9.43 A, with the maximum system voltage being 1,500 V.
The new product measures 1,903 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs 23.5 kg. It is built with 3.2 mm anti-reflective glass and an IP68 enclosure. It has a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The module comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2% and the 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.80% of the nominal output power.
According to the manufacturer, the panels have endured pressure tests performed by Germany's certification organization TÜV Nord and were awarded the Outdoor Yield Performance from the TÜV Lab Test. “Our product can ensure an increase in power generation of up to 11.5%, according to a report published by the TÜV Lab Test itself,” the spokesperson stated.

Set in 2015, SDG 7 calls for “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030 and includes the goals of providing universal access to electricity and clean cooking, of improving energy efficiency and accelerating clean power deployment, and of financing those ambitions.
The latest annual update on the progress of SDG 7 was published last week by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).
The 266-page document showed funds for SDG 7 slowed in all global regions except Oceania in 2019.
In that region, the rise in funding from $77 million to $132 million was mostly devoted to solar generation capacity, the report stated.
Funding for solar more than halved in western Asia and North Africa in 2019, from $1 billion a year earlier to $460 million, helping drive a 22% total year on year reduction in SDG 7 funding in the region, from $2.3 billion to $1.8 billion.
Sub-Saharan Africa saw only a 1.7% reduction in SDG 7 funding from 2018 to 2019, Irena calculated, with the $4 billion attracted amounting to 37% of global SDG 7 commitments to developing countries.
While a chunk of the cash was devoted to solar, the report noted PV funding was “no longer on the rise” in Africa in 2019.
Despite resilient funding for Africa, the study pointed out Guinea, Madagascar, Malawi, and Mozambique all saw the proportion of their populations without access to electricity rise, from 2018 to 2020.
The study added only 12% of people in Burundi had access to electricity in 2020, only 11% in Chad, and only 7% in South Sudan.
While Chad and East Timor received SDG 7 funding in 2019, after an absence the previous year, according to Irena, Sao Tome et Principe, Eritrea, and Kiribati received nothing to drive the development goal in 2019.
The document stated 21% of renewable energy funding in 2019 went to solar, down from 24% a year earlier, from 28% in 2012, and from a peak of 51% in 2016 which was driven largely by projects backed by the International Finance Corp private sector arm of the World Bank.
The $10.9 billion total funds directed toward SDG 7 goals in 2019 was lower than the $11.2 billion recorded in 2010, according to the study, and well short of the $24.7 billion observed in 2017.
That could be in part down to donor nations diverting cash to their Covid-19 spending, the report noted, adding 90% of the $710 billion of Covid spending relevant to SDG 7 went to advanced economies.
Rising energy prices saw 90 million people in Asia and Africa who previously had access to electricity become unable to afford power in 2021, the report said.
In terms of the outlook for SDG 7, attaining universal access to electricity will require 100 million new connections per year, with 80 million of them in Africa, according to Irena.
That will require $35 billion per year through to 2030, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) calculations, plus $6 billion per year for clean cooking.
Reaching a net zero carbon global economy by 2050 will require funding to hit $4 trillion per year by 2030, according to the body, and capping the average global temperature rise this century at 1.5 degrees Celsius will need almost $5 trillion per year through to 2030, according to Irena's figures.
Renewables project funding alone needs to hit $1 trillion to $1.7 trillion annually, the IEA has estimated, with more effort needed in the heating and transport sectors to match the achievements to date in clean electricity generation.
As things stand, Irena has predicted 670 million people will be without electricity at the end of the decade and 2.1 billion will lack access to clean cooking – which includes gas appliances.

There are many ways to build out the energy transition to renewables, and some are more sensitive to nature than others. Energy sprawl, or the increased use of land and water spaces to support energy infrastructure, could rise over the next several decades, working against some of the environmental goals that are the foundation of renewable energy deployment.
Distributed rooftop solar is one way to prevent energy sprawl, and another method, agrivoltaics, the co-location of farming and solar, can be effective in supporting local wildlife and farming practices while adding large amounts of emissions-free energy to the grid.
The AgriSolar Clearinghouse, an informational and networking organization dedicated to connecting farmers, landowners, and solar developers around the buildout of agrivoltaics, shared a case study of one solar farm that supported not just one species, but several. The study focused on the 23.4 MW Arnprior solar project in Ottawa, Canada, developed by EDF Renewables (EDFR). The project sits on 180 acres of land and can meet the peak energy demand of about 7,000 homes.
The pioneering project was built in 2009, at the time doubling the PV capacity of the entire country of Canada. Six years following construction, one of the landowners expressed interest to EDFR to return the land to functioning agriculture after decommissioning.
EDFR took interest in the idea, but decided not to wait for decommissioning to take action. In 2015 it began phasing out the use of pesticides and herbicides. By 2016, as declining bee populations became an international focus, it reached out to a local honey company to install hives at the site. Two hives were installed, and side by side with renewable energy, 100 jars of honey per year were produced. Today, efforts have expanded, and over 300 jars are made each year.
In 2017, EDFR received an award by the Government of Canada to provide a habitat for the monarch butterfly. Arnprior became the first solar project in Canada to be awarded by the Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk. In tandem with the Pollinator Partnership, EDFR planted native wildflowers and milkweed, the exclusive host plant for monarch butterfly larvae. Within a month of the partnership, larvae and butterflies began to appear.
Later that year, the Arnprior site launched a pilot program for sheep grazing as a method of vegetation management to reduce shading on the solar modules. Local business Shady Creek Lamb Company brought 50 ewes to snack on vegetation and optimize solar production. The array site proved beneficial to the local sheep farmers, providing an area for the flock to expand without having to rent or buy additional land.
The arrangement offered the sheep farmers additional revenue streams, as they were paid for the sheep’s vegetation management services. In 2022, over 500 sheep roam the site from spring to fall, boosting production, eliminating the need for chemical-based plant killers, and providing free range lamb and fiber to the local market.
In total, the site has proved to be a win-win for both farmers and solar developers. This agrivoltaic model could prove useful for the energy transition. In California alone, Environment California said as much as 148,000 acres of land could be used to support solar by 2045, based on a state regulator's estimated deployment of 28.5 GW. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles. With this development comes the opportunity to build a future that is sensitive to all life on Earth and the farming needs of local communities.

Solaria Corporation settled its patent infringement claims against Canadian Solar and under terms of the agreement, Solaria agreed to stop the litigations in exchange for Canadian Solar stopping the importation of shingled solar modules into the US for seven years.
The settlement resolves patent infringement disputes that Solaria brought in 2020 against Canadian Solar in Federal District Court for the Northern District of California and in the United States International Trade Commission (ITC). The suit claimed that Canadian Solar infringed Solaria’s US patent concerning a process for separating photovoltaic strips from silicon solar cells for use in shingled solar panels.
Solaria asserted in the lawsuit that “it first introduced Canadian Solar to its high-efficiency, high-density module (HDM) technology in 2014, when representatives of Canadian Solar evaluated Solaria’s next-generation shingling technology for a potential licensing deal. After further collaborations between the companies over the ensuing year, in which Solaria disclosed its proprietary technology and business strategies to Canadian Solar under an NDA, no deal was reached.”
“Solaria initially filed suit against Canadian Solar because they chose to ignore and violate Solaria’s core intellectual property (IP). When rendering his Initial Determination in the ITC investigation, the Chief Administrative Law Judge recognized that Canadian Solar infringed Solaria’s patents,” said Tony Alvarez, Solaria CEO. He explained that in that Initial Determination, issued in October 2021, Chief Administrative Law Judge Cheney found that Canadian Solar, a Chinese solar panel manufacturer, violated section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, in their importation of shingled solar modules.
“Solaria remains open to cooperating with companies that recognize the value of Solaria’s IP; we’ve licensed Solaria’s technology to other firms in the industry. However, Solaria will actively defend our IP against any infringers, and protect our technology for ourselves and our valued partners,” stated Alverez.
This is not the first time Solaria has sued other solar manufacturers related to its technology and patent use. pv magazine reported, for example, that in 2018, Solaria filed suit against South Korea’s Genesem for using Solaria’s patents outside of agreed upon terms. In 2017, Solaria resolved a legal dispute with GCL-Poly of China involving alleged stolen trade secrets for shingle-cell solar technology. The suit was settled under NDA. Solaria also sued Jiangsu Seraphim Solar System and Suzhou Autoway System for mis-using its patents.

The dominant story in solar for 2022 has been the Department of Commerce’s investigation into alleged anticircumvention/antidumping violations of four solar panel suppliers in Southeastern Asian countries suspected of harboring Chinese solar goods. Tariffs attached to goods supplied by these countries could range from 50 to 250% of the cost of goods and would back-date to the February filing by US-based manufacturer Auxin solar.
The uncertainty and risk level caused by this investigation essentially froze the solar industry in its tracks, with hundreds of megawatts of projects canceled or delayed and the industry cutting its forecasts for deployment this year in half. This uncertainty will now be alleviated, for now, as the Biden Administration enacted a 24-month moratorium on tariffs from these locations.
This development came with praise from most major players in the solar industry, save US-based manufacturers like First Solar. One of the major criticisms of the investigation was that it appeared to be a feeble, poorly planned attempt to boost US-based manufacturing. Many industry players said they were open to supporting domestic manufacture of US solar goods, but that the tariffs were a short-term measure that blindsided developers and crushed deployment in the near- and mid-term.
The moratorium was launched alongside a few other actions designed to support domestic manufacturing, indicating the White House heard the near-uniform message from the solar industry that executive actions and stated goals were misaligned. With these new actions, the Biden administration is steering the market back toward the high bar of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030, among other climate-driven emissions goals.
While the actions have been generally celebrated, the industry is still awaiting long-term industrial policy like the provisions introduced in earlier drafts of the Build Back Better Act. It is calling for a swift end to the investigation for greater long-term clarity.
“While I applaud the President for his leadership in building a brighter future today, the lingering threat of tariffs stemming from the ongoing circumvention case will continue to jeopardize our clean energy progress. I strongly urge the Department of Commerce to work toward a swift end to this case and put the solar industry fully back to work.” George Hershman, CEO, SOLV Energy
In addition to the halt of tariffs, the White House invoked the Defense Production Act for clean energy, and stated goals to use the full power of federal procurement through master supply agreements and giving solar goods “super preference” status.
The Defense Production Act
In pursuit of a rapid expansion to 22.5 GW of domestic solar manufacturing by 2024, the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 was invoked. This act will not end the antidumping investigation, but it will eliminate the provision that would have back-dated tariffs to the date of the February Auxin Solar petition.
The DPA, to be administered by the Department of Energy will be directed to boost five key technologies, including solar panel parts including modules and module components, insulation for buildings, efficient electric heat pumps for heating and cooling, equipment for making electricity-generated fuels, including electrolyzes, fuel cells, and related platinum group metals, and critical power grid infrastructure like transformers.
The Act will encourage strong labor standards, including agreements for project labor and community benefits that ensure prevailing wages are paid and a quota of local hiring is met. The administration also stated goals of environmental justice and empowering clean energy transition in low-income communities that have historically (and continue to) bear an inequitable burden in energy-related injustices.
Following the announcement, the Biden administration said it will meet with industry, labor, environmental justice, and key stakeholders to enable a strong implementation of the DPA.
Federal procurement
The administration said it is also using the full power of federal procurement in action to increase domestic manufacturing capacity. 
Master Supply Agreements will be put in place to enable domestic clean electricity providers to sell products to the US government rapidly and efficiently. Such agreements standardize contracts, making them easier to administer, and supporting transparent quality control for all parties involved.
It also enacted the use of “Super Preferences”, which apply domestic component content standards for federal procurement of solar projects. The procurement will be in alignment with the Buy American Act.
The White House said these actions combined will pave the way for 10 GW of solar procurement over the next decade by the United States government alone. In cooperation with local and state governments and municipal utilities, the administration said the actions will make a potential market impact of as much as 100 GW over the next decade.
