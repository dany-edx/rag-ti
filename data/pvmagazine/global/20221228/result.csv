The LC R290 – Low Charge Heat Pump Solutions project aims to “develop easy-to-use solutions that can be propagated to replace gas and oil heating systems in existing multi-family houses,” Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement.
Dr. Lena Schnabel, head of the department of heating and cooling technologies at the research institute, said that propane has become a recognized refrigerant for the heat pump industry. She noted that it is now widely used for heat pumps installed outdoors. “What we need now are solutions that can be easily implemented indoors as well,” she added.
The consortium will develop heat pumps for single-floor heating systems, indoor central heating systems, and high-performance outdoor heating pumps. Safety will be a key concern for indoor heating applications. The team will build on Fraunhofer’s development of a heat pump refrigeration circuit using less than 150 g of propane to ensure adequate heating capacities, while using low amounts of the highly flammable refrigerant.
The team said it wants to develop heat pumps with a higher heating capacity to replace indoor central heat systems, to build on the results of the LC150 project and reduce propane use in larger-capacity heat pumps. They will also study how to interconnect and control several heat pumps in a single home, while testing a range of safety concepts.
For outdoor high-capacity systems, the researchers will focus on optimizing refrigerant reduction, defrosting, and safety features. “The aim is to be able to implement larger outputs with the same footprint and safety zone through refrigerant reduction and improved defrosting, thus facilitating the installation of these systems in urban areas,” said Fraunhofer ISE.
The research-industry consortium structure will try to fast-track the solutions to commercialization. The participating heat pump manufacturers will be able to incorporate the solutions into their own product development. Production volumes at the fab scale should offer significant cost reduction potential for the new solutions, according to Fraunhofer ISE.
“The participating companies will have access to all project and measurement results during the project period, as well as indirect use of the test facilities and the experience of Fraunhofer ISE in dealing with propane,” said project leader Katharina Morawiez. “Ideally, the development advantage for the participating manufacturers is additionally secured by industrial property rights (patents, utility models, design protection).”
The LC R290 project has received €7 million ($7.4 million) in funding from the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/28/2022-review-in-trends-modules-part-i/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"DECEMBER 28, 2022",2022 review in trends: Modules (Part I),"The development of PV cell and module technology has been one dictated by both power output and cost. And while n-type technologies, such as heterojunction (HJT), have long demonstrated superior energy yields and conversion efficiencies, lower cost technologies such a p-type passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) were able to achieve high performance at a far lower cost structure.
In 2022, PERC remains the predominant PV technology. Larger wafer sizes, coupled with half-cut cells, high density layouts, and multibusbar cell interconnection, utilizing monocrystalline PERC cells, have delivered high power outputs and module outputs of 400 W to 500 W and even beyond.
However, with PERC cells approaching their theoretical efficiency limit of 24.5%, 2022 has seen manufacturers turn to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and HJT technology, on n-type wafers. And if cost structures, in particular relating to silver consumption for the cell metallization, can be brought down, 2022 may well be seen as the year in which a major technological transition within the solar industry commenced.
“2022 has been an exciting year,” says Molly Morgan, a senior research analyst with UK-based analysts Exawatt. “With the efficiency gains of mono PERC slowing, it has been exciting to see many manufacturers adopt n-type technologies and to see this reflected in the proportion of n-type modules available in the market.”
Records tumble
High-efficiency records were being achieved by manufacturers on n-type technology even before the 2022 got underway. In August 2021, Chinese HJT producer Huasun announced that it had achieved a cell efficiency of 25.26% on an M6 format (166mm) cell – equaling the world record. Cell efficiency above 25% blows past what p-type PERC is able to achieve and is somewhat of a watershed for the industry.
Notably, the production processes that Huasun is developing, along with its production equipment partner Maxwell, represents a departure from the processes that had been used by early developers of the technology, like Panasonic and Sanyo before it.
“Huasun uses microcrystalline and nanocrystalline layers, multiple layers, and a two-layer TCO,” said George Touloupas, the director of technology at quality assurance provider Clean Energy Associates (CEA). “Amorphous silicon absorbs a lot of light. That is why HJT efficiency is on a par with TOPCon today, although it has very high voltage, as it always had high light absorption issues that reduce current. That is one of the major things Huasun is trying to improve now.”
In June, Chinese monocrystalline ingot and wafer giant Longi topped Huasun’s HJT record, hitting 26.5% on an M6 wafer. While it appears that Longi’s first step to n-type production will be upgrading at least some of its PERC lines to TOPCon, it may well still adopt HJT in the near future, and is clearly putting considerable R&D resources into the cell technology.
Notably, HJT capacity is being established outside of China. Re-emerging European PV producers are also pursuing HJT, with Meyer Burger and Enel Green Power leading the way. Singaporean manufacturer REC has one of the longest track records in HJT production among this second wave of producers in its award-winning Alpha series.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/28/2022-review-in-trends-applications-part-i/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"DECEMBER 28, 2022",2022 review in trends: Applications (Part I),"Indeed there are so many trends to review in 2022 that we’ve had to split them into two articles. So, without further ado, here are our first three PV project and application trends for 2022:
Hybridization
Solar-wind hybrid (SWH) projects are a growing trend in several parts of the world, especially those with congested grid connection processes or appositely correlated wind and solar peaks. The trend of SWH projects is perhaps best on show in India and the United States. One of the many reasons India is so keen on SWH projects is for their ability to mitigate renewable energy doubts when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine.
Bridge to India’s (BTI) managing director, Vinay Rustagi, said that SWHs “are becoming increasingly popular due to their smoother power output profile. We are seeing a trend in India where the utilities and even large corporate consumers are preferring SWH over plain solar projects despite higher cost.”
Jennifer King, a research engineer for the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), told pv magazine that SWS systems are effective tools for avoiding transmission congestion.
“We probably won’t be able to build transmission fast enough to reach our decarbonization goals in time,” said King. “Hybrids can help because it provides a cost-effective (enough) way to build in sub-optimal resource areas but at least where there is existing transmission and avoided grid congestion.”
Hybrids not only allow developers to maximize their grid connection, but allow increased flow of renewables closer to where said energy is being consumed – the key to efficiency and grid stability. Ultimately, King said, “the limitations of the transmission system are really driving hybrids. If the transmission system was built out perfectly, we would not need hybrids.”
Another grid-congested and much more land-conscious continent, Europe, is also beginning to see the attraction of SWS systems. In Spain, one of the countries leading the SWH push, the lure is provided by the capex saving gained in sharing a grid connection.
Further north, in Denmark, and the retrofitting of onshore wind farms with solar has already begun. Eurowind Energy’s head of public affairs, Joachim Steenstrup, told pv magazine that the wind in Denmark doesn’t blow in July, but noted that there’s no sunshine in January.
“They complement each other excellently,” said Steenstrup. “If we had 100 MW of wind and 100 MW of solar sharing the same 100 MW grid connection, the loss would only be 8% (periods of overlapping generation), and if you look at how valuable that 8% is, it’s worth next to nothing, because both wind and solar would be active and so power prices would be through the floor.”
Hybridization is not limited to land, however, as this next trend will show.
Offshore floating PV
Floating PV (FPV) is now a well-established niche in the solar sector, but as the utility of FPV proves itself again and again, the lure of the open sea grows stronger. After all, there are literal oceans of space for offshore FPV to take advantage of, and thanks to project developers pushing the boundary, the coast is beginning to clear.
Of course, offshore PV is of particular interest to nations without much land to spare but a lot of coastlines to play with, such as the Netherlands, Malta, Japan and Singapore.

“In a place like Malta a 20 MW, let alone a 100 MW, solar park is unthinkable,” says Luciano Mule’Stagno, director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy and group leader of the Solar Research Lab at the University of Malta. “But we can easily find suitable places for several of these plants at sea. Coupled with the ever-falling cost of energy storage, I can see a place like Malta running on 100% renewables (FPV -plus-offshore wind) in 10 to 15 years.”
As offshore FPV is still in its early stages, various designs are vying for supremacy, including Norwegian-headquartered Ocean Sun’s flexible circular surface membrane modelled on a giant water lily, and Dutch outfit SolarDuck’s raised triangular platforms capable of interlocking.
SolarDuck, with partner German utility RWE, launched the Merganser project in 2022, a 500 kW pilot project aiming to withstand winter storms in the North Sea. Though the project is still ongoing, in November 2022 SolarDuck announced it had been selected to build a 5 MW offshore FPV project with the Hollandse Kust West offshore wind farm in the North Sea.

Islandable microgrids
Islandable microgrids are a growing trend, especially in remote regions at the end of electricity networks or parts of the world prone to natural disasters and unreliable grids. Solar-powered microgrids can provide a community with more stability and independence, allowing vulnerable regions to not rely on distant sources of generation as was demonstrated in recent years in places like Australia and California as a result of wildfires, or Puerto Rico in the wake of hurricanes.
An islandable microgrid is a system of generation (solar) combined with storage that is both grid-connected and capable of hiving itself off into an island. This capability means communities can contribute their solar generation to the grid, but if they grid fails them they are not left in the dark.
For Jana Ganion, director of sustainability and government affairs for Blue Lake Rancheria (BLR), a federally recognized Native American tribal government located in rural northern California, the state’s precautionary energy shutoff events are known to last several days. Thankfully, BLR is home to a pioneering microgrid system that has demonstrated its value in a crisis several times already.
According to Warda Ajaz, a research analyst at Global Energy Monitor who has studied microgrid adoption in the US extensively, “disasters act as a key landscape pressure for the adoption of microgrids in the US.” And it’s not just Californian wildfires either, as one of Ajaz’s interviewees said of the New York University (NYU) microgrid in Manhattan: “One of the shining examples [during Hurricane Sandy] was when lower Manhattan was dark… NYU [microgrid] was the only thing running and operating downtown. A lot of people call it the beacon of light in the darkness of Sandy, all of a sudden people started looking into it and saying, ‘Hey, this might be a good solution for our potential resiliency issues.’”
But when it comes to resilience in the face of hurricanes, there are few more experienced that Puerto Ricans. In the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017, and Hurricane Fiona in September 2022, Puerto Ricans are increasingly turning to solar and now islandable microgrids.
As Puerto Rico generates 70% of its energy in the south, but 70% of its population live in the north, when a hurricane topples power lines traversing the island’s mountainous interior, the outages can take a long time to repair. Hence why community microgrids like in the rural community of Castañer are proving a testing ground for the wider adoption and interconnectivity of microgrid systems.
This sense of Puerto Rico as a laboratory for grid redevelopment is not just a nice idea to put some optimistic gloss on a catastrophic situation. Indeed, after the success of the Castañer microgrid during Hurricane Fiona, the US Department of Energy decided to use the microgrid as a “dynamic laboratory” for the transmission and distribution provider LUMA to monitor how such distributed resources can help to bring back power after an outage.

Consisting of 225 kW of solar and 500 kWh of battery storage, the Castañer microgrid is the product of the community’s own organization and the New York-based Interstate Renewable Energy Council’s (IREC) Solar Business Accelerator Program, which is funded by the US Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration.
IREC Program Director Carlos Alberto Velázquez says the success of the microgrid system during Hurricane Fiona, not just for the five local businesses it powers but the resiliency hub it created when the grid failed, means it has “already been identified as an important component of the new grid, albeit a tiny part, but in the future there will be hundreds of these microgrids across Puerto Rico.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/28/german-court-rules-in-favor-of-q-cells-in-patent-dispute-with-trina-solar/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,GERMANY",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"DECEMBER 28, 2022",German court rules in favor of Q Cells in patent dispute with Trina Solar,"Hanwha Solutions, the parent of Hanwha Q Cells, has revealed that a district court in Düsseldorf, Germany, has ruled that China’s Trina Solar has infringed upon the German part of European Patent EP 2 220 689 B1, which covers the South Korean group’s passivation technologies. The court has issued a preliminary injunction barring Trina Solar from importing, marketing and selling the infringing products – including its Honey and Vertex X panels – in the German market. 
In late October, Hanwha Solutions filed a preliminary injunction request in which it claimed that Trina Solar (Germany) had been improperly selling solar modules in the German market. It claimed that the Trina Solar panels infringed upon one of its own patents for its proprietary Q.ANTUM passivation technology. It say this technology plays a key role in improving the performance of silicon-based solar cells.
Trina Solar now has the option to oppose the preliminary injunction and challenge the decision before it becomes final. It said that the matter will not have a substantial impact on its business operations.
“We do not agree with any allegations of patent infringement as the raised claims lack any legal grounds or justification,” the company said in a statement to pv magazine. “We will aggressively defend our position and take actions against the imminent temporary restraining order of the Düsseldorf court and we shall not rest until the case has been dismissed.”
Moon-Hwan Cha, the managing director of Hanwha Q Cells, said that the case underscores the importance of protecting intellectual property rights.
“We will vigorously defend our technology from infringement using the intellectual property laws that exist for this purpose,” added Cha.
Hanwha Q Cells filed patent infringement complaints in Germany in March 2019 against Jinko Solar and REC Group, and followed this with a similar lawsuit against Longi Solar. All of the complaints claimed that the companies had unlawfully included Q Cells’ patented passivation technology in their own products. In June 2020, the Düsseldorf regional court determined that all three defendants had infringed upon the German part of the patent. The appeal process is still ongoing. 
Hanwha Q Cells has also filed patent-related complaints in France, the Netherlands, and the United States. The US Court of Appeals has determined that the complaint over the disputed patent was invalid. The European Patent Office, meanwhile, confirmed the validity of the passivation tech patent in June 2020, with only minor changes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/28/airbus-taps-australian-researchers-to-develop-high-efficiency-solar-cells-for-space/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NETHERLANDS,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 28, 2022",Airbus taps Australian researchers to develop high-efficiency solar cells for space,"From pv magazine Australia 
Airbus Defense and Space has announced it will team with researchers from the University of New South Wales on a strategic research program to fast-track the development of high-efficiency solar cells to be used in space.
Airbus Defense and Space, a division of Airbus, has selected the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney to conduct a multi-year research project that is expected to push the performance of PV cells for space to the limit, both in terms of efficiency and radiation stability.
Airbus said the 3.5-year project will focus on the solar cells that are presently used to power spacecraft. Those cells are composed of several different layers of semiconductor materials that selectively absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. This selectivity enables the cells to operate more efficiently than the standard silicon solar cells used on domestic rooftops.
Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes, a researcher from the UNSW Sydney School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, said the project will explore the merit of introducing patterned, non-planar layers into the cell structure, a technique known as interstitial light-trapping, which can further confine particular wavelengths of light into particular layers of the solar cell.
“Our research on high-efficiency solar cells can help extend the operational life of a spacecraft and lead to light-weight, lower-cost solar arrays,” he said.
Ekins-Daukes, who has previously developed nanostructured, strain-balanced PV absorbers that have utility for solar power conversion in the space environment, said the partnership with Airbus has the potential to open opportunities for commercialization of this technology in Australia and internationally.
“Partnering with Airbus’ experts will help us to understand the broader aerospace industry requirements for solar power and realise the full potential for these future solar power technologies,” he said.
Airbus Defense and Space UK Managing Director Richard Franklin said the project is a perfect example of industry and academia working together to develop and commercialize technologies to benefit and support the defence and space sectors in Australia.
“This is another example of the world-class research capabilities to be found in Australia, and in partnering with UNSW Sydney, we aim to bring these leading-edge research results to applications in space,” he said.
