The planned solar project, in Atlantis, to the north of South Africa's legislative capital, would be operational in 2024 and would supply 14.7 GWh of clean power annually for 20 years from its 7 MW generation capacity, according to the Cape Town municipal government website, which carried details of the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services tender this week.
Former mayor of Cape Town, Dan Plato, in October 2020 announced his intent to encourage all of South Africa's cities to turn away from state power company Eskom and secure electricity supplies from independent generators instead.
At that point it was not clear whether a recent change made to national energy rules which permitted cities to procure power from non-Eskom entities – a change made after a legal challenge from the Cape Town authority – would also relate to power stations owned by municipal authorities themselves. Recent developments in Cape Town suggest that it does.
Plato had voiced a desire to escape the regular electricity black-outs – termed load-shedding – which afflict his and other Eskom-supplied cities. His successor as mayor, fellow Democratic Alliance politician Geordin Hill-Lewis, touted the other moves Cape Town is pursuing to break free from the utility.
Hill-Lewis said this week the city – one of three capitals in South Africa, along with Pretoria and Bloemfontein – had allocated ZAR 15 million ($847,000) for a feed-in tariff program to pay small scale generators R1.01 for each kWh they inject into the city grid; had changed the rules recently to permit commercial and industrial solar generators to sell electricity to the city network; and is tendering to buy electricity from 200 MW of independently-owned power station capacity.
Reuters had reported, in October 2020, the city was seeking to procure power from 300 MW of clean energy capacity within five years.
The EPC tender for the Atlantis solar plant is due to close on October 25.
Quoted on the Cape Town government website, Hill-Lewis said: “The city currently purchases most of its electricity from Eskom. High Eskom price escalations expected in future may not be financially sustainable for the city and its residents. It is expected that the Atlantis solar plant will enhance the city's financial sustainability as the cost of generating the electricity would be lower than … bulk procurement from Eskom. Reducing … dependency on Eskom also means the city can develop and explore more climate-friendly power sources than Eskom's coal-fired power stations.”

The battery uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has a round-trip efficiency of 93.93%.
“The EP Cube is highly customizable and was designed with both homeowners' and installers' diverse needs in mind,” the company said in a statement. “Homeowners no longer have to pick and choose what to power, as the full home can be powered with the EP Cube. Installers can efficiently install the full unit, ultimately driving growth and cost savings.”
The new product is available in four versions with a storage capacity ranging from 9.9 to 19.9 kWh, with the smallest device having a 3-battery module configuration and the largest featuring 6-battery modules.
Each battery module measures 600 mm × 600 mm × 180 mm and weighs 20 kg. The weight of the integrated battery inverter ranges from 130 to 220 kg and its size varies from 600 mm x 1,210 mm x 220 mm to 600 mm x 1,855 mm x 220 mm.
The system has a maximum PV input voltage of up to 600 V and a PV input voltage range of 80 to 550 V. With four MPPT channels, the MPPT voltage ranges from 90 V to 550 V.
The product comes with a 10-year warranty and can reportedly provide steady operation for up to 6,000 charge cycles.
“The EP Cube solution can be stacked for 9.9 kWh to 19.9 kWh capacities,” Canadian Solar said. “Up to six units can be connected in parallel to deliver up to 119.9 kWh of storage and 45.6 kW output, which is more than enough to fully power the average home with high-surge-current appliances and AC units.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/22/fire-at-pges-tesla-battery-in-california-is-now-under-control/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2022",Fire at PG&E’s Tesla battery in California is now under control,"Fire broke out in a battery energy storage facility housing a 182.5 MW Tesla Megapack system, where at least one of the battery units caught on fire. The facility is operated by utility PG&E and is located in Monterey County, California, in the United States.
“There have been no injuries to onsite personnel, and there are no electrical outages for customers at this time due to the incident,” Jeff Smith, operations and communications manager at PG&E, told pv magazine.
The fire started at 1:30 am Pacific Time (PT) on the morning of September 21, and was fully controlled by firefighters at the North Country Fire Department by 7:00 pm PT. It caused California’s Highway 1 to shut down. The County Sherriff's Office lifted its twelve-hour long shelter-in-place advisory at 7 pm PT and reopened the roads. Residents had been asked to shut all windows and turn off ventilation systems due to the hazardous material emitted by lithium-ion battery fires. The County Office advised via Twitter that smoke may still occur in the area for several days despite the fire being fully controlled.
According to local media reports, firefighters let the initial megapack burn out and worked to prevent flames from spreading to adjoining batteries and structures in the large-scale system, as per protocols recommended by PG&E and Tesla to the fire department. The cause of the fire is still unknown, and a joint investigation will be carried out by PG&E and Tesla.
“Safety systems at the facility worked as designed and automatically disconnected the battery from the electrical grid,” Smith said. Property damage to the battery is expected to exceed $50,000, according to preliminary information shared by PG&E.
The Californian facility is one of the biggest utility-owned, lithium-ion battery energy storage systems in the world. A Tesla Megapack also caught fire last year in the Victorian Big Battery in Moorabool, Australia.

“Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites have often a better stability against humidity, which would save on costs for the encapsulation,” the research's corresponding author, Rene Janssen, told pv magazine. “One of the first applications will likely be as top-layer of conventional perovskite solar cells.”
The scientists said their review is focused on two-dimensional RPPs possessing a monovalent organic space and is aimed at providing a toolbox to achieve high-efficiency solar cells. They also noted that RPPs are mostly used in p-i-n solar cells with inverted configurations, which are more suitable for multijunction applications, and offer improved photostability and environmental stability compared with their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts. “The introduction of new fabrication methods, the use of new additives and spacers, and a more thorough understanding of crystallization mechanism, vertical orientation, and phase purity are behind a substantial increase of power conversion efficiencies in RPPs,” they also stated.
Through their review, the Dutch group analyzed different molecular and additive engineering techniques, as well as all manufacturing methods related to RPP solar cells. “Additive engineering is clearly an effective tool to achieve higher efficiencies, even though the mechanism behind the enhancement in efficiency is often not studied or explained,” it stressed, noting that these devices recently reached efficiencies over 20%. “Apart from additive engineering, tuning the interlayer interaction and the dielectric confinement has also proved to be an effective way to increase the efficiency of RPPs.”
According to Jannsen, the study of precursor solutions will also be crucial in developing a reproducible method to form efficient, phase pure RPPs. “Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites have shown significant improvements in performance and stability. Pure Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites, however, are likely further away,” he also explained. “At present, I do not know of real commercial perovskite products of Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites although quite some companies are claiming these will be out soon.”
The research team presented its review in the study “High Efficiency Quasi-2D Ruddlesden–Popper Perovskite Solar Cells,” published in Advanced Energy Materials. “With this work, we show that there is plenty of potential and room for further improvements of this fascinating class of materials,” it concluded.

That is one of the headline figures in the body's EU Solar Jobs Report 2022, published this week.
Under SolarPower Europe's medium scenario for development of the industry – which appears the most accurate when comparing the actual figures with the last medium scenario prediction from the trade group – Europe will need more than 1 million solar workers in 2030, prompting the trade body to warn: “The skilled labor gap may well become the key bottleneck that stops Europe from reaching its energy security and climate goals.”
The membership body used the report to propose tax deductions to attract individuals to train as solar installers, and to persuade companies to provide skills; to call for a planned EU solar mandate for new public buildings to be extended to all structures which have their external surface renovated; and to demand a ban on oil and gas boilers.
The labor-intensive nature of residential rooftop PV meant Poland was Europe's biggest solar employer last year, with its industry supporting around 113,000 positions – 24% of the EU total – helped also by the nation's low labor costs.
Germany supported 87,000 solar industry roles in 2021; Spain 66,000; the Netherlands 36,000; France 33,000; and Italy 24,000; with Greece the fifth biggest solar jobs marketplace, with the equivalent of 34,000 positions. Spain and France were the only EU member states where utility scale solar supported more jobs than rooftop in 2021.
SolarPower Europe predicted – again under its medium-ambition scenario – Germany would support 204,000 solar jobs in 2026, helped by a 23 GW-per-year solar market and a push on PV manufacturing. The energy crisis will ensure Poland retains 102,000 roles in 2026, despite the planned closure of a rooftop solar incentive scheme which has rocket-fueled its PV sector, the trade body added.
Spain, Italy, France, and Greece will continue to be healthy solar job markets in 2026, according to SolarPower Europe, and will be joined by gigamarket new entrant Romania, where low labor costs will help support around 43,000 solar positions, with utility scale-related employment dominant.
The report included useful snapshots of the EU's solar manufacturing industry, highlighting Wacker Chemie as Europe's only polysilicon maker and, extra-EU Norwegian outfits NorSun and Norwegian Crystals two of the continent's three solar ingot and wafer makers, alongside France's EDF Photowatt.
Lithuania's Valeo; Germany-based Meyer Burger; Hungarian fab Ecosolifer; and Italy's 3Sun were Europe's only solar cell producers in 2021, according to the study.
The document also listed capital expenditure (capex) costs for PV across Europe last year, taken from figures supplied by the International Renewable Energy Agency, International Energy Agency, and German research body Fraunhofer ISE.
Hungary and Czechia offered Europe's cheapest solar systems, the report stated, at an upfront cost of €0.38/Watt ($0.38) of installed generation capacity for utility scale systems; €0.50/W for industrial arrays; €0.58 for commercial panels; and €0.86 for residential rooftop kit.
Greece had the bloc's most expensive industrial, commercial, and residential solar costs, at €1.61/W; €1.87; and €2.75, respectively. The nation's €0.76/W figure for big solar was matched, though, in Poland and Spain, and cheaper than the utility scale solar capex recorded in Romania and Denmark (with €0.77/W); Italy (€0.78); Sweden (€0.86); Portugal and France (€0.94); the average value of €0.98 recorded across Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Malta; and in the Netherlands (€1.07).

Chinese solar, battery and EV manufacturer BYD announced it will set up a production line for n-type solar modules based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) technology at its factory in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The company said the bifacial modules will have a power conversion efficiency of 22.2%, a nominal power of 575 W, and a temperature coefficient of -0.32% per C.
“We will be the first company to produce these panels in Brazil. This shows the great pioneering spirit of BYD Energy, a company that is always bringing cutting-edge technology to the country,” stated Marcelo Taborda, Sales Director at BYD Energy do Brasil.
The factory in Campinas reopened in April. The production line and processes were upgraded with the latest technologies such as multi-busbar, half-cell, and 1/3 cut cell. “The new 575 W n-type TOPCON module was developed in Brazil, by Brazilian engineers, specifically for our market,” said Rodrigo Garcia, R&D manager at BYD Energy do Brasil.
The new production lines also allow the factory to become compatible with all solar cell sizes currently available on the market. The facility now has a capacity of 500 MW and produces panels with power outputs ranging from 450 W to 670 W.
The factory opened in 2017 with an annual capacity of 200 MW, with the support of Apex-Brasil, the Brazilian government's trade and investment promotion agency. Solar projects that feature Brazilian-made components can obtain financing from the Brazilian Development Bank and Banco do Nordeste.

“The measure will be part of the Tax Plan 2023 package and still needs final parliamentary approval,” Dutch solar analyst Peter Segaar told pv magazine. “As the Netherlands has been a firm proponent of the decision of the European Commission to enable this type of tax exemption, it is expected that this measure will be introduced by the end of this year.”
Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems were not included in the proposal. “But part of the VAT paid for those installations can still be requested by homeowners. The majority of residential dwellings has, however, conventional PV systems mounted on roof tiles, or on flat roofs with mounting systems,” Segaar explained.
According to him, around 1.58 million Dutch households were equipped with a residential PV systems at the end of 2021. “These systems have a combined capacity of 5.6 GW,” he also stated.
The country is currently supporting rooftop PV through a net metering scheme. The prospect of reduced net-metering returns may prompt Dutch homeowners to instead focus on raising the self-consumption rate of home solar systems, for instance by adding behind-the-meter battery storage.

The Indian Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy’s proposal to implement the second phase of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for gigawatt-scale manufacturing of high-efficiency solar PV modules. 
The government has allocated INR 19,500 crore (around $2.43 billion) for the second part of the program. “Solar PV manufacturers will be selected through a transparent selection process. PLI will be disbursed for five years post commissioning of solar PV manufacturing plants on sales of high-efficiency solar PV modules,” the government said in a statement.
The PLI scheme is expected to support the deployment of up to 65 GW of annual solar module manufacturing capacity, fully and partially integrated.
India aims to install 175 GW of renewable energy generation capacity by next year, and 450 GW this decade. Based on techno-economic analysis, the country's Central Electricity Authority has projected an optimal clean power generation mix will require the nation to add 280 GW of solar capacity by 2029-30. That would mean around 25 GW of solar would need to be added annually. 
The government wants to ramp up Indian PV module manufacturing to support such growth. With the country currently hosting only 9-10 GW of solar module annual production capacity, and around 2.5 GW of cell fabrication facilities, India's solar industry is heavily reliant on imported cells and modules.
