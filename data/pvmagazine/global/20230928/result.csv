The site has the capacity to assemble 13,000 integrated solar panels per month, according to the company, enabling the supply of 6,000 homes with 10 kW solar roofs.
“The 2000 m2 new facility is made up of various complex precision CNC cutting and milling machinery,”
Janari Võrk, a Solarstone spokesperson, told pv magazine that the new facility, which spans 2,000 square meters, features a range of complex precision CNC cutting and milling machinery. The new equipment enables Solarstone to apply its proprietary Click-on BIPV installation technology to a wider range of top-tier solar panels to meet design specifications and performance requirements, according to Võrk.
Solarstone, which was founded in 2015, has a patented aluminum technology that enables direct integration of solar PV tiles  and rooftop PV systems. It also has a range of carport kits. The company claims that it has installed 1,000 solar roofs as of September in 10 markets.
Its production line includes a multi-functional, customized A+ rated PV-testing station.
“It means from now on, we can provide above TÜV level testing results for every single panel,” said Võrk.
Solarstone, which employs 50 people, recently raised €10 million ($10.5 million) in a funding round led by Biofuel OÜ, an Estonian family office investing in renewable technologies. Sunly, an independent energy producer, was an early backer.

Spanish energy provider Iberdrola has finished building what it claims is the first hybrid wind-solar plant in Spain, and is currently carrying out work on the commissioning process.
The solar plant consists of a 74 MW solar facility spreas across the municipalities of Revilla Vallejera, Villamedianilla, and Vallejer, near Burgos, in the central Spanish province of Castilla y León. The wind plant has a capacity of 69 MW, is located near the municipalities of Ballestas and Casetona, and has been operating for several years.
Iberdrola invested €40 million ($42.0 million) in the solar facility.
“Iberdrola will bet on this technology in the coming years in Spain, with which it aims to improve its existing renewable energy assets,” it said in a statement.
The energy supplier is currently developing and building several hybrid wind-solar projects in Spain and throughout the world. Last year, it commissioned two hybrid plants in Australia and Brazil. It also secured approval to build a 50 MW project in Salamanca, northern Spain.
In addition to projects planned by Iberdrola, the Spanish official journal regularly reports on a steady stream of hybrid solar-wind projects in the pipeline.

Mondragon Assembly has revealed that it has won a new dispute with an undisclosed Chinese manufacturer over its patent for continuous string technology.
The Spanish PV production equipment supplier said the patented continuous string process makes cuts between two cells to create individual strings from single infinite strings.
“The patent has been valid since 2013,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Mondragon Assembly said the process increases machine productivity by around 10%, allowing the ribbon/wire to be kept under control at all times. It claimed that the process also increases the quality of the alignment, while reducing the number of defective strings.
Several years ago, Mondragon Assembly faced another legal dispute with a solar machinery manufacturer, but the Chinese court ruled in the Spanish company's favor.
“Mondragon Assembly has taken legal action against two Chinese competitors who infringed said patent,” the company said. “In both cases, the Chinese courts have ruled in favor of Mondragon Assembly and the offenders have been sentenced to cease the manufacture and sale of continuous string machines and to pay compensation to it.”

“With strong policies and great sales showing a clear path ahead in 2022, heat pump manufacturers invested massively in production capacity,” said EPHA’s secretary general, Thomas Nowak. “Now, sudden policy changes and unfavorable electricity-to.gas price ratios have shaken end users’ confidence. This is a serious threat to the heat pump sector – a key EU net zero industry – as well as slowing Europe on its path towards net zero and energy independence.”
The statement was released on the second day of the EU Heat Pump Forum: a two-day conference held in Brussels attended by stakeholders and policymakers who are focused on “expanding the role of Heat Pump Technologies in our society within the context of RepowerEU.”
The EPHA press release says that sales figures for a range of European countries are collected by each country’s own independent heat pump association and then supplied to the European association. “These figures led to the warning,” a spokesperson from the trade body told pv magazine today.
The association revealed that in Italy sales between the first halves of 2022 and 2023 fell by 34%, while Finland and Poland experiencing a drop of 17% and 6%, respectively.
Sales dips could be attributed to the respective government’s “changing” policies and market fluctuations. Italy’s support scheme was “less generous” and unclear, leading to canceled projects; “higher interest rates”, economic uncertainty and the “slowdown” of new building projects shook up Scandinavia; and electricity prices’ four-fold increase, “supply chain issues” and lack of “consistent” government policies impacted Poland sales.
The sales data referred to heat pumps sold to installers and distributors, not to the amount received by end users, the press release stated. Some heat pumps ordered last year by distributors – counted as sales in 2022 – were now stocked in warehouses waiting for end-user orders.
Nowak said the association urged the European Commission to expedite its EU Heat Pump Action Plan – a policy designed to accelerate the rollout of heat pumps across the European Union. Underpinned by the goal of installing at least 10 million additional heat pumps by 2027, and fueled by financial benefits, the strategy is slated to come into effect at the end of the year.
Nowak also said the document should also include “measures to ensure long-term stability in demand and affordability of clean heating solutions at its heart”, which are then replicated nationally.

Hydrostor – a Canadian company with patented advanced compressed air energy storage technology (A-CAES) designed to provide long-duration energy storage – has signed a binding agreement with Perilya to leverage existing assets at the Potosi mine site near Broken Hill, New South Wales, to support the construction of the Silver City Energy Storage Project.
The estimated AUD 652 million ($415 million) Silver City project, which will store excess solar and wind power in a re-purposed underground mine shaft at the Broken Hill site, will be able to deliver 200 MW of electricity for a duration of eight hours.
In a joint statement, the companies said reserve capacity of 250 MWh will be set aside to provide back-up power during network outages.
“Silver City will operate as a large energy storage asset, connected to the NSW grid and able to trade large quantities of energy on a daily basis,” they said. “It will also act as an emission-free long-term grid reliability solution for Broken Hill and the wider region, supporting existing and new renewable energy generation, and serving communities and mining loads in the most cost-effective manner.”
Martin Becker, Hydrostor’s vice president of business development and origination in Australia, said that Silver City will be the company’s first operational project in Australia and will serve as a showcase for A-CAES technology.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process for storing and dispatching energy. It draws off-peak or surplus energy from the grid to produce heated compressed air. During charging, heat from the compressed air is collected and stored before the cooled air displaces water out of an underground cavern up to a water reservoir on the surface. To discharge, water flows back into the cavern forcing air to the surface under pressure where it is heated with the stored thermal energy and drives a turbine to generate electricity.

The company said its technology has similar applications and benefits to pumped hydro energy storage but requires only one-20th of the volume of water that conventional pumped hydro needs per MWh of energy storage and has the added benefits of being flexible with location and topography.
“This patented technology allows grid operators to draw on clean energy, even when there is no sun to fuel solar panels and no wind to generate energy from turbines,” Hydrostor said.
While no dates have been provided for the delivery of the Silver City project, Paul Rasmussen, Hydrostor’s Vice President of Integration, said the agreement with Perilya will allow the company to accelerate the development of the facility.
“By leveraging the existing mine investment and infrastructure, this partnership enables us to improve project delivery timeframe, since we can build the underground air storage cavern much faster, with reduced set-up costs and a better understanding of the geology at site,” he said.
The agreement with Perilya includes access to property transactions and existing mine infrastructure, provision of construction support services, and supports the continued and longer-term operation of the Potosi mine during and after the project is being constructed.
The Silver City project has received development funding from the NSW government under the Emerging Energy Opportunities Program and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has conditionally approved $45 million in funding to help finance the project.
ARENA’s funding for the Silver City Project is conditional upon the project reaching financial close, which is expected to occur in late 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/28/lithium-ion-batteries-differ-in-terms-of-risk/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2023",Lithium-ion batteries differ in terms of risk,"From pv magazine USA
Lithium-ion battery deployment is proliferating exponentially in the United States. Every phone, power tool and electric vehicle come with a lithium battery today, not to mention the 100 GWh or so of lithium batteries operating at the utility scale.
This makes a lot of consumers nervous. As this trend unfolds, stories litter the media landscape about lithium-ion batteries catching fire, and even exploding. It’s a valid concern, and the time for consumers to understand a basic truth about lithium-ion batteries is long past due.
The crucial point that’s either unknown or omitted in every one of the hundred horror stories you can find online about EV, utility and home battery fires, is that “lithium-ion” is a catch-all term. It doesn’t describe a particular type of battery. There are more than a dozen lithium-ion battery chemistries. Six of them have made it outside the laboratory. Three of them can be found on the market. Two of those are incredibly common, and the differences between them are so substantial that comparing them will serve as an excellent primer for the subject.
NMC options
The first chemistry is lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide or NMC. Up until about 2020, these were the undisputed leader of the market share of lithium batteries. In 2022, they still comprised some 60% of the market share. However, after so many (largely unreported) battery fires in early models of  electric vehicles (EVs), and the subsequent shift by Tesla and a few other major EV manufacturers to the exclusive use of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry last year, this is expected to halve in short order.
NMC has an energy density roughly 10% (depending on manufacturer) better than LFP. In addition, they are significantly lighter than LFP in weight per kWh. This is largely responsible for its early adoption by industry. However, NMCs lacklustre safety record, lifespan, and its increasing material cost has recently made LFP the preferred choice of nearly every industry sector in the last year.
The dangers of lithium-ion about which the public has been so repetitiously warned, are almost exclusively the dangers of NMC. A very low thermal runaway temperature reached in many real-world scenarios is primary. With temperatures breaking records every year in most parts of the country, ambient temperatures of 110°, or even 120°F are almost commonplace now in regions that had never seen them before the 2000s.
With most of the country’s grid suffering from insufficient and decaying infrastructure, coupled with increased demand for air conditioning in hot weather, a ‘perfect storm’ is created much more commonly now wherein NMC batteries attached to utility grids (whether in a garage or a utility storage facility) are called upon to export their maximum power capacities during the hottest ambient temperatures. Thus, their (alarmingly low) thermal runaway temperatures are reached, and you get cell explosion and battery fires.
Calls for evacuations in response to the larger of these incidents, aside from risks of explosion in the immediate vicinity, are issued by fire personnel because the gas emissions during an NMC cell rupture event are extremely toxic, containing several fluorine gasses as well as cobalt and manganese cenospheres well above toxic limits.
LFP chemistry
LFP or lithium iron phosphate, also known as LiFePO4, is a completely different chemistry. With a much higher thermal runaway temperature, (some 20° C higher depending on manufacture), the potential for cell rupture due to thermal runaway is well outside of normal operating conditions, even on the hottest of days.
Further, (and it seems obvious but still bears mention) iron doesn’t burn like manganese. Actual fires due to battery failure, on those rare occasions that they do occur, are limited to wires, and sometimes battery management system (BMS) printed circuit boards. Assuming that the battery casing conforms to NEMA or IP standards, cell fires cannot escape the case unless it’s been punctured.
Also, the findings of several experiments where cell explosion is forced, have confirmed using gas chromatography that the release of gasses during a cell rupture event are by far the least toxic (containing no transition metal aerosols in contrast with NMC) of the common three lithium chemistries.
If the decarbonisation of US energy infrastructure within our generation is a real goal, and not just election-cycle pillow talk, then the continued deployment of LiFePO4 batteries in tandem with the ongoing rapid deployment of solar and hydro renewable resources are absolutely paramount.
Let’s not do the public further injustice by promulgating terms like “lithium-ion batteries” that for lack of distinction are turning us all away from the LFP solution that may yet afford a small chance of success, for fear of the early NMC deployment that even the profit-first-and-only markets have admitted was probably a bad idea.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/28/solar-geometry-based-model-to-assess-performance-of-bifacial-pv-systems/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,INDIA",LIOR KAHANA,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2023",Solar geometry-based model to assess performance of bifacial PV systems,"Scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur have created a novel energy estimation model for bifacial PV systems which they claim can accurately predict irradiances for both sides of a prototype bifacial PV module.
The model is based on solar geometry, which measures the angle of the sun and the earth to calculate how much solar energy reaches a particular object.
“Our results suggest that the proposed model can be relied upon as a tool for accurately predicting the irradiance of bifacial PV modules,” the scientists said. “This validation is a significant step towards developing more precise energy estimation models for bifacial PV systems, which can contribute to optimizing their design and maximizing their energy output.”
While models calculating the energy reaching the front side of the PV are well established in scientific literature, this research contributes by calculating the energy reaching the rear side. It is based on two components – the reflected irradiance from the ground, and the rear side irradiance of the PV system.
“The amount of reflected irradiance depends on several factors, including the ground’s albedo, the module’s tilt, height, and solar zenith angle,” the paper explained. “Rear-side irradiance includes both the reflected and transmitted light that passes through the front side of the module.”
To validate this model, the academics compared their predictions with measurements from two pyranometers placed on each side of a PV system. That PV system is deployed with a fixed tilt angle of 22 degrees and is located on a building of the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur itself. The system consists of 18 bifacial PV modules with a total capacity of 6.8 kW.
“There was a high level of agreement between measured values and the model predictions, as indicated by the correlation coefficients of 1.04 and 1.40 for the front and rear sides, respectively,” they emphasized. “The correlation coefficient is a measure of similarity between the modeled and measured data, with higher values indicating a better match.”
In addition, the scientists have compared their model against actual results from an array elevated to one meter, with an albedo of 30%, under different tilt angles ranging from 0 to 90 degrees. “The proposed model exhibits a favorable agreement with the measured output, with an error rate of around 2–5%,” they said.
Furthermore, the researchers have also looked into the energy output at various elevations in optimum tilt angle. “Raising the array to a height of at least 1 m can significantly increase energy output, particularly at higher tilt angles. Moreover, using an elevated structure can further enhance the yield of a bifacial PV system by capturing more reflected irradiance from the ground,” they concluded.
The model is presented in the paper “Performance assessment of a bifacial PV system using a new energy estimation model,” which was published in Solar Energy.

Renfe, a Spanish railway operator, has unveiled plans to build a 20 MW solar project to power its trains. Most of the generated electricity will be used for train traction, with any excess power being sold on the market.
The pilot facility, to be built near Valladolid, will help Renfe to assess self-consumption levels. The project is expected to continue for around five years, with an estimated investment of €27 million ($28.5 million).
In 2021, Renfe offered €233 million to develop 390 MW of self-consumption solar capacity for its high-speed trains. The company also intends to cover more than 40% of electricity consumption at 14 maintenance bases with 11 MW of photovoltaic panels for self-consumption.
In 2019, UK-based climate change charity 10:10 developed a demonstrator solar array in partnership with Community Energy South and national rail infrastructure operator Network Rail. According to the developers, a solar plant can theoretically be connected to any traction substation and supply from 5 km to 10 km of the track in either direction.

The novel techniques are reportedly able to reduce silver consumption and avoid lead-containing soldering materials.
“We show that with a deep understanding of the processes and material behavior, low-temperature metallization and interconnection with the established equipment of solar cell and module production lines is possible,” the research's lead author, Angela De Rose, told pv magazine.
The scientists developed two different processes: front-side metallization at very low temperatures for full-size perovskite silicon tandem solar cells; and the interconnection to high-efficiency full-format demonstrator modules with an output power of more than 400 W.
The metallization step used fine-line screen printing. The selected paste was shown to be suitable for high-speed printing reliable at widths of 20 μm, resulting in a printed width of 26 μm. The process translated into 43% less silver consumption compared to a layout with finger widths of 35 μm. For curing at 150 C, “good electrical properties were reached” and high throughput production is possible due to fast curing times down to 2 minutes per wafer, according to the researchers.
For interconnection, the group used electrically conductive adhesives (ECA), screening several pastes and methods. “There are many commercially available ECAs on the market, allowing the processing at different temperature ranges, including less than 200 C and less than 150 C,” it explained, noting that most of ECAs use silver particles to ensure more electrical conductivity.
Their techniques achieved silver reduction by using finer line printing and less ECA than conventional methods and avoiding lead-containing materials in the low temperature screenprinting pastes and lead-free solder alloys.
The researchers claim they have been able to use 50% less ECA compared to the conventional continuous application patterns, noting that the proposed solution offers sufficient joint adhesion for string handling and stable module powers on the cells, also for ECA curing temperatures of 130 C. “The major challenge for this approach is to keep the curing time as short as possible to enable high throughput,” they said.
The solar modules made with a soldered wire interconnection and ECA ribbon interconnection have a total area of 1.8 m2, an output of more than 400 W, consisting of full-size perovskite silicon tandem half cells. The solder-coated wire enabled low-temperature processing and damage-free fabrication, said the researchers.
“By optimizing the involved processes and materials hand-in-hand, we were able to build highly efficient perovskite silicon heterojunction modules in full-format with different interconnection technologies,” said De Rose.
The team claimed the process enables high-throughput production at stringing speeds of 1600 to 1800 cells per hour. The cell matrix, either silicon heterojunction or tandem, was embedded into a commercially available encapsulant for a lamination process within a conventional process window between 140C and 160C. The full-size modules were built as glass-glass modules with edge sealing.
The processes were described in the study “Low-temperature metallization & interconnection for silicon heterojunction and perovskite silicon tandem solar cells,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
The group’s future research activity includes lead-free and low-temperature soldering, shingling interconnection using ECA, as well as long-term stability of tandem cells and modules.

Wood Mackenzie has released a new energy storage market report, with a new record high for US installations for the second quarter of 2023. The United States deployed 1,680 MW/5,597 MWh of energy storage nationwide, leading to an average duration of 3.3 hours.
However, second-quarter installations were significantly lower than expected based on project pipelines. Wood Mackenzie said that well over 2 GW of projects have been pushed to later years.
Much like the residential solar sector, the residential energy storage sector has been hammered this year by steep interest rates and meaningfully negative policy changes like the onset of California Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0. In the second quarter, residential storage declined to 138 MW/381 MWh. The biggest decline was in California, which fell 17% quarter over quarter and 37% year on year, despite promises from regulators and utilities that NEM 3.0 would be a net-positive for the solar-plus-batteries market.
Despite these challenges, Wood Mackenzie sees growth ahead for the residential storage segment. The report said the sector is forecast to install 3.5 times more solar in 2027 than it did in 2023. It expects 8 GW for the sector over a five-year horizon.
In the September issue of pv magazine, we examine booming solar markets in Brazil and Mexico; investigate whether TOPCon modules really are more susceptible to degradation than PERC products; attempt to unravel how US solar manufacturers can qualify for domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act; and look at how homeowners can achieve the residential solar, battery, and EV dream.
Looking ahead, Wood Mackenzie sees grid-scale storage accounting for most of the capacity to be added through 2027, bnut residential storage is expected to rebound and maintain strength, despite recent challenges. Between 2023 and 2027 Wood Mackenzie projects 66 GW of energy storage added, 83% of which will be grid-scale capacity.
Vanessa Witte, a senior storage analyst at Wood Mackenzie and one of the report's lead authors, will be a featured panelist in the grid-scale energy storage session at the upcoming pv magazine Roundtables US 2023 event, which is free to attend.

They found that the best way for governments to nudge homeowners into installing rooftop PV solar systems was greatly increased when the individual was guided by self-interest.
“There were two key takeaways,” one of the study’s co-authors, Maurus Pfalzgraf, told pv magazine, “and one was that nudging is effective.” The other major finding was that the success of nudging – meaning to gently propose an idea without a mandate or incentive – was determined by whether the homeowner was informed by how much money they could save, “or would have saved if they already installed PV,” Pfalzgraf said.
Mainly tasked with testing the efficacy of nudging, the researchers also wanted to find what personalized behavioral interventions worked better as a nudge. The first intervention was underpinned by prosocial motives – meaning the intention to benefit another person, group or society – and the latter intervention was rooted in self-interest. Schaffhausen was selected as the pilot city as its residential electricity price at the time of research was “very close” to the European average, the paper reported.
In collaboration with the local government, the researchers sent 600 homeowners two personalized letters. One of the letters addressed the prosocial benefits of rooftop solar PV and included phrases such as, “You could become less dependent on energy sources such as oil or gas from abroad and at the same time make a valuable contribution to climate protection.” The second letter was written in the vein of self-interest and included lines such as, “You are missing out on 7,900 kWh of solar electricity per year, worth around CHF 790 ($865).”
Both types of letters included invitations to receive PV consulting sessions offered by a neutral public organization. The consultation was followed by the option to request an offer for the installation. After the consultation, the homeowner was asked to state the likelihood for going through with the installation. At every step of the process, the researchers were keeping track of follow-through.
“With a 15-percentage point change, this self-interested type of nudge increased the pressure to act,” the paper states. “In comparison, a second group which received a personalized letter activating social norms regarding one’s community by demonstrating how many of one’s neighbors have already installed PV produced smaller, yet statistically significant effects with about 6.5 percentage point change.”

Pfalzgraf said the team was still waiting to collect the figures regarding how many individuals went through with the whole PV installation, and he was also personally interested in interrogating whether nudging worked to convince individuals with large property portfolios and renters. Overall, Pfalzgraf said the team was “happy” to see the “clear potential” of nudging proved as an effective government instrument. Nudging is generally perceived as an easier and cheaper mechanism for governments to employ as the prompts do not require policy-change or subsidies for implementation.
The research group presented its findings in the study “Governments can nudge household solar energy adoption: Evidence from a field experiment in Switzerland,” which was recently published in Energy Research & Social Science.
The research was conducted from June—September 2022 and was guided by a desire to “contribute to a better understanding of how public organizations can use behavioral interventions to promote renewables without large subsidies,” the paper claimed. Pfalzgraf said the research was important from a Swiss perspective as it could help the federal government achieve its net zero fossil fuel target by 2050.
Swissolar, the PV association of Switzerland, announced in June the central European country had installed more than 1 GW of PV last year – the third year PV demand increased by 40%. Switzerland recorded 4,134 MW of total solar PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recently collected data by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

German PV panel manufacturer Solarwatt said this week that it will start manufacturing solar modules based on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell technology.
The company said it will start selling its first TOPCon glass-glass and glass-backsheet modules from the end of October, with deliveries starting in January 2024.
The bifacial half-cell modules will initially be available with power outputs ranging from 420 W to 425 W and will feature 3.5 mm aluminum frames.
The Dresden-based company offers a 30-year product and performance guarantee on the double glass modules, as well as its free Solarwatt Complete Protection insurance.
“We have significantly increased our guarantee periods for glass film modules,” said Solarwatt CTO Armin Froitzheim. “This puts us well above the market standard.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/28/new-perovskite-solar-cell-design-with-silicon-dioxide-anti-reflector-layer/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,IRAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2023",New perovskite solar cell design with silicon dioxide anti-reflector layer,"Researchers at the Tarbiat Modares University (TMU) in Iran have designed a two-dimensional perovskite solar cell with a light-trapping (LT) structure and an anti-reflector layer based on silicon dioxide (SiO2).
They said that the combination of these two elements helps to trap light in the whole cell structure, thus offering a significant advantage compared to perovskite PV devices based on a planar structure. “In order to form the described light-trapping structure, the layers of this cell must be placed on a textured silicon substrate,” the scientists explained. “Contrary to planar structures, this structured solar cell should be constructed starting from the bottom layer.”
In solar cells built with an LT architecture, the main issue is the thickness of the absorber, which must be increased compared to that of planar cells in order to achieve higher light absorption. An increased absorber, however, may have negative effects on the electrical properties of the cell itself.
The research group designed the cell by placing the anti-reflective SiO2 layer on the indium tin oxide (ITO) layer and considered the use an absorber made of CH3NH3SnI3, a perovskite material with an energy bandgap of 1.3 eV. It utilized an electron transport layer made of titanium oxide (TiO2), a hole transport layer based on copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a gold (Au) metal contact.
Through a series of simulations, the academics compared the performance of the proposed solar cell design with that of a similar cell with a planar configuration. They found that, the reflectance of the LT architecture was lower than that of the planar configuration. “This means that light easily enters the active layer and is confined inside the active layer,” they explained. “Also, because light is difficult to exit, the volume of light entering the active layer increases as the wavelength increases.”
The simulation also showed that the most efficient cell designed with LT structure may achieve an efficiency of 20.48%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current density of 22.22 mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 83.33%. This cell would require a perovskite absorber with a thickness of 300 nm.
“When the perovskite layer becomes thicker, so does the efficiency of the perovskite solar cell,” they explained. “However, the efficiency practically achieves its maximum when the thickness approaches 200 nm. Thereafter, the efficiency marginally declines.”
They presented the novel cell design in the paper “Design of optimized photonic-structure and analysis of adding a SiO2 layer on the parallel CH3NH3PbI3/CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite solar cells,” published in scientific reports.
