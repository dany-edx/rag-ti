Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica (EPE), a Brazilian government-run energy agency, allocated around 166 MW of PV capacity in its A-4 energy auction on Friday.
Overall, the EPE assigned around 950 MW of renewable energy capacity in the auction. This included 183 MW of wind power, 400 MW of thermal capacity, and 189.5 MW of small-sized hydroelectric power facilities.
The five solar projects in the procurement exercise are all located in the state of Pernambuco. Their average final price is BRL 178.24 ($37.6)/MWh.
 
The selected projects will sell power on the regulated market under power purchase agreements with duration of 15 to 20 years.
The EPE plans to hold the A-5 and A-6 auctions later this year. It has already pre-selected 115 GW of projects. Solar is eligible to participate only in the A-5 exercise, which has a proposed project pipeline of 83 GW, including 55.8 GW for PV projects.

French CPV specialist Soitec, which originally developed the cell structure, achieved a 46% efficiency for one of its most powerful devices back in 2014.
“The upper tandem solar cell is made of gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) and aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs), which was bonded by Soitec onto a lower tandem solar cell made of gallium indium arsenide phosphide (GaInAsP) and gallium indium arsenide (GaInAs),” Fraunhofer ISE said. “Now an improved contact layer and a 4-layer antireflection coating were applied to the tandem cell structure in Fraunhofer ISE’s Center for High Efficiency Solar Cells.”
The cell's previous efficiency level was 46.1%. The scientists improved it by reducing resistance losses and the reflection on the cell front side. It also implemented improvements for the metal contacts.
“Possible applications of such highly efficient tandem solar cells include concentrator photovoltaic systems, which contribute to efficient power generation in sun-rich countries,” said Stefan Glunz, division director of Photovoltaics Research at Fraunhofer ISE. “With tandem photovoltaics, it is possible to leave the limitations of single-junction solar cells behind and ultimately achieve a reduction in solar power costs.”
Fraunhofer ISE has worked on several kinds of III-V solar cells in the past. They include a 68.9%-efficient III-V solar cell for laser energy transmission systems, a 35.9%-efficient III-V triple-junction solar cell based on silicon, and a III-V tandem solar cell with an efficiency of 25.9%, among others.

France's Ciel et Terre has expanded its line of Hydrelio flexible floating platforms with the new Hydrelio aiR Optim floater.
Vincent Grumetz, general manager EMEA for the Lille-based company, told pv magazine France that the new platform adheres to the Hydrelio line's “one float, one panel” principle.
“The new product is an optimized version that adapts to the increase in size and weight of photovoltaic panels,” said Grumetz.
The floater is made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) recyclable plastic. The company adapted its size and flotation properties to support larger modules of up to 670 W in size.
“The connection between the floats makes the structure flexible,” Grumetz said. “This product is therefore ideal for bodies of water that are agitated, such as dam reservoirs, or subject to strong winds or basins that can be completely emptied.”
The floating PV specialist said the first projects to be built with the new floaters could see the light of day at the end of 2022.
Ciel et Terre has also unveiled a new rigid floating system for calmer bodies of waters, such as lakes or storage basins. It is compatible with M10 and M12 modules and features a metal structure fixed to HDPE floats.
“This allows us to bring the photovoltaic panels closer together and increase the number of modules over a smaller area,” said Grumetz.
The modules are installed in portrait mode, in either a south or east-west orientation.
“In addition, thanks to its high buoyancy, this technology withstands higher snow loads – an important element in regions such as the northern United States, Canada, Switzerland or northern Italy, where the use of floating solar is on the rise,” Grumetz said. “These two solutions, one flexible and the other rigid, are complementary. They allow us to provide a solution adapted to the constraints of our customers, taking into consideration the type of their project.”
Ciel et Terre has 650 MW of installed capacity throughout the world. It has a portfolio of 1.2 GW now under development.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/30/lack-of-european-solar-manufacturing-could-cripple-repower-eu-bid/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GEOPOLITICS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",MAX HALL,"MAY 30, 2022",Lack of European solar manufacturing could cripple RePower EU bid,"European solar manufacturers will need 42 times more annual PV cell production capacity if the European Commission's raised ambitions are to be met with Made in Europe products. US research firm Wood Mackenzie this week released that figure to illustrate how threadbare Europe's solar manufacturing industry is.
The commission has stated an ambition to drive at least 420 GW of new solar generation capacity this decade, in a bid to wean the bloc off Russian gas. WoodMac has estimated Europe will supply around 331 GW of new solar by 2031 and this week said the commission's “RePower EU” plans have the potential to double that figure.
However, the Edinburgh-based research firm pointed out that “virtually all” of the 60,000 kilotons of solar panel raw material polysilicon it says Wacker Chemie produces each year is exported to China because there is insufficient demand in Europe. Keeping Wacker product in Europe would require 10 times more nearby ingot and wafer production capacity, 21 times more cell production lines, and three times more solar module capacity, WoodMac estimated.
It said hitting the raised ambition outlined by the commission would require three times more annual polysilicon production capacity, 20 times more wafer lines, 42 times more cell output, and six times more module capability. Solar panel raw material costs drove panel prices up more than 20% in 2021, according to WoodMac. It said the polysilicon price has trebled in the last 18 months and is expected to stay “elevated” throughout 2022.
Aluminum, copper, and steel prices have all risen more than 30% in the past year, according to WoodMac. The cost of solar panel glass is also rising, it said, attributing the increases to escalating natural gas and tin prices.
The commission's plans to reduce dependence on direct Russian gas supplies could be helped, ironically, if the gas price rise driving solar glass costs is in part alleviated by Russia following through on recently announced commitments to switch euro supply deals to China.

The Jiangsu Jintan Salt Cavern Compressed Air Energy Storage Project is located in Changzhou, Jiangsu province. It has a storage capacity of 300 MWh and a power generating capacity of 60 MW. 
The facility features a salt cavern, situated 1,000 meters underground and owned by China National Salt Industry Group. The system has an efficiency of more than 60% and is expected to reach a power generating capacity of 1 GW. Huaneng Group built the plant and is now operating it.
“Its commissioning marks the qualitative leap of China's compressed air energy storage technology from theoretical experiment to engineering application, and provides a new energy storage scheme for the construction of a new power system with new energy as the main body,” Huaneng said.
The China Energy Storage Alliance (CNESA) noted a number of advantages with non-afterburning compressed air energy storage power generation technology. They include high capacity, long life cycles, low cost, and fast response times.
“The completed project will help to solve the problem of wind and solar curtailment, alleviate the current challenge of energy shortage in Jiangsu province, and promote the commercial development process of advanced technologies and equipment in the domestic energy storage industry,” said CNESA.

The missile strike hit the solar plant on the night of May 28. Ukrinform quoted local media outlet Suspilnie Kharkiv as saying that the project had been built on a former landfill site under Ukraine's feed-in tariff scheme. It had been operational for about a year and a half.
According to the manager of the project, Volodymyr Ronchakovsky, the missiles produced holes at the site measuring 6 meters deep and 11 meters in diameter. The missiles were reportedly launched from Belgorod, western Russia.
 
In mid-March, the Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy (UARE) said that 37% of the nation's ground-mounted solar project capacity had been built in areas where armed conflict was taking place, with another 34% in adjacent areas. The UARE reported “registered cases of destruction” of solar panels and claimed that Russian forces “steal all the equipment from the stations – everything that can be stolen and taken away.”

“We seek to understand the trends in the commercial development of hybrids and to identify factors that may alter those trends through an evaluation of the costs and revenues of different hybrid configurations, enabling planners to make more informed assumptions about the configuration and behavior of hybrids,” they said. “We also seek to understand which configuration choices are more impactful than others on market value and costs.”
They described their findings in “Keep it short: Exploring the impacts of configuration choices on the recent economics of solar-plus-battery and wind-plus-battery hybrid energy plants,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The group of researchers considered historical wholesale market power prices from 2012 to 2019 and recent component costs for renewable energy projects. They shaped their analysis by considering battery duration and capacity, grid interconnection capacity, the size of PV systems relative to inverter capacity, and the connections between batteries and generators.
They also considered hybrid costs based on capital costs and battery lifetimes.
“We construct an analytical approach that system planners could use with case specific parameters to evaluate hybrid development trends and demonstrate its explanatory power by qualitatively comparing the attractive hybrids we model to recently developed hybrids or projects in the near-term development pipeline,” they said.
The scientists calculated the net value of each of the proposed configurations. They also relied on a linear optimization program to calculate a generator's revenue based on historical wholesale power market prices.
“The objective of the optimization is to maximize revenue from buying and selling power from the hybrid at an hourly varying wholesale power price, accounting for a linear degradation penalty applied to the battery charge and discharge power,” they said.
They found that battery duration and capacity have the largest impact on the net value of either solar or wind hybrid plants. They said the ideal configurations are those with a battery duration ranging from two to four hours. In solar-plus-storage projects, the battery capacity with the highest net value should be between 25% and 100% of the PV plant nameplate capacity, depending on the region and the availability of fiscal incentives, while the highest net value for wind-plus-storage plant should be around 25% of the wind capacity, with or without the tax credits.
“AC vs. DC coupling and the sizing of the solar panels relative to the inverter in solar hybrids appear to be secondary,” they said.
The scientists said their analytical framework aligns with current commercial trends and identified six main trends in US electricity markets. Solar-plus-battery projects are more common than their wind counterparts, while solar hybrids are more common than wind hybrids. Both solar and wind hybrids are more common in the bulk power system operated by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), while battery durations are commonly between one and four hours. Battery-to-generator capacity ratios are larger for solar than wind hybrids, but hybrids in the CAISO have a point of interconnection capacity similar to the renewable generator capacity. In addition, DC-coupled projects use inverter loading ratios ILRs at the same levels of those for off-grid solar.
The researchers said that in the future, they want to improve their analysis of the cost and hybridization cost-reduction potential.
“Future work could refine battery cost and degradation estimates for specific battery technologies, along with incorporating projections of cost trends into the future to make more precise estimates of the net value of specific hybrids,” they said.

“TOPCon is not new to Trina, we built our first pilot project four years ago – a 400 MW solar plant under China’s Top Runner program,” Helena Li, president of the company’s global cell and module business, told pv magazine in a short interview at the recent Smarter E event in Munich, Germany. “We utilized our own n-type TOPCon technology in that project, but when we built that customers were not ready to buy these products, as prices were too high, although we had a production line of a certain size. However, we built on this experience for our current approach.”
The company is still uncertain about when it will launch its new n-type TOPCon products.
“This time it depends on the shortage of components and materials,” Li said. “We don’t want a new product which may eventually not be able to supply.”
She said the whole n-type transition is now being postponed. The company plans to raise its capacity for new n-type products from 500 MW to 20 GW by the end of 2023.
“We are also looking at interdigitated back-contact (IBC) and heterojunction, but first we want to expand our TOPCon business,” said Li.
In March, Trina Solar said that its 210 mm × 210 mm TOPCon cell had achieved an efficiency of 25.5%.
“Our 210 plus n-type technology is undergoing rapid advance, expected to increase power by another 3% to 5%, further driving down (the levelized cost of electricity). Surely in the offing, but constrained by supply chain pressure,” Li said. “Our shipments have already grown 40% year on year, maintaining a high market share, despite all difficulties. Trina Solar will keep developing TOPCon tech rapidly and is planning to raise its capacity for new n-type products from 500 MW currently to 20 GW by the end of 2023.”
Supply chain issues have been going on longer than the company initially expected, she noted.
“First the covid and then all these logistics issues. Then there was the problem with the Suez canal, and now there are the war in Ukraine and the inflation. Furthermore, there is a new covid crisis in China. You can see what we had to go through,” Li said.
The current situation is teaching the company about its own clients, however.
“It is teaching our industry how to adapt to new and unknown circumstances. For example, previously we could never suspect that shipping costs for solar modules may be between $0.04 and $0.05 per watt. This is 15% or 20% of the total module costs, and we never expected this to materialize,” she said. “In spite of current constraints, we are very optimistic about the European markets. Trina Solar has been playing a leading role in Europe and globally, with more than 22 GW shipped to European markets to date, ranking first in the region.”
The company has launched a number of joint ventures or partnerships to diversify its polysilicon, ingot and wafer sources over the past year, especially in Southeast Asia.
“We realized supply chain can not be centralized in one place and customers also want independence. Our mid-term strategy is to have a clear fragmentation of products and markets, as well as geographically diversify our supply chain. Different markets require different supply chains,” said Li.
Trina Solar is now considering more solar factories through new partnerships.
“We are looking at US as everyone else and we already conducted some feasibility studies. And Europe is also an option,” Li said, without providing further details.
