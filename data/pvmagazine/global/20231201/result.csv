A consortium formed by Germany-based mounting system provider K2 Systems and Swiss EPC contractor Solarmotion has deployed a vertical PV system on a bypass road in the municipality of Teufen in the canton of Appenzell Ausserhoden, Switzerland.
The array is located on a 75-degree retaining wall and has a capacity of 325 kW. It uses 756 glass-glass full black solar modules from an undisclosed provider.
According to K2 Systems, the mounting solution used for the installation is based on its “K2 BasicRail” mounting rail combined with HUS screw anchors. Lichtestein-based Hilti provided the mechanical dowels for the project.
In the system configuration, the PV system's parts, as well as the K2 building protection mat as a substrate, were anchored on and in the masonry using an adhesive technique. The companies had to consider that an anchoring depth of a maximum of 90 mm could not be exceeded, in order not to affect the statics of the retaining wall.
An engineering office from the Swiss road inspectorate checked all static calculations during the planning phase.
The companies completed the project in two months. Due to its proximity to the asphalt, the K2 mounting system is still subject to exceptional corrosion requirements and its components are covered with anodized aluminum for protection. The components of the fastening system are made of aluminum and A2 stainless steel.
The photovoltaic system is scheduled to be officially inaugurated in December. It is expected that the vertical array will produce good yields, especially in winter. Overall, the annual solar power generation is expected to be around 230,000 kWh.
The system is injecting power to the grid of local energy provider St. Gallisch-Appenzellische Kraftwerke AG (SAK) under Switzerland's feed-in tariff regime.

According to South Korean research firm SNE Research, CATL cemented its domination of the global EV industry in the January-August period this year with 37% market share, followed by second-ranked BYD with 16%. Its sales outside of China reached 27.7%, up by 6.9% year-on-year.
As pv magazine learned from CATL, in the third quarter of 2023, the company’s battery sales volume stood at around 100 GWh, with BESS accounting for nearly 20%.
According to CATL, innovation is the key driver of its growth. In the first three quarters of 2023, CATL invested about 14.88 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in R&D.
As of the first half of 2023, CATL’s issued and pending patents have reached 22,039 worldwide, and it has contributed to the drafting or amending of over 110 industry standards at home and abroad.
With R&D centers in Ningde, Liyang, Shanghai, Xiamen and Munich, which employ more than 17,998, CATL is managing to stay at the forefront of development in energy storage technologies.
Some of its key breakthroughs include the development of liquid-cooling energy storage solutions with long service life and high level of safety.
Session 8 | Dec 6, 10:30 am CET, virtual | All about storage: Price, materials, tech, and new revenue
As the energy storage sector continues to grow and mature, understanding costs and revenue opportunities is the highest priority for many stakeholders. As lithium-based batteries continue to dominate the sector, the outlook on costs, materials, and technology remains the key question. In addition, we will also explore the most attractive markets and revenue opportunities for BESS in Europe, beyond the wins in transferring energy from generation to times of demand.

Furthermore, CATL has worked on low lithium consumption anode, which reduces the consumption of active lithium content while improving the stability of the anode material surface and structure as well as self-repairing electrolyte, which improves cell storage and cycling performance.
It has also achived big results with its  passivated cathode with the help of doping and coating techniques to reduce side reactions in high-voltage scenarios.
As CATL underlines, “ensuring the safety of energy storage batteries poses far greater challenges than those for EV batteries, as it requires a much higher level of consistency in manufacturing as well as innovation in cell and system design.”
By deploying advanced technologies including 5G, flexible automation and IoT, CATL has achieved a defect rate of DPPB (single defect rate per billion) for its cells, which is the top in the industry.
As for the next frontier in development of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, today's leading energy storage technology, CATL’s goal is further optimization of product performance including service life, power rating, and direct current resistance (DCR), which will in return pave the way to more competitive batteries for its customers.
In terms of cycle life, CATL has already made and deployed batteries capable of cycling 12,000 times. In 2020, CATL deployed the 12,000-cycle ultra-long-life batteries at the Jinjiang 100 MWh Energy Storage Power Station, which has been operating safely ever since, according to the company. CATL’s stated goal is to increase the cycle life to 18,000 cycles.
Beyond lithium-ion stationary storage technology, CATL is also at the forefront of development of the sodium-ion chemistry. It sees the technology as compatible and complementary to lithium-ion batteries.
CATL says it has successfully built the basic industry chain for sodium-ion batteries and established the mass production capacity, noting that the production volume and shipment scale depend on the implementation of customers’ projects.
According to CATL, there are still many conditions that need to be met in the market before the large-scale commercial application of sodium-ion technology. “We hope that the whole industry will work together to promote the development of sodium-ion batteries,” company representatives say.
In 2021, CATL rolled out its first generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. In April, it confirmed that Chinese Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
This year, CATL has also signalled that it is setting a foot into the emerging field of long-duration energy storage. In November, the manufacturer announced a 10 GWh supply deal inked with Australian renewable energy investor Quinbrook, which will initially involve the delivery of 1 GWh of CATL’s latest outdoor container LFP solution called EnerC Plus.
It also said that the partners will work closely together to assess the viability of “CATL's groundbreaking 8hr charge and 16hr discharge energy storage solution” for use on the Sun Cable Project located in Australia's Northern Territory, which is expected to include up to 20 GW of solar and up to 42 GWh of battery storage.
In the EV sphere, CATL’s major announcement this year was the development of the “condensed matter” battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg.
This was preceeded by the launch of Qilin battery in 2022, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.

Data analyzed by Solcast, via the Solcast API, shows a mixed November across Europe as Ireland, the west coast of Great Britain, Northern Italy, and the rest of Eastern Europe saw 10-30% above average November irradiance while other areas saw lower or close to average irradiance than normal.

The UK and Western Europe had a cloudy start to the month with Storm Ciarán. It passed over Southern England on November 2, bringing widespread flooding and damaging winds to Northern Europe.
This resulted in contrasting outcomes for different areas. As seen in cloud patterns of the image below, the Baltic low pressure steered more north-easterly winds than usual, which shielded the western side of the British Isles from the impact of the storm.

Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain observed irradiances 10-20% above the November average. However, typical November irradiance at these northern latitudes is less than 2 kWh/m2, so these increases will not have made an enormous difference to the power
generation mix.
In contrast to the Atlantic moisture and typical cloudiness seen in Western Europe, most of the southern and eastern regions have been sunnier. Sheltered from the north-westerly Atlantic moisture by the Alps, Northern Italy in particular received 30% above-average
irradiance.

The influence of the Baltic low-pressure system extended to Eastern Europe, with varied impacts. From the Adriatic Sea to Romania, irradiance was 20% below average, due to increased moisture and cloudiness pushed north by the low pressure system. However, the
rest of Eastern Europe was sheltered by Western Europe, resulting in irradiance 10-20% above average.
At similar latitudes to Ireland and Great Britain, the above-average irradiance is of a relatively low irradiance, so average daily irradiance was still higher overall in more southerly regions.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with a typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

Clean energy developer Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) has nominated Canadian Solar’s e-storage division as the preferred major contractor to build the 240 MW/480 MWh Summerfield Battery Energy Storage System being developed in South Australia’s Murraylands region.
Canadian Solar will supply its Solbank technology for the battery energy storage system with CIP saying a final investment decision on the project is due next year, with construction to begin by 2025.
CIP said the Summerfield project will initially have two hours of storage but there is scope for expansion to meet future market demand.
“The 240 MW Summerfield battery will provide much-needed storage and grid stability, storing excess supply during low demand periods and delivering power back to the grid when it is needed most,” the company said. “This is vital to maintaining a reliable and affordable electricity supply to South Australia, Victoria and the wider national energy grid.”
The project is being developed on land at Tepko, about 60 kilometres east of Adelaide. CIP said the site is “strategically positioned” on the proposed 275 kV South East transmission line expansion which will bring in new renewable generation from the South East Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
“We are excited about the role this battery will play in ensuring continued energy reliability for South Australians, and to be a catalyst for the transmission investment needed to unlock the South East Renewable Energy Zone,” CIP Australia head Jørn Hammer said.
“This is an easy win as far as transmission investment goes.”
CIP said the Summerfield battery is the first of multiple large-scale battery projects it has planned for Australia and part of a $100 billion development pipeline that includes offshore and onshore wind, renewable hydrogen, pumped hydro and battery storage.
A leading player in developing renewable energy projects in Europe, CIP is seeking to expands its presence in Australia to capitalise on opportunities in the energy transition.
Among the projects in its portfolio is the proposed Bowen Renewable Energy Hub project, a 1.4 GW integrated energy generation and storage project being developed in Queensland, and the gigawatt-scale Evergreen green hydrogen production hub planned for South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula.
It is also developing the 2.2 GW Star of the South offshore wind project off the Victorian coastline and the 5.2 GW Murchison Hydrogen Renewables project being developed near the Western Australian coastal town of Kalbarri.

The problem was first recognized around 2012; the industry did not know the exact cause behind it, but it has been quick to develop mitigation strategies.
Understanding the effectiveness of these strategies, and ultimately eliminating performance losses associated with LETID, requires comprehensive testing. Such testing is increasingly a requirement for module buyers wary of the financial impacts of unexpected performance losses.
With this in mind, an international group of researchers has investigated the stability to LeTID of gallium-doped Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si:Ga) PERC cells.
“In this study, we perform a wide variety of stability tests on typical industrial Ga-doped Cz-Si wafers and industrial PERC cells produced on the same material,” the scientists explained. “This serves to demonstrate that the robustness to LeTID of modern PERC cells originates in large part from adaptions within the cell process, as the material itself is still prone to degradation.”
The group performed the experiments on seven groups of Cz-Si:Ga wafers t with a resistivity range of about 0.4–1.0 Ωcm. In each group, half of the samples were processed into PERC cells produced by Chinese module maker Trina Solar in an old production line, and another half were processed into symmetrically passivated lifetime samples to assess the impact on the Cz-Si:Ga material itself.
Some samples were processed to create high hydrogen content and some to have lower content. According to existing scientific literature, the main contribution to LeTID is suspected to be the level of bulk material hydrogenation. In addition, boron-doped Cz-Si and boron-doped float zone silicon (FZ-Si) wafers were investigated for comparison.
“Our experiments on lifetime samples confirm that LeTID can, in fact occur in Cz-Si:Ga wafers,” the academics said. “The degradation was less pronounced than in boron-doped. The degradation was found under low and high illumination intensity at 75 C and also during the accelerated LeTID test of 2 sun equivalent. Illumination at 140 C. Dark annealing of the Cz-Si:Ga samples did not give rise to activation of LeTID defects in contrast to observations on B-doped material and earlier reports on a Cz-Si:Ga wafer.”
However, the experiment did not find LeTID affecting full industrial PERC cells. “We tested PERC cells under several conditions resembling different operation conditions and the accelerated LeTID test but found no relevant degradation,” they said. “This includes the cells to be stable after 300 ◦C dark annealing, which led to LeTID susceptibility in earlier product generations.”
In conclusion, the research group added that the differences in LeTID are due to the cell manufacturing process. “It can be stated that a suitable combination of dielectric passivation layers and thermal treatments – especially for metal contact formation – with Cz-Si:Ga effectively suppresses LeTID,” they said.
The results were presented in “Stability of industrial gallium-doped Czochralski silicon PERC cells and wafers,” published on Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The researchers were from the UK’s University of Warwick; Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the University of Freiburg; South Korea’s Korea University; and China’s Trina Solar and LONGi Green Energy Technology.

Installations – totaling 19 MW (AC) – will be awarded 20-year PPAs with a maximum tariff of LKR 34.93 ($0.11)/kWh, according to CEB tender documents.
Projects will be located near six existing substations. This includes the 2 MW (AC) Ampara substation in the country’s east and the 2 MC (AC) Habanara substation in the country’s north. It also includes the 1 MW (AC) substation in Kurunegala, the 3 MW (AC) substation in Veyangoda, the 5 MW (AC) substation in Kosgama, and the 6 MW (AC) substation in Pannala, all located in the country’s west.

The regulator awarded 6 TWh of 88 TWh tendered with the auctions largely unsubscribed. PV accounted for 98% of selected projects.
The ERO assigned 123 MW of PV capacity for renewable energy projects not exceeding 1 MW. The auction for this category had a ceiling price of PLN414 ($103.4/MWh), with the lowest bid coming in at PLN 284.95/MWh and the highest being PLN 355/MWh.
The ERO assigned 471 MW of solar for projects over 1 MW. The lowest bid was PLN272.91/MWh and the highest was PLN 389/MWh.
Hydroelectric power plants, farm biogas plants, biomass and non-farm biogas installations recorded “insufficient” project offers, the ERO said.
President of the URE Rafał Gawin said this year’s auction did not attract interest from generators.
“Only 6.8% of the electricity offered for sale was contracted, and the entrepreneurs investing in photovoltaic installations were virtually the only beneficiaries that stayed in the game,” he said.
Gawin said the results show long-term corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) are becoming an attractive alternative to the auction-based support system.
“Indeed, the auctions attracted little interest, even though the supply of photovoltaic projects is still relatively high,” Piotr Pająk, a PV analyst for Gramwzielone.pl, told pv magazine. “Similar, poor effects of the auction were recorded last year. The main reason is that investors are moving away from the auction system due to the relatively low sales prices of energy that they can secure.”
In this year's auctions, ceiling prices for photovoltaics were increased, but they were still too low to encourage a larger group of investors to submit offers. “In this situation, investors are looking for opportunities to secure revenues in market PPA contracts,” Pająk stated. “And the demand for such contracts from customers in Poland is growing. Local customers, but also corporations such as Amazon, Google and McDonalds, are looking for opportunities to purchase renewable energy under PPA contracts on the Polish market.”
The Energy Regulatory Office said it has contracted more than 274 TWh of electricity worth almost PLN 67 billion resulting from 2016 to 2023 auctions.
Poland recorded 12.4 GW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to data from the Polish research institute Instytut Energetyki Odnawialnej (IEO). The institute estimates the country's installed solar capacity could more than double to 26,791 MW by the end of 2025, with 5,981 MW of solar projects added to the grid this year.
SolarPower Europe said there were 4.9 GW of new solar additions in 2022, making Poland the third-best solar market in the European Union.

To calculate this average price, BNEF conducted more than 300 surveys among buyers and sellers of lithium-ion batteries for electric passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, buses, two- and three-wheeled vehicles, and energy storage applications.
Prices vary by sector: Chinese electric buses and commercial vehicles have the lowest prices at $100/kWh. The average price of packs for fully electric passenger cars was $128/kWh.
“However, the story behind this price decrease is somewhat different from previous years,” the analysts said. While the main cause of falling battery prices has historically been technological innovation, this year the price drop is mainly attributed to reduced raw material costs.
Prices for key battery metals, especially lithium, have fallen sharply since January, due to significant growth in production capacity in all parts of the battery value chain, from raw materials and components to cells and battery packs.
Although demand continued to increase year on year, the pace of growth in some electric vehicle markets slowed in the second half of the year, mainly due to increased financing costs and economic uncertainty. On the other hand, battery production in China alone exceeded global demand.
As for the future, BNEF's energy storage team expects prices to closely follow the trajectory of raw material prices. “We project that pack costs will fall to $133/kWh next year in real terms in 2023,” said BNEF. “In the long term, if the learning pace of the previous year is maintained, battery prices will fall below $100 /kWh in 2027.”
BNEF said that local battery manufacturing in regions such as the United States and Europe can drive up prices in the short term due to the price of energy, equipment, land and labor in these regions compared to Asia.
“However, as the industry matures, these costs could end up falling,” it said.

Researchers from the UNSW School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering have mapped PV productivity across future emissions scenarios in various parts of the world, with a focus on maximizing potential and minimizing costs in warmer climates.
Greenhouse gases affect climate change and global temperatures, but the study identifies additional impacts of aerosols on global horizontal irradiance (GHI). The study assessed the role of aerosols and cloud cover, along with temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed.
In addition to applying different emissions models over different world regions, the research also investigated the difference between mono-crystalline silicon (mono-Si) and thin-film modules to find out which would be more beneficial under different future climate scenarios. This is significant, of course, since mono-Si modules are dominant in the market but thin-film modules are more resilient to warmer climates, highlighting the importance of improving thermal management in PV modules. In Australia, for example, PV reductions were shown to be significant for mono-Si but not for thin film.
The study’s models reflecting different emission-level scenarios made such differences clear across global regions. The study found that, with increasing climate change, solar resources increased in West and Central Europe, South America, and Central North America. In contrast, global horizontal irradiance (GHI) reductions were predicted in northeast Africa, the Tibetan plateau and South Asia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/01/m10-solar-cell-prices-dive-to-new-record-low/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"DECEMBER 1, 2023",M10 solar cell prices dive to new record low,"The FOB China prices of both PERC and TOPCon Mono M10 cells, the mainstream size of solar cells in the current solar market, continued their downward trajectory and were assessed at $0.0550 per W and $0.0616/W this week, respectively. This marks their lowest prices ever, according to OPIS data, amid falling prices of the entire supply chain and weak demand in China and its key export market.
Cell prices were negatively impacted by the ongoing price decline of the supply chain in China. Prices for China polysilicon and Mono PERC M10 wafers both decreased this week by 4.07% and 0.40%, respectively. The price of Mono PERC modules is approximately CNY1.011 ($0.14)/W, which is extremely close to the industry's psychologically low value of CNY1/W, while the prices of TOPCon modules are slightly higher at CNY1.077/W.

OPIS learnt from its market survey that cell manufacturers are making every effort to lower production costs as they are experiencing losses. One of the approaches is to buy wafers of reduced quality. According to a cell supplier, the Mono PERC M10 wafers with reduced quality are available on the China market for CNY1.7/pc while good quality wafers are still priced between CNY2.2/pc and CNY2.3/pc. This may resonate with a few downstream users who have been worried about the impact that this competition to cut production costs may have on module quality for 2024.
Another strategy for cell manufacturers to cut production costs is to outsource their production to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). OPIS has learnt from the marketplace that a major cell manufacturer has an extremely high operating rate, as it has won numerous contracts from other cell companies that have outsourced their cell production.
According to OPIS’ market survey, manufacturers who outsource cell production benefit from the low cost brought by the high operating rates of OEMs, and could provide Mono PERC M10 cells at lower than CNY0.43/W in the China market. Those who continue to produce at low operating rates in their own production facilities are still offering it at around CNY0.45/W.
Sentiment in China remains bearish. According to the National Energy Administration, China deployed 13.62 gigawatts (GW) of solar in October, which presents a month-to-month decrease of 13.69%. This is the third straight month that China's newly installed solar capacity has declined.
China’s key export markets continue to offer little sunshine. A state-owned cell manufacturing enterprise claims that sales of its cells have been hindered since the second half of the year, especially in the cell export market. Purchasing Chinese cells has become a rare occurrence for their Southeast Asian consumers, although formerly they did so regularly.
“The module producers cannot use Chinese cells if they want to ship their products to the US market; the local Southeast Asian market has a very limited solar capacity to digest Chinese cells and modules,” this supplier explained.
Looking ahead, the industry anticipates that the price of Mono PERC M10 cells will continue to decrease, with industry discussions suggesting that it may drop to approximately CNY0.4/W very soon in the Chinese domestic market. This indicates that the sentiment in the cell market will remain subdued.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/01/new-zelands-largest-utility-scale-solar-project-starts-generating-power/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW ZEALAND",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 1, 2023",New Zealand’s largest utility-scale solar project starts generating power,"From pv magazine Australia
Renewables developer Lodestone Energy has started generating energy at its 39.4 MW solar project in Kaitaia, on New Zealand's North Island. The developer, which started work in late 2022 and broke ground in April 2023, expects the project to generate 55 GWh of power per year.
Besides the Kaitaia Solar Farm, Lodestone’s phase-one capital program includes solar projects at Edgecumbe, Waiotahe, Whitianga and Dargaville. While Kaitaia is the first of Lodestone’s solar farms to start generating, Edgecumbe is expected to be commissioned early in 2024 and Waiotahe late in the same year.
“This project ushers in a new era for energy in New Zealand. Kaitaia is the first solar farm at this scale and is a key step in helping New Zealand deliver on its climate goals,” said Gary Holden, managing director of Lodestone Energy. “It is also crucially important to our customers who have contracted with us to meet their own sustainable energy objectives.”
The Kaitaia installation is an agrivoltaic project, so agricultural activity can continue in and around the solar installations and even be enhanced by the solar facility. The project is surrounded by regeneration efforts with tree planting, among other elements.
With more than 61,000 solar panels installed at the North Island plant, the farm’s 55 GWh of power annually will flow to residential and commercial energy consumers, including all of the stores in New Zealand’s Warehouse Group, which is signed up to Lodestone’s phase 1 portfolio.
Lodestone Energy is New Zealand’s first utility-scale solar generation company and is wholly New Zealand-owned. About 80% of New Zealand’s electricity is from renewable sources, most of which is hydro generation, and less than 1% is generated by solar power. This looks set to change as the field of solar energy slowly ramps up in Aotearoa.
This week, The New Zealand Herald reported that a smaller solar farm has also started generating power.  The Te Ihi o te Rā solar facility has just started generating power in Gisborne’s airport district on the mid-east coast of the north island. The solar farm produces enough power for 1,000 homes, with about 7,300 MW of electricity produced annually.
