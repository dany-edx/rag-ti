https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/31/hydrogen-bromide-flow-battery-for-large-scale-renewables-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 31, 2022",Hydrogen bromide flow battery for large-scale renewables storage,"Elestor, a startup based in the Netherlands, has secured €30 million ($29.9 million) in funding from a consortium of lenders led by Norwegian energy producer Equinor.
It will use the funds to further develop its hydrogen bromide (HBr) flow battery technology for renewable energy storage. The company plans to build a gigawatt-scale production facility at an unspecified location.
“We are also building the first commercial system as we speak,” said Elestor CEO Guido Dalessi. “The first customers are large corporates, adopting Elestor technology on a strategic basis. Their demand grows to serious production capacities and that will reduce the manufacturing cost very fast. Technically speaking, we are there in terms of lifetime and efficiency, but we need to bring this technology to series production in order to further reduce the production costs, and along with that, the levelized cost of storage (LCOS).”
In the proposed system configuration, HBr works as the system’s electrolyte. The system assembles a large number of Elestor’s electrochemical single cells connected in series. The membrane surface area determines the power of the system and the tank volumes determine the capacity. According to the manufacturer, both can be designed independently, in any desired combination.
During the charging phase, HBr is split into hydrogen ions and bromide ions. The hydrogen ions cross then the membrane, absorb an electron, and are stored as hydrogen gas in a separate tank. The resulting bromine (Br2) is then dissolved in the same tank as the HBr.
During the discharging phase, hydrogen is recombined with bromine forming HBr again, and the stored energy is then released.
“Our HBr flow battery combines electrolyzer and fuel cell functionality with one single membrane,” Dalessi said. “The discharge processes do not suffer from degradation and the system is self-contained with no emissions. After around 10,000 cycles, the stack modules can be replaced, while the system itself including active materials remains unchanged. With new stacks, the system is given a full second life.”
The manufacturer claims the system has a depth of discharge of 100% and a round-trip efficiency ranging from 65% to 75%. The containerized version has a power output of 200 kW and a storage capacity of 2,000 kWh. Each cube container measures 12.2 m x 2.4 m x 2.9 m and has a gross weight of 42 tons.
Dalessi claims the battery could potentially achieve an LCOS lower than $0.05/kW.
“Scaling and automating production is one of the main reasons to enter this investment round,” he said. “Potentially, the LCoS of the Elestor technology can be far lower than for instance lithium-ion storage, especially when it concerns long-duration storage applications. All these claims, like on LCoS, have been extensively challenged in detail during the investment round by external advisers to the investors. Apart from the financials, another result of successfully closing this investment round is that the Elestor technology, proposition and organization have implicitly been validated.”

Germany added 535 MW of new PV capacity in July, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur).
The month's new capacity additions compare to 612 MW of solar in June and 434.9 MW of solar in July 2021. The country's cumulative installed solar capacity surpassed 60 GW at the end of July.
About 470.7 MW of the monthly new additions were represented by PV installations that were built under the country's incentive schemes for renewables. The rest of the capacity came from PV systems built outside of such incentive programs.
If the EU Commission does not approve new feed-in tariffs, Bundesnetzagentur will continue to publish the values to be applied, which will then be subject to a degression of 1.4%. From September, these would be between €0.0499 ($0.049)/kWh and €0.0646/kWh for PV systems up to 750 kW in size. For other systems with outputs above 750 kWh, the value to be applied in September is €0.0453/kWh.

It reportedly has an exergy efficiency of 16.24%.
“Our system combines photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) modules with organic Rankine cycle (ORC), a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, and liquefied natural gas (LNG),” researcher Ehsanolah Assareh told pv magazine. “It is able to supply electrical and thermal powers, hydrogen, and oxygen.”
The system was designed with PVT collectors, hot and cold storage tanks, and two pumps. Water is used as a working fluid for the PVT panels. Excess heat from the PV layer is stored by an absorber plate and glass wool reduces the heat loss from the absorber plate and tubes.
The hot water is then sent to the hot tank while the hot liquid is pumped to the ORC unit, which uses propane as a working fluid. The ORC's saturated fluid generates then power in the turbine.
“Once the fluid has exited the evaporator, it enters the turbine and expands to generate mechanical work,” the scientists explained. “The mechanical energy generated propels an electric generator coupled to the turbine, producing electrical power. Finally, the fluid from the turbine exit is transferred to the condenser, where it is rejected as heat.”
The fluid then exits the turbine and is transferred to the condenser and the cold energy of LNG is used as a heat sink.
“Reduced pressure in the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and increased ORC output power are two advantages of using LNG cold energy recovery technology. The temperature of LNG is relatively low,” the researchers stated. “A pump is used to compress LNG to high pressure. The pressurized LNG is fed into the condenser to condense the exhaust vapor from the ORC turbine and is subsequently vaporized into natural gas (NG) in a heat exchanger. When superheated NG enters an LNG turbine, the enthalpy drop is increased, and more electrical power is generated.”
In the proposed system configuration, the electrolyzer takes power to produce hydrogen from the ORC turbine, while oxygen intended for medical applications is produced via the LNG turbine.
The Iranian group used artificial intelligence (AI) tools as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to assess the economical viability of the system. They found that the ideal system has an exergy efficiency of 16.24%, a cost rate of $4.48/h, and a net electrical power of 33.32 kW.
“The findings reveal that in Tehran, Dubai, Paris, and London, the most critical monthly electrical power generated by PVT collectors is 9,390 kWh, 8,666 kWh, 7,050 kWh, and 7,040 kWh,” the scientists said. “In addition, the maximum monthly hydrogen production for the locations is 62 kg, 75 kg, 17 kg, and 14 kg, respectively.”
They described the system in “Innovative integrated solar powered polygeneration system for green Hydrogen, Oxygen, electricity and heat production,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management. The research team includes scientists from the University of Sharjah in the UAE, the Aalborg University in Denmark, and the Université de Monastir in Tunisia.
“Future research could focus on designing and optimizing the suggested integrated energy system to provide the building’s heating, cooling, and electrical loads and load of hydrogen vehicles,” they concluded. “Moreover, an experimental study of the proposed polygeneration is recommended.”

Ada Li, head of Latin America at Sungrow, told pv magazine that the Chinese inverter manufacturer is carefully evaluating the possibility of opening a new factory outside of China. Such a factory would assemble inverters, with parts imported from China.
Separately, Sungrow said it has reached 9 GW of total delivered capacity to South America, with 6 GW of the total delivered to Brazil alone. It said about 3 GW in Brazil were delivered for utility-scale PV projects, with central inverters accounting for a 70% share of the market, and string inverters accounting for the remainder.
“We think that in the next five years Brazil will continue to be in the top five of PV markets worldwide. The biggest growth will be in distribution generation, for the residential segment,” said Li.
For Sungrow, financing is still the most challenging aspect of working in the Brazilian PV market.
“We see one restriction for demand – not so much module prices, but bank interest rates here in Brazil,” Li said. “This is the main issue.”
Brazil’s baseline interest rate currently sits at 13.75%, leaving its PV market sensitive to the capex of solar projects. Public and private credit lines with more attractive interest rates have been created to incentivize the installation of solar.
Beyond Brazil, Sungrow is currently looking at Chile for utility-scale storage, and Mexico for commercial and industrial (C&I).

Arctech, a China-based solar tracking specialist, has started production at its first joint venture manufacturing base in India.
Jash Energy, the joint venture, has a solar tracker factory with an annual production capacity of 3 GW in Mundra, in the Indian state of Gujarat. The factory spans more than 16 acres of land and will produce all major components for Arctech solar tracker products.
The factory is modeled after Arctech’s existing Chinese manufacturing base, in both the automatic production line and manufacturing management system. It is equipped with an advanced automatic production line for Arctech’s patented torque tube, said the company. With the official launch of the factory, Arctech now caters to the entire lifecycle of its tracker systems in India, including structural, mechanical, and electrical design, as well as construction, operations and maintenance. 
Arctech’s shipments in India recently hit the 3.5 GW milestone. According to Wood Mackenzie, the company was India’s largest supplier of solar trackers in 2020 and held a 45% market share in 2021. 
“Jash Energy will have easy access to Western, Middle East, and African markets,” the company said.
Arctech has added more than 200 jobs to the local community by setting up the factory. It plans to offer technical training for local employees. It also intends to go deeper in vertically integrated production, including the use of local steel for trackers made in India. In addition, it aims to work with domestic steel manufacturing partners to develop solar trackers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/31/solaredge-under-investigation-for-alleged-patent-violations/,"INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 31, 2022",SolarEdge under investigation for alleged patent violations,"From pv magazine USA
Ampt, a power electronics specialist based in Colorado, has filed a lawsuit against SolarEdge, a major player in the power electronics space, for allegedly violating its patents.
The company said that SolarEdge violated patents on “power optimizers that contain high-efficiency power converters that both allow maximum power-point output and use operational boundary conditions that continue producing power during conditions that might otherwise require the optimizer to be bypassed.”
Now, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) has accepted the complaint from Ampt, and will launch an investigation into the alleged patent infringement. The ITC set a target of 45 days from the announced investigation to complete the review. Ampt is seeking a ban on imports of SolarEdge products as well as a ban on the sale of such products in the United States after they are imported.
Ampt string optimizers have two inputs and one output back to the inverter. The string optimizers are located between the PV source circuits and the combiner box on a PV system. The optimizer performs MPP tracking on each input and delivers full available power to the output at a voltage set by the inverter. This is done without requiring communication between the inverter and optimizers.
“We appreciate the commission’s decision to investigate SolarEdge’s unlawful use of our proprietary technology without asking our permission or compensating us,” said Levent Gun, Ampt's chief executive officer.
Ampt has also filed a patent infringement action involving claims from eight of its US patents in the US District Court in Delaware against SolarEdge seeking a finding of patent infringement, substantial monetary damages and an injunction.
“SolarEdge and Ampt have been litigating a dispute involving a patent family filed by SolarEdge and a patent family filed by Ampt before the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for many years,” SolarEdge told pv magazine. “Recently, the USPTO awarded priority of invention to SolarEdge, canceled the claims of Ampt’s patents, and awarded the patent claims in these Ampt patents to SolarEdge. It appears that having lost before the USPTO, Ampt is now shopping around its claims to other courts. SolarEdge anticipates a vigorous defense of these new cases.” 
SolarEdge, along with other players in the solar industry, is expected to grow significantly following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes record spending for renewable energy technologies. JP Morgan recently increased its 12-month share price target for the company from $373 to $419. The target implies a 51% increase from its current share price of $277.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/31/polysilicon-price-relief-in-2023-as-industry-scales-to-500-gw/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 31, 2022",Polysilicon price relief in 2023 as industry scales to 500 GW,"From pv magazine USA
The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association said last week that polysilicon prices touched $45.47/kg, before settling a bit lower. This is an increase of more than 600% from the low pricing of under $7/kg seen in the second quarter of 2020.
It takes about 3 grams of raw polysilicon to create each watt of a solar panel, so a 400 W residential solar panel uses 1.2 kg of polysilicon. The largest panels – 700 W utility-scale modules – use 2.1 kg. The 700 W utility-scale panel contains $90 of polysilicon.
Spot market prices are likely much higher than the prices being paid in long-term contracts. The cost of polysilicon inputs hasn’t risen nearly to the same heights, so companies that produce their own polysilicon are actually paying much less for their input costs. Multiple parties have suggested that the industry should see significant volumes of polysilicon manufacturing come online as the year ends, which would lead to decreases in pricing starting in 2023.
Clean Energy Associates (CEA), in its PV Price Forecasting Program Q2 2022 report, said “significant expansions among ingot and wafer suppliers are expected to create a competitive market scene when these suppliers can once again source lower-priced polysilicon.” It said that by the end of 2022, the world will have approximately 285 GW of polysilicon manufacturing capacity online.
While the executive preview version of the report does not share future polysilicon pricing, CEA does suggest that the average 2022 wafer pricing of $0.13/W could fall by as much as 23% by the end of 2023. This implies that polysilicon pricing could fall by roughly $10 per kg. BloombergNEF recently suggested that by the end of 2023, there will be enough polysilicon manufacturing facilities to supply 500 GW of solar modules.

The Chinese solar module manufacturer said its TOPCon 24.5%-efficient cells are based on front-laminated composite film passivation, which enables the back tunnel oxide passivation contact technology to improve the cell open-circuit voltage by more than 710 mV.
“The backside micro-processing and ultra-thin tunneling passivation layer improve the backside efficiency, as well as the cell bifaciality to over 90%,” the spokesperson said.
The 156-cell Panda 3.0 PRO module is available in six versions, with power outputs ranging from 590 W to 615 W and efficiencies ranging from 22.11% to 22.0%. Its open-circuit voltage is between 54.74 V and 56.44 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.72 A and 14.12 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panel measures 2,465 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs 35.0 kg. It also features an IP67 enclosure and 2 mm tempered glass. It has a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“Yingli's TOPCon cell capacity will be 5 GW at the end of this year, and will reach 10 GW next year and 15 GW in 2024,” the spokesperson explained. “All these capacities are located in Chinese manufacturing bases including Hebei province and Tianjin city. The production capacity of modules corresponds to it.”
