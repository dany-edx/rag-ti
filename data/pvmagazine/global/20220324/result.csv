Tambo International Airport.
The PV facilities are set to provide power to the system's traction, stations, and depots. The proposed projects should have an initial capacity of 3 MW and could also be linked to some storage capacity.
The rail network comprises a 25kV AC electrified and signaled standard gauge track infrastructure, of which 15.3km is situated underground, as well as 10 stations and one maintenance depot.
Interested consultants have until Mar. 28 to submit their bids.
With specially designed power electronics, PV can be directly connected to electrified railways to supply one-tenth of the energy needed to power trains, without connecting to the grid.
In related solar train news, the Swiss South Eastern Railway AG (SOB) commissioned a feasibility study from Swiss CMT AG a few years ago, with the aim of reducing its energy requirements and operating costs. It found that solar PV is “well-suited” for installation on the roofs of train stations, halls, and the soundproofed walls along railway lines.
Another recent study by Indian NGO Climate Trends and UK green-tech start-up Riding Sunbeams suggested self-generated solar power would be an optimal way of helping Indian Railways meet its 2030 net-zero target, given the rapid cut in carbon emissions and cost advantages it would offer.
In 2019, UK-based climate change charity 10:10 developed a demonstrator solar array in partnership with Community Energy South and national rail infrastructure operator Network Rail. According to its developers, a solar plant can theoretically be connected to any traction substation and supply from five to 10 km of the track in either direction.

The ribbon cutting for DSD Renewables’ new 7.5MW community solar project in Schenectady County, New York was met with considerably more fanfare than a typical project of its capacity, as the state’s Lieutenant Governor, Brian Benjamin, used the opportunity to announce that the state has reached more than 1GW of community solar installed and operational.
That milestone supplants New York as the top community solar market in the United States, edging out incumbent Minnesota, which has installed 830MW of operational community solar capacity as of February 2022, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.
“Reaching this nation-leading milestone – with more than one gigawatt of community solar installed – is a testament to New York’s aggressive pursuit of clean-energy alternatives that will supercharge our economy and bring us one step closer to a carbon-neutral future,” Governor Kathy Hochul said.
This community solar market dominance is only set to grow, as New York’s distributed solar pipeline is now comprised of more than 708 community solar installations, all in pursuit of achieving 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and the governor’s goal to achieve 10GW of solar by 2030. According to the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie’s Solar Market Insight 2021 Year in Review report, New York is not only the national leader for installed community solar, but is installing new projects at more than double the rate of second-place Massachusetts.
Similarly impressive to the capacity of community solar installed in New York is the speed in which these projects have reached operation. Prior to 2018, New York saw relatively little activity in community solar development, according to installation data collected by SEIA.
Much of the community solar developed in the state has received benefits from the state’s NY-Sun program, a state solar incentive program for distributed generation assets. Since being launched in 2011, NY-Sun has put forth more than $1.8 billion to advance the scale-up of solar and move the State closer to having a sustainable, self-sufficient solar industry. Tangibly, this funding has supported:
Not to be lost in the celebration, the 7.5MW community solar project in Schenectady that triggered the benchmark announcement is also notable for being a brownfield solar installation, located on the site of a former landfill in Glenville.
The project also features 10MWh of onsite energy storage and is part of a seven-project, 25MW portfolio made possible through a collaboration with the Schenectady County Solar Energy Consortium that provides over $400,000 in energy savings annually to the municipalities and cities of Schenectady County and enables each of the municipalities to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy.

The result was certified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany. “It was achieved using the same manufacturing processes as the N-type, demonstrating once again the versatility and robustness of this technology,” the CEA said in a statement.
“A new way of manufacturing P-type Cz wafers has recently been deployed on a large scale by replacing boron doping with gallium (Ga) doping at no extra cost, making them insensitive to degradation phenomena under light,” according to the statement. “A recent study indicates that P-type heterojunction cells should have an efficiency gap of less than 0.4% absolute to be competitive with N-type heterojunctions.”
The solar cell also showed an open-circuit voltage of 749.2mV, a short-circuit current of 9823mA, and a fill factor of 82.05%.
The wafer technology for the device was provided by Chinese manufacturer Longi.
Enel Green Power and the CEA achieved in August 2020 an efficiency of 25.0% for a heterojunction solar cell with an active surface of 213 cm2, based on a M2 silicon wafer format. With this result, the two parties had improved upon their previous record of 24.63%, reached last February. Enel said at the time the increase in efficiency was made possible by combining busbarless technology – which enables more light to fall onto the cell surface – and a treatment developed by INES and Enel which further improved cell passivation

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/24/large-area-reference-solar-cell-for-high-precision-measurements/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 24, 2022",Large-area reference solar cell for high precision measurements,"German engineering company Mencke und Tegtmeyer GmbH (IB-MuT) has brought to the market a reference solar cell solution developed by researchers from the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH).
Called BigRef, the new solution is claimed to be the only rugged encapsulated reference solar cell with an area of 160×160mm² available on the market – a size that, according to the research institute, compares with an edge length of only 20mm in conventional encapsulated reference solar cells.
“The unique design of the BigRef, which utilizes techniques like Ethylene-vinyl acetate encapsulation from photovoltaic module construction, results in extremely good thermal coupling to the base plate and thus excellent temperature control capability of the sensor,” the ISFH said. “This is essential for precise calibration of constant-light solar simulators and spectral responsivity measurement systems.”
The solution was developed following the current market trend for bigger solar modules, for which larger light fields of solar simulators are needed. “To measure their homogeneity, the irradiated area must be scanned and a homogeneity correction must be performed. The smaller the reference solar cell used for this purpose, the greater the effort,” the scientists said.
According to the ISFH, a large-area reference solar cell has the advantage that the need for a homogeneity correction can be completely eliminated, when the irradiance of solar simulators for single solar cells must be attentively calibrated. “This not only simplifies the calibration procedure but also leads to a lower measurement uncertainty,” it continued.
The new solution is currently being offered by Mencke und Tegtmeyer GmbH with the possibility of calibrating the simulators at ISFH's solar cell calibration laboratory.

It found that these installations may be competitive with conventional monofacial projects (MPV) across several locations in terms of levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
The scientists explained, however, that creative thinking and novel project architectures are needed to develop VBPV solutions with minimal additional land use and minimal need for additional support structures due to increased wind load. “It is important to note that VBPV and MPV installations in the same area, or even in the same building, can be complementary providing long uniform production during the entire day time,” they explained.
The Finnish-Norwegian group emphasized that the difference between VBPV arrays and MPV generators located at Nordic latitudes is given by factors such as the location itself, panel orientation, local light diffusion conditions, and ground reflectance, which may allow the long hours of low-angle morning and evening sun to be harvested when daily electricity consumption and prices are traditionally higher than at noontime when, by contrast, south-oriented monofacial projects provide their maximum yield.

Through their analysis, the academics found that incident irradiation on VBPV and conventional MPV systems enable the former to collect more irradiation at high latitudes and subtropical desert areas, with most of central Europe also being highlighted as an ideal area for VPBV deployment.
“VBPV outperforms conventionally mounted MPV in the Nordic countries even with a low albedo. Moreover, since the electricity consumption profile of a typical household peaks in the evening and is low at noon, VBPV can help to improve the match between production and the load for house-integrated PV systems,” they said referring to the possibility of deploying these kinds of projects on buildings either on rooftops or as solar fences.
The researchers also found that residential and commercial VBPV systems are a grid-friendly solution for low-voltage networks when compared to MPV arrays. “At the distribution grid level, the improved match between production and load decreases the chance of overvoltage occurrence, allowing higher PV penetration in the grid with VBPV,” they said. “At the national level, correlation between production peak and electricity demand can reduce the need for balancing power solutions, such as increasing gas generator production or electricity import.”
Their findings were presented in the paper Benefits of bifacial solar cells combined with low voltage power grids at high latitudes, published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. “To remove the barriers for large-scale VBPV implementation, especially the need for accurate irradiation modeling with a low solar altitude angle and identifying the most suitable locations for VBPV installations in built environment are identified as the key factors,” they concluded. “Although VBPV has the potential to be a commercial success at high latitude locations, such as the Nordic countries, it has to overcome several barriers.”

Kolkata-headquartered Vikram Solar, one of India’s leading module manufacturers and a comprehensive EPC solar solutions provider, has filed a draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with market regulator SEBI to launch its initial public offering (IPO).
Vikram Solar intends to utilize the net proceeds from the IPO primarily to fund the capital expenditure for a new 2GW solar module facility in Tamil Nadu with backward integration for solar cells. The manufacturer has already deployed INR 5.58 crore in the INR 1,244.39 crore project. It intends to fund the balance INR 1,238.80 crore of the project costs with the net proceeds. An amount not exceeding 25% of the net proceeds shall be utilized for general corporate purposes. 
The IPO consists of a fresh issue of up to INR 1,500 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to five million equity shares by the selling shareholders. 
The OFS comprises sale of up to 3,615,000 equity shares by group promoter Anil Chaudhary, up to 258,500 equity shares by Girish Kumar Madhogaria (individual shareholder), up to 126,500 equity shares by Pushpa Madhogaria (individual shareholder), and up to 1,000,000 equity shares by Vikram India Limited. 
Vikram Solar is one of India’s largest PV module manufacturers. As of Dec. 31, 2021, the company had a domestic market share of approximately 19% (calculated as a percentage of operational modules capacity) with 2.5GW of installed manufacturing capacity for solar PV modules (inclusive of trial production). It has a global footprint through a sales office in the United States and a procurement office in China and it has supplied PV modules to customers in 32 countries.

The electricity will be supplied to Tronox through wheeling agreements, which will see South African state-owned utility Eskom paid for the maintenance and upkeep of its infrastructure to transport the energy. The planned capacity should be fully operational by the fourth quarter of 2023.
“The projects will be majority-owned and operated by Sola Group and will deliver around 540GWh of energy to five mining operations through long-term power purchase agreements. The developments make use of the government’s recent relaxation of licensing requirements which exempt projects up to 100MW in size from requiring a generation license,” the company said in a statement, referring to the South African government's recent decision of raising the threshold for distributed generation to 100MW.
Through these provisions, renewable energy developers are exempt from applying for a license but they will be required to register with the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa). The measure is aimed to reduce dependence on Eskom for power supply. The troubled utility, which is currently unable to meet the country's power demand due to financial and operational issues, recently began considering renewables for its plant portfolio.

This low percentage value was previously applied only to residential solar arrays and heat pumps installed on buildings that were more than ten years old. “The VAT reduction will be extended to homes that are were also built in the past 10 years and will be in place until 31 December 2023,” Van Peteghem said. “Our country has more than 2.9 million very outdated homes that are waiting for an urgent energetic renovation by 2050, which represents a huge challenge for our families.”
The new measure will enter into force on April 1 and will be re-discussed by the Belgian federal government in September. Its further extension will depend on energy prices and Europe's energy crisis conundrum.
Belgium reached a cumulative installed solar power of over 7 GW at the end of 2021. According to recent analysis by Belgian institute EnergyVille, rooftop PV and onshore wind have the technical potential to reach 118 GW of capacity in Belgium. Of the three Belgian macro-regions, Flemish-speaking Flanders is the one with the largest solar potential for rooftop systems, at 67.56 GW, followed by French-speaking Wallonia, with 31.54 GW, and the Brussels metropolitan region, with 4.23 GW.

With the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecasting at least 45GW/620GWh of energy storage will be needed to cater for the transition of the nation’s energy system from fossil fuels to renewables, former prime minister Malcom Turnbull has pointed to pumped hydro energy storage projects, including the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 project, as the ideal technology.
Speaking at the Australian Energy and Battery Storage conference in Sydney on Wednesday Turnbull said energy storage, and in particular Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES), is the single most important element in Australia’s ongoing energy transition.
“The transition will require not simply green power to replace coal, but vastly more supplies of electricity to cater for the electrification of sectors, like transportation, household heating which rely on fossil fuels as well as the production of green hydrogen,” he said.
“We need more storage and above all we need projects which provide at least eight hours storage and more and are in a form that can be widely emulated.”
This need for energy storage is predominantly driven by the urgency to replace aging coal units with AEMO’s modeling showing that up to 14GW of the current 23GW of coal-fired generation could exit the market by 2030.
In its Draft Integrated System Plan (ISP) released late last year AEMO highlights that 60% of coal capacity would come out of the Australian system in the next eight years.

In its Draft Optimal Development Path, AEMO says nine times today’s utility-scale renewable energy would be needed to continue delivering affordable, reliable and secure power to consumers.
To firm that renewable generation, major investment in storage is required, with 45GW/620 GWh of dispatchable generation, including utility-scale batteries, hydro and other forms of energy storage needed. These will play the critical role of filling the gaps when renewable energy is not available.
“We need much more storage,” Turnbull said on Wednesday. “AEMO suggests at least another 45GW and for all the obvious reasons of security and grid stability it should be distributed and ideally located close to existing transmission.
“Even more importantly it should be, wherever possible, in a format that is repeatable.
“Obviously pumped storage is not replicable in the way a battery is, but the raw truth is that about 95% of the world’s stored electricity is in pumped hydro systems.”
Turnbull pointed to the $4.6 billion expansion of the existing 4.1GW Snowy Mountain Scheme as a prime example of a long-duration energy storage solution.
The Snowy 2.0 project, which involves linking the Tantangara and Talbingo dams via 27 kilometers of tunnels, will provide 2GW of dispatchable energy and provide 350GWh of large-scale storage, enough to power the equivalent of 500,000 homes for over a week during peak demand.
“Snowy 2.0 is the ultimate long-duration storage asset,” he said. “It will be able to generate 2000MW for seven-and-a-half days without repumping. Which is enormously valuable.”

Turnbull, who is now serving as chair of Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), said pumped hydro energy storage projects are ideally suited to provide longer-duration forms of energy storage, with the economics for battery projects of that scale not yet competitive.
“It’s easy to see a business case for a battery that can discharge for an hour or two or three or four,” he said. “FCAS (Frequency Control Ancillary Services) revenues, basic arbitrage all stack up. But storage for eight or more and more hours is harder to justify, at least in today’s market. But if we want to keep the lights on all the time, we will need it.
“We have to plan for a world where we have stopped burning coal and gas and when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. We won’t have any electricity unless we have stored it in some way.”
Turnbull said the technology already exists to support the transition to a net-zero economy, dismissing the Federal Government’s continued support for coal and gas as “as irresponsible as it is surreal”.
“There is a lot of lazy, glib talk about how the transition to net zero requires new technologies, innovations yet to spring from the imagination of a new generation of inventors,” he said.
“Don’t believe a word of it. We have the tools to do this job, right now. Variable renewable energy – wind and solar – supported by storage – batteries, pumped storage and green hydrogen – can take us to a zero-emission energy world.
“Of course new technologies, and refinements to existing ones, will emerge – whether it is bigger and better batteries and electrolysers, smarter turbines, or the creation of virtual power plants to name just a few.
“That’s great. But it is no excuse for not moving fast today. We have no time to waste.”

Hanwha Solutions announces stepped up efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products. Hanwha, the Korean company that owns Q CELLS, launched this effort by becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, a major US manufacturer of polysilicon.
Following its initial $160 million acquisition to acquire a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha is acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at around $44 million. This investment will help American manufacturers secure the raw material critical to the solar supply chain.
“Our commitment to the U.S. is more serious than ever before,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Q CELLS. “We plan to make investments to secure capabilities across the entire solar supply chain, with the goal of supplying our partners with ‘Made in America’ products that will help the U.S. regain its leadership in clean energy solutions.”
In the announcement, Hanwha indicated that it intends to make additional investments in virtually every sub-sector of the US solar manufacturing industry, ranging from key raw materials like polysilicon to fully assembled solar modules. The company currently operates the largest module production facility in the US through its solar panel business unit, Q CELLS. The Georgia factory can produce 1.7GW of solar modules per year, accounting for nearly 20% of total module production capacity in the US.
Hanwha’s US initiative supports the Biden administration’s efforts to increase solar power generation by 40% and to decarbonize all electricity by 2035. Hanwha sees the enactment of the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) as critical to a US-based solar supply chain. Once passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Biden, the legislation is intended to boost America’s panel manufacturing capacity and create jobs. The SEMA Coalition, representing American solar manufacturers supporting the legislation, said in a letter to President Biden, that the bill would add more than 30GW to domestic solar manufacturing capacity in the US by 2025, creating 18,000 direct and 60,000 indirect manufacturing jobs. Hanwha stated in its announcement that once SEMA is passed, the company “will implement a multi-phase, multi-billion-dollar expansion across the full solar energy supply chain”.
“Enacting SEMA is key to fulfilling our pledge to rebuild the U.S. solar supply chain with fully ‘Made in America’ products,” said the Hanwha Solutions spokesperson. “With a long term plan to support domestic solar manufacturing, we can help America lead the clean energy revolution and win the fight against climate change.”
Hanwha’s investment is also expected to add a substantial number of well-paying, local renewable energy jobs across America. Hanwha currently employs up to 750 staff in its Q-CELL production facility in Georgia.
“We imagine a Moses Lake factory brought back to life with local workers clocking in and operating the plant,” said a Hanwha spokesperson, referring to the currently idle REC factory, which is planned to reopen in 2023. “Together with our module factory in Georgia and new planned investments, we will fulfill our pledge to create quality clean energy manufacturing jobs across the United States.
Completion of the REC Solar transaction with Aker Horizons is scheduled in May 2022, subject to a customary anti-trust filing in the US. REC Silicon is expected to become operational in 2023.
