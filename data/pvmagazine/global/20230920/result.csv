The Swiss components manufacturer did not reveal the size of the investment in the two-year-old US startup, which develops autonomous ground vehicles to provide PV plant monitoring, including inspections of the rear sides of installed PV modules.
The financing round is meant to finance further development of the algorithms and artificial intelligence technology that OnSight Technology uses in its robots. They are equipped with computer vision systems, thermal cameras, and heat sensors to provide surveillance, detect anomalies, and record the status of infrastructure at PV plants.
The units can purportedly detect electrical problems that could threaten plant safety. The unmanned, remotely controlled units are solar-powered and can move at a speed of 1.6 km per hour for up to 12 hours a day.
It lists several reference customers on its website, including Duke Energy, a public utility, Enerparc, a German solar PV plant specialist, and McCarthy, a utility-scale solar and energy storage project company.
Staubli was joined by a second lead investor, Moneta Ventures, an early-stage investor based in California, along with an earlier investor Growth Factory Ventures, a startup accelerator based in California.
Staubli said the investment is closely aligned with its area of expertise.
“With our proven track record in the photovoltaics industry and our longstanding experience, we feel that it’s our responsibility to invest in the future of safer solar farms,” said Matthias Mack, vice president of renewable energy at Staubli. “We are very excited to participate in the development projects of OnSight Technology's innovative solutions.”

Speakers and exhibitors appear more confident than ever that solar cell and module performance will continue to improve, and that reliability and system lifetimes will increase.
The practical matters of rolling out these technology improvements at scale and integrating them into landscapes and electricity grids around the world are emerging as a new set of key concerns for solar experts in every specialty, and topics related to these take a prominent position at this year’s conference.
Topping the agenda since day one has been the geopolitics of manufacturing. The risk of continuing to rely on a single region for supply is becoming an essential component in energy systems. And there is a clear consensus that the solar industry wants to see action from the European Union and member state governments to support the establishment of a domestic supply chain for solar energy products via incentives.
Beyond that headline, several sessions have delved into the grid constraints that threaten to slow down solar installations in some otherwise leading markets – a topic that SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger called for researchers to address in the opening panel discussion on Monday. Solutions to these constraints are grid upgrades, energy storage and increased interconnection. Here as well, regulation seems to be a major hold up, and consensus is that allowing more private investment in grid infrastructure would be an effective way to speed up the required changes to energy infrastructure.
Integrating solar into landscapes and built environments has also been a key topic, as land constraints begin to be felt. Tuesday afternoon saw a session dedicated to ensuring the reliability of PV systems in tough climates such as deserts and water surfaces, and introduced the possibility of accelerated testing specifically designed to simulate these environments – a presentation by Bengt Jäckel of the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Photovoltaics introduced the idea of “mission profiles” to test PV equipment under the combined stresses of different environmental conditions. And the extra capacity that could be opened up by improvements in building-integrated PV products, agrivoltaics and also by simple efficiency improvements getting more energy out of the same amount of space.
Impressive progress in PV module recycling is also on show at this year’s conference, with high technology approaches to shred modules using light pulses or high pressure water jets on show, and new processes focused on extracting the most valuable materials for reuse. And it’s clear from those presenting and in the audience during this session that an industry is forming around these processes, with both new startup companies and those already established in glass recycling all looking at setting up factories able to handle several thousand tons of module waste per year.
Wednesday morning’s session covering the latest in silicon PV technologies also illustrated the industry’s growing focus on sustainability – with a presentation from Longi Solar’s Chunxui Li detailing potential problems with the supply of indium for heterojunction modules, and a neat way to get around this, achieving better than 26% cell efficiency.
This session later moved on to the high efficiency cell technologies now making their way from laboratories toward manufacturing.
Offering a comprehensive update on tandem cell technologies, Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin’s Rutger Schlatmann stated that the progress made and the number of companies pursuing the technology mean that the solar industry is now committed to bringing perovskite technology to the market. This was underlined in the following presentation by Oxford PV’s Laura Miranda and has been reflected in many other presentations on the topic of perovskites – which have focused on the development of testing and characterization techniques, as well as large-scale manufacturing processes, with few presentations demonstrating new lab-made cells.
Finally, on the technology front, First Solar’s Matthew Merfert revealed some impressive results and an ambitious roadmap for the US-based thin-film giant. The company hopes to increase its efficiency to 25% over the next few years, and has also successfully demonstrated an approach to replace its metal back contacting structure with a transparent conductive oxide, potentially opening doors to bifacial cadmium-telluride modules, and the uses of this technology in a tandem or multijunction cell stack.

The renewable energy company said the SAS Energy purchase will allow it to expand its in-house offerings to include financed and capital-funded projects across the solar, electric vehicle and battery storage sectors for commercial clients.
The acquisition follows a period of growth for SAS Energy, which specializes in C&I installations. Accounts filed with UK corporate register Companies House show that SAS Energy increased its workforce by 50% to 31 people in the year to Sept. 30, 2022. Inventory holdings increased from GBP 347,079 ($429,000) to GBP 1.76 million during the same period.
SAS Energy had more than 45 projects in development or construction at the time of the sale. EDF Renewables UK and Ireland plans to operate SAS Energy as a wholly owned subsidiary.
EDF Renewables UK and Ireland completed the acquisition on Sept. 15, marking the latest milestone in its ongoing collaboration with SAS Energy. Together, the companies worked on a rooftop PV installation at Safran's manufacturing site in Pitstone, United Kingdom. SAS Energy served as the main contractor for the project, which involved the installation of over 2,100 roof-mounted panels.
“We are looking forward to working with the SAS Energy team and EDF Business Solutions to expand our offering and reach a larger proportion of the UK Commercial and Industrial market; with enhanced delivery making onsite renewables projects more cost effective and accessible for our customers,” said Rachael Kyle, head of the C&I Renewables Team at EDF Renewables UK.
SAS Energy Managing Director Nick Porter said the company's mission from the start was to help businesses fight against climate change by deploying solar.
“From our existing relationship with EDF Renewables UK, it is clear that they share this vision so we’re incredibly excited to join such a well-established leader in renewables,” said Porter.

The PPIB said the successful solar projects will be built in the districts of Kot Addu and Muzaffargargh, Punjab. They will be developed on a build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) basis for a concession term of 25 years.
The deadline for the tender was extended once before, originally set to April 17. However, it was later extended to May 8.
In June, the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) merged with the PPIB.
NEPRA, the country's energy authority, recently granted 12 generation licenses, with a total capacity of 211.42 MW. Nine of those approvals were granted to solar projects with a total capacity of 44.74 MW. Last year, the nation installed 166 MW of solar capacity.
In May, NEPRA launched the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM), a new model for Pakistan’s wholesale electricity market. The Central Power Purchasing Agency said the model will “introduce competition in the electricity market and provide an enabling environment where multiple sellers and buyers can trade electricity.”
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Pakistan had 1,234 MW of installed PV capacity by the end of 2022.

German hydrogen specialist Enapter has developed a new electrolyzer for industrial applications.
The AEM Flex 120 system has up to 50 AEM stack modules and is designed to ensure flexible operation and high responsiveness to fluctuating loads from renewable energy, the manufacturer said. It added that it is specifically aimed at green hydrogen production in the range of 70 kW to 500 kW, to serve the needs of the refueling sector.
Enapter said it is possible to start with hydrogen production between 70 kW and 120 kW and then gradually expand. With an optional drying system, the device is expected to produce around 53 kg of hydrogen per day, with a purity of 99.999%.
The manufacturer said the new product closes the gap between its electrolyzers AEM EL 4 with a capacity of 1 kg per day and the AEM Multicore system with a capacity of 450 kg per day.
The company also said the electrolyzer comes with energy management software that enables the remote control of hydrogen production, storage and transmission.  The product is mounted on a frame and designed for easy and quick integration into the customer environment.
Enapter said it developed the first commercial product for the German company ABC-Klinker, a brick manufacturer that wants to gradually replace natural gas.
“ABC-Klinker chose the ‘AEM Flex 120' primarily to counteract price fluctuations in natural gas and to be able to start producing and using cost-effective, clean gas at short notice,” said Enapter.
The company said the electrolyzer is also drawing interest from other companies looking to replace fossil fuels in applications such as ovens and kilns. Additional potential applications in the sales pipeline include refueling stations for forklifts, cars, and buses, as well as electricity storage for peak load management and energy self-sufficiency.

Pieter Godderis, Managing Director of Svea Solar Utility, today told pv magazine the PPA was a “historic” agreement and a decade-long contract. “What’s historic for the company and for the whole solar industry in Sweden is that it is the largest power purchase agreement for solar energy in Sweden thus far,” he said. “Arla is a really big name and we are really proud that a big established company engages in this.”
Godderis said the move was part of a “clear” trend of companies to buy energy directly from domestic utility-scale solar parks.
“There's been an era where the Googles and Facebooks have entered these long, huge PPAs with big wind farms up north, so that's very established,” he said. “But now what we see more and more is maybe smaller consumers… having a direct agreement with a solar IPP for a long-term power off-deck.”
Godderis could not reveal the terms of the Svea Solar and Arla PPA or when it is expected to commence, but said the solar energy would be generated from a range of Svea Solar solar parks currently in development in Sweden’s southern region, electricity area SE3 (Stockholm).
He said there were benefits to operating solar parks in the SE3 as there was congestion transporting the energy generated in SE1 and SE2 – predominantly from wind and hydro – to the bottom of the country, where the “largest consumer of electricity in Sweden” resides.
Svea Solar has built over 30 solar parks in Sweden with an additional 30 large-scale solar parks under development in European countries such as Italy, Spain and Cyprus.
Godderis said the company expects five more solar parks to reach a commercial operation date (COD) later this year and early next year.
Svea Solar’s bread-and-butter is installing rooftop solar systems, with 20,000 completed installations under its belt, according to its website. Godderis said the company should also be known as an independent power producer with an international scope.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/20/new-design-for-vacuum-integrated-photovoltaic-curtain-walls/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2023",New design for vacuum integrated photovoltaic curtain walls,"A group of researchers in China has developed a new design for vacuum integrated photovoltaic (VPV) curtain walls, which they claim can efficiently combine PV power generation and thermal insulation for the building.
“For the first time, a multi-function partitioned design method for PV curtain walls was proposed, which aims at reconciling the competing demand of different functions of PV curtain walls such as daylight, view, and power generation,” the research's lead author, Jinqing Peng, told pv magazine. “Now, we are optimizing the height and PV coverage rate of each section, and after this study, we will cooperate with enterprises to produce the partitioned PV curtain wall.”
The researchers explained that VPV curtain walls with high PV coverage may be beneficial to a building, as they may prevent large amounts of solar radiation from entering the building, thus preventing overheating issues. By contrast. VPV curtain walls with low PV coverage may have overheating issues, but may help the building require less energy for lighting and heating.
“Thus, the single-objective optimal design of the VPV curtain walls is unable to balance its restrictive and even contradictory functions,” they stated. “The primary objective of this study is to balance the trade-offs between the different functions of the VPV curtain wall and improve its energy-saving potential while ensuring the comfort of the occupants.”
The system consists of a PV laminate glass based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells, an air cavity, and a sheet of vacuum glazing. The scientists etched the solar cells into strips by laser.
The system is also divided into daylight, view, and spandrel sections based on the different functions, and the PV coverage of each section must be determined separately. The daylight and view sections are designed to provide daylight and a visual connection to the exterior, while the spandrel section is mainly intended for power generation. This allows the modulation of the transmittances of each section by adjusting the density of the PV cell strips.
The Chinese group simulated the performance of the VPV curtain via the Radiance and EnergPlus software and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). They assumed the system is deployed in a south-facing private office building.
“It is assumed to be the middle floor of a high-rise glass curtain wall building with dimensions of 2.7 m in height, 4.0 m in depth, and 3.0 m in width,” the researchers stated. “The VPV curtain wall was equipped on the southern façade with a large window-to-wall ratio of 86%.”
The simulation showed that the PV coverage variation of the daylight section has a big impact on useful daylight illuminance (UDI) and the discomfort glare index (DGP). Discomfort glare is a psychological sensation caused by high brightness, and UDI refers to the amount of daylight that is useful to a space's occupants. 
Furthermore, the academics found that the optimal system configuration would require 20% PV coverage in the daylight section, 40% PV coverage in the view section, and 90% coverage in the spandrel section. “The optimal VPV curtain wall, with 50%, 40%, and 90% PV coverages for daylight, view, and spandrel sections, achieved a 34.5% reduction in glare index, 4.9% increment on the UDI, 5.2%
increment on the ratio of net-zero energy hours (RNEH), and 112.59 kWh augment of surplus electricity,” they also explained.
The system was described in the study “Multi-function partitioned design method for photovoltaic curtain wall integrated with vacuum glazing towards zero-energy buildings,” published in Renewable Energy. The research group comprises scientists from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Hunan University in China.
“As for the cost of this system, the partitioned PV curtain wall only differs from the traditional PV curtain wall solely in the arrangement of solar cell strips,” Peng concluded. “Consequently, there is no significant cost difference between the two designs, but the proposed partitioned PV curtain wall can reduce building energy consumption and yield more surplus power generation electricity.”

Swisspower-Stadtwerk SIG, the power utility in the Swiss canton of Geneva, has announced the completion of a 200-meter PV system deployed along a section of road in Satigny. It said construction of the Solar Horizon system took six months. The installation is expected to generate 200,000 kWh hours of electricity per year.
In 2021, SIG announced an architectural competition to create the prototype of the photovoltaic roof to be used in the cycle path. The winner was Colucci & Colucci, an architectural firm.
According to SIG, the facility was designed in consultation with nature, heritage and landscape protection. Recycled concrete was used for the foundation, a metal structure and a secondary structure made of local wood, meaning that the system fits perfectly into the landscape.
The electricity from the 468 bifacial solar modules will be fed into the Geneva grid.
The company has estimated the cost of the project at CHF 1.5 million ($1.67 million). The prototype is now being evaluated and could be further developed in Geneva or other locations in Switzerland.

A fire erupted this week inside a solar battery storage container at the Valley Center Energy Storage Facility in northern San Diego County, California. The fire occurred when a battery storage unit caught fire, according to Terra-Gen, the owner of the energy storage facility.
The Valley Center Energy Storage Facility is a standalone 139 MW energy storage project in a commercial-industrial zone. Homes and businesses near the site were evacuated and a local shelter-in-place order was put into effect. Terra-Gen has since issued a statement saying that the facility’s design systems kept the incident contained.
The energy storage facility houses lithium-ion batteries in racks within enclosures. Electricity is stored and discharged from the batteries to the inverter transformer located next to them, which converts the energy from DC to AC. The energy is delivered to the SDG&E Valley Center substation located one-third of a mile away. Terra-Gen contracted with San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) to provide power under a 15-year Resource Adequacy (RA) contract for up to 14,000 homes for four hours on a single charge..
Lithium-ion batteries have been known to cause fires, explosions, arc flashes, electric shocks from the energy storage systems can expose workers and area residents to toxic chemicals. The McMicken fire is an often cited incident that occurred in  2019 in Arizona when an Arizona Public Service (APS) battery failure and corresponding explosion left eight firefighters and one police officer hospitalized. Insights from that fire are reflected in the 2023 National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 855 code revision. American Clean Power recently published a guide for first responders on lithium-ion battery energy storage system emergencies that takes the new code into account.
The Valley Center facility has been online since March 2022, and this is reportedly the second fire at the location. The first occurred in March of this year when a faulty sprinkler system caused the decommissioning of LG batteries.
The California Public Utilities Commission recently approved a plan to add more than 25.5 GW of renewables and 15 GW of storage by 2032, at a cost of $49 billion. The purpose of ramping up battery energy storage is to prevent power outages, help stabilize the grid, and help with peak power demand, all especially important in an area prone to high heat and wildfires. SDG&E is reportedly nearing approximately 300 MW of its own energy storage and Pacific Gas & Electric is also moving quickly to ramp up its battery resources.
In the September issue of pv magazine, we examine booming solar markets in Brazil and Mexico; investigate whether TOPCon modules really are more susceptible to degradation than PERC products; attempt to unravel how US solar manufacturers can qualify for domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act; and look at how homeowners can achieve the residential solar, battery, and EV dream.
According to Terra-Gen, the Valley Center project also provided economic benefits amounting to tens of millions of dollars in the form of direct and indirect jobs associated during construction and increased property taxes. In addition, the company donated $250,000 to support the Valley Center Fire Protection District’s new fire station.
Terra-Gen reports that it owns and operates four battery energy storage projects in California, representing more than 1.5 GW of energy storage, or enough to power 1.5 million homes for approximately four hours. The company has an additional 1 GW under construction, expected to come on-line in 2025.

Their work consists of a comprehensive review of advances achieved in the field of solar forecasting based on computer vision with deep learning. Computer vision is a special branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers to interpret and understand the world using digital images from cameras and videos. The deep-learning models and tools used with this approach are able to identify and classify objects.
“Integrating the solar panel spatial configuration and local shadowing effects caused by vegetation, buildings or terrain variation, has the potential to ameliorate the accuracy of solar forecasts,” the researchers explained. “This information could be inferred from irradiance measurements, object detection from sky images or high-resolution remote sensing observations, LiDAR data, and other in situ 3D mapping measurements.”
Another way to enhance deep-learning solar forecasting models recommended by the article is the introduction of the laws of physics. This could help with predictions of streamlines, which are paths that floating clouds trace in the atmosphere.
“Machine learning methods based on computer vision are capable of visualizing streamlines in satellite images and ground-based sky images but in a suboptimal manner,” the researchers said. “In this context, a physics-informed deep learning method has the potential to optimally visualize fluid mechanics field lines.”
The paper also suggests that the limited generalization skills of current deep-learning models are a strong limitation to their widespread implementation. However, the academics said this could be resolved by building models on many open-source data sets throughout the world.
The research group encourages future work to use a standard benchmark data set, as that will help to compare different models.
“Although there are studies benchmarking certain types of solar forecasting models based on a single dataset, there are currently very limited studies cross-comparing different types of solar forecasting models, i.e., deep learning-based models, machine learning-based models, timeseries models, and physics deterministic models on standardized datasets,” they said.
The researchers presented their findings in “Advances in solar forecasting: Computer vision with deep learning,” which was recently published in Advances in Applied Energy. The group includes scientists from the European Space Agency, ENGIE Lab, University of California Santa Barbara, Stanford University, Idaho National Laboratory, Open Climate Fix, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Réseau de Transport d’Électricité, the World Energy and Meteorology Council, and University College Dublin.
The research group concluded by calling for better coordination between commercial forecast developers and grid operators.
“This is a significant barrier that can, however, be overcome by putting effort into understanding the needs and processes of the user (i.e., grid operators) on the one side and developing the products with the users on the other side,” they said. “Further, grid operators might need to upgrade their skills via dedicated training to gain the required knowledge to understand and use recent computer vision-based forecasting models.”

The research group said the vehicle is road-legal and independent of charging stations.
The “Stella Terra” car has a top speed of 145 km per hour, weighs 1,200 kg, and has a maximum range of 630 km. It collects energy from rooftop PV panels.
“Stella Terra must withstand the harsh conditions of off-roading while remaining efficient and light enough to be powered by the sun,” said Wisse Bos, the team manager of the student group. “That is why we had to design almost everything for Stella Terra ourselves, from the suspension to the inverters for the solar panels.”

“Our low-cost watertight canopy solar car parking structure is designed to give maximum power for east-west facing double row car parking layouts,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “For installation north-south each rafter can be set to different angles of inclination.”
The manufacturer offers the structure in three different versions: the Double Gull Wing, which can host up to 6 solar panels in portrait architecture; the Double Mono, which can embed up to 5 PV panels in portrait for south-facing locations; and the Single Row, which can host up to 3 modules and is ideal, according to the company, for projects connected to EV charging.
“Typically, a 45 m long Gull Wing structure would consist of 6 m x 7.5 m bays with each bay consisting of 6 car parking spaces,” the spokesperson said, referring to the first version of the product, noting that it allows for cantilevered canopies to increase the number of panels and lower the cost per W. “Using XL PV panels of 575 W would provide 141 kW, which equates to 3.9 kW per car parking space.”
The structure is built with galvanized steel and lower structural weight, which the manufacturer allows to build low-cost foundations. Furthermore, it does not require a steel sheet or mounting rails for the solar panels.
“It also incorporates cable containment, guttering, colored facias and end gable facades,” the spokesperson added. “The central post area is minimized to enable vehicles to open doors without damage.”
The company said the structures are entirely produced at its facilities in the UK, from UK-held steel, which it said enables quick project turnaround.
SIG Building Solution said the solar carport structure has already been deployed by an unspecified British local authority, a motor manufacturer, a leisure center and a business park in the UK, for a total of around 500 solar parking spaces.
