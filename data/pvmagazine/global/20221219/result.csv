The Australian government has signed off on a $117.5 million investment to deliver eight large-scale batteries with a combined 2 GW/4.2 GWh of storage capacity. The investment will help to stabilize and balance the nation's major grid, the National Electricity Market (NEM), as Australia transitions from coal-fired power to renewables.
Funded through the government-owned Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Large Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, each battery will be equipped with grid-forming inverter technology, allowing them to provide essential system stability services traditionally provided by synchronous generation such as coal and gas.
System strength services and inertia have historically been provided by baseload coal and gas power plants, but ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said grid-forming technologies could provide the necessary substitute as the penetration of variable, renewable energy increases.
“It's the ability of this advanced inverter technology to support the grid without coal or gas that's fundamental to the innovation here today,” he said. “We know we need the energy, but we also need those crucial system security services, frequency support voltage and the like that these new batteries can provide.”
The funding will see seven new batteries developed across the states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. The batteries range from 200 to 300 MW each and will provide virtual inertia and system strength services to the grid.
The funding also provides for a major upgrade of the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery near Geelong. Owned by French renewable energy developer Neoen, the storage facility will be retrofitted to enable grid-forming capability.

All of the projects are expected to reach financial close in 2023 and be operational by 2025.
ARENA said with a total project value of about $1.8 billion and a combined capacity of 2.0 GW/4.2 GWh the projects represent a ten-fold increase in grid-forming electricity storage capacity currently operational in the NEM.
Miller said the batteries represent a transformative portfolio of new storage capacity and will help underpin the transition to renewable energy in Australia. And added that the need to smooth out variable generation and store electricity is essential for Australia's transition to renewables.
“These next-generation grid-scale batteries will underpin this transition, with inverter technology that can maintain grid stability without the need for coal and gas generators. This pipeline of grid-forming projects will help move us closer to an electricity grid that can support 100% renewable energy in the NEM,” said Miller.
The developers and projects ARENA has selected for support are:
Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the successful projects, which include the first grid-forming batteries in Victoria and Queensland, will be a major step forward for Australia's energy grid.
“We know that part of a renewable economy is being able to store renewable energy,” he said. “These batteries will help stabilise the grid and deliver the cleanest, cheapest form of energy for Australian businesses and households.”
ARENA has previously provided $54.5 million in funding for eight grid-scale batteries, including five with grid-forming capability at a smaller scale. The 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, which received ARENA funding for its 2019 expansion, is currently the largest grid-forming battery in Australia.
The agency said the previous projects have highlighted the potential of grid-forming batteries and the need to support further projects at a larger scale to build experience with the technology, de-risk investment and drive further innovation from inverter manufacturers.
It said the funding round will also help to overcome current commercial and regulatory barriers to large-scale deployment.

Annual additions grew by almost 50%, up from 28.1 GW in 2021. It's another record-breaking year for solar, with the continent adding 10 GW more capacity than predicted by SPE in 2021.
Germany again installed more solar than any other European country, adding 7.9 GW. Spain followed close behind with 7.5 GW of new installations, and Poland closed out the top three with 4.9 GW. Poland's shift from net-metering to net-billing in April 2022, combined with high electricity prices and a fast-growing utility-scale segment, contributed to its remarkable third-place performance.
The Netherlands (4 GW), France (2.7 GW), Italy (2.6 GW), Portugal (2.5 GW), Denmark (1.5 GW), Greece (1.4 GW), and Sweden (1.1 GW) round out the solar top 10, all above the GW milestone according to SPE estimates. While the top five EU markets remain unchanged from 2021, Portugal and Sweden entered the top 10 at the expense of Hungary and Austria. Portugal joined the GW club for the first time thanks to impressive annual growth of 251%, mainly due to the large increase in utility-scale solar.
Italy, on the other hand, finally returns to the GW group after adding an estimated 2.6 GW, 174% year-on-year growth.
“The small-scale PV segment has bolstered the market, thanks to the country’s favorable Superbonus 110% incentive scheme, and high electricity prices which have improved the attractiveness of self-consumption business models,” the report reads.
The EU’s total solar power capacity grew by 25%, from 167.5 GW in 2021 to 208.9 GW in 2022, according to SPE. The industry body forecasts annual PV growth in Europe will be 53.6 GW in 2023, and 85 GW in 2026, according to its “most likely” scenario. This means the EU solar market is set to more than double within four years, reaching 484 GW by 2026.
“The numbers are clear. Solar is offering Europe a lifeline amid energy and climate crises. No other energy source is growing as quickly, or reliably, as solar,” said Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe. “We’re building a secure, green, prosperous Europe on a foundation of solar.”
The report also highlights five key areas for getting Europe ready for solar: expanding the pool of solar installers, maintaining regulatory stability, improving grid stability, streamlining administrative procedures, and strengthening European manufacturing.
“It’s more than high time to take solar seriously,” added Dries Acke, policy director at SolarPower Europe, “That means tackling barriers head on.”
Acke then called for “more electricians and stable electricity market regulation. A solar-powered Europe can only be based on smoother administrative processes, speedier grid connections, and resilient supply chains.”

The French developer told pv magazine that they will be available to order from the first half of 2023, with first deliveries from the third or fourth quarter of 2024. It is developing plug-and-play solutions for the telecoms industry, airports, hospitals, water treatment plants, and data centers. Other generators will target sea applications, especially for energy-intensive vessels. EODev said it is helping customers to source hydrogen and is signing contracts with hydrogen suppliers throughout the world to “guarantee the availability and price of hydrogen” for its customers, with a focus on North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.
Gascade, Ontras, and terranets have agreed to create Flow, a hydrogen pipeline system connecting five European countries from the Baltic Sea to southwestern Germany. “The project partners will convert existing gas pipelines,” the companies said. “At a length of more than 1,100 km and a feed-in capacity of up to 20 GW (depending on the pressure level), the pipeline system will already be large in dimension at the start – and will be expanded going forward.” They plan to convert the first hydrogen pipelines in Germany from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to Thuringia by 2025, followed by a line from Hesse to Rhineland-Palatinate in 2028, which Gascade said will make it possible to transport hydrogen to Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria from 2030.
Nikola has agreed to sell up to 75 Nikola Tre fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) to Plug Power over the next three years, with the first trucks being delivered in 2023, under a new strategic partnership. Plug will pair the FCEVs with its liquid hydrogen tankers and will provide integrated liquefaction systems for Nikola's recently announced hydrogen hub project. The companies have also signed a supply deal for 125 metric tons of green hydrogen per day. In addition, Nikola said it will work with E.ON to develop integrated mobility solutions, from the supply of green hydrogen and demand-based fueling station infrastructure to the provision of hydrogen-powered fuel cell trucks, with a focus on the city of Essen, Germany. 
The Port of Rotterdam is leading 18 companies in a study into the potential establishment of a large-scale ammonia cracker in the port area to convert imported ammonia back into 1 million tonnes of hydrogen per year targeting North-West Europe. The initiative includes Air Liquide, Aramco, bp, Essent/ E.ON, ExxonMobil, Gasunie, GES, HES international, Koole Terminals, Linde, OCI, RWE, Shell, Sasol, Uniper, Vopak, VTTI.
IHI Corp. has signed a memorandum of understanding with Gentari Hydrogen, a subsidiary of Petronas, to evaluate the feasibility of using the abundant solar resources of Malaysia to produce and sell green ammonia derived from renewables.

Engineers from the Electronics, Control, and Signal Processing Research Institute (LEICI) at the UNLP and environmental protection company Recyclamer Pampa Argentina have developed a solar-powered robot that collects waste from water bodies and surveys hydro-environmental variables.
“The robot has the capacity to clean waste on the surface and up to 40 cm deep, in bodies of water such as rivers, lagoons, and ports,” LEICI researcher Juan Luis Rosendo said. “Macro-plastics (bottles, bags), micro-plastics, and floating hydrocarbons, which are among the main pollutants in water courses, are usually found at this depth,” he explained.
The solar panels located on the deck of the device, which resembles a small catamaran without sails, can recharge its batteries while the robot operates.
Recyclamer Pampa Argentina contributed with its experience in waste treatment and cleaning of water bodies, while LEICI automated the system.
This automation “consisted of the design, sizing, and electronic integration of a modular hardware architecture on board (speed controllers, computer, sensors, antenna, etc.), and the development of the control logic to achieve robot autonomy,” Rosendo added.”
Recyclamer Pampa Argentina aims to commercialize the robot in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The solar PV plant is is reportedly the west African country’s first independent power project, and was developed by the Kenya-based company and built under a public-private partnership.
The 5 MW installation is the first phase of a 25 MW PV project in Yamandu, near Bo town in Sierra Leone. The project will reportedly add approximately 15% to Sierra Leone’s total electricity generation capacity.
Serengeti expects to start building the project’s second phase in 2023. The entire project will require an investment of $35 million. It will sell electricity to Sierra Leone’s national distributor Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA).
“I am delighted to announce that the 5 MW Baoma 1 solar PV plant in Sierra Leone has successfully reached commercial operations. This has been achieved through strong collaboration between EDSA and the entire Serengeti Energy team,” said Chris Bale, Serengeti Energy’s CEO. “The project will supply low-cost electricity to the local power grid for many years to come and will help to diversify the electricity mix in the country,” he added.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Sierra Leone had a cumulative solar capacity of 4 MW in 2021.

European Energy has acquired a majority stake in Australia-headquartered energy company Austrom Hydrogen with the intention of accelerating the formal development and grid connection processes for the proposed 3.6 GW Pacific Solar Hydrogen Project.
The Pacific Solar Hydrogen Project, planned for a 6,000-hectare site near the port of Gladstone, will comprise up to 3.6 GW of PV and battery energy storage. The integrated solar and storage facility will power a hydrogen electrolyzer capable of producing more than 100,000 tons of green hydrogen per annum.
“It is one of the biggest projects that we or anyone in the world for that matter have undertaken,” said Thorvald Spanggaard, European Energy Executive Vice President and Head of Project Development.
“We do believe that it is feasible and realistic to realise this project in 2026 not least because of the willingness of the local authorities in Australia to see the possibilities of moving ahead on the green transition and become a key exporter of the fuel of tomorrow.”
Austrom, which has secured the rights to four sites totalling 6,000 hectares in proximity to the Gladstone export hub, first unveiled its plans for the Pacific Solar Hydrogen Project in 2020, saying the ultimate goal is to generate green hydrogen for export through Gladstone Port.
Catriona Mcleod, the country manager for European Energy in Australia, said the project would also become a hub for renewable energy production, along with “green hydrogen and e-fuels.”
“The vast energy resources of Australia are not limited to fossil fuels,” she said. “Being a hub for renewable energy production, green hydrogen and e-fuels is the logical next step for our country.”
McLeod said European Energy will be doing the development work as well as managing the grid connection process for the Pacific Solar Hydrogen Project portfolio.
The project is part of a growing portfolio of renewable energy projects that European Energy is pursuing in Australia.
The Copenhagen-headquartered company, which established an office in Melbourne in 2022, said it is determined to acquire, develop, build, own, and operate, a portfolio of large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia.
“European Energy is now advancing wind and solar opportunities across the NEM (National Electricity Market), and as one of the frontrunners in e-fuels and green hydrogen I believe we are very well suited to accelerate the speed in which these projects can be realised,” McLeod said.
European Energy said it has a development pipeline of more than 20 GW of renewable energy projects across four continents and is currently constructing more than 1.2 GW of new energy capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/19/roadblocks-to-rooftop-solar-in-india/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 19, 2022",Roadblocks to rooftop solar in India,"From pv magazine India
pv magazine: Rooftop solar adoption is slower than the utility-scale segment. What are the challenges impeding the growth of rooftop solar?
To start with, there is still a lack of understanding about what all it takes to make a rooftop solar plant work. Then there are policy restrictions and regulations, especially regarding net metering (for the commercial and industrial sector), which are the most critical roadblocks affecting rooftop solar adoption. Apart from these, administrative delays in securing various approvals from different state entities and in the disbursement of subsidies make the entire process of rooftop solar very cumbersome.
pv magazine: Do you think the government has done enough to remove these roadblocks?
It’s not that the government has not done enough. There have been very well-intentioned initiatives, like the launch of the recent National Portal for Rooftop Solar aimed at simplifying procedures for rooftop solar applicants. While it is in its early days right now and there are still improvements being made like addressing the issue of state-wise multiple registrations on the portal, we hope that it will ease out quite a lot of things in the future.
pv magazine: To what extent has the basic customs duty (BCD) impacted the rooftop solar segment? How are developers addressing the price increase?
BCD has led to a sharp rise in solar tariffs, as modules contribute 50%-60% of the total project cost. This is in addition to the rise in module prices due to the hike in silicon prices, along with other raw materials and metals, globally.
Beyond BCD, there is also the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers or ALMM, which is challenging the basic requirement of high-quality and high-efficiency modules, a necessity as rooftop spaces are limited.
As developers, we cannot risk the long-term performance of solar plants by using modules that do not have a proven performance track record and we’ve been voicing our concerns accordingly.  
pv magazine: What are the emerging trends in the module, mounting, and inverter technologies for rooftop solar?
There are continuing upgrades in the module wattage. At present, mono PERC modules that the industry uses are in the range of 500-550 Wp. The upcoming range will be tending towards 650 Wp in the same category.
In inverters, the industry has transitioned more towards string inverters (from central inverters), ranging from 2-5 kW to 200 kW, with multi-MPPT technology providing better efficiency and lower generation losses.
pv magazine: Are Indian manufacturers in sync with these trends and capable of delivering these at attractive prices?
In India, domestic manufacturers are largely producing [multicrystalline] modules with 330 Wp primarily. Very few suppliers of high-efficiency mono PERC or bifacial modules are available at the moment. While some manufacturers are investing, it will take time before we have an adequate domestic supply of efficient modules.

The US-based Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) launched a project aimed at restoring prairie lands and pollinator habitat under solar arrays along a 20-acre plot of land in Sacramento County, California.
The team will create a pollinator habitat under a 160 MW utility-scale solar project and measure changes in energy, soil carbon, and management costs at the site. Expected outcomes include the establishment of native plant species promoting pollinator habitats and soil carbon monitoring. The project is set to run for four years in multiple phases.
The Rancho Seco energy project is located at the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant in central California and part of native tribes’ ancestral lands. It was installed in February 2021 and is operated by D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments, under a 30-year power purchase agreement with SMUD.
“Successful demonstration could provide the blueprint for future renewable energy projects throughout the country that are restorative not just in their kilowatts, but also for local people and biodiversity,” said Jessica Fox, senior technical executive and conservation biologist at EPRI.
“We’re trying to create a model that other solar developers can follow,” said Rebecca Hernandez, a UC Davis associate professor and director of the Wild Energy Center. “This is an opportunity to stack California prairie with solar energy and begin to restore the 98% of prairie habitat that’s been lost.”
UC Davis PhD student, Yudi Li, developed a list of species to plant at the facility, with the aim to balance the need for unimpeded sun with plants growing shorter than 3.5 feet (106cm) to protect the California tiger salamander, restore pollinator habitat, and provide ecosystem services. The list of plants also includes those commercially available so other solar developers can replicate the project.
Argonne National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory noted that approximately 1,350 square miles of farmland in the United States sits in close proximity to current or planned utility-scale solar projects that could benefit from pollinator habitat agrivoltaics programs.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has unanimously voted to approve Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM), slashing payments for excess solar production sent to the grid by 75%.
The CPUC voted to cut the average export rate in California from $0.30/kWh to $0.08/kWh, making the cuts effective from April 15, 2023. Customers who have new systems installed and approved for grid interconnection before the effective date in April will be grandfathered in to NEM 2.0 rates.
The commission said the balancing of costs and benefits continue to be “quite generous” under the decision. Currently, average net metering rates range from $0.23/kWh to $0.35/kWh, and the new proposed decision cuts those rates to an average of $0.05/kWh to $0.08/kWh. This is set to be the largest cut of export rates in US history, in a market that represents roughly 50% of the nation’s residential solar market.
Payments were cut as a result of a reported cost shift where non-solar owners cross-subsidize solar owners for maintaining the grid. The utility-backed concept suggests poorer Californians are paying higher utility rates to pay for lost profits that utilities endure in order to pay solar owner for delivering clean energy to the grid.
The current print edition of pv magazine visits Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and includes coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that for the vast majority of US states and utilities, the effects of distributed solar on retail electricity prices will likely remain negligible for the foreseeable future. The study showed that distributed solar “likely entails no more than a $0.03/kWh long-run increase in US average retail electricity prices, and far smaller than that for most utilities.”

The US heating tech manufacturer currently offers two residential heat pumps that meet the US Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pump specification – the York YZV and York HMH7. The cold climate heat pumps operate at temperatures up to -15 C and have a heating season performance factor (HSPF) of up to 10.5 and a coefficient of performance (COP) at -15 C above 2.
“In the coming years, we’ll have heat pumps that maintain full heating capacity at 5 F and efficiently heat spaces down into negative temperature territory,” Mark Lessans, senior director of sustainability and regulatory affairs, at Johnson Controls told pv magazine. “This level of performance will be critical to maintaining a clean, resilient grid during winter peak periods.”
Under the Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge, the company will develop and commercialize heat pumps for temperatures equal to or below -29 C. While the York YZV and York HMH7 use R-410A refrigerant, the next-generation heat pumps will use R-454B. Lessans claimed that this “will cut the global warming potential (GWP) of the refrigerant by nearly 80%.”
The company said it hopes the cold-climate heat pumps will be certified to AHRI Standard 1380. Lessans said that this “will enable utilities and aggregators to ask connected heat pumps to reduce power consumption to 70%, 40%, and shut-off, depending on the level of curtailment needed.” Heat pumps that successfully pass the challenge will have to provide such grid-interaction services.
US-based Carrier and Ireland-based Trane Technologies have also developed prototypes for the field-testing phase of the challenge. Lennox was the first manufacturer to successfully develop a prototype, winning the Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge in June 2022.

“It can work with any type of water pump, both on- and off-grid, and doesn’t require an additional inverter to drive the pump motor,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The three-phase Quad microinverter is compatible with up to four 550 W PV modules and has an operating voltage range between 315 V and 450 V. It measures 41 mm x 217 mm x 300 mm and weighs 4 kg. The inverter features a peak efficiency of 97.5% and a nominal MPPT efficiency of 99.8%.
The maximum continuous output power is 2 kW. The inverter also features cooling systems based on natural convection and comes with a 12-year warranty extendable to 25 years, said the manufacturer.
The Quad is currently undergoing regulatory certification and limited field trials in India.
“We have successfully completed product trials in several agriculture farms in India proving the ruggedness and key performance of the inverter,” said Sparq’s India manager, Salil Gupta.
Sparq said that multipurpose inverters can help farmers to run water pumps and irrigate their farms. They can also earn extra revenue by selling electricity to the grid when their pumps are not in use. The company expects to commercialize the inverters in the first quarter of 2023.

The country installed 194 MW of solar in the first three quarters of 2022, according to its distribution system operator, SODO. Almost all capacity was added in the residential sector.
The SPA estimates that the country will reach 724 MW of cumulative capacity by the end of this year. The analysts said they also expect demand from the residential sector to continue to grow in 2023.
“Slovenia has extended the period of the net-metering scheme system for the residential sector (for PV installations up to 11 kW) until the end of 2023 and that will result in high demand, especially with announced accompanying subsidies,” a SPA spokesperson told pv magazine. “The permits issued already support that estimation and the relevant institutions have taken steps to improve the response time in permitting which was an issue in the last period.”
The Slovenian government has prepared draft legislation to simplify the permitting process for renewables and ramp up deployment, particularly for large-scale PV. In June, it announced a plan to deploy 1 GW of solar by 2025. It has since identified go-to-areas for large-scale PV.
“They have prepared a map and an app [called SODOKart] of the electric grid with identified PV (and wind) connection points. Basically, they analyzed the state of the electric grid and the points where the installation of large PV would be appropriate (and not [require] significant investment in the grid),” said the SPA spokesperson. “The map is publicly available, [informative,] and does not affect the permitting procedures.”
The measures are expected to lead to the rapid development of the large-scale segment in Slovenia, where the largest PV plant is currently a 6 MW installation.
In addition, the government has announced subsidies for the residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) segments. While current subsidies focus on companies, the new ones will focus on energy communities and community solar, according to the SPA. Subsidies in the residential sector will shift from solar panels alone to solar plus storage, it said, without providing additional details.
Slovenia plans to start its first green hydrogen projects in 2023, under the European Union’s Just Transition Fund, according to the SPA. Its defense ministry is also leading a project to build hydrogen infrastructure that will be partly publicly owned.
