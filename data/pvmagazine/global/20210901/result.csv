With Covid disruption exacerbated by rising renewable energy equipment costs, the partners in the newly-convened Energy Access Relief Fund (EARF) want to mobilize the cash to be lent to “more than 90” suppliers of the likes of solar lanterns, clean cooking stoves, solar home systems, and mini-grids.
Quoted in a press release issued to publicize the initiative yesterday, Shell Foundation director Sam Parker said the hope was that similar investors would follow suit as “much more capital will be needed in the coming months to continue progress toward universal energy access.”
The short-term credit will be provided by a group convened by U.S.-based philanthropic investor Acumen and managed by New York City-based venture capital peer Social Investment Managers and Advisors.
The other members of the EARF grouping are U.S. government funded Power Africa, the United States Agency for International Development, and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation; U.K. government-financed UK Aid and CDC Group; Netherlands government-controlled development bank FMO; government-backed peers the Swedish International Development Co-operation Agency and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; multilateral public bodies the Green Climate Fund, which is part of the UN, and the World Bank and its International Finance Corp private sector arm; and private entities the Ikea Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and the Shell Foundation.

A press release issued on Friday to announce an opening ceremony attended by the president and the prime minister of Uzbekistan, stated the 100 MW solar farm will power 31,000 households in the Central Asian state.
The Navoi region is also due to have an energy sector training center next year.
Uzbek energy minister Alisher Sultanov, quoted in the press release, credited work by the International Finance Corporation private investment arm of the World Bank to help open up his country's power sector to private investment.
Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO of Emirati developer Masdar, described Uzbekistan as a “key strategic investment destination” for his company and the renewables business is also working on 440 MW of solar generation capacity at two sites in the Samarkand and Jizzakh regions, with Friday's release indicating they are expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2023.
Masdar is also developing a 457 MW solar project in the Sherabad district of Uzbekistan's Surkhandarya province.
The Uzbek government last month announced its intent to raise its 2030 solar capacity target from 5 GW to 7 GW as it aims to generate a quarter of its electricity from renewables this decade.

The storage project is being deployed at the Automobile Industrial Park of the Xiangyang high-tech development zone and is expected to come online by the end of next year.
The storage facility will be owned by Hubei Green-Move Zhongvan New Energy Co Ltd (Green Move ZF) which is, in turn, owned 70% by China's largest energy company, the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC); 20% by Hubei Pingfan Ruifeng New Energy Co Ltd; and 10% by Chinese real estate developer Wuhan Yuanxing Real Estate Development Co Ltd.
The project is linked to a 1 GW wind and solar project portfolio, 500 MW of solar distributed generation, and the construction of a gigafactory for vanadium redox flow batteries in China.
“VRB Energy has participated, since 2019, in the construction of the first phase of the 3 MW plus 3 MW/12 MWh vanadium redox flow battery energy storage phase of the 10 MW solar and storage project in Hubei Zaoyang, and the project is working well,” said VRB chief executive, Huang Mianyan. “The operation has fully confirmed the huge application value and market prospects of VRB Energy’s storage technology and will promote the grid connection and on-site consumption of renewable energy.”
In mid-July, China's National Photovoltaic and Energy Demonstration Experimental Center began testing VRB Energy's vanadium redox flow batteries at its Daqing facility in northeastern China. VRB Energy claims its vanadium redox flow storage systems rely on low-cost ion-exchange membrane and bipole material, and long-life electrolyte formulation. The standard battery power module is rated at 250 kW for megawatt-class systems.

The renewable energy auction held this week by the Chilean National Energy Commission (CNE) has not only seen the lowest bid ever recorded for a large scale PV project in Latin America – $0.01332/kWh – but has also delivered a bid of $0.03399/kWh for a concentrated solar power (CSP) project, which is the lowest offer ever reported for an energy auction at a global level to date.
The announcement was given by the Chilean association Asociación de Concentración Solar de Potencia (ACSP), which revealed that the bid relates to the 390 MW Likana Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) project, under development by EIG Global Energy Partners.
“This shows that CSP is a competitive technology that advances very quickly in reducing costs,” the trade body said, in a statement. “The solar thermal technology is the answer to advance in the decarbonization process in Chile. We reiterate the need for our authorities to deliver regulatory and economic signals that allow promoting investment in continuous renewable energies such as CSP, geothermal and pumped-storage, among others, since they represent the ideal replacement for coal.”
Chile is currently hosting a 110 MW CSP project built by Spanish renewable energy company Acciona – the Cerro Dominador plant. The project is located in the Atacama Desert, renowned as the region with the highest concentration of solar irradiation in the world. The CSP plant is owned by EIG Global Energy Partners, whereas the Spanish company has been contracted to act as EPC and to conduct operations and maintenance on the project.
The project, which also includes a 100 MW PV unit, obtained partial financing from a program run by the European Union and the German development bank, is being built at a cost of €1.41 billion ($1.7 billion).
*The article was amended on September 2 to reflect that the Likana project is owned by EIG Global Energy Partners, and not by SolarReserve, as we previously reported.

And the solar industry is rapidly evolving here. Testing standards are emerging to better simulate the effects of extreme weather, and assessments required by insurance providers and other project stakeholders are becoming more sophisticated. But there is still plenty that we don’t know about climate conditions and their potential effects on solar generation.
A research project led by the US Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories aims to fill this gap in knowledge by collecting and analyzing field data from operating PV plants, and referencing this with weather data to observe the impact of various weather events. Their latest paper, Evaluation of extreme weather impacts on utility-scale photovoltaic plant performance in the United States, has been published in Applied Energy.
The group analyzed data from more than 800 solar installations located in 24 U.S. states. They used various machine learning methods, details of which are publicly available for other research, to draw conclusions about the most damaging weather conditions.
Analysis of words used in maintenance found that ‘hurricane’ was the most frequently mentioned weather event, followed by snow, storm, lightning and wind. “Some hurricanes damage racking — the structure that holds up the panels — due to the high winds,” said Sandia researcher Nicole Jackson. “The other major issue we’ve seen from the maintenance records and talking with our industry partners is flooding blocking access to the site, which delays the process of turning the plant back on.”
Deeper analysis that also incorporated weather data from project sites found that snowstorms have the highest impact on PV production, a difference in output of 54.5% between ‘event’ and ‘non-event’ days. This also found that older solar projects are more vulnerable to extreme weather, potentially due to already being weakened by wear and tear.
While it offers valuable insight into PV in extreme weather, the group notes that events causing major damage – such as hailstorms – may not be listed in maintenance records, as they would go straight to an insurance claim to document the damage.
The group now plans to extend the scope of its study to include wildfires and prolonged extreme heat, and also to look at impacts on the entire electricity grid, rather than PV installations alone. “This analysis improves our understanding of compound, extreme weather event impacts on photovoltaic systems,” Jackson and co-author Thushara Gunda conclude. “These insights can inform planning activities, especially as renewable energy continues to expand into new geographic and climatic regions around the world.”

Goldi Solar, an Indian solar panel manufacturer and EPC service provider, has unveiled the HELOC̣ Pro series, featuring mono-facial and bifacial modules with M10 (182 mm x 182 mm) wafers. The new modules can be widely used in utility-scale, agricultural, industrial, and rooftop applications.
The GS10-B144-GF bifacial module features 144 half-cut monocrystalline silicon (PERC) cells and a multibusbar design. It offers power outputs ranging from 525 W to 560 W, with a power conversion efficiency of 20.3-21.7%. Rear-side can provide additional power gains of up to 30%.
“Higher module conversion efficiency and lower resistance are characteristic of half-cell structure. The new circuit design with multi-busbar technology prevents current losses. Advanced glass and cell surface textured design ensure excellent performance in the low light environment and reduced hot-spot losses,” said Goldi Solar.
The bifacial mono PERC module weighs 32 kg and measures 2,278 mm ×1,133 mm × 35 mm. It can withstand snow loads of up to 5,400 Pa and 2,400 Pa of wind load.
“The modules will be available by the end of (the third quarter of fiscal) 2022. Products will be available both in India and overseas markets,” said the manufacturer, adding the panels will carry a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty.
Goldi Solar also plans to facilitate backward integration by setting up a multi-gigawatt solar cell manufacturing line and supporting the ecosystem through the manufacturing of raw materials used in solar modules.

The executive summary of the latest publication compiled by the Norwegian business states: “It is sobering to reflect … that the pace of the energy transition has not accelerated beyond our first forecast.”
The bad news is stark, with the energy consultancy predicting that current policies have us on track for a global temperature rise of 2.3 degrees Celsius this century, with the world set to fall well short of halving CO2 emissions this decade and reaching net zero by mid century.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they are changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
The failure of policymakers to use Covid recovery packages to reset global industry – with the honorable exception of the EU – means the Covid-19 pandemic is now a “lost opportunity,” according to Oslo-based DNV, with the world on track for only 9% fewer energy-related emissions in 2030, and 45% fewer 20 years later.
That the global economy and energy industry will change beyond recognition by mid century is not disputed by DNV, which predicts the world will host 11.5 TW of solar generation capacity in 2050 – 7.6 TW of solar panels and 3.9 TW of solar-plus-storage, and including 800 GW of off-grid photovoltaics dedicated to hydrogen production and 130 GW of other off-grid arrays, alongside cheap battery systems, for energy access purposes.
The world will install 300-500 GW of panels annually after 2030, a quarter of it alongside energy storage facilities at that point, and rising to 50% by mid century. That rise in storage will reflect DNV's prediction the current prohibitive cost of adding batteries to solar farms – more than double the cost of just solar at present – will fall to less than 65% this decade. That price differential at the end of this decade, will be offset by the greater income from solar-plus-storage projects as PV continues to drive down the cost of grid electricity.
Solar's capacity factor – the amount of time in a given window during which any power plant generates at maximum capacity – will rise from its current 19%, to 26% by 2050, DNV predicted, at which point Greater China will have installed 35% of the global solar generation fleet, and the Indian subcontinent 20%.
Energy storage deployment will rise as a necessary concomitant of renewables roll-out, said the consultancy, with 240 TWh of vehicle-to-grid systems in 2040 – almost as much volume as two to four-hour lithium ion battery storage facilities. By 2050, there will be 20% more pumped hydro, and more-than-five-hour storage tech – such as vanadium redox flow batteries, zinc chemistries, and compressed air storage – will account for almost 1 TWh.
However, with DNV predicting gas will be the major source of energy in mid century, the need for hydrogen production and, even more critically carbon capture and storage tech, will be crucial. On our present path, the Norwegian organization said, only 3.6% of fossil fuel CO2 emissions will be abated in mid century.
As far as hydrogen is concerned, DNV predicted 16% of the energy storage medium produced by the world's 3 TW of electrolysis capacity will be fired by dedicated, off-grid solar capacity.
Digging down into the global regions studied by the consultant, cheap solar for hydrogen production will change the energy landscape of Latin America by 2050, DNV said, and photovoltaics – including extensive off-grid arrays – will supply almost 40% of African power by that point. China has already achieved peak coal, the report stated, but the EU will miss the mid century net zero aim of its ‘Fit for 55‘ program and northeast Eurasia – for which, read ‘Russia‘ – was dismissed as “a laggard on decarbonization.”

The €103.5 million project is expected to be built with 175,214 solar panels with a power output of 485 W each, and 424 string inverters with a capacity of 185 kVA. Construction should last around 24 months, the company said in a document filed with the county's environment agency.
The project will be adjacent to a coal power plant operated by Romanian energy company Complexul Energetic Oltenia (CE Oltenia), and another 4 MW solar park currently under development in the area. The plant will be connected to the local grid via a new 20/110 kV substation and is expected to generate 125,913 MWh/year.
OMV Petrom announced, in May 2020, a plan to install PV systems on the rooftops of 40 gas stations in Romania.
Currently, there are other large scale PV projects under development after the government introduced more favorable rules for power purchase agreements, in May 2020.

The research team developed a thermal energy storage technology called Economic Long-Duration Electricity Storage by Using Low-Cost Thermal Energy Storage and High-Efficiency Power Cycle (ENDURING), which it defines as a scalable solution that can be deployed almost anywhere.
The baseline system, which is designed for a storage capacity of up to 26,000 MWh, works by heating silica particles through an array of electric resistive heating elements at a temperature of around 1,200 degrees Celsius and depositing them on insulated concrete silos for thermal energy storage.

“When energy is needed, the hot particles are gravity-fed through a heat exchanger, heating and pressurizing a working gas inside to drive the turbomachinery, and spin generators that create electricity for the grid,” the NREL researchers explained. “Once discharged, the spent, cold particles are once again fed into insulated silos for storage until conditions (and economics) are appropriate again for charging.”
According to them, the proposed storage technology could be deployed at a cost of between $2 and $4 per kWh and it could also be hosted by existing infrastructure from retired coal and gas-fired power plants. Furthermore, it may provide a continuous source of heat for industrial and chemical processes.
“Sand and concrete silos with refractory insulation are very inexpensive materials that can lead to low-cost energy storage,” said NREL researcher Patrick Davenport. “Traditional four-hour storage technologies don't scale well to the grid or city scale. Now that we are in need of large scale energy storage, this technology makes a lot of sense.”
The prototype heaters and heat exchangers for the proposed system are currently being tested under high temperatures.

Haryana-based Pyramid Electronics has unveiled new three-phase, grid-tie string inverters for residential and commercial rooftop solar applications. The inverters are based on silicon carbide (SiC) technology to provide high power conversion efficiencies and greater power density. 
The inverters are available in power ratings ranging from 5 kW to 15 kW, with maximum input DC voltage of 1,000 V. The 10 kW, 12 kW, and 15 kW inverters have three maximum power point trackers – one for each of the three PV strings that can be connected to the inverter. The MPPT range is 80 V to 800 V DC.
With triple MPPT trackers, the paralleling of PV strings does not happen inside the inverter, resulting in better MPPT efficiency, according to the manufacturer.
The 15 kW inverter offers an efficiency of 98.2% to 98.4% and a European efficiency of 97.5%. It weighs 29 kg and measures 600 mm x 420 mm x 185 mm.
Three PV strings of 15 to 20 panels in series can be connected to the 15 kW inverter. With a maximum continuous input current of 17 A per PV string, the inverter is even compatible with high-power bifacial monocrystalline PV panels, with a maximum power point current up to 15 A.
With the maximum continuous grid current of 25 A (per phase), the inverter has overload capabilities and can feed up to 18 kW of power into the grid at a nominal grid voltage of 415 V.
For remote monitoring, Wi-Fi has been integrated into all of the inverters. End users will be able to remotely monitor their solar energy generation by using the company’s mobile application, Pyramid Solar, which is available for both Android and IOS.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/01/australia-could-install-another-8-9-gw-of-pv-by-2025/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2021",Australia could install another 8.9 GW of PV by 2025,"From pv magazine Australia
Solar could supply up to 77% of total electricity demand in Australia by 2026, the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) has revealed in its annual Electricity Statement of Opportunities report.
The report predicts that new renewable energy generation and energy storage projects will be able to supply the country as coal-fired plants retire, despite concerns around reliability and supply shortfalls.
“No reliability gaps are forecast for the next five years, primarily due to more than 4.4 GW of new generation and storage capacity, as well as transmission investment and reduced peak demand forecasts,” AEMO Chief Executive Daniel Westerman said.
AEMO said it is also confident about the following five years to 2031, so long as proposed renewable generation, storage and transmission investments are actually committed. In fact, it has pointed to coal plant failures, like the flooding at Victorian’s Yallourn plant in June, as the most pressing reliability threat.
AEMO has bumped up its solar forecasts from last year and now estimates that 8.9 GW of new distributed PV capacity will be installed by 2025. In addition to utility-scale solar plants, AEMO forecasts that 6.5 GW of that capacity will come from commercial and residential solar installed in the National Electricity Market (NEM), which includes every state and territory except Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
With solar booming, the focus has now shifted from fears of supply shortfalls to demand shortfalls, as more houses and businesses power themselves through their rooftop systems.
 
AEMO expects electricity demand in the main electricity market to drop to a record low of between 4 GW and 6 GW by 2025, down from 15 GW in 2019. This drop in minimum operational demand, which is happening even faster than last year’s predictions, has been flagged as a major threat to power system security, with AEMO noting the necessity for reforms, as well as government policy to accelerate electrification of homes and transport, which would at least partially reverse the downward demand trend.
“Without additional operational tools, we may no longer be able to operate the mainland NEM securely in all periods from 2025 due to a lack of security services when demand from the grid is so low,” Westerman said. “These conditions may occur earlier than 2025 under abnormal network conditions, such as network and generation unit outages, possibly associated with bushfires or storms.”
Westerman pointed to the Energy Security Board’s recent reform recommendations as addressing some of these issues. Despite delivering a suite of reforms around the integration of distributed energy resources like solar and batteries, headlines have been dominated by the proposal of a capacity market, which many fear the government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison will shape into a “coal-keeper” scheme.
Given the capacity market proposal seeks to solve the issue of reliability, Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton said that the mechanism seems “unjustified in light of the current reliability outlook.”
Coal out
Since AEMO’s report last year, a number of planned thermal generator retirements have been brought forward, including the Yallourn Power Station (now scheduled to close in 2028), one unit of Eraring Power Station (2030), as well as the mothballing of one unit of Torrens Island B Power Station, expected in October.
If no additional dispatchable energy or transmission projects come into the market, these early closures could cause reliability gaps in Victoria and New South Wales from 2026 to 2031, AEMO said. And while early closures have the potential to be disruptive, AEMO noted that the coal plants themselves are a also threat to reliability.
“Coal-fired generation reliability remained at historically poor levels last year,” the report said. “While some plant improvements are expected in the near term, most generators are anticipating a trend of decreasing reliability in the longer term, increasing supply scarcity risk. The accelerated exit of coal and growing risk of plant failures is increasing the need for dispatchable projects.”
This shift away from thermal generation toward clean energy will require a range of new services, AEMO said. It is looking for the market to provide solutions like frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), fast frequency response (FFR) and recovery services, load shifting, and active management of distributed energy resources. Such services are increasingly being provided by big batteries, as well as new inverter technologies, with rules currently being introduced to accelerate this.
Storage like batteries and pumped hydro are also increasingly important as solar shifting devices, “soaking” excess solar generation by storing it or having demand flexibility. The aim, AEMO said, is to restrict the curtailment of large and small scale solar systems to be a last resort.
Australia has seen a massive spike in storage projects, with investors backing 650 MW of large-scale batteries this year alone, amounting to an annual increase of more than 400%. In fact, the pipeline of publicly announced storage projects, beyond those already operating and committed for operation, includes 21 GW of battery storage and 6.3 GW of medium to long-term duration storage.
Demand flexibility solutions could also be provided through new uses for electricity, AEMO said, including hydrogen production and electrification of industrial processes and transport.
Hydrogen in
For the first time, AEMO has this year included green hydrogen as a scenario in its modeling. Named the “hydrogen superpower” scenario, it is the next progression from the ‘Step Change’ trajectory Australia is currently following.
 
“Momentum is building in the industry as the development of a hydrogen economy may simultaneously enable a significant new export opportunity and provide a means to achieve carbon emission reduction objectives,” AEMO said. “There are now more than 10 projects at the 100 MW+ scale being actively developed across Australia, and many more at a smaller scale.”
AEMO has also considered a path called “strong electrification sensitivity,” in which hydrogen uptake is limited and energy efficiency is also muted, leaving most emissions reductions to be achieved through electrification.
If there are strong incentives for the electrification of the transport, residential and industrial sectors, including heating, Australia could add almost 81 TWh of additional consumption by 2031. This is equivalent to 46% of total current operational consumption in the NEM.
 
“Beyond the next decade, the potential growth due to electrification, hydrogen production and associated zero-emissions industry is forecast to be even more significant, with NEM consumption potentially doubling by 2050,” the report said.
AEMO predicts if the current rate of large-scale wind and solar development continues, there could be sufficient renewable resources available in 2025 to meet 100% of underlying consumer demand in certain periods.
In July, Westerman said that AEMO was readying Australia’s grid for such instances, as it is eager to end the curtailment of clean energy assets, which have plagued Australia’s landscape. This is a decisive shift away from the traditionally favoured thermal generators, which are difficult and slow to ramp up and down, toward what Westerman calls “zero-cost renewables.”

Silfab said that cell sorting, glass washing, soldering, and cell alignment are all automated processes – something that the company said leads to its products having low defect rates.
The company is primarily known for its back-contact and mono PERC PV modules for the North American residential and commercial markets. 
The new Prime STC series panel is rated at 20.2% efficiency, 370 W power rating, and a maximum DC voltage of 1,000. It operates at temperatures between -45 C and 85 C.
The 44-pound module contains 120 Si mono PERC half cells, with nine busbars, and is packaged in a black anodized aluminum frame.  Module product workmanship warranty on the panel lasts 12 years, with an option to expand to 25. The company said the linear power performance is good for 30 years.
