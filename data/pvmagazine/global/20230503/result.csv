Kaneka said the cells will be utilized, in particular, in the roof glass of Toyota's Prius PHEV car. “Our solar cells were selected by Toyota for use in an automobile following their use on Toyota bZ4X due to recognition of its curved surface design enabling itself to be mounted on a car body in addition to the high conversion efficiency and excellent exterior design of our proprietary technology,” Kaneka said in a statement, noting that the back-contact design with no wiring on the surface has an appearance similar to vehicle roof glass.
Kaneka's solar cell has been for years recognized as the most efficient crystalline silicon PV device developed at both the industry and research levels. In November, however, Chinese manufacturer Longi announced it crossed this threshold by achieving a power conversion efficiency of 26.81% for an unspecified heterojunction (HJT) solar cell, based on a full-size silicon wafer, in mass production.
The Japanese manufacturer started supplying bifacial heterojunction solar modules based on its cell technology in 2019.
In its latest financial report published in February, the company said it was ready to start the operation of an additional production line for heterojunction PV panels during this fiscal year to respond to the strong demand. “We plan to begin full–scale delivery of in–vehicle PV this spring,” it also stated.

India's Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has said solar or wind-solar hybrid projects for which bids were finalized before the announcement of the basic customs duty (BCD) on modules on March 9, 2021, would be granted commissioning extensions only on a case-by-case basis. 
The renewable energy implementing agencies, including Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), NTPC and NHPC would examine developers’ requests for an extension on a case-by-case basis and grant extensions only if the developer has taken all possible measures to implement the project, such as land acquisition and orders for modules and balance-of-system supply, but couldn’t complete it for reasons beyond his control.
If the developer is yet to take steps to implement the project and is merely sitting on the award, such projects will not be granted an extension and will face cancellation.
Earlier, the MNRE had announced that solar and solar-wind hybrid projects for which bids were finalized before March 9, 2021, may be given time for completion up to March 31, 2024.
In its latest order, the MNRE has clarified that the completion extension for these projects is “not a general blanket extension”.

Swedish furniture provider Ikea announced it will rely on Meyer Burger‘s heterojunction solar modules for its own panel offer in the future.
The group's investment arm, Ingka Investments, concluded a four-year supply agreement with the Swiss photovoltaic manufacturer for solar modules manufactured at Meyer Burger's US plant in Goodyear, Arizona, to be shipped between 2025 and 2029.
The agreement is one of two contracts that prompted Meyer Burger to increase annual production capacity at the US plant from 1.6 GW to 2 GW. Ingka Investments will ensure a substantial annual advance payment to enable Meyer Burger to procure and finance machinery as well as raw materials for solar module production.
The two companies did not disclose the financial and quantitative terms of the deal. “We are very pleased to be working with Ingka Investments, who will support us with the rapid ramp-up of our production in the USA through this off-take agreement,” said Daniel Menzel, COO of Meyer Burger.
Ikea parent company Ingka Holding unveiled in March a plan to invest €340 million ($375.1 million) to acquire seven solar parks under development by Enerparc in Germany and Spain. At the time, the furniture giant also said it wanted to refresh the Solstrale offer for residential PV applications, which was launched in 2019.
Ikea is currently active in the PV sector in Sweden, France, Australia, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Poland and the United Kingdom.
Ikea is also trying to cover its own electricity needs with renewable energy. Its goal is to become climate-neutral throughout the world by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/03/indian-pv-market-must-invest-in-quality-infrastructure/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"MAY 3, 2023",Indian PV market must invest in quality infrastructure,"While India’s solar PV ambitions are high, more efforts are needed in the implementation of and adherence to the International and National Quality Infrastructure (QI) is a challenge. India has set a target of 300 GW solar PV by 2030, with a cumulative capacity of 63.8 GW of solar PV projects currently in the pipeline. But in India, solar PV quality focuses more on component certification and less on the design and engineering of the solar energy plants, as highlighted by multiple experts from the sector in a workshop on QI this spring. The degradation rate of modules in India is 1.2% per year, while the global average is much lower at 0.4-0.5%. If India wants to change this trend, it needs to focus on quality infrastructure in the overall value chain to ensure a sustainable operation and long-term growth.
Global trends for solar PV are bright, and India can be at the forefront of installing additional capacities: During the 2010-2021 period, IRENA data shows that the global Capital Expenses costs (or CAPEX) for solar PV projects declined by 80%, capacity factors increased to 17.2%, and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) decreased by 88%. On the latter point, since 2010, LCOE costs for solar PV in India have declined by 90%. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the global cumulative capacity of solar PV in 2021 was 843 GW. To meet the net zero scenario, however, this capacity needs to increase to 5,221 GW and 14,036 GW by 2030 and 2050 respectively – QI will play a key role in meeting this goal.
The International Forum on Quality in the Indian PV Sector in Delhi raised many of these issues. IRENA, together with the co-organizers of the meeting, the German Metrology Institute, India’s National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE), and India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, discussed with Indian private sector representatives and authorities how investing in enhancing the quality infrastructure can help unlock the vast potential of the PV industry in the country.
Looking first at the risk that too few investments in QI hinder capacity, the meeting concluded that hot spots due to poor module design, microcracks due to transportation protocols not being adhered to, corrosion due to low moisture resistance of modules, broken solder joints due to poor wiring techniques, and broken cells because of people stomping on cells without awareness/training on correct installation practices all play a role in lowering quality. India’s quality gaps are usually the result of aggressive climate conditions and strong price pressure in the marketplace. These challenges are typical, but not limited to India. Recommendations are therefore relevant beyond the Indian situation.
How can India’s PV sector overcome these challenges by investing in QI? QI is an interdependent ecosystem of the different elements (accreditation, certification, standards, testing, metrology, inspection and monitoring) working together in harmony, and all associated services should be developed in unity and not in a piecemeal fashion. Improvements all along the QI system are necessary and interconnected; the workshop participants identified the following recommendations as the most pressing:
As these recommendations clearly show, while India has done tremendous progress and is pose to become a global leader in solar PV technology, there is still further work concerning QI improvements in the country, as for example the degradation rate of solar panels signals that the industry must take this path. By doing so, the entire industry and its consumers are the beneficiaries. After all, QI services outweigh their costs. On average, QI accounts for only 5% of total project costs. That is a win for everyone.

A mapping conducted by H2 Brazil, a project resulting from a partnership between the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy, has identified at least 42 green hydrogen production projects in the country of different sizes and stages of development.
H2 Brazil, which started in 2021 and will run until the end of 2023, mapped more than 800 companies and institutions in 12 sectors of the green hydrogen value chain in five Brazilian regions.
According to H2 Brazil coordinator José Zloccowick, an interactive tool will be made available for a detailed consultation of the projects and players in each state. The results of the mapping were presented at the Intersolar Summit Nordeste last week, where green hydrogen was one of the main topics.
The study identified green hydrogen hubs in port regions as one of the main business models for developing green hydrogen in Brazil. These hubs concentrate all the demand from the port industrial complexes in one place and can also meet the export demand. For transportation, the production of green ammonia is one of the main options.
Most green hydrogen hubs are located in ports in the northeast of the country, where most of the country’s solar capacity is also installed.
The production of green hydrogen is seen as a way to tap Brazil's enormous potential for renewable generation. Just from projects under development, there are 99 GW of solar energy and 25 GW of wind energy capacity. Electricity corresponds to 73% of the production cost of green hydrogen.
In the last federal government auction in which the sources were contracted, held in October 2022, with supply starting in 2027, wind and solar were negotiated for BRL 175 ($34.72)/MWh and BRL 171/MWh, respectively. In the wholesale market, which serves PPAs and self-production for large consumers, the incentivized energy (which also includes small hydroelectric plants) is being negotiated at BRL 113/MWh for contracts with supply starting in 2024.
For the green hydrogen produced in Brazil to become competitive, the price level for renewable energy in the country should decrease to between $10/MWh and $30/MWh (BRL 149/MWh), according to estimates presented at the Intersolar Summit Nordeste.
Although the level of competitiveness is still far from the auction prices — and even more so from the price considered adequate to remunerate the investment of solar energy generators — the cost of transportation and storage will also be a differential for the production and commercialization of green hydrogen.
Moreover, the geographical location of the ports in the northeast of the country and the presence of industrial consumers, which could make joint investments in infrastructure, can be important in giving Brazil the edge in the global green hydrogen race.

In the paper “A review of solar hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors and systems,” published in Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, the scientists explained that PVT technologies may show strong potential in urban environments, which traditionally have both thermal and electrical energy demands while offering limited space for deployment.
Crucial for PVT system development will be trade-offs between heat and electricity generation, depending on different applications and environmental conditions. “This introduces challenges for the design and operation of PV-T collectors, and solutions to overcome this conflict have been proposed, for example, through spectral splitting, amongst others,” the researchers specified.
In their work, they covered previous experimental and computational studies, identified performance enhancement opportunities, and analyzed the implications of widespread deployment at the solar-generation system level.
“Specifically, we first proceed to classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air-water, heat-pipe, building-integrated and CPV-T collectors,” they said. “This is followed by a presentation of techno-economic performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids.”
Their review includes conventional PV-T collectors, air-based systems, liquid-based installations, water-based collectors, refrigerant-based systems, heat-pipe-based technologies, dual air-water systems, building-integrated PVT arrays, and concentrated PVT collectors.
Their analysis also includes possible collector modification designs, PVT configurations for glazing, novel thermal absorber technologies, and the use of phase-change materials (PCMs) and aerogels. Furthermore, it explains how new technologies such as tandem solar cells, selective coatings, spectral splitting, dichroic mirrors/filters, holographics, luminescent splitters/concentrators, nanofluids, or heat transfer and optical absorption techs may be integrated into PVT systems.
The study also provides a final overview of all conclusions drawn by the group and a series of recommendations for future further adoption of PVT technologies. Looking forward, they said more studies on the long-term operation of PV-T systems to assess the long-term reliability of PV-T collectors are strongly needed, as well as system cost assessments and certification rules for PV-T collectors.
The research group included scientists from the Imperial College London and the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, the Zhejiang University in China, Boise State University in the United States, the Cyprus University of Technology, and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia.

The move comes after the Dutch government announced in May 2022 that hybrid heat pumps were to become the country’s new heating standard from Jan. 1, 2026. The measure originally encompassed apartments and listed buildings, but the government has now backtracked on those plans.
The heat pump mandate will apply to buildings where the return on investment for the heat pump is no more than seven years after the government has covered up to 30% of the cost with a grant. Jonge said that multi-story buildings often fail to meet this requirement.
“The study by W/E consultants shows that housing in stacked construction generally has a long payback period and that there are bottlenecks with regard to noise and available space,” he wrote in a letter to Parliament.
The minister justified the exemption for listed buildings with the fact that these require a permit to undergo modifications, a process that is too lengthy for a swift exchange of a gas boiler for a heat pump.
In general, “there will be an exception for situations in which the standard cannot be properly applied, for example when due to noise requirements or necessary modifications to the home, the more efficient installations lead to disproportionally high costs,” said Jonge.
Houses already heated by district heating will also be exempt, and so will neighborhoods that can switch to district heating within 10 years.
Non-residential buildings with a yearly electricity usage of less than 50,000 kWh or 25,000 cubic meters of natural gas will also be required to install a heat pump.
The mandate sets hybrid heat pumps as a “minimum standard” but highlights that fully electric heat pumps and district heating are also feasible solutions. Homeowners, institutions, and small companies will be able to apply for a grant to cover 30% of the average cost of installing the heat pumps. Households with a yearly income of up to €60,000 ($66,261) will be able to borrow additional funds via an interest-free loan system.

“These dopants have been reported to impair device stability because of the hygroscopic nature and dopant-induced ion migration, which promotes perovskites degradation,” the scientists said.
They fabricated the HTL with the polymer Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and Spiro-OMeTAD in a mixed binary configuration, which they claim offers better protection to the perovskite absorber used in the cell thanks to the hydrophobicity of P3HT. “P3HT not only exhibits a higher degree of molecular order but also shows a preferential ‘face-on' orientation, i.e., the P3HT molecules are parallel to the substrate, which have significant positive effects on the opto-electronic properties and charge carrier mobility,” they explained.
The Chinese team built the solar cell with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL), a perovskite layer, the proposed HTL, molybdenum oxide (MoOx) buffer layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The academics tested the performance of several solar cells developed with this design and with an active area of 0.08 cm2 through a solar simulator equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp and a Keithley 2400 source meter under standard illumination conditions.
The champion device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.30% and a certified efficiency of 24.22%. It also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V, a short-circuit current density of 24.94 mA cm-2, and a fill factor of 82.51%. The cell was also able to retain 90% of its initial efficiency after 1,200 hours of storage in dark ambient environment.
“A successful modification of the conventional Spiro-OMeTAD HTL has been demonstrated by incorporating hydrophobic polymeric P3HT into Spiro-OMeTAD film to improve the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells,” the group concluded. “We believe that this strategy will pave the way on the development of low-cost, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.”
The scientists presented their findings in the study “Binary Hole Transport Layer Enables Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with PCE Exceeding 24%,” which was recently published in DeCarbon.

The company said the manufacturing facility is the world’s first-ever TES gigafactory and that it will reach a full annual capacity of 4 GWh by the end of this year. “We’re Israeli — we’re building technologies that can reach up to 1,400 F in the middle of the desert — we know a thing or two about harnessing heat, and we’re ready to share that knowledge with the world,” said its CEO, Avi Brenmiller.
Brenmiller secured a €7.5 million ($8.2 million) credit facility from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to build the factory.
“Brenmiller’s bGen TES system is an intelligent, scalable, and cost-effective solution that enables industrial- and utility-scale decarbonization by turning renewable electricity into clean steam, hot water, or hot air,” the company said in a statement. “This provides industrial factories and power plants critical reliability, protection from renewable intermittency and fluctuations in energy market prices, in addition to 24/7 access to electric heat.”
Brenmiller recently tested a 24 MWh TES system in Italy both as power-to-heat equipment and a thermal storage, in partnership with Enel.
“Our levelized cost of heat (LCOH) depends on what is charging the system. Typically, this is cheap renewable energy, so our LCOH stands between 30-50 $/MWh, which makes it cheaper than gas today in most places in Europe,” the company said at the time.
Brenmiller’s bGen system heat crushes rocks and then stores that thermal energy for minutes, hours, or days. The stored heat energy can be used to produce energy in the form of steam for electricity, water, or hot air for industrial applications. The bGen system is said to be low maintenance, with a lifespan of more than 30 years.

Each year, Fremont, California’s Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) releases its PV Module Index, tracking the latest trends in solar module quality, performance, reliability, and emergent technologies.
The latest annual report, PV Module Index 2022 opens with remarks about the rise of TOPCon solar modules, a technology increasingly being adopted by major panel suppliers.
TOPCon was first demonstrated at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in 2013 and is now gaining market traction and acceptance.
The technology is comprised of n-type PV cells with passivating contacts. The modules have strong surface passivation and effective carrier transport, both of which contribute to a strong open-circuit voltage and high efficiency. The shift to TOPCon comes as p-type passivated emitter and rear-contact cell (PERC) modules begin to reach their theoretical efficiency limits.
RETC said this boost in efficiency has made TOPCon “the buzziest word in solar.”
The report noted that while Longi is “betting big” on p-type TOPCon, many other leading module companies, like JinkoSolar, Jollywood, JA Solar and Trina Solar are making significant investments in modules with n-type TOPCon cell designs. 
“Via higher open-circuit voltage values, you can achieve higher efficiencies and power ratings. In and of itself, that is likely going to move manufacturers to n-type TOPCon cell designs, as soon as they can get there,” said Kenneth Sauer, principal engineer, VDE Americas.
RETC said due to manufacturing complexities, high-efficiency n-type cells using heterojunction technology (HJT) and interdigitated back contact (IBC) cells are relatively expensive to produce and remain a niche part of the market. By comparison, n-type TOPCon cell production is very similar to the PERC manufacturing process, making for an easier transition from existing manufacturing lines.
“Though today’s n-type TOPCon modules cost slightly more to produce on a per-watt basis than p-type mono PERC modules, the efficiency gains result in a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in large-scale field deployments. Best of all, leading experts expect n-type TOPCon to benefit from an accelerated learning curve,” said the report.
However, as with any emergent technology, the report notes that moving towards TOPCon may carry some risk. While n-type TOPCon PV cells have proven resilient to light-induced degradation and light and elevated temperature-induced degradation, some evidence exists of susceptibility to ultraviolet-induced degradation (UVID), which could chip away at module longevity.
Researchers at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have documented front- and back-side power loss from these technologies. The data does not point to a single degradation mechanism but suggest that different cell designs degrade via different pathways, said the report.
“We’re not trying to sound an alarm for no reason,” said Cherif Kedir, chief executive officer at RETC. “We just want to test the potential for UV degradation to educate ourselves and the industry. If there’s no problem, we can all move forward with our lives.”
Kedir recommends module makers conduct accelerated UVID testing as part of a technical due diligence survey. If cell passivation layers are improperly tuned, they can break down under this exposure. He recommends evaluating each new cell design on a case-by-case basis.
“If there is a problem, we will publish a report so that the industry can get out in front of the issue,” he said.
