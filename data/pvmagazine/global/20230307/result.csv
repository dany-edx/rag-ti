Systovi has inaugurated a new assembly line in Carquefou, near Nantes, France. It invested €1.5 million ($1.59 million) to double its production capacity from 40 MW to 80 MW.
“In addition to this increase in capacity, our objective is to produce panels with higher output,” Systovi Managing Director Paul Toulouse told pv magazine France.
The new line will make it possible to manufacture the latest Optymo series of Systovi panels, which are based on M10 cells, with outputs of up to 400 W. The new modules, which are mainly intended for the rooftop market, measure 114 mm x 176 mm and weigh 22 kg.
“Contrary to the market trend, which is moving towards thinner and thinner aluminum frames, especially for transport cost reasons, we have chosen to maintain an aluminum frame of 4 cm thickness,” said Toulouse. “This gives the panel better resistance to handling and better resistance over time.”
The company has further automated its production processes, particularly in the soldering stage. “We have also strengthened quality control because the electroluminescence inspection now takes place before lamination, which makes it possible to identify any welding inaccuracies and micro-cracks in the cells upstream,” said Toulouse.
Thanks to the continuous improvement in the sourcing of its suppliers, Systovi claims its new module has an estimated carbon footprint of approximately 23.8 CO2 eq/kWh.
“This balance sheet should drop slightly again next summer because we will be welcoming a new laminator to our site,” he added. This oven, which melts the different layers at 154 C to obtain a laminate, will have improved energy efficiency.
The company hopes, through these investments, to participate in efforts to shift the PV supply chain to France.
“However, today we are faced with multiple competition,” said Toulouse. “Chinese manufacturers are heavily subsidized and sell at low prices that are totally disconnected from their production costs. By contrast, the United States has announced significant financial support for local production with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Finally, India has launched a production incentive program (PLI) to encourage the domestic manufacture of solar panels, up to 100 GW/year.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/07/heat-pumps-vs-renewables-a-dilemma-for-germanys-way-out-of-gas/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MARCH 7, 2023",Heat pumps vs. renewables – a dilemma for Germany’s way out of gas,"An international group of scientists have hypothesized that renewables-powered heat pumps could potentially be one of the fastest ways to reduce Germany’s imports of Russian gas. To test the hypothesis, they investigated whether more gas can be substituted by replacing gas boilers with renewables-powered heat pumps. They also considered the use of renewable electricity to reduce the load hours of existing gas-fired power plants.
The investigation rests on a comparison of the coefficient of performance (COP) for heat pumps with the efficiency of gas-fired power stations. The COP is defined as the amount of heat moved by the heat pump, divided by the electric power required to operate it. The scientists used the efficiency of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) as a reference, as they provide the bulk of gas-based electricity in Germany.
“Their average annual efficiency in 2020 is the ratio between their electricity generation, which was 95.0 TWh, and the gas consumed, which was 171.4 TWh, yielding 55%,” they said. “To account for grid losses, we lower this value to 50%.”
They assumed a COP of 2 for industrial heat pumps used in the chemical, paper, and processing industries. For residential space heating, they took the COP for a “commonly sold” air-to-water heat pump: the GMLW 14 PLUS from German heating equipment manufacturer Ochsner. Its COP varies between 3.4 and 5.3 to heat water to 35 C. To heat water to 50 C and 60 C, the COP is 3.1 and 2.8, respectively, according to the product’s datasheet. The academics assumed an average COP of 2.5 for warm water.
They modeled the German electricity system using hourly generation data of all contributing power plants, wind farms, decentralized PV, and storage capacities in 2020 – the reference year. To model near-future power generation, they included additions to PV and onshore and offshore wind, according to the plants of the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection. They assumed that Germany would undertake sufficient grid expansion to manage these capacity additions.
The model features four scenarios: a “business-as-usual installer’s roadmap” scenario, an “accelerated” scenario, and “fast” and “very fast” scenarios. The results show that between 2022 and 2024, new solar and wind capacity mostly reduces the load hours of gas-fired power plants.
“Our hourly resolved modeling shows that this is because in these first years, there are many hours when the sun is shining and/or the wind is blowing, but not enough wind farms and PV capacities are installed to cover grid demand entirely,” said the researchers.
However, in the “fast” and “very fast” scenarios, heat pumps draw most of the newly added renewable power from 2024 to 2030. They represent the fastest way to reduce gas imports in Germany, according to the scientists.
The “very fast” scenario shows gas savings of about 30% by 2025. That is the equivalent of 290 TWh or 28 billion cubic meters, given that Germany imported 971 TWh of gas in 2020.
“Considering that in 2020, about 50% of the gas was imported from the Russian Federation, the very fast scenario can save about 60% of this gas by 2025,” they argued.
The “fast,” “accelerated,” and “installers’ roadmap” scenarios achieve total gas savings of about 22%, 18%, and 15% by 2025, respectively.
“The scenarios, developed here for Germany, must accordingly be adjusted to specifics in other countries, but offer clear, tangible, pathways to reduce the price volatility and supply risks of fossil gas,” the scientists concluded.
They shared their findings in “Replacing gas boilers with heat pumps is the fastest way to cut German gas consumption,” recently published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/07/north-americas-bid-to-onshore-rare-earth-supply/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,GEOPOLITICS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 7, 2023",North America’s bid to onshore rare earth supply,"With the electric vehicle market expected to drive demand for 200,000 tons of rare earth elements in North America through 2030, work is being put in by industry and policy makers to restore the region's rare earth element supply chain.
Efforts are being made in Canada and the US to shift dependency away from Chinese rare earth element reserves. There are many reasons why North America is looking to onshore its processes, one of the biggest being concern around potential supply chain choke points in the event China decides to cut off rare earth element supply due to geopolitical wrangles.
Demand for the material is expected to skyrocket, with an estimated 315,000 tons of rare earth elements needed by 2030, most of them for EVs.
What is being done by North American mines to ensure they can keep up with demand without needing to rely on Chinese rare earth element supply and Far Eastern separation facilities? What type of government policy needs to be implemented to help speed the onshoring process along?
Las Vegas-based MP Materials owns the only operating rare earth mine and processing facility in the US. The Mountain Pass Mine, in California, is an open pit site that supplied 15.8% of the world’s rare earth production in 2020. In late April, MP Materials began construction at its first rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet manufacturing facility with the intention of fully restoring the US' rare earth magnetics supply chain. The plans include establishing hydrometallurgy and separation facilities, along with the manufacturing fab, at a site expected to be completed in 2025. Becoming a closed-loop operation that can convert refined materials into metals and alloys would mean the company would no longer have to export its mineral concentrate material to China for processing, thereby onshoring the process and decoupling the current supply chain.
MP Materials' substantial, $700 million investment is the first of its kind in the US and would be able to produce approximately 1,000 tons per year of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, thereby supporting the production of approximately 500,000 EV motors, with room to scale. In addition to electric vehicles, NdFeB magnets are used in robots, drones, defense systems, wind turbines, and many other high-growth technologies.
Just before construction began at the mine, MP Materials was awarded $35 million by the US government's Department of Defense to refine and separate heavy rare earth elements to further support onshoring of both the mining and processing procedures. At around the same time, MP Materials and General Motors (GM) announced a definitive supply agreement for Mountain Pass to produce alloys and magnets for GM's electric vehicle programs. Under the long-term contract, MP Materials will supply US-sourced and manufactured rare earth materials, alloy, and finished magnets for the electric motors for more than a dozen GM models, with a gradual production ramp expected to begin late this year, starting with alloy supply.
This means that not only will Mountain Pass be expected to produce enough rare earth elements to fulfill the Pentagon’s Department of Defense requirements, it must also meet the alloy requirements needed to make electric motors for GM. How is this all possible without significant government support?
Although tremendous efforts have been made to begin decoupling supply chains from China, to shift processing to onshore facilities, there is still a significant gap between domestic supply and demand. One solution to this which US president Joe Biden and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau should consider is the creation of upstream investment incentives for suppliers of these critical minerals – particularly the metals needed for EV motors.
In late December, the Canadian government published a strategy to increase the responsibly-sourced supply of 31 critical minerals. It was backed by $3.8 billion in the 2022 budget, including $40 million to support northern regulatory processes and a 30% exploration tax credit for targeted minerals.
The issue is that these budget promises are currently no more than smoke and mirrors. Brandon Macdonald, CEO and director of Canadian miner Fireweed Metals, says he would like Ottawa to extend flow-through tax credits as there is capital scarcity during the lengthy permitting process for mining.
Flow-through shares are stock issued by mining companies at a higher price than common shares. The issuer agrees to forego, on flow-through shares, the tax deductible benefit due under Canadian law that is associated with mining exploration and development. Instead, investors buying flow-through shares can themselves claim those tax deductions, with such stock helping miners raise finance during capital-intensive exploration efforts.
Macdonald is also calling on the Canadian government to invest in infrastructure including roads, power grids, smelters, and refineries. Although Ottawa’s strategy is meant to accelerate strategic projects, build sustainable infrastructure, and make assessments more efficient, if the right companies – the ones uniquely positioned to begin fulfilling national demand within a couple of years – are not supported financially, the nation could be no closer to decoupling supply chains in 2025 than it is today.
Much work remains to be done to onshore North America's rare earth element supply chain.
If the US and Canadian governments explore different incentives for junior mining companies, the sector could see expedited infrastructure and supply chains decoupled from China becoming a reality much, much more quickly. The time to act is now, given rare earth element demand is expected to soar as North America looks to reduce its carbon footprint by rolling out EVs at mass scale.
Ultimately, the grip China has over North American supply is expected to loosen over time, particularly as new mines such as Mountain Pass come into full operation, but onshore rare earth processing could be further accelerated with the help of proper government funding and support from policy makers.
The world outside China needs more rare earth element mines and processing and separation facilities in order to reduce its dependence on the Far East for critical minerals.

“Our work provides a comprehensive approach for calculating the energy rating of bifacial modules and shows that, in order to make it consistent with the existing standard, the Climate Specific Energy Rating (CSER) should be normalized with the front side irradiation,” researcher Malte Vogt told pv magazine.
Vogt noted that the IEC 61853 is currently applicable exclusively to monofacial panels. “Our paper is a step toward updating the standard to also cover bifacial modules, which are increasing in market share rapidly,” said Vogt.
In particular, the scientists suggest changes for the third part of the IEC 61853 standard, which combines module measurements and climate data in an energy yield and rating calculation algorithm. They also recommend changes for the fourth part, which defines the reference climates with hourly irradiation, temperature, wind speed, and angle of incidence data.
The Dutch group said the climate data from the fourth part could be expanded to take in all of the irradiance values for bifacial modules. They said that in the third part, the energy yield calculation algorithm needs to be adjusted for bifacial panel configurations.
The academics introduced a new model to calculate the rear irradiance and said its calculation should be performed exclusively by creating the bifacial module energy rating climate data and not by every user.
“It extends the climate data from IEC 61853-4 to provide additional rear irradiance components necessary for bifacial modules,” they said.
They split the rear irradiance (Gr) into beam direct, sky diffuse, and ground reflected diffuse irradiance.
“Note that we use 20-degree module tilt angle in order to enable a comparison of monofacial and bifacial module energy ratings, as the monofacial standard fixes the angle to 20 degrees for all climates irrespective of what the optimum tilt for the climate might be,” the scientists said, noting that east–west-oriented and vertical installations, as well as systems with trackers, were not considered.
The researchers said they maintained the IEC 61853 standard's four main calculation steps for monofacial panels, while correcting angular losses for the yield calculation algorithm.
“In contrast to the standard, we apply it twice once for the front and once for the rear irradiation,” they explained, noting that they implemented a correction of the ground-reflected irradiance, as well as spectral correction.
The team tested the algorithm with two different approaches under real outdoor conditions over a nine-month period. One of the two methods gives the same CSER value for a bifaciality of zero as the monofacial module. The other one always gives a lower CSER.
The scientists said that their work consists of extending the rear-side angular correction for ground-reflected irradiance and combining total and effective irradiance in the temperature and power calculation steps.
“Thus, only relatively simple calculation steps and no measurements, which are not already used for the front side, are added when extending the standard to bifacial modules,” they said. They presented their findings in “Developing an energy rating for bifacial photovoltaic modules,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

Therefore, research efforts have been directed toward solid electrolytes that can provide improved performance and are compatible with the lithium metal anode, which currently exhibits the highest theoretical specific power capacity.
Now, researchers at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have engineered solvent-free single-ion polymer electrolytes which have delivered a significant improvement in ionic transport for lithium-metal battery applications.
Namely, in liquid electrolytes, lithium cations and counter anions move in opposite directions to conduct electricity. Normally, anions move at least four times faster than lithium cations, and thus lithium cation transfer contributes only a small fraction (20%) of the overall ionic current. Meanwhile excessive anions accumulate at the interface between electrode and electrolyte, causing internal short circuits and capacity fade of the battery.
The newly single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes designed by HKU researchers are reported to overcome these limitations and lead to at least fourfold increase in cationic transport.
The anionic network polymers consist of borate anions bridged by branched ethylene glycol linkers of differing stoichiometric ratios, in which the anions are tethered into the polymer frame, enabling a highly selective cation transport.
The researchers controlled the cation conductivity within the polymer by systematic engineering of segmental mobility. This helped them map out the comprehensive design rules for a new class of highly conductive solid electrolytes, successfully overcoming the persistent problems of current solid electrolytes, such as low cyclability and high overpotential.
“We believe the single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes would open up the possibility of new battery chemistries that will revolutionize the field of rechargeable batteries, and offer a high level of safety, high power density, and long life cycle,” said Jingyi Gao, the first author of the research paper.
According to Dr Dong-Myeong Shin of HKU, the ion-selective electrolytes can also result in fast charging due to low overpotential. “It can allow electric vehicles to be fully charged in just the time needed for drinking a cup of coffee. This remarkable advantage will unlock a new era of a clean energy world,” he adds.
Their findings were discussed in “Engineered networking in a family of solvent-free single-ion conducting borate network polymer electrolytes for Li-metal battery applications” published in Chemical Engineering Journal.

The solar lifecycle management software specialist performed aerial inspections across 24.5 GW of large-scale solar systems.
The inspection statistics show that solar assets are becoming more anomalous each year. Underperformance due to anomalies nearly doubled from 1.61% in 2019 to 3.13% in 2022, said the company. Power losses have increased by 94% since 2019, it added, noting that anomaly-driven power losses could grow to almost 6% by 2025 at the current rate.
Raptor Maps estimates annual losses of $82 million for the 24.5 GW of assets it inspected in 2022, at an average of an $3,350 annual loss per megawatt.
“Extrapolating across total global PV capacity (as of the end of 2021, excluding residential) translates to a $ 2.5 billion annual revenue loss for the industry,” the company said.
The report includes data on underperformance by site size and module-level anomalies for the first time. The figures show that smaller sites had the highest average power losses as a percentage of their generation capacity. However, the largest sites exhibited higher average power losses. Sites between 100 MW and 200 MW in size had average power losses of 4.04% – 29% higher than the global average.
“Sites larger than 200 MW are losing, on average, around $4,320 per MW, with some sites losing up to $12,900 per MW,” claimed Raptor Maps.
The report shows that system-level anomalies are the largest drivers of power losses, with string, inverter, and combiner anomalies affecting the most power as a percentage of total power inspected, at 1.06%, 0.70%, and 0.67%, respectively. String anomalies were reportedly responsible for 34% of lost revenue, while inverter and combiner anomalies were respectively responsible for 22% and 21%.
At the module level, Jinko Solar, First Solar, Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, and Longi were the top five manufacturers of inspected assets. Cell and diode anomalies were the most common module-level and sub-module-level anomalies among these manufacturers, according to Raptor Maps. Combined, the two categories accounted for roughly 70% of observed defects. Physical damage accounted for 18% of defects.
The next issue of pv magazine, due out on Thursday, will focus on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
Monocrystalline modules were found to be considerably less defective than polycrystalline and thin film technologies, by 65% and 41%, respectively. The inspected thin-film modules were purportedly more susceptive to physical damage such as cracking, delamination, and warping. They showed three times more physical damage than polycrystalline and 12 times more than monocrystalline. Hot spots were also found much more frequently in thin-film modules than in the other two technologies.
“The report underscores the need for asset owners and managers to monitor equipment performance over time, proactively identifying maintenance issues and warranty claim opportunities,” said Raptor Maps.

Meyer Burger has announced that in the future, it will only manufacture glass-glass bifacial solar modules. The Swiss manufacturer cites two main reasons for making the switch to glass. First, it wants to create a “unified, leaner and flexible concept for Meyer Burger’s future solar modules.” The group said that leaner production and logistics processes will lead to faster scalability of new manufacturing.
Over the short term, Meyer Burger said that the change will actually slow down manufacturing volumes in existing facilities as it transitions. The company’s Goodyear manufacturing site in the United States will be glass-glass from its start date next year.
While manufacturing speed and efficiency is of the utmost importance in the solar industry, there is another, more important reason for Meyer Burger’s decision: Glass-glass solar modules are a better technology than their plastic backsheeted siblings.
Officially, the manufacturer’s warranty suggests that their “Meyer Burger Glass” solar module will degrade at 0.2% or less per year, for 30 years. That means that a Meyer Burger glass-glass module bought today should be expected to produce at least 93.2% of its original output in the year 2053. In theory, if that degradation rate holds, a glass-glass Meyer Burger panel would still produce 89.2% of its original power rating after 50 years.

It is designed for commercial and industrial (C&I) applications.
The China-based storage and inverter manufacturer said the 5.12 kWh, 512 V batteries feature lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells from CATL. They include two clusters of batteries connected in parallel with 10 modules each in what KStar calls a “1+1 redundancy” design.
“If one battery cluster fails, the other 52.1 kWh battery cluster can still work normally,” KStar said in a statement. “They serve as each other's backup, 1+1 redundancy design ensures the stability of the system operation.”
The system capacity can be expanded to 1 MW/2 MWh, according to KStar. The batteries fits in an outdoor cabinet measuring 1,100 mm x 1,1000 mm x 2,380 mm and weighing 1.5 tons. It comes with IP54 protection and operates in temperatures ranging from -30 C to 50 C. The maximum operating altitude is 4,000 meters, with derating starting at 3,000 meters.
The system reportedly “enables the power generation to restore a stable power grid, optimize the power output curve, reduce solar curtailment, increase the proportion of renewable energy in total power generation, and optimize the energy structure,” the manufacturer said.
