The first of these planned auctions was a joint PV and wind power tender on Sept. 5. Greece’s energy regulator, RAE, aimed to award 1 GW of solar and wind capacity, but in the end it only handed out 538.4 MW of capacity.
The joint tender awarded 14 solar farms, or 372 MW of capacity, and about about 166 MW of wind. The average awarded price for PV projects came in at €47.98 ($48.83)/MWh, while wind power projects were also awarded various tariffs, with an average price of €57.66/MWh.
Greece’s state-owned utility, Public Power Corp. (PPC), was awarded 251 MW of PV. That capacity is spread across 80 MW, 75 MW, 16 MW and 80 MW installations. Heliothema Energy, France’s EDF renewables energy unit in Greece, won an additional 33 MW of capacity, also spread among four projects.
The tender also awarded three energy community PV projects of 10 MW, 37.5 MW and 10 MW in size, at €46/MWh (he tender’s lowest tariff), €46.37/MWh and €49.35/MWh, respectively. Most of the smaller PV projects, including the energy community ones, are managed by Geoapodosi, a company based in the city of Kavala, northern Greece.
The 251 MW that PPC won is a stunning result for the state utility, building upon its recent efforts to clean up its energy mix. It has secured contracts in Greece’s renewable tenders before, and it is also building subsidy-free solar farms. In addition, it has joined up with Germany’s RWE to build 2 GW of coal-mine solar capacity.
The PPC is leading Greece’s effort to phase coal out of the national energy mix. Before the war in Ukraine, Greece had rather ambitious plans to phase out coal, but these have been dampened to allow for lignite-fired power plants to replace gas flows.
Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said this week that Greece remains focused on its plans to phase coal out of its energy system. However, given the high prices of natural gas at present, lignite mined at the PPC’s coal mines will be needed for Greece in the next one or two years, he noted. It remains to be seen whether his estimated timeline is a realistic one, or the energy crisis continues for much longer.
Renewables shift
Lignite generated about 10% of Greece’s electricity last year. But given the current energy crisis, this could more than double in 2022 and 2023. Greece therefore aims to boost domestic production of renewable energy.
Specifically, the government aims to capitalize on its policies to modernize the renewables licensing process, which started about two years ago. One of these policies was to digitize the licensing process for green energy and establish strict deadliness for it. The idea is that renewable power projects should be able to acquire the necessary licenses and be ready to build within just 14 months.
However, such time scales remain unrealistic at present. The failure of last week’s tender to award 1 GW of renewable capacity demonstrates this. Put simply, there were not enough projects that had gathered all of the necessary licenses (generation licenses, environmental permits, and grid connection agreements) that are needed to participate in the tenders.
Local business stakeholders have told pv magazine that the Greek regional authorities responsible for the issuance of environmental permits often delay the process, despite the deadlines set by the policy. Grid space is also scarce, although the energy ministry has recently prioritized projects that should be allowed to connect to the grid soon. On this front, too, a lot of investors argue that the ministry has failed to explain why it promotes specific projects for grid connection and excludes others. Finally, the much-advertised central IT platform that would link all licensing authorities under the same electronic portal has yet to be launched. 
Stelios Psomas, policy adviser for the Hellenic Association of Photovoltaic Companies (HELAPCO), said that he agrees that the licensing of PV plants should be further improved.
However, he also told pv magazine that there might be an additional reason why last week’s tender was undersubscribed – the tender’s high starting price for bids. Bidding was set to start at €54/MWh for photovoltaic systems and many developers might struggle to build their projects with so low tariffs. Given inflation and the increase in the costs of solar equipment, added Psomas, some investors were very possibly discouraged to bid in the tender.
According to the energy ministry, the remaining 1 GW of capacity that was not awarded last week will be rolled over to upcoming tenders.

The electrolyzer will be assembled and installed in the coming weeks, with the validation process to be initiated when possible. The electrolyzer shipment left Tianjin, China, in July. The electrolyzer will have an output of 1,100 Nm3/hour of hydrogen at normal current density. “This equals 100 kg of pure hydrogen per hour, which will set a new standard for the industry,” said HydrogenPro. The electrolyzer has a diameter of 2 meters.
Siemens and German utility SWW Wunsiedel have revealed plans to commission an 8.75 MW PEM electrolyzer in Wunsiedel, Bavaria. The companies are working on the project in coordination with their credit financing partner, Umweltbank. “The hydrogen produced primarily from solar and wind power using PEM electrolysis,” wrote Siemens. It will be Germany's second biggest electrolyzer. 
The Port of Antwerp-Bruges and Germany's Duisport have signed a long-term cooperation agreement on energy transition, rail and hinterland connections, as well as port infrastructure. The two port operators said that the development of solutions to import, store, and distribute green hydrogen in various forms is one of the main strategic pillars of their cooperation. “The goal is to build an international supply chain for hydrogen in which both partners become central hydrogen hubs for Europe,” wrote the  of Antwerp-Bruges. Duisport and Antwerp-Bruges want to establish a high-frequency rail shuttle, in addition to planned pipeline connections, to establish rail as a “rolling pipeline.”
HDF Energy has confirmed to pv magazine that it plans to commission a hydrogen power plant in Namibia by 2024. “Our project delivers electricity and grid services. No fuel. Hydrogen is used as storage in our Renewstable power plants,” said Nicolas Lecomte, director of Southern Africa for the French company. Renewstable is a non-intermittent renewable electricity power plant whose deployment will start in Namibia, and eventually in other African countries, such as Morocco, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
Changsha University of Science and Technology researchers have reported the in-situ growth of molybdenum dioxide on a porous nickel substrate followed by phosphorus doping to generate self-supported P-doped MoO2/porous Ni electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The excellent performance of P-doped MoO2/porous Ni is mainly attributable to the efficient electrolyte diffusion, fast emission of gas bubbles, and enhanced electrical conductivity brought by porous Ni substrate and the highly active sites, wrote the researchers in “P-Doped MoO2/Porous Ni Self-Supported Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Solution.” They said the self-supported catalyst is superior to conventional powdery catalysts in developing new energy conversion technologies.
Enapter is reportedly the first electrolyzer producer to run the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) communication standard on its electrolyzers. OPC UA is a communication standard for industrial automation and Industry 4.0, enabling data communication and interoperability between devices and systems. The German company specializes in Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) Electrolyzer technology.
Ports of Stockholm has revealed that it is launching a procurement process for a hydrogen fueling station. The procurement plan will include the delivery and operation of a station to refuel vehicles with hydrogen, as well as a distribution agreement for hydrogen to be in place no later than January 2023. “This hydrogen fuelling station is part of converting our work vehicles to run on hydrogen,” said Johan Wallén, the CCO of Ports of Stockholm.
Plastic Omnium said it will develop and provide Ford with 700-bar type-IV hydrogen high-pressure vessels to equip its demonstrator fleet and generate real-life data in the medium-duty sector by the end of 2023. “The Ford F-550 Super Duty hydrogen fuel cell electric truck prototypes will support several applications, including trucks with auxiliary equipment, such as lift buckets for working on power and telecom lines,” wrote the Euronext Paris-listed company.

Desigenia, a Spanish energy efficiency specialist, has developed Ecocube, a hybrid power system for telecoms sites that is based on solar panels, high-cycle batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells.
“Its novelty compared to the rest of the hybrid systems that Desigenia installs in telecommunications sites is the storage of energy based on hydrogen,” the company said. “Normally, the space limitations of isolated telecommunications centers condition the installation of photovoltaic systems, and prevent having a totally renewable solution based on solar panels and batteries, which makes it necessary to install a diesel generator set.”
The system uses photovoltaic energy for direct consumption and uses surplus power to produce hydrogen via an electrolyzer. The generated hydrogen is then compressed, stored in bottles and used for electricity production via the fuel cell.
“The system is designed to provide between 1-10 kW of energy,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “It is scalable and can be adjusted according to the required power and demand, with the expansion of solar panels or an increase in the number of batteries. In other cases, the hydrogen bottles could be resized and increased.”
In principle, the system is designed for isolated telecoms stations, but if more power is required, the project would have to be studied. It would be possible to design a custom-made system.
“By replacing the diesel generator with a fuel cell as a source of energy, we avoid more than 3,600 liters of fuel consumption per year,” said the company.
The new EcoCube with hydrogen is designed for telecoms locations without an electrical network and a lack of space to install the necessary solar modules. The system can be installed on sites with space restrictions with a footprint of 10 meters ×1 0 meters, including the tower.
“There we have our headquarters and we can better coordinate the supervision and operation of the system, but we hope that by next year we will be able to implement it in other markets where we have already implemented our traditional EcoCubes in Mexico, Chile or Colombia, for example,” the spokesperson said. “We are open to new markets if demand arises.”
The company developed the system under the umbrella of the Together Project (Trigeneration with Geothermal, Hydrogen and Renewable Energies), which was funded by Spain's Ministry of Science,  and Innovation.

It did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.
“The agreement increases the energy storage capacity of Prime Infra’s renewable energy portfolio by 6,000MWh/day which is defined by a maximum continuous generation at 500MW for 12 hours,” said Prima Infra CEO Guillaume Lucci.
The facility will require an investment of approximately $1 billion and will be located at the Wawa/Montalban dam in Rizal province. Construction is scheduled to start next year.
In 2017, OVWPI awarded the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the project to Power Construction Corp. of China (PowerChina). At the time, the project was being developed by San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders and Developers (SLRB) and Equis Energy (Equis).
Prime Infra is also developing a 1,400 MW pumped storage hydropower project in Pakil, Laguna province. Construction of the $1.11 billion project is scheduled to begin in 2023, with completion set for no later than the first quarter of 2027. The first stage of the project will feed 700 MW of electricity into the grid for primary and tertiary reserve ancillary services, while the second stage will generate 500 MW for mid-merit services.
Prima Infra is also building a 2.5 GW to 3.5 GW solar farm tied to 4 GWh to 4.5 GWh of battery energy storage, in order to help power the Philippines, as the nation ramps up its transition to renewable energy.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Philippines had around 3,785 MW of hydropower capacity and 736 MW of pumped hydro capacity at the end of 2021. The government aims to increase the share of renewables in the power mix from 21% in 2020 to 35% by 2030 and 50% by 2040. Renewables currently account for 29.1% of the nation's total installed capacity.

Perth-based Liontown Resources is the latest mining company to back renewables to power its off-grid operations, engaging remote power generation specialist Zenith Energy to build a 95 MW hybrid solar PV, wind and battery energy storage system at its Kathleen Valley Lithium Project in Western Australia.
Liontown Resources has awarded Zenith Energy a contract to supply power at its Kathleen Valley project on a build-own-operate basis. Zenith Energy will construct a 95 MW hybrid power station at the Kathleen Valley project, about 680 kilometers northeast of Perth.
The hybrid power station will feature 30 MW of wind capacity, a 16 MWp fixed-axis solar PV array, and a 17 MW/19 MWh battery energy storage system. The thermal power component will include 27 MW of gas generation and 5 MW of diesel standby generation.
With the thermal components of the power plant designed to operate in “engine off” mode at times, it is anticipated the hybrid power plant will deliver at least 60% renewable energy at the start and up to 100% during times of high wind and solar radiation.
Zenith Managing Director Hamish Moffat said that with a combined 46 MW of generation capacity and 17 MW of BESS, the hybrid power station is expected to have the largest off-grid renewable capacity of any mining project in the country.
“It’s an exciting opportunity to showcase our expertise, and the ability of renewables to deliver reliable, continuous supply, to power an entire mining operation,” he said. “It will once again raise the industry benchmark in renewable energy integration and demonstrates our commitment to power decarbonisation.”
Moffat said the letter of award enables Zenith, which has installed capacity of more than 400 MW across Western Australia and the Northern Territory, to undertake planning, engineering and design work while the parties progress toward finalizing a binding power purchase agreement.
Liontown CEO Tony Ottaviano said Zenith will be incentivized to operate the power station in a manner that maximizes renewable power, with a renewable energy guarantee expected to be included in the definitive arrangements.
“We believe Zenith Energy is an ideal partner to delivery an industry leading hybrid power station to meet Liontown’s energy needs and requirements for a high-capacity renewable solution,” he said.
Liontown expects construction of the Kathleen Valley project to commence later this year. It is expected to initially produce about 500,000 tons of spodumene concentrate per year, but Liontown hopes to expand production to 700,000 tons by 2029.

“The new DPI microinverters will be available in both 208 V and 480 V versions and will incorporate several key features, including integrated phase monitoring/phase balancing, NEC 2020 690.12 rapid shutdown compliance, and UL 1741-SA (Rule 21) compliance,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Each DPI supports four high-capacity solar modules.”
The inverters measure 359 mm x 242 mm x 46 mm and weigh 6 kg. They have a peak efficiency of 96.5% and a nominal maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency of 99.5%.
The operating voltage range is between 26 V and 60 V and the maximum input voltage is 60 V. The maximum continuous output power for the 208 V device is 1,728 VA and 1,800 VA for the 480 V product. The inverters also feature cooling systems based on natural convection and come with 10-year warranties that are extendable to 25 years, the manufacturer stated.
“This utility-interactive microinverter has Reactive Power Control (RPC) technology that exceeds recent NEC Rapid Shutdown requirements” the company said. “Microinverters are a safe bet over high-voltage string inverters and eliminate the risk for DC arc faults.”
The inverters are manufactured in Taiwan for Yotta Energy under a strategic original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partnership with Seattle-based microinverter specialist APsystems.

The corporate power purchase agreement was signed in March with US-based titanium products supplier Tronox, which operates several mines and smelters in the region. The electricity will be supplied to five Tronox facilities in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal through wheeling agreements, under which state-owned utility Eskom will pay for the maintenance and upkeep of infrastructure to transmit the electricity.
“These are the first projects of this scale in South Africa that are based on pure private bilateral trade.  It's also a great plus for the country that these projects are 100% South African owned, financed, constructed, operated and managed,” said Dom Wills, CEO of Sola.
The projects raised a total of ZAR 4 billion ($233.6 million) of funding for construction and development. Sola partnered with African Rainbow Energy to raise the funds.
The debt arrangement was led by PepperTree Capital, with the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) lending ZAR 3.1 billion. Other lenders included three of the South Africa’s major banks – Absa, Nedbank, and Standard Bank. The legal advisers on the transaction were Pinsent Masons, Hogan Lovells, Faskens, Allen & Overy and ENS, said Sola.
The design and construction of the projects will be the responsibility of South African construction company WBHO, with engineering services supplied by Sola.
The company sees the project as a potential breakthrough for the private energy market.
“We hope the model of private power through bilateral agreements continues to become more widely adopted,” said Wills. “The benefits to the end user are competition, choice and ultimately a more diverse contribution to the power system.”
The South African government raised the threshold for the distributed-generation solar segment to 100 MW in August 2021, exempting developers from applying for generation licenses to improve the entire permitting process. The new rules also imposed a wheeling fee to be paid Eskom for the maintenance and upkeep of its infrastructure to transport the energy.

The Netherlands, with 14 GW of solar capacity, lacks land for the development of new PV projects.
“This is why the Dutch government has adopted a more flexible regulatory framework, in particular in terms of authorizations, for projects built on non-conventional surfaces, such as agrivoltaics or floating solar,” Maximilian Tegtmeyer, agriPV project manager for BayWa r.e.
In June 2020, BayWa's Dutch subsidiary, GroenLeven, built a first pilot agrivoltaic park in Babberich, near the border with Germany. The companies tested two types of panels at the facility, including semitransparent modules. The project was extended in June 2020 to a commercial format of 3.2 hectares.
The traditional plastic tunnels have now been replaced by a 2.67 MW solar structure, made with the help of Germany's Zimmermann. The 250 W semi-transparent panels each have a transparency rate of 35%.
“Previously, we worked with the Chinese manufacturer BYD and now we call on the company HT/SAAE,” said Tegtmeyer.
The PV modules generate 2,403 MWh per year, fully injected into the grid. A 60 kW Huawei string inverter is installed at the end of each row, to avoid the passage of cables from one row to another.
The investment cost per hectare  was nearly €1 million ($1.01 million), which corresponds to approximately €1.15/W, which compares to €0.50/W to €0.80/W for a conventional ground-mounted project.
“BayWa r.e. signed a long-term lease with the operator, as for any renewable energy project,” said Thomas Domblides, regional solar development manager for BayWa r.e. France. “For his part, the farmer has signed a lease loan, so the two financial flows offset each other.”

Yaskawa Solectria Solar, one of the few US-based manufacturers of solar inverters, has formed a partnership with First Solar. The two sides are working to optimize the Solectria XGI 1500-250 utility-scale string inverters for First Solar’s thin film cadmium telluride solar modules.
The goal of the partnership is to create a version of the new XGI 1500-250 utility-scale string inverter that allows a grounded DC input, and thereby ensures optimal integration with First Solar’s Series 6 and Series 7 modules. 
“We expect that Solectria’s new inverter design in combination with First Solar’s module technology will help asset owners and operators further enhance the LCOE of their solar installations,” said Alex Kamerer, manager of product management for First Solar. 
First Solar said its modules are lower-carbon alternatives to traditional crystalline silicon panels. The company also has a robust end-of-life and recycling program it developed in-house.
The partnership might prove attractive to developers who are looking to make the most of the incentives within the US Inflation Reduction Act. In addition to the 30% investment tax credit, there is a 10% credit adder for projects that use domestically produced hardware. To qualify for the 10% credit adder, 100% of steel and iron must be manufactured in the United States. For manufactured goods – like solar panels, inverters, and electrical gear – the goods must initially be 40% US-manufactured, although this percentage will increase in the future. 
Solectria is a wholly owned subsidiary of Yaskawa America. Its products include inverters ranging from 25 kW to 250 kW in size, string combiners, and web-based monitoring for all size solar systems.

Indian developer Avaada has emerged as one of the winners in a 500 MW solar auction (phase eight) held by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. (MSEDCL). It won 300 MW of PV capacity at a tariff of INR 2.83 ($0.036)/kWh.
The developer can connect the projects to the inter-state or intra-state grid, anywhere in India. It will supply the generated power to MSEDCL through the state grid in Maharashtra on a long-term basis.
Avaada recently won 25 MW win in another 500 MW solar auction (phase seven) by MSEDCL in August. It secured 25 MW at a tariff of INR 2.91/kWh.
“By winning the MSEDCL auctions for a total of 325 MWac capacity, we are well on our way to achieving our targeted renewable energy capacity of 5 GW by the end of FY 2022-23 and 11 GW by the end of 2025,” said Avaada Chairman Vineet Mittal.
The projects must be commissioned within 18 months from the date of the signing of the power purchase agreement. In addition, the projects must achieve financial closure within 12 months.
Avaada aims to reach 11 GW by 2025 and 30 GW by 2030. It has a manufacturing facility with an annual capacity of 5 GW for cells and modules, with commercial production expected to start by early next year. Avaada plans to scale up its PV manufacturing to 10 GW by 2030, with backward integration into polysilicon, ingots, and wafers.
