The Bundesnetzagentur has opened the first round of 2023 tenders for large-scale solar systems, with a target volume of 1,950 MW. The deadline to submit bids is March 1.
Since the start of the year, surcharges have been awarded for PV ground-mounted systems with an output of at least 1 MW. In addition, bids for ground-mounted systems are permissible up to 100 MW.
The Bundesnetzagentur recently raised the maximum value for tenders. The ceiling price is now €0.0737/kWh for the 2023 rounds for ground-mounted PV systems. This is to account for higher component, installation, and financing costs and to avoid unsubscribed tenders.
The advertised volume was not fully used in any round last year. For the November round, the Federal Network Agency even lowered the originally planned volume from 1,200 MW to 890 MW. However, only 104 bids for photovoltaic projects with a total of almost 609 MW were accepted. At €0.0580/kWh, the average, the volume-weighted surcharge was only slightly below the previous year's maximum of €0.0590/kWh.
Tenders for large-scale solar systems will total 5,850 MW this year. The second and third phases will open on July 1 and Dec. 1.
There are also three rounds of tenders this year for rooftop systems with an output of at least 1 MW. The first round with a volume of just under 217 MW has already started and has a deadline of Feb. 1. A total of 650 MW are to be tendered in this segment in 2023, with the ceiling price being raised significantly compared to 2022 to €0.1125/kWh.

The Flex2Energy project, officially called “Automated Manufacturing Production Line for Integrated Printed Organic Photovoltaics”, received €21.2 million ($23 million) in funding from the European Horizon research initiative. It is led by the two Greek specialists in organic electronics and thin film technology, OET and the Lab for Thin Films and Nanotechnology (LTFN), and includes 14 other companies and research institutions from across Europe.
The new factory is expected to start operations at the end of 2025 and produce a million square meters of organic solar cells annually, according to local media outlet Kathimerini.
The project aims to “demonstrate that automated manufacturing of integrated photovoltaics (IPV) can deliver cost competitive products assuming both the function of energy generators and of structural elements,” according to its Horizon website description.
The consortium proposed to develop a pilot manufacturing line that can adapt to emerging novel cell and module technologies. It should also be able to print organic PV with different formats, thicknesses, and variations in the solar cell matrix, encapsulation materials, and front sheets, according to the Horizon website.

Plenty of additives, encapsulants and barrier layers have been suggested to fix this, but understanding the exact mechanisms that take place within the material to cause damage upon contact with heat and water could open up pathways to a more comprehensive solution. This was the goal of scientists led by École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland and South Korea’s Sungkyunkwan University, who looked deep into the crystalline structure of a perovskite to work out what was going on.
The group analyzed different facets – flat faces on the surface of the crystal. Their results are published in the paper Unveiling facet-dependent degradation and facet engineering for stable perovskite solar cells, published in Science. The group found one common facet, the 100 facet, which it describes as “perpendicular to a crystal's c-axis with its atoms arranged in a repeating pattern in the form of a square grid”, was particularly unstable when exposed to moisture.
Another facet, named 111 and described as “atoms arranged in a triangular grid,” was shown to be much more moisture resistant. And the group set about engineering a new perovskite film that would grow with more of the 111 facet and less of the 100. The group used the films to make solar cells that achieved 23.8% efficiency, and these maintained 85% of their initial performance after 800 hours under test conditions of 85% humidity and a temperature of 85 C, while a control sample fell to 75% of its initial performance value under the same conditions.
The group says various optimizations should be able to improve the PV performance of the newly engineered perovskite, and that it expects this type of facet engineering to be a valuable tool in developing perovskite solar cells that can meet market expectations for performance and longevity.

“The Labor Authority believes that more attention should be paid to safety in this sector and will increase the number of inspections,” it said in a statement, noting that there have also been four casualties over the past three years.
Around 80% of the accidents were related to installers falling from rooftops or through the actual roofs.
“In more than half of the cases, the victims suffered one or more bone fractures,” the authority stated. “In 20% of the cases they suffered a head injury and in 10% of the cases the installers suffered permanent injuries from the accident.”
It conducted more than 150 inspections and accident investigations and applied fines to companies that violated Dutch legislation on working conditions.
“We estimate that the chance of an accident is at least 100 times smaller if an installer works according these working conditions,” says Inspector General Rits de Boer.
Rooftop PV development is booming in the Netherlands under its net-metering regime. The country's cumulative installed PV capacity hit 16.85 GW at the end of June 2022. In the first six months of last year, the country added 1,946 MW of new PV systems, according to official statistics from CBS – Statistics Netherlands.

It said the two facilities will have capacities of 60 MW and 300 MW and will be located in the provinces of Pangasinan and Zambales, respectively.
The Pangasinan solar farm is being built at a cost of PHP 2.8 billion ($51 million).
“It will be directly connected to the grid through a 2 km transmission line to the NGCP 69kV San Manuel Substation,” said Acen Renewables.
The second project, the Palauig 2 Solar farm, will require an investment of PHP 16 billion. The company said that module manufacturer Seraphim will supply 540 MWp high-efficiency solar panels for the installation. The project will be built near Acen's existing 63 MW Palauig 1 solar project.
“This expansion of our Palauig solar assets comes at an exciting time for ACEN’s Philippine operations as we are relying on our core market to boost our energy transition efforts in the region,” said the company's chief development officer, Jose Maria Zabaleta. “Palauig 2 Solar is the first of several new plants to commence with major construction works this year, and the need to sustain this accelerated pace towards the exponential growth of the renewables space is on top of our agenda.”
In February 2022, AC Energy completed and switched on a 40MW/60MWh storage facility at the 120MW Alaminos Solar plant. It is now one of the largest operational PV projects in the country.
The Philippines plans to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that the nation had 1.08 GW of installed PV capacity by the end of 2021. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under its old feed-in tariff regime, as well as auctions and net-metering programs.

rPlus Hydro, LLP, a developer of large-scale pumped storage hydro projects, announced the submission of its application for Final License to the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for its 900 MW Seminoe pumped storage project located in Carbon County, Wyoming. According to rPlus Hydro, this milestone has been achieved by only six pumped storage projects in the United States since 2000.
The Seminoe pumped storage project is expected to provide 10 hours of full-output energy storage capacity and will help ensure reliability and dependability of the regional transmission grid, especially as additional wind and solar capacity comes online. With an estimated construction cost of approximately $2.5 billion, the project expects to create up to 500 skilled construction jobs in Carbon County over four to six years. Once operational, the project will provide an estimated 35 full-time skilled positions to the area and generate approximately $9 million in additional annual tax revenue for state and local governments.
Pumped storage hydroelectric storage works by pumping water from a lower to a higher reservoir during off-peak periods. This can be at night or when there is too much electricity being generated, such as by solar during the day. When power is needed, stored water flows downhill through a turbine, and that energy is harnessed to produce electricity.
“Seminoe pumped storage will be an ideal match for Wyoming’s excellent wind energy resource, and will support Wyoming’s role as an energy leader,” notes Matthew Shapiro, rPlus Hydro CEO. “It can also help ensure efficient utilization of new transmission lines that are, or will soon be, under construction, such as the Gateway lines and TransWest Express.”
In the project’s design, the lower reservoir will be the existing Seminoe Reservoir. The upper reservoir will be located in the Bennet Mountains approximately 1.7 miles east of the Seminoe Dam, and approximately 1,000 ft higher in elevation than the Seminoe Reservoir. The two reservoirs will be joined by tunnels underground.
An underground powerhouse will contain equipment to generate electricity from the power of the water as it flows from the upper reservoir through the powerhouse and on to the lower reservoir. The same equipment would be used to pump water from the lower reservoir back to the upper reservoir, enabling the system to start the cycle again when needed.
Energy for pumping, and power generated by the project, will be delivered through a new, 30-mile transmission line connecting the project with PacifiCorp’s existing Aeolus Substation, near Medicine Bow, Wyoming.
Pumped storage has been in use for more than a century, and there are currently 43 such projects operating in the United States, according to rPlus. The submission of the Final License Application is the first of several major milestones for rPlus Hydro coming in 2023. rPlus Hydro anticipates final license to be granted by March 2025, construction to begin in October 2026, and commercial operation of the first unit by June 2031, with full operation by September 2031.
rPlus Hydro’s submission of its final license application is the culmination of a multi-year study and approval process that includes in-depth engineering designs, environmental assessments, and community engagement. The filing of this application will launch an environmental review and licensing process with local, state, and federal agencies.
The company expects to submit a final license application for its White Pine Pumped Storage project, a 1,000 MW project located in White Pine County, Nevada, in the coming months.
The final license application is available here.

In a quarterly report on large-scale renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPA), energy advisory Edison Energy said prices in the US market continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than experienced since the second quarter of 2021.
Tracking 120 projects with commercial operations dates through 2026, the report shows that PPA prices increased by 4% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Many of the planned projects are solar, with 105 projects planned in total. The slower rate of price increases marks a step down from the 17% increase in the third quarter of 2022.
Compared to one year ago, prices have increased by 48%, or $18/MWh. The PJM grid remains the most expensive, with median prices increasing by 8% or $5/MWh, in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the Southwest Power Pool, the median solar PPA price fell by 8%, or $5/MWh, in the fourth quarter, following a record-setting 29% increase in the third quarter.
After an exceptionally low quarter for project availability in the July-September period, US developers are more confident in marketing projects, with clearer guidance on import tariffs and long-term certainty from the US Inflation Reduction Act. Actively marketed projects increased 40% over the previous quarter.
By ISO region, fourth-quarter solar PPA prices are as follows ($/MWh):
Raw material costs fell year on year, with copper, aluminum, and North American steel down 15%, 10%, and 64%, respectively. Edison Energy said lower material costs could push PPA prices down even further as the impact of cost improvements ripple through the supply chain.
Rising interest rates are also contributing to higher prices. The Federal Funds rate, representing the cost of borrowing money, rose to 3.7% for the three quarters ending on Sept. 30, 2022, compared to close to 0% throughout the prior year. 
Projects placed in service after Jan. 1, 2023, are eligible for credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. At minimum, the Investment Tax Credit provides 6% of total project costs and can rise as high as 50% if certain wage, domestic content, and Energy Justice requirements are met.
The Production Tax Credit, offered to both solar and wind projects, ranges between $5.50/MWh to $33/MWh, also dependent on prevailing wage requirements, domestic content, and energy community siting.
Edison Energy said members of the European Union have expressed concerns that the IRA will hinder European companies, and that it violates international trade law. In response, the United States and the European Union have set up a joint task force to address these concerns. Project developers will be attentive to any potential changes that may result from these conversations in 2023.

They found that such devices could provide a lower LCOE than new storage systems.
They described their findings in “Second-life battery systems for affordable energy access in Kenyan primary schools,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. They investigated the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed system configuration and said that its use could be extended to electrify all rural households.
“Lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles are particularly high-value SLBs,” they explained. “At their ‘end-of-life’, they still typically have 70% to 80% of their capacity remaining. This equates to thousands of charge/discharge cycles and hours of usable energy storage.”
The academics spoke to 12 East African schools about their respective consumption profiles and projected energy needs, as well as the technical and financial challenges. They aimed to compare the performance of the proposed system configuration with two reference systems featuring conventional batteries and grid electricity.
The electricity produced by the solar-plus-storage system would be used for classroom lighting, security lighting, information technology, and phone charging.
“These all use relatively little power, which speaks well to the potential suitability of hybrid battery and PV solutions to meet school energy needs,” the scientists explained.
Th appliances are roughly the same for the four schools. They would require an average installed power of around 5 kW, given an annual average demand of 10,220 kWh.
The scientists calculated the LCOE of the three system configurations over 25 years.
“This was estimated at $0.31/kWh, resulting from the current electricity cost of $0.28/kWh and considering an annual utility escalating factor of 1%,” they said. “Results for each scenario show that the LCOE varies between $0.11/kWh and $0.22/kWh and that in 97.2% of the scenarios studies, using second-life batteries is cheaper compared to new batteries as per the LCOE obtained.”
They identified a minimum payback time of 2.9 years for a hybrid system consisting of a 5 kW PV system and 5 kWh of SLB storage. They found that locally sourced SLBs were cheaper than imported new batteries in all of the scenarios. They also determined that the maximum reduction in LCOE of 29.4% could be achieved for a system that combines 7.5 kW of PV with 20 kWh of SLB storage, or for a 10 kW of PV paired with 20 kWh of SLB storage.
“While we have shown that SLBs can reduce the costs of school energy access in Kenya significantly while effectively mitigating the challenges of battery waste, there are still a number of issues that need to be overcome for SLBs to be effectively used on a wide scale,” the scientists concluded, noting that more research will be needed to address the aforementioned issues.
