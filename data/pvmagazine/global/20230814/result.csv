Iberdrola has started the filling process for the Alto Tâmega reservoir, a significant part of Portugal's largest pumped hydroelectric storage installation. This project includes Alto Tâmega, which has a capacity of 160 MW, alongside Gouvães, an 880 MW pumped storage plant, and the 118 MW Daivões section. All three facilities have been operational since 2022.
The completion of the Alto Tâmega dome dam – characterized by its double curvature design and height of 104.5 meters, with 220,000 cubic meters of concrete – marks a significant milestone. With this phase accomplished, attention now shifts to the filling of the Alto Tâmega reservoir. This strategic step will facilitate the harnessing of water resources for the generation of renewable electricity at the Alto Tâmega power plant, which is strategically situated at the base of the dam.
Elaborating on the technical details, Iberdrola highlights the recent closure of the river diversion tunnel. Over the coming three months, a substantial 28-meter-long concrete plug is set to be meticulously constructed within the tunnel, a critical measure aimed at ensuring the comprehensive and enduring closure of the diversion tunnel for the entirety of the facility's operational lifespan. Throughout this three-month period, the river's flow will continue its circulation through the dam's bottom outlets, maintaining a continuous natural rhythm.
“The Tâmega hydroelectric complex is one of the largest energy initiatives in Portugal's history,” said Iberdrola.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/14/hysata-testing-hydrogen-electrolyzer-tech-in-real-world-setting/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 14, 2023",Hysata testing hydrogen electrolyzer tech in real-world setting,"From pv magazine Australia
Hysata, a company spun off rom the University of Wollongong (UOW), has secured more than AUD 23 million ($14.87 million) from the Australian and Queensland governments to fund a project designed to accelerate the development and commercialisation of its “capillary-fed” electrolyzer cell technology.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has committed AUD 20.9 million to help fund the demonstration project, while Queensland government-owned power company Stanwell Corp. is backing the initiative with AUD 3 million. Stanwell will also provide the site and facilities for the field deployment of the electrolyser.
Hysata is developing ultra-high efficiency hydrogen electrolyzer technology that eliminates almost all resistance in the electrolysis process and has the potential to significantly shift the economics of green hydrogen production.
“Existing electrolyzers face energy losses from electrical resistance and gaseous bubbles forming on electrodes, reducing the overall efficiency of the system,” Hysata said. “[The technology] has been proven to produce hydrogen with 95% (41.5 kWh/kg) efficiency, well ahead of incumbent technologies that operate with efficiencies close to 75% (52.5 kWh/kg).”
ARENA said the technology has the “potential to reduce the cost of renewable hydrogen production through reduced electricity inputs … The technology also offers lower balance of plant costs, with reduced electrical resistance resulting reduced cooling requirements. If delivered at scale, these reduced input costs will help lower the levelized cost of hydrogen, making renewable hydrogen a commercially viable energy resource.”
Hysata plans to develop and test a 5 MW unit at its new electrolyzer manufacturing facility in Port
Kembla, New South Wales. The electrolyzer array will then undergo testing and validation before it is relocated to Queensland where it will be installed adjacent to the 1,460 MW Stanwell Power Station near Rockhampton. The site has available land, water and grid connection capacity.
Hysata said initial development of the system is already underway, with the field pilot at Stanwell due to commence in 2025. Hysata Chief Executive Officer Paul Barrett said the project is a pivotal moment in the company’s rapid technological and commercial scaling, as it works towards achieving a 9.4 GW pipeline of signed conditional orders and letters of intent.
“Our plan encompasses the construction of a 100 MW per annum production line, with commercial-scale units
scheduled for delivery in 2025, including the 5 MW electrolyzer unit for Stanwell’s project. And we
will ramp up rapidly to giga-scale capacity thereafter,” he said.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the project is a crucial step to enabling purchase orders for the technology.
“This electrolyser technology could be a game-changer for renewable hydrogen,” Miller said. “The demonstration at Stanwell’s site will be key to unlocking commercial demand for Hysata’s product by proving the technology works at scale.”
The new funding builds on AUD 8.98 million awarded by ARENA under the German-Australian HyGATE program, with an additional AUD 9 million contribution from Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).
With the help of the HyGATE grant, Hysata is currently working on the development of a 200 kW electrolyzer system that will demonstrate the key components of the 5 MW commercial-scale demonstration unit.

The company has submitted solar energy operating contracts (SEOC) to the Department of Energy for eight blocks of 100 hectares each in the southern and eastern sections of the lake. In addition, Acen recently signed a renewable energy contract area utilization (RECAU) agreement with the Laguna Lake Development Authority to lease 800 hectares of space on Laguna Lake.
Acen's first floating solar project is awaiting approval, but it did not disclose any additional details regarding the project or its timeline.
The company is now constructing the 283 MW San Marcelino solar farm in Zambales. It will become the largest solar farm in the Philippines once it is operational. It will likely be completed this year.
Acen has already built about 4 GW of renewable generation capacity across the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Australia. It plans to expand this capacity to 20 GW by 2030.

Such an automated system is said to be a useful tool to assist many stakeholders in the PV industry, as it can supply policymakers, authorities, and financial evaluators with accurate data.
The novel method utilizes deep learning and image processing techniques to detect solar thermal and photovoltaic systems, and according to its authors, a follow-up study might even enhance the model to differentiate between the PV and solar thermal technologies. “This is a challenging task as the two technologies share similar texture and color appearance,” the article explains. “However, we believe that with the right modifications and improvements, it can be effectively adapted for multi-class segmentation of solar energy systems.”
In the study “Identifying small decentralized solar systems in aerial images using deep learning,” published in Solar Energy, the academics explained that they used a U-net architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a convolutional network method for fast and precise segmentation of images, explaining that the key strength of this technique is that it requires a smaller number of input data and lower hardware usage compared to other approaches.
“The utilization of the U-net model for solar energy systems detection provides a data-driven and automated solution with enhanced complexity, enabling precise detection,” it added. “Its accurate segmentation and identification of solar energy systems from aerial images hold substantial practical value, facilitating efficient assessment of panel performance, maintenance requirements, and energy production estimation.”
The new model was trained and tested on two databases – one from Germany and another one from Sweden – and a mixture of the two was used for higher generalization of its abilities. When compared to other CNN architectures, the researchers said, the U-Net model stood out, especially in image segmentation tasks.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
Also according to the research, the U-net model can be trained on aerial images with a resolution of 128 x 128 pixels, and achieve accuracy that is not significantly poorer than it does with a higher 256 x 256 pixel resolution. Its ability to use lower resolution, in turn, results in lower computer hardware usage.
“This study has proven that a U-net model can assess the area of solar energy systems in aerial imagery with high accuracy,” the article concluded. “However, the tilt of the modules is also needed for a correct area estimation. Calculating the tilt can be done either from 3D building data or high/low-resolution LiDAR data. Combining the latter with the method of this study is the planned next step.”

On Jan. 10, 2013, Chilean Minister of Energy Jorge Bunster oversaw the commissioning of the nation's first PV plant to be linked to the Central Interconnected System (SIC).
The 1.2 MW project – constructed by Santiago-based engineering group Kaltemp and Germany's Juwi – features 5,200 solar panels. It is situated near the city of Vicuña, Elqui province. It was the third operational PV plant in the country.
Bunster said that Chile had an active 3,107 MW solar project portfolio, with an additional 908 MW under environmental review. In addition, Chile's National Energy Commission (CNE) said that it was feasible to connect up to 2.2 GW of solar to the national grid over the next 15 years.
World-efficiency records
Germany's Heliatek GmbH said its organic solar cells now possess an accredited efficiency of 12%, surpassing its prior record of 10.7% set merely nine months earlier in 2012. This remarkable progress has prompted plans for the commercial launch of initial applications by the end of 2013. Concurrently, Heliatek has initiated a fundraising campaign, targeting €60 million from both current and fresh investors. This capital infusion aims to facilitate the establishment of a new production line.
In parallel, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) made a significant stride by introducing a thin-film-on-polymer CIGS cell boasting an impressive efficiency of 20.4%, representing a new milestone. EMPA emphasized that this novel cell now matches the efficiency of cells founded on polycrystalline silicon wafers, a notable achievement. Team leader Ayodhya Tiwari further emphasized the success, stating that they have effectively bridged the “efficiency gap” between solar cells based on polycrystalline silicon wafers and CIGS thin-film cells on glass.
Bankruptcy rumors
There were persistent rumors of a potential bankruptcy at Trina Solar in 2013. Speculation was sparked by an unusual incident in which analyst Richard Pearson said on Seeking Alphathat Trina Solar had acquired polysilicon at unsustainable prices. He claimed that the deals were struck at levels exceeding the module maker's profit potential. Company sources promptly refuted the claims and issued a warning, reserving the right to hold those responsible accountable through legal means.
United States backs solar
In his inaugural speech in January 2013, re-elected US President Barack Obama focused on sustainable energy. He said that America needed to lead the transition, rather than relinquish the technological advantage to other nations. He also noted the importance of preserving the environment for future generations. “We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,” he said.
LatAm's solar ambitions
In 2013, Latin America emerged as a promising market for solar, with the region announcing 8.4 GW of new solar projects in the preceding 12 months. This surge prompted GTM Research to predict an additional 450 MW of new grid-connected capacity to be commissioned in 2013. Notably, Mexico and Chile took the lead in this solar expansion, with Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Peru, and Jamaica also making notable contributions to the region's solar ambitions.
German achievements
Germany's accomplishments in solar energy reached new heights in 2013, building upon remarkable achievements in the preceding year. In 2012, the country added 7.6 GW of new PV to the grid. By February 2013, PV systems were set to receive feed-in tariffs (FIT) ranging from 0.1152/kWh to 0.1664/kWh, underscoring Germany's position as a solar energy leader.

New York state has a lot of work to do if it hopes to meet the transmission requirements outlined in the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA).
A report by the NYSOSC, currently led by Thomas P. DiNapoli, states that as of 2022, renewables accounted for approximately 29% of the electricity generated in the state. Roughly 75% of that came from hydroelectric generation, with the remaining 25% was primarily split between wind and solar.
In 2019, New York State adopted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which includes targets to generate 70% of electricity used from renewables by 2030 and 6 GW of distributed-generation solar by 2025. It also aims to  install 3 GW of storage by 2030.
The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) found that to meet the CLCPA 2030 renewable electricity goal, the state will have to more than triple the installed renewable capacity of roughly 6.5 GW in 2022 by adding an additional 20 GW over an eight-year period.
The NYSOSC report identifies three interrelated processes that play a role in the development of renewable electricity generation resources in the state. The processes work in parallel and developers should note that they do not need to have completed any of the processes before they can enter one of the other processes. Permitting and grid interconnection, however, are required for any all-new sources of generation.
The three processes are incentives, permitting and siting and interconnection. Through various programs, particularly renewable energy certificates (RECs), incentives stimulate the market to advance the state toward its renewable goals. The report notes that the permitting process is intended to ensure that projects are sited in areas and under conditions consistent with state and local laws and regulations.
The interconnection process should ensure sufficient electric transmission and distribution infrastructure to satisfy customer demand. The report suggests that streamlining the three parallel processes can help reduce the frequency of slow-moving or canceled projects. This is essential, the report contends, to ensuring that the state will meet its goal of removing greenhouse gasses from the grid by 2040.
According to the report, there were three key challenges that hindered its progress: inconsistent provision of incentives; project cancellations; and lengthy project timelines due to delays in siting and operationalization.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/14/mitigating-residential-duck-curve-via-solar-pre-cooling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 14, 2023",Mitigating residential duck curve via solar pre-cooling,"Researchers in Australia have looked at how rooftop PV generation used to run air conditioners (AC) to pre-cool residential and commercial buildings may improve cost savings for households, while mitigating the so-called duck curve.
The proposed solar pre-cooling concept, which the scientists developed in previous research, considers the thermal mass of buildings as a virtual battery that could be used to shift or shave peak demand caused by AC systems. It can be implemented in all kinds of buildings that have an AC unit and can be more beneficial if the surplus PV generation during the day is used to pre-cool the building instead of importing electricity from the grid. The AC unit is switched on before peak demand hours with lower thermostat setpoints to pre-cool a household's thermal mass and indoor air.
“In our previous study, we only simulated pre-cooling,” the research's lead author, Shayan Naderi, told pv magazine. “The novelty of our new work consists of using measured AC demand, PV generation, and household load profile, and clustering households based on their load shape. We also calculated the benefits of solar pre-cooling for different groups of households and building types.”
The analysis considered the feed-in tariffs (FITs) that are currently paid in Australia for residential rooftop PV generation, three different categories of residential building types dubbed 2-, 6-, and 8-star homes representing old, new, or renovated houses, respectively, and their net demand profiles. For each star rating, three different construction weights were simulated for Adelaide, Melbourne, Sidney, and Brisbane.
The analysis also considered maximum demand reduction, minimum demand mitigation, peak import reduction, self-consumption improvement, and cost savings. It was carried out with a dataset provided by monitoring and energy management services provider Australia-based Solar Analytics Pty. Ltd, which includes hourly data for net demand, AC demand, and PV generation of 349 households during the period from December 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019.
“The temporal pattern of PV generation and household demand are contributing factors to solar pre-cooling potential,” the researches emphasized. “There is a significant difference between the overall magnitude of average hourly AC excluded net demand profiles across the houses.”
They identified four dominant clusters of AC excluded net demand profiles across the 349 households and said only one of the clusters, representing only 3% of the households, does not provide solar pre-cooling technical and economic potential. “The other three clusters, representing 97% of the solar homes analyzed, have a duck shaped AC excluded net demand and offer demand profile improvement through solar pre-cooling,” they said, noting that these results are achieved regardless of the building's energy efficiency.
The improvement of ‘flattening’ demand profile is mainly due to minimum demand mitigation, with a maximum PV system capacity of 4 kW. The action of solar pre-cooling, meanwhile, was found to be mainly limited by AC size and surplus PV generation, and not by the thermal comfort of occupants.
The research's findings were exposed in the paper “Clustering-based analysis of residential duck curve mitigation through solar pre-cooling: A case study of Australian housing stock,” published in Renewable Energy. The research group comprises scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of New South Wales (UNSW).
