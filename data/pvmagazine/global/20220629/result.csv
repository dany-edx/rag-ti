“The new provisions have not yet entered into force, but this should occur shortly,” Mihaela Nyerges, partner at Romanian law firm Vlăsceanu, Nyerges and Partners, told pv magazine. “It was adopted by the parliament and sent to the Romanian president for promulgation, which should not take more than 20 days. After promulgation, it will be published in the official gazette and will enter into force three days from publication.”
The new rules allow PV, wind, biomass, bioliquid, biogas, storage projects, and transformer stations to be developed directly on extra-muros land under fertility classes III, IV, and V. Thus far, development has been prohibited on such sites. The new rules also establish that such land could be used for projects with dual uses, including power generation and agricultural activities.
Construction work has long been permissible only on sites that are registered as intra-muros, buildable land.
“Although there are specific exceptions to this rule, none of them applies to renewable energy projects,” Nyerges said. “The new law mainly paves the way for agrivoltaic projects and solves some of the permitting inconveniences faced by developers.”
For example, the approval of a zonal urbanism plan (PUZ) to change land destinations to intra-muros will no longer be necessary.
“Instead, a special procedure for changing the land category from agricultural to buildable land should be conducted,” she said. “However, such procedure is significantly shorter as compared to the PUZ, as the authorities should issue their approval within 45 days from the application date, or else the application is deemed tacitly approved.”
The new rules also set lower authorization fees for PV projects in the case of dual-system applications.
“In case a dual system is implemented, the change of land category from agricultural to buildable will no longer apply to the entire land allocated to the renewable energy project, but only to the specific portion of land which can no longer be used for agricultural purposes,” Nyerges said. “In the case of PV projects, this is highly significant as a higher pillar structure allows for agricultural activities/animal grazing underneath the panels and hence, a much lower surface of land becomes affected.”
The new law only applies to sites up to 50 hectares in size.
“This limitation may trigger a high impact on the economics of the PV projects, since high connection costs may be commercially acceptable only in case of high project capacity, which requires a big surface,” she said, noting that the new law will only apply until Dec. 31, 2026. “The idea behind the 2026 deadline was to stimulate the investments in renewable energy capacities for the duration of the current EU budget (2021-27), in order to increase the absorption rate of the available EU funds. From this perspective, after the National Recovery and Resilience Plan that was launched several months ago, the industry is eagerly waiting for the Modernization Fund that is expected, after long delays, to be accessible from this fall.”

“The thermo-acoustic technology is suitable both for residential and industrial applications,” a spokesperson from TNO told pv magazine. “However, the Blue Heart Energy solution focuses exclusively on domestic applications.”
The device measures 55 cm x 55 cm x 55 cm. It can be used in combination with rooftop solar generation.
“The thermo-acoustic heat pump is especially suitable for this given its excellent modulating capability and its temperature flexibility,” the TNO spokesperson said. “When using the thermo-acoustic heat pump in combination with PV, the energy required to drive the heat pump can be taken mainly from the PV-panels, leading to fossil-free heat generation. In the future, smart controls to optimize the efficient use of PV panels and potentially sustainable heat or cold sources are expected.”
The novel heat pump can purportedly reach higher temperatures than existing heat pumps, without the need for refrigerants. It works with two pistons that oscillate at a frequency of 100 Hz in a closed pressure vessel filled with 50 bar helium. It creates an acoustic wave that is able to displace heat from a lower temperature to a higher temperature.
This process takes place in four phases: expansion, displacement, compression, and return displacement.
“During the expansion phase, the temperature of the gas drops, and the gas in the cold heat exchanger absorbs heat,” the scientists explained. “The gas then moves through the regenerator to the warm heat exchanger. Here, the gas is compressed, the temperature rises, and the heat previously absorbed is released into the warm heat exchanger. Finally, the gas moves back, and the cycle is complete.”
They are currently testing the heat pump in an advanced climate chamber in Delft, the Netherlands.
“‘The climate chamber enables us to mimic reality very closely, so performance in the laboratory can give us a good idea of how the device will perform in people’s homes in the future,” they said. “Not only under the static conditions that relate to the standards, but also under dynamic conditions with changing temperatures which come much closer to real-life conditions. In the climate chamber, we can simulate a cold winter’s day, for example, or we can recreate all four seasons in quick succession.”
Blue Heart Energy plans to test the first devices in real houses in 2023.
“There are no moving parts other than the two oscillators, and the device has a service life of more than 15 years,” the research group said.

“It’s a completely passive system – it doesn’t need energy to track the source or have any moving parts,” said research coordinator Nina Vaidya. “Without optical focus that moves positions or need for tracking systems, concentrating light becomes much simpler.”
The AGILE (Axially Graded Index LEns) device purportedly harvests more than 90% of the light that hits its surface. It also creates spots at the output that are three times brighter than the incoming light.
“Installed in a layer on top of solar cells, they could make solar arrays more efficient and capture not only direct sunlight, but also diffuse light that has been scattered by the Earth’s atmosphere, weather, and seasons,” the scientists explained, noting that the solar cell could be built with fewer raw materials and at lower costs.
They said a top layer of the concentrator could be used to replace existing encapsulation materials. That would in turn create space for cooling and circuitry to run between the narrowing pyramids of the individual devices. The pyramid was made of different optical glass flats provided by Japan's Ohara Corp.
“The geometry of the pyramid was a square of side 14.5 mm down to a square of 8.5 mm giving a concentration of three, along a total height of 8 mm with 8 glass layers, with each flat 1 mm thick,” the academics said.
They layered the glass together with polymers that bend light to different degrees. “The layers change the light’s direction in steps instead of a smooth curve,” they said. “The sides of the prototypes are mirrored, so any light going in the wrong direction is bounced back towards the output.”
The prototype can improve optical concentration by a factor of three and achieve a 90% efficiency in capturing light, they claimed in “Immersion graded index optics: theory, design, and prototypes, which was recently published in Microsystems and Nanoengineering.
“Results of the functional prototypes demonstrate that immersion graded index technology can improve the way we concentrate and couple light many fold,” the scientists said. “The AGILE has the potential to greatly improve opto-electronic systems by reducing cost, increasing efficiency, providing a scalable concentration system with built-in anti-reflection and encapsulation without the need for tracking.”

NREL researchers have reviewed more than 3,000 scientific publications on the life cycles of the most common solar and lithium-ion battery technologies. They have found that alternatives to recycling could help to build an effective circular economy for PV and battery technologies.
The review does not dismiss recycling, but it promotes other less-explored aspects of manufacturing and hardware usage. The researchers said the emphasis on recycling, while valuable, may overlook the challenges and opportunities that research into other strategies could reveal.
“If you can keep them as a working product for longer, that’s better than deconstructing it all the way down to the elements that occurs during recycling,” said Garvin Heath, senior environmental scientist at NREL. “And when a product does reach the end of its life, recycling is not the only option.”
The researchers said that designing products with fewer overall materials, especially hazardous materials, will improve their environmental impacts more than recycling can. Recycling itself is also an imperfect process, as there are currently no integrated recycling processes that can recover all the materials for either technology, and existing research has focused more on lab-scale methods, rather than commercial-scale approaches.
“People often summarize the product life cycle as ‘take, make, waste.’” Heath said. “Recycling has received a lot of attention because it addresses the waste part, but there are ways to support a circular economy in the take part and the make part, too.”

Solid-state lithium-ion batteries with lithium anodes offer higher energy densities and are safer than conventional liquid electrolyte-based Li-ion batteries. However, a long-standing challenge with solid-state batteries is the growth of lithium dendrites across the solid-state electrolyte layer, leading to the premature shorting of cells.
Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, have come up with a new interfacial engineering approach to enable fast charge-discharge rates in solid-state lithium metal batteries. They have found that nanoscopic refractory metal layers like tungsten could improve the performance of these batteries by improving dendrite growth tolerance in solid-state electrolytes. 
The team found that Li-ion currents were concentrated at the edges of the microscopic voids. The currents at these edges were around 10,000 times larger than average currents in the cell. Hence it is necessary to impede void growth to prevent dendrite growth.
To delay void growth, the researchers experimented with an ultra-thin layer of refractory metals between the lithium anode and the solid electrolyte. They noted that tungsten is an ideal candidate to impede lithium vacancy motion due to its low solubility for lithium and therefore delay void growth. They collaborated with researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to corroborate their work through computational methods. 
The team now plans to build on these advances to develop full solid-state cells that could enable charging in less than an hour, while offering up to 1,000 or more cycles at temperatures of 45 C or higher.

Günder, the Turkish PV association, said that the ministry selected two 100 MW projects and 10 projects with installed capacities of 50 MW each. The final prices for the 12 projects ranged from TRY 0.49 ($0.029)/kWh to TRY 0.597/kWh.
For the YEKA 4 procurement exercise, the ministry had set a ceiling price of TRY 0.40/kWh. In the first tranche of the solar tender, the Turkish authorities selected three 100 MW projects. The three developers offered TRY 0.375/kWh, TRY 0.39/kWh, and TRY 0.427/kWh for them.
Including both tranches, the lowest bid was TRY 0.375/kWh. The final average price was TRY0.51 ($0.031)/kWh. In the previous procurement exercise, the 1 GW YEKA 3 PV tender, the lowest bid came in at TRY 0.182/kWh.
The selected projects will receive 15-year power purchase guarantees. Domestic content requirements for equipment selection have played an important role in the tender.

Russia's war against Ukraine continues to influence fuel prices. An embargo on Russian imports, the partial suspension of gas deliveries to Europe, and a decline in trading activity are some of the challenges that electricity markets have faced in recent weeks.
The impact on the European power purchase agreement market is a reason for concern. The monthly PexaEuro index by Pexapark shows a fairly considerable increase in PPA prices. Average prices rose 4.1% month on month. France, Great Britain, and Germany showed the highest increases, at 6.9%, 4.8%, and 7.8%, respectively.
In May, there was a decrease in the number of agreements and the volumes of closed PPAs, according to Pexapark. The European Energy Exchange (EEX), the central European electricity exchange in Germany, reported a 30% year-on-year decrease in the trading volume of energy futures in Germany during the month of May.
In Spain, the decline in volumes of energy futures has fallen by 75%, mainly due to the approval of temporary restrictions on the price of gas for electricity generation. Traders have blamed low liquidity and the current price environment, which affects their ability to hedge volumes. In addition, a lack of interest from industrial consumers in signing long-term contracts has been making it difficult to place volumes on the market.
About 393 MW of PPAs were announced in May. That represented a decrease of 55% from April, but is comparable to March.
Pexapark noted that two PPAs were recently signed in Italy, which is a market with a lot of potential that has been held back by long-standing permit problems. “We continue to hope that Italy will soon have its moment to shine,” the company said.
Permits are a key problem for project development. Europe needs to install around 80 GW per year to meet the REPowerEU 2030 targets of reaching 1.2 TW of installed renewables capacity by 2030 – more than double the annual average of the last decade.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/29/new-pricing-mechanism-for-pumped-hydro-storage-in-india/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 29, 2022",New pricing mechanism for pumped-hydro storage in India,"From pv magazine India
A new report by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) recommends a differential pricing mechanism for pumped-hydro energy storage (PHES) projects in India.
The proposed pricing mechanism has different pumping and generation prices, instead of only generation-based energy charges. The report says developers can use profitable generation from the differential pricing mechanism for fixed cost recovery.
The current pricing mechanism considers PHES only as a generator that needs to recover its costs by selling power at a determined tariff to the beneficiaries/consumers. The tariff for a PHES project includes fixed costs and variable costs.
The fixed cost component, or capacity charge, is to recover the capital cost incurred on the plant every year, such as plant and machinery, manpower, and administration costs. The variable cost component, or the energy charge, is used to recover the cost incurred during the plant operation. 
However, PHES acts as both a generator and a consumer. The PHES draws power from the grid and acts as a consumer when water is pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir during off-peak hours. And it acts as a generator at the time of releasing water and generating energy. 
Therefore, the report highlights the need for developing a differential pricing mechanism for PHES during its pumping (off-peak operation) and generating mode (peak operation). The report also recommends the pricing mechanism for PHES should be based on specific use cases. The current pricing mechanism does not consider the grid flexibility aspects of PHES. The report highlights the need to develop a pricing mechanism for each specific service offered by the PHES.
Differential tariffs
The report proposes new tariff computation methods for peak load shaving and renewables smoothing. For peak load shaving, PHES can be operated in the market (such as the Indian Energy Exchange) as a merchant power plant with different pumping (off-peak rates) and generation prices (peak rates). The peak price should be 1.33 to 1.35 times the off-peak price for profit generation.
Grid-connected PHES plants that use renewables for their pumping requirements and are co-located with renewables plants enable round-the-clock support from these renewables plants. The report says incentives should be provided in such cases. The incentives could be one or a combination of the following: compensation for avoiding renewables curtailment, avoided cost from high-priced purchase of thermal or gas plants, grid flexibility incentive similar to ancillary unit plants, and generation-based incentive in the range of INR 1 ($0.01) per kilowatt-hour to attract more investment in the sector.
In addition to the above pricing mechanisms, the report recommends financing mechanisms for total PHES project cost funding. These include budgetary subsidy on viability gap funding, expense distribution (resources, assets, and investment distribution) through collaboration between local government and developer, and foreign direct investments in the PHES sector.
The report states the new pricing mechanisms will lead to higher revenue generation for PHES projects. Developers can recover the fixed costs from their revenues. PHES projects can also benefit from competitive pricing by operating in the market.

“I don't expect a major disruption because East Hope was already planning for regular maintenance, but a tangible impact was already visible in the polysilicon price increase last week,” polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter told pv magazine. “The actual impact should be a reduction in production output of around 1,500 metric tons (MT).”
This minimal output drop compares to a decline of around 21,000 MT in 2020, when three different accidents occurred at factories owned by Daqo, Xinjiang GCL, and Sichuan Yongxiang (Tongwei).
“So there is at least an order of magnitude difference between the impacts of the East Hope accident in 2022 and the three incidents combined in 2020,” Bernreuter said. “However, the latter occurred at the historically lowest price point, whereas the current situation is characterized by continuing shortage and the highest prices since October 2011. In such an environment, any disturbance increases the nervousness of market participants on the demand side and spurs further price increases.”
According to Bernreuter Research, East Hope said that the post-fire production shortfall would be limited. It reportedly expects the shutdown to last about one month.
“Polysilicon manufacturers are currently running at full speed in view of the supply shortage and high prices,” said Bernreuter Research. “That may loosen the attention to safety concerns.”
Last week, polysilicon prices reached a high of CNY 280 ($41.78)/kg in China.

State-owned General Electricity Co. of Libya (Gecol) announced plans this earlier month for France's TotalEnergies to develop a 500 MW solar field in the country. This week, Gecol said it has also signed a memorandum of understanding for Alpha Dhabi to construct and operate an initial 500 MW of 2 GW of solar in the nation.
Separately, the Emirates News Agency reported this week that the projects would have 25-year lifetimes, but it did not provide a timeline or indicate where the Alpha Dhabi solar capacity would be developed. Under the terms of the agreement, the Libyan government will purchase the solar power generated by the Alpha Dhabi sites.
Alpha Dhabi owns businesses in the fields of construction, industry, health care, and hospitality, according to its website. Gecol, meanwhile, has around 9 GW of power generating capacity, including 16 oil and gas plants. However, only 2% of its fleet is devoted to clean energy.
Libya's General National Congress envisaged 300 MW of solar by 2020 and 450 MW by 2025 under its 2013-25 strategic plan for renewables, plus concentrating solar power capacity. The nation aims to source 22% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. However, the International Renewable Energy Agency estimated that the country had just 6 MW of solar at the end of 2021, with 5 MW in place since 2012.
