The planning permission was granted to the 1 GW/2 GWh Rawhills Energy Storage facility in Coalburn, south of Glasgow, and the 500 MW/1,000 MWh Devilla Energy Storage site in Fife, north of Edinburgh.
According to Alcemi, CIP is expected to take a final investment decision for the two BESS projects later this year, with construction set to start shortly thereafter.
The two projects will support the transmission system by limiting network constraints and further enabling the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid.
“These projects will provide stability to the grid, limit network constraints, and are vital to maximising our offshore wind generation. They are a key component to ensuring renewable energy is transported across the country,” said Alcemi Development Director James Forster.
Working closely with local authorities and stakeholders, both projects have undergone extensive environmental impact assessments, according to the developers. Environmental initiatives include tree and shrub planting and the creation of new habitats, which will enhance biodiversity across the sites.
The two projects were developed in collaboration with CIP through their Flagship Funds as part of Alcemi’s 4 GW energy storage portfolio deployed at key locations across the United Kingdom. Alcemi aims to develop at least eight large-scale transmission-connected storage and network support projects across Great Britain.
Another big battery project by Alcemi, the 500 MW/1,000 MWh Coalburn 1 installation, broke ground in December, following CIP’s final investment decision. Canadian Solar is supplying 1.7 GW (DC) of e-STORAGE lithium iron phosphate batteries for the project.

Residential solar installer Sunrun has partnered with utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) to enroll solar and energy storage customers in a program called Peak Power Rewards, which compensates customers for dispatching power during times of peak demand on the grid.
Sunrun enrolled 8,500 customer systems in California, operating the assets as a distributed network that forms a power grid. Under the program, the assets delivered an average of 27 MW of power during peak hours for over 90 days consecutively.
“PG&E was able to confidently rely on the renewing daily resource of Sunrun’s fleet of home solar and storage systems,” said Mary Powell, chief executive officer, Sunrun. “We are rapidly transitioning to a storage-first company and the results of this partnership highlight the unique capability that distributed power plants provide communities.”
The distributed solar and storage assets provided an instantaneous peak output of nearly 32 MW and frequently provided up to 30 MW of power, enough for more than 20,000 homes.
Sunrun said it managed the fleet of home batteries and provided power to PG&E in the same way a traditional centralized power plant would. However, the program was operational within six months of signing the contract with the utility, a timeframe that far outpaces the development cycle of utility-scale assets.
Enrolled batteries in the Peak Power Rewards program discharged energy to the grid from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. from August through October, a time of peak electricity demand in California. Customers received an upfront payment of $750 and a free smart thermostat for participating. Sunrun said that batteries enrolled in the program retain enough energy to meet personal, essential needs in the event of a power outage.
“Solar-plus-storage plays a significant role in California’s clean energy future and we’re proud of our customers who are leading the charge with their clean energy adoption. Every day, we’re looking at new and better ways to deliver for our hometowns while ensuring safety, reliability and resiliency for our customers,” said Patti Poppe, chief executive officer of PG&E Corporation.
PG&E has the most behind-the-meter solar installations in the nation attached to its grid, with approximately 820,000 customers connected adding roughly 8 GW of capacity to the grid. The utility said nearly 75,000 PG&E customers have connected energy storage systems to its grid, representing 670 MW of capacity.
“What is happening in California will soon need to be replicated across the country,” said Powell. “Residential solar-plus-storage systems networked together as distributed power plants are answering the demand call by providing flexible, on-demand power stabilization while also guarding against increasing rates.”
Despite adding new value to customers through battery aggregation programs, residential solar installers in California have been faced with increased challenges to acquiring new customers. High interest rates have worsened the return on investment for customers, and the move toward NEM 3.0 has altered the value of exported electricity. The California Solar and Storage Association recommended policy changes to improve market conditions and revive the state’s wounded behind-the-meter solar industry.

5,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/02/best-practices-for-end-of-life-pv-management/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-02-02,Best practices for end-of-life PV management,"SolarPower Europe has published best practice guidelines for handling EoL solar panels, in a bid to ensure that solar is making a valuable contribution to the European Union’s circularity objectives. 
The report offers recommendations on how to sustainably handle EoL products and outlines how companies can comply with mandatory requirements. The scope of the legislation covered spans the utility-scale, commercial and industrial, and residential segments.
The association says guaranteeing high-quality EoL solar management is crucial for both the sustainability of the industry and public support for solar.
“Solar will be the backbone of Europe’s green transition, and this needs to come with sustainable growth,” said Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe. “This new report will support the sector in diligently managing end-of-life solar panels, and ultimately, strengthen the sector’s resilience going forward.”
With the lifespan of solar systems normally around 30 years, the report warns part of the EU’s existing solar fleet is expected to start reaching EoL in the next decade, with increasingly more waste produced as time progresses. 
Estimates suggest that when a PV panel reaches the end of its natural life, it still possesses approximately 80% of its initial power generation capacity that could be exploited.
The report says that in the next 10 to 15 years, more than 50% of the PV panels considered as “waste” could be re-used because they are still functional, as long as reuse can be done under environmentally sound, qualitative, and safe conditions.
In response, part of the report offers recommendations on how to assess potential for a “second life” or extension of a solar system’s lifespan, featuring detail on how to prepare for reuse and the factors that must be considered, such as the availability of spare parts and repair services, security updates, safety requirements and regulatory compliance, and compatibility with other devices and protocols.
When reuse and repurposing options are exhausted, recycling and takeback programs are pivotal for the responsible management of PV waste.
The report says that as more panels near their EoL, an unprecedented waste management challenge is emerging. It is projected that PV waste will account for a substantial portion, ranging from 4% to 14%, of the total electricity generation capacity by 2030 and could reach 60 million tons to 80 million tons by 2050.
The final chapter explores the role of producer responsibility organizations (PROs) in managing the responsible disposal and recycling of PV components, the challenges and obstacles faced in the pursuit of sustainable and efficient recycling processes and the recycling and take back processes of PV components.
SolarPanel Europe’s latest report follows best practice guidelines on floating PV and agrovoltaics, published by the association in 2023.

7,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/02/2023-delivers-best-year-this-century-for-irradiance/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,2024-02-02,2023 delivers best year this century for irradiance,"2023 was not only the hottest year in modern records, but was also the sunniest year so far this century, according to analysis by Solcast.
2023’s margin as the sunniest year of the century was particularly large for non-polar landmasses – the places we live, and the places
where our solar PV systems are located, as El Nino kept moisture and cloud over the Pacific Ocean, and deviations in the Arctic circulation pulled low pressure systems further north into the Arctic Ocean. Large regions were 10% or more above long term trends, including Western and Northern Europe, Eurasia, much of China, Southern Australia, the Midwestern and Southern US, Central and most of South America.
2023: Sunniest year so far this century

Analysis by Solcast reveals that for the entire planet, 2023 saw the highest total solar irradiance of any year this century, using data from Solcast and ECMWF ERA5. 2023 saw total solar irradiance near 0.5% above the long-term average – a small percentage, but equating to an increase of solar energy received of approximately 16,000 TJ.

The anomaly was 1% for combined non-polar land areas, a much larger deviation than any seen in the last 15 years. This deviation was larger than the global total, due to increased cloud formation over the oceans offsetting some of the reduced cloud formation over non-polar land areas.
Americas
The Americas saw above average irradiance, as an early El Nino created a lot of moisture and cloud over the tropical Pacific Ocean, pulling cloud away from the surrounding land areas.
In Central and South America, Brazil and neighboring countries to the north saw the highest irradiance in over 15 years, in a year marked by significant drought in the Amazon. Argentina and Chile further south saw near or slightly above average irradiance. In total, 13 countries in the Americas saw the highest irradiance year in over a decade, including Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
North America saw slightly above average irradiance in total, although the North-West and North-East United States both saw cloudier than average conditions. In the North-East conditions will also have been impacted by aerosols, from the Canadian wildfires that burned
for much of the year.
In the US this was offset by large areas of above average irradiance in the Mid-West and South. This was good news for solar production in Texas, which had another record year of solar capacity installations and generation according to the SEIA.
Africa, Europe and the Middle East
Western Europe and Northern Europe saw well above average irradiance, due to Arctic circulations contracting north, reducing the intensity of associated cloud from low pressure systems. Estonia saw the sunniest year they have seen in over 10 years. Whilst these patterns delivered several large and intense storms, cloud cover was lower than average.
Eastern Europe and the Middle East saw below average irradiance as moisture from both the Eastern Mediterranean and Indian Ocean was pushed onshore. Much of Africa saw a relatively normal year for irradiance, with only small deviations relative to average. Despite small deviations, Tunisia, Liberia, Eritrea, Kenya, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Rwanda saw more irradiance in 2023 than they have for any other year in the last decade.

Asia
China saw above average irradiance, with some areas seeing 110% of long term averages, although this was less intense towards the coast. Japan saw the highest national average irradiance in over a decade, especially along the eastern coast near Tokyo, as anomalous westerly winds kept Pacific moisture offshore.
A positive Indian Ocean Dipole contributed to overall below average irradiance across most of India, although the south-western Indian states saw above average irradiance. Across Asia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Bhutan, and Japan saw higher irradiance than the last 10 years.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This information is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets throughout the world.

The total represents 32% of Growthpoint’s total current annual electricity consumption and will be used across its commercial property buildings in several jurisdictions across the country.
The deal is billed as South Africa’s first multi-jurisdiction, multi-building, multi-source renewable energy wheeling arrangement, and will enable Growthpoint’s tenants to access green energy. The duration and financial terms of the PPA were not disclosed.
Etana will cover 70% of the power consumed by Growthpoint’s participating buildings, and in some buildings, provide tenants with the ability to purchase 100% renewable energy. The wheeled renewable energy will mainly consist of wind, with a smaller component of hydro and large-scale solar capacities.
Growthpoint will have exclusive rights to purchase all of the roughly 30 GWh that will be generated annually by a 5 MW hydroelectric power plant developed, owned and operated by Serengeti Energy.
The plant is located on the Ash River within the Lesotho Highlands Water Scheme, close to Clarens in South Africa's Free State. The hydroelectric power plant has reached financial close and is currently under construction. It is expected to be operational by July 2025, when it will supply its first electricity to Growthpoint.
“Business has a clear role to play in solving our biggest challenges, and this is a highly replicable, scalable example of how to achieve this while creating value for all involved,” said Reyburn Hendricks, director of Etana Energy. 
Hybrid projects in South Africa are gaining ground. In August 2023, the government announced it had awarded project agreements to two wind-and-solar-storage hybrid facilities as part of its Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (RMIPPPP). The facilities are estimated to generate 203 MW of combined energy.
South Africa recorded 5.8 GW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Olsen 1848 deploys floating PV pilot in Norway,"Norwegian green energy supplier Fred. Olsen 1848 has deployed a 124 kW pilot project of floating PV at sea.
Located in Risør, Norway, the 50×50 metre floating array will be commissioned during spring.
The pilot serves as a testing ground for refining Fred. Olsen 1848’s floating solar solution, Brizo. 
The technology is designed to follow the motion of the ocean and withstand ocean environments. It features floating solar modules that can move individually within a pre-tensioned rope mesh.
Fred. Olsen 1848 says the design not only enables the efficient harnessing of solar energy but also uniquely addresses the challenges posed by wave and wind loads.
The company adds Brizo will now transition to a next phase, focused on foundational design work, to facilitate the development of a 3 MW first unit project tailored for commercial application.
“The process of installing BRIZO in Risør, Norway has gone as expected with a successful outcome,” said Geir Grimsrud, CTO of Fred. Olsen 1848.
Figures from Norwegian authorities show that the country deployed 300 MW of solar in 2023, taking its cumulative installed PV capacity to 597 MW.
In December, a report by SolarPower Europe claimed a global floating solar potential of 3 TW to 7 TW, while IEA-PVPS analysts have estimated a cumulative capacity of 60 GW by 2030.

The researchers described their findings in “Exploration of Solution-Processed Bi/Sb Solar Cells by Automated Robotic Experiments Equipped with Microwave Conductivity,” which was recently published in JACS Au. They said the robot can perform photoabsorption (PA) and photoluminescence (PL)  spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and white-light flash time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) tests.
“Current solar cells are made of inorganic semiconductors containing silicon and gallium, but next-generation solar cells need to reduce both cost and weight,” said researcher Chisato Nishikawa. “However, the wide range of elements and process parameters impede the rapid exploration of vast chemical spaces.”
The robotic system is controlled by in-house software. It includes a handling robot, PA and PL spectrometers, TRMC optics and electronics, an optical microscope, and a sample cartridge.
“The TRMC comprised an Xe-flash lamp, a signal generator, a resonant cavity at around 9 GHz, a microwave circuit, a pulse generator, and an oscilloscope,” the scientists said.
The results are automatically analyzed through the creation of an optical microscopic image.
“In recent years, machine learning has been very helpful in better understanding the properties of materials,” said researcher Akinori Saeki. “These studies require vast amounts of experimental data, and combining automated experiments with machine-learning techniques is an ideal solution.”
The research team said a typical cycle of measurements takes five minutes. To verify the accuracy of the new robot, the TRMC transients were measured 50 times over the identical sample. That process reportedly showed high reproducibility, with a standard deviation of 1.99% for the photoconductivity maximum.
Rhe academics used the robot to evaluate different thin-film semiconductor samples.
“We tested 576 films of quaternary element-blended wide-bandgap Cs−Bi−Sb−I semiconductors with various compositions, organic salt additives (MACl, FACl, MAI, and FAI, where MA and FA represent methylammonium and formamidinium, respectively), and thermal annealing temperatures,” they explained.
Among all tested films, the robot found the maximum power conversion efficiency to be 2.36% with a composed ratio of 1:0.5:0.5. The related photovoltaic material was created with MACl organic salt additives and thermal annealing at 200 C. Compared to a reference film without the additive, the efficiency was 0.68% higher.
“The unique automated robotic experiments and findings presented in this study will benefit scientific research on PV materials by accelerating the discovery process,” the research group concluded.

The team selected ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C, and used it as a passivation layer between a zinc oxide (ZnO) electron transport layer (ETL) and the photoactive layer of in NFA OPV cells fabricated with an inverted device layer stack and a semiconducting polymer (PBDB-T:IT-4F).
The scientists built the cell with an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, the ZnO ETL, the vitamin C layer, the PBDB-T:IT-4F absorber, a molybdenum oxide (MoOx) carrier-selective layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The group found that the ascorbic acid produces a  photostabilizing effect, reporting that antioxidant activity alleviates the degradative processes arising from exposure to oxygen, light and heat. Tests, such as ultraviolet-visible absorption, impedance spectroscopy, light-dependent voltage and current measurements, also revealed that vitamin C reduces the photobleaching of NFA molecules and suppresses the charge recombination, noted the research.
Their analysis showed that, after 96 h of continuous photodegradation under 1 Sun, the encapsulated devices containing the vitamin C interlayer retained 62% of their original value, with the reference devices retaining only 36%.
The results also showed that the stability gains did not come at a cost of efficiency. The champion device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.97 %, an open-circuit voltage of 0.69 V, a short-circuit current density of 21.57 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 66%. The reference devices containing no vitamin C, exhibited 9.85 % efficiency, an open-circuit voltage of 0.68V, a short-circuit current of 21.02 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of  68%.
When asked about commercialization potential and scalability, Vida Engmann who heads a group at the Center for Advanced Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Energy Devices (SDU CAPE), told pv magazine, “Our devices in this experiment were 2.8 mm2 and 6.6 mm2, but can be scaled up in our roll-to-roll lab at SDU CAPE where we regularly fabricate OPV modules too.”
She emphasized that the manufacturing method can be scaled, pointing out that the interfacial layer is an “inexpensive compound that is soluble in usual solvents, so it can be used in a roll-to-roll coating process like the rest of the layers” in an OPV cell.
Engmann sees potential for additives beyond OPV in other third-generation cell technologies, such as perovskite solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). “Other organic/hybrid semiconductor-based technologies, such as DSSC and perovskite solar cells, have similar stability issues as organic solar cells, so there is a good chance they can contribute to solving stability problems in these technologies as well,” she stated.
The cell was presented in the paper “Vitamin C for Photo-Stable Non-fullerene-acceptor-Based Organic Solar Cells,” published in ACS Applied Material Interfaces. The first author of the paper is SDU CAPE's Sambathkumar Balasubramanian. The team included researchers from SDU and Rey Juan Carlos University.
Looking ahead the team has plans for further research into stabilization approaches using naturally occurring antioxidants. “In the future, we are going to continue investigating in this direction,” said Engmann referring to promising research on a new class of antioxidants.

13,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/02/fluence-expands-storage-strategy-with-optimization-software/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-02-02,Fluence expands storage strategy with optimization software,"From pv magazine Australia
Australia is experiencing one of the most rapid shifts toward clean energy in the world and global energy storage provider Fluence aims to support the next frontier of the battery-based energy storage scale-up the country will need.
Fluence President and Chief Executive Officer Julian Nebreda said energy storage technology providers and developers in Australia have navigated significant challenges, including increasingly complex grid connection requirements, to kick-start a new industry.
Having played a key role in that development, Fluence is now looking beyond hardware, offering renewable energy and storage asset owners optimisation software that maximises asset performance and servicing.
“We are continuously scouting for innovations that can create value for our existing customers and open up new segments for energy storage,” he said. “Customers are exploring new revenue streams like network support contracts, creative offtake structures, and cycling strategies, as well as performance guarantees to support these.”
Nebreda said tools like the Mosaic automated bidding software and the cloud-based Nispera asset performance management software platform are helping asset owners improve bidding strategies and operations.
“These solutions drive value and allow owners and operators to maximise revenue,” he said.
Fluence has an extensive track record and robust pipeline in Australia. The company deployed its first asset here, a 30 MW/30 MWh system near Ballarat, Victoria, in 2018. It now has 1,030 MW/1,830 MWh of projects operating or under construction in Australia. The most recent is the 300 MW/650 MWh Mortlake Power Station Battery being developed by Origin Energy in Victoria.
Nebreda said Australia remains one of the key markets for Fluence globally, noting that while it is “challenging and fast-moving,” the market fundamentals for battery-based energy storage are increasingly strong.
“Australia is experiencing one of the most rapid shifts towards clean energy worldwide, especially due to the need to replace its aging fleet of coal-fired power plants and its privileged abundant renewable resources,” he said. “With one of the longest and stringiest grids, addressing major stability issues is crucial. Large-scale energy storage deployment helps make this energy transition smoother, more cost-efficient, and reliable.”
Utility-scale energy storage has emerged as a linchpin of a modern, sustainable, and resilient power grid and Nebreda said it will be “absolutely critical” following the agreement reached at the recent COP28 meeting to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030.
“The only proven and economic way to incorporate that level of intermittent energy is to utilise utility-scale energy storage systems to enable this large percentage of renewable energy to be integrated onto the power grid,” he said.
Lithium-ion technology currently dominates the utility-scale storage industry and Nebreda expects that to continue but said the company remains open to new technologies and developments.
“These innovations can take many forms, such as extensions to existing lithium-ion batteries, the connected ‘digital battery,’ and even novel non-lithium-based battery chemistries, such as sodium-ion,” he said.
Nebreda said battery technology will continue to improve, including in performance, costs, ease of deployment, and potentially new architectures but he expects the main advancements will come via improvements in lithium-ion based systems.
“This will allow for greater flexibility in how the batteries are operated to maximise the benefit for the grid, such as degradation curves based on the actual operation of the battery system,” he said, noting that the technology is currently the most cost-effective solution that provides the most value to its customers.

14,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/02/four-key-takeaways-from-sunrise-arabia-conference/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SAUDI ARABIA",MARK HUTCHINS,2024-02-02,Key takeaways from SunRise Arabia conference,"Saudi Arabia has long been known as a region with some serious solar potential, and over the past few years it has begun to take bigger steps toward realizing this. The SunRise Arabia event in Riyadh this week revealed the expectation that PV installations will continue to grow at an impressive rate in the years to 2030, and likely beyond that as well.
Speakers in the opening sessions of the conference noted that the Kingdom now has close to 8 GW of renewable energy capacity connected to its grids, and is demonstrating an appetite for a whole lot more before 2030.
Several large-scale projects have been completed, and more are on the way. Moneef Barakat, CEO of Solarabic, noted that international players have been encouraged to enter this segment by a tender mechanism that ensures stable demand, and allows them to start building quickly, with the issuing authority taking care of land acquisition and much of the other pre-development work.
There is also a nascent market for commercial and industrial (C&I) solar projects, with experts forecasting major growth beginning later in this decade. Many of those C&I project developers were in attendance at SunRise Arabia, looking to meet component suppliers and other industry players. Ahead of the event, Marcus Schrauf, CEO of developer FAS Renewables, told pv magazine that he sees no other market in the world that is likely to match the potential of Saudi Arabia.
During discussions it also became clear that while the authorities in the Kingdom are keen to embrace solar as a major component of the energy mix, there are a few things still missing on the policy side. In particular, a net metering policy would help the C&I market to grow. Schrauf and other speakers warned that without a policy to remunerate PV system owners for power fed back into the grid, the market will be highly restricted, with fewer customers and much smaller system sizes. The removal of the current requirement that PV systems may only cover 15% of the total load on a transformer could also help to boost demand.
Residential PV in Saudi Arabia has so far seen very little development, but it was suggested that schemes such as low-cost financing for rooftop systems could help to stimulate demand here.
Elsewhere, speakers noted that low prices for fossil fuels still present a challenge to renewable energy in the region, and that the approval process for new projects also takes a long time. However, some speakers said that regulatory improvements have begun to happen, and there is plenty of optimism here.
The second session of the day focused on PV technologies and revealed that the debate between n-type technologies is still very much on – with both tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and heterojunction (HJT) promising strong performance in the hot, high-irradiance environments of the Middle East.
Some questions remain over the ability of PV modules to handle this very harsh environment, with talk of new encapsulation strategies and anti-dust coatings promising solutions. A key measure here will be for the Kingdom and the wider region to develop its own quality assurance landscape – something that local players are working on, having formed the GCC Lab organization in partnership with UL. As Saudi Arabia both imports modules in large numbers, and works to establish its own manufacturing industry, quality assurance as well as new testing standards focused on simulating the desert environment will be key to ensuring that products are up to the task.
With local content requirements already in place – and a successful industry producing cables, glass (though so far little solar glass), and other components – there is huge ambition on show for the Kingdom to build its own manufacturing industry, beginning with polysilicon.
Representatives from several of the largest PV manufacturers – including JinkoSolar, Trina Solar, Longi and Risen – all spoke of intent and enthusiasm to meet with local partners and work to establish a local PV supply chain, although so far there seem to be few commitments. These players also warned of the dangers of jumping into such a market without proper preparations, particularly in the current global environment of oversupply and low prices. They said that incentives, as well as guaranteed demand, will likely be needed.
In addition, the conference revealed how Saudi Arabia is already at work developing the engineering expertise and other skills that establishing such a local industry would require. Majid Refae shared details of the recently founded Saudi Polytechnic for Renewable Energy, which is working with industry to establish appropriate training and education programs to develop this workforce.
The final session of the day focused on technologies other than PV – chiefly energy storage, green hydrogen and concentrating solar power (CSP).
On the battery side, it was noted that the flagship Neom project is already bringing large-scale energy storage to the Kingdom. Beyond this, though, low energy prices make the development of big batteries a challenge. But Kris Ignaciuk of Apricum, who moderated this session, said that “pure PV will soon be a thing of the past.” He argued that with so much large-scale PV planned, batteries will soon be a necessity to consider.
It was also noted that many regions and industrial sites in the Kingdom rely on diesel-powered microgrids for much of their energy, creating a clear opportunity for PV and battery-powered systems to step in.
Like many other parts of the world, Saudi Arabia is showing huge ambition to be a key player in a future green hydrogen economy. Although it is not yet clear how, or even if, this economy will develop, the Kingdom’s existing expertise and infrastructure for oil and gas will likely create a good starting point.

15,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/02/wafer-prices-stable-ahead-of-chinese-new-year-festivities/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,2024-02-02,Wafer prices stable ahead of Chinese New Year festivities,"Wafer FOB China prices have stayed consistent for the third consecutive week due to a lack of significant changes in the market fundamentals. Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafer prices remain steady at $0.246 per piece (pc) and $0.357/pc, respectively.

Cell manufacturers who intend to keep up production throughout the Chinese New Year break have started to accumulate raw materials, which has increased the volume of wafers traded. The amount of wafers produced and in stock is adequate to meet downstream demand, momentarily dashing wafer makers' expectations of additional price increases.
Divergent views exist regarding the near-term outlook for wafer prices in the marketplace. According to a market observer, polysilicon companies appear to be banding together to drive up polysilicon prices perhaps as a result of the relative scarcity of N-type polysilicon. This foundation may lead to an increase in wafer pricing, the source said, adding that wafer makers may boost prices even if demand does not recover in the near future because of manufacturing cost considerations.
On the other hand, a downstream market participant believes that there aren't enough fundamental prerequisites for price hikes in the supply chain market as a whole due to the oversupply of upstream materials. The polysilicon production output in January is expected to be equivalent to about 70 GW of downstream products, significantly greater than the module's January production output of roughly 40 GW, according to this source.
OPIS learned that only the major cell producers will continue regular production throughout the Chinese New Year break, with nearly half of the existing cell capacity in the market suspending production during the holiday.
The wafer segment is expected to reduce plant operating rates during Chinese New Year but is less evident as compared to the cell segment, resulting in higher wafer inventories in February that may exert downward pressure on wafer pricing in the coming weeks.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
