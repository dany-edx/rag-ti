The transmission system operator said that repurposing existing natural gas pipelines for the hydrogen network will be a cost-effective and rapid approach. The privately financed project has support from the German government through various programs, including subsidies to expedite planning procedures.
Tree Energy Solutions has presented the $4 billion Projet Mauricie in Canada, featuring an electrolyzer and 1 GW of renewable energy assets. The Belgian startup said that, upon commissioning in 2028, the project will produce 70,000 tons of green hydrogen exclusively for end users in Quebec. Approximately one-third of the green hydrogen will target long-haul transportation, with the rest to be used for electric renewable natural gas (e-NG) production.
H-TEC has delivered a 1 MW PEM electrolyzer to Hydrogen Lab Bremerhaven (HLB), a Fraunhofer Institute research project in Germany. The electrolyzer is part of a test field focusing on wind energy for hydrogen production. The test infrastructure at HLB allows scientists to explore the interaction between wind turbines and electrolyzers under real-life conditions. It said that PEM electrolysis is selected for its adaptability to fluctuating energy sources like wind energy.

Shandong, Henan, and Hebei were the provinces with the highest share of residential PV systems.
Flat Glass said this week that it will invest around $290 million to build two solar glass production lines, with a total capacity of 3,200 tons per day, in Java, Indonesia. The Shanghai-listed solar glass manufacturer did not reveal specific details about the project.
Canadian Solar shipped 8.3 GW of modules in the third quarter, up 39% from last year, contributing to $1.85 billion of revenue. The company is investing in TOPCon cell production, with plans for a 5 GW solar cell plant in the US state of Indiana, a 5 GW solar wafer project in Thailand, and a 5 GW solar module facility in Texas. Its top five markets based on shipments were China, the United States, Brazil, Spain, and Germany.
China Power Construction has started building a 1,170 MW solar plant at an altitude of 3,200 to 4,200 meters above sea level in Liangshan, Sichuan province. The PV facility is part of a broader hybrid hydroelectric solar project.

France-based Armor Group said it has acquired a 20% stake in French solar module maker HoloSolis.
In 2025, HoloSolis plans to open a TOPCon PV cell and panel factory in Hambach, France. At full capacity from 2027, the factory is expected to employ 1,700 people and produce 10 million modules per year, for a total capacity of 5 GW per year. HoloSolis is also working on the next generation of solar panels and the perovskite-silicon tandem cells.
“After the construction of our new factory for battery components near Nantes, HoloSolis' project is an additional building block of our action in the service of restoring our energy sovereignty and generating non-relocatable jobs, two principles that we have defended for many years,” said Hubert de Boisredon, chairman and CEO of Armor Group.
A week ago, Armor Group sold Asca GmbH’s organic solar panel manufacturing facilities in Kitzingen, Germany, to Hering Group for an unspecified sum. According to an Armor Group press release from June 2023, Acsa GmbH was a “largely loss-making” business.
“After having focused our efforts for several years on organic photovoltaics (OPV), which has proven to be a very promising but still immature technology, we have decided to direct our efforts towards new tandem-perovskite cells on silicon,” said De Boisredon.
Last week, German silver metallization paste maker Heraeus also acquired an unspecified stake in HoloSolis.
Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (ISE) recently said that it will support HoloSolis in setting up a planned manufacturing facility.
HoloSolis was founded by three European entities: EIT Innoenergy, a clean-tech investor based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands and financed by the EU; IDEC Group, a real estate developer in France; and TSE, a prominent solar energy producer in France and a leader in agrivoltaics.

Portugal's Prosecutor's General Office (PGO) reportedly said on Sunday that the transcribed wiretaps implicating the country's Prime Minister, Antonio Costa, in a corruption scandal were incorrect. The transcripts are reported to have named the Minister of Economy, António Costa Silva.
The announcement came five days after Costa resigned as prime minister. He asserted his innocence in the televised address.
PGO said in a statement it was investigating alleged crimes of “malfeasance, corruption, and influence peddling” in certain lithium and hydrogen projects.
This includes companies allegedly receiving exploration concessions while operating Spanish mines, such as the Romano, Montalegre, Borroso and Boticas sites. The probe is also exploring a project related to a hydrogen energy production facility in Sines, as well as a mega-data Start Campus center.
Portuguese newspaper Público reported that Diogo Lacerda Machado, a legal expert also arrested as part of last week's raids, informed the Public Ministry about the lapse, which has been recognized.
Investigating judge Nuno Dias Costa on Monday released five people arrested as part of the investigation.
The remaining detainees – Nuno Mascarenhas, the mayor of Sines, and two administrators of the Start Campus company, Rui de Oliveira Neves and Alfonso Salema – are not linked to the corruption case but are linked to alleged influence peddling, he said.
The Portuguese government published a statement on Sunday saying the investigation's commencement was due to a Code of Criminal Procedure attributing special jurisdiction to the prime minister.
“The procedures carried out within the framework of the operation carried out this week and the evidentiary material collected within its framework, including the documentary and digital compilation, require an exhaustive analysis,” the government said. “Without neglecting these requirements, the investigations will continue with the necessary diligence and speed, with the aim of closing them as soon as possible.”
A snap election has been called for Mar. 10 2024 due to Costa's resignation.
Meanwhile, Portuguese Minister of Infrastructure, João Galamba, resigned this week after “deep personal and family reflection” at the discretion of his loved ones.

The new program will only fund systems up to 4.16 kW of PV capacity per household and the participating households will need to pay the investment back via €150 installments, payable to their power supplier every two months through their electricity bills.
Papanastasiou stated that a household consuming an average of 825 kWh every two months currently pays around €280 for electricity. However, with a 3 kW PV system installed, the cost can drop to €195 every two months, reaching as low as €45 every two months after the installation payback period of about three to four years.
The new program for the installation of residential photovoltaics comes at a time when electricity consumers are complaining about the escalating costs of powering their homes. However, there is no alternative option because the country’s retail electricity market is not open to alternative suppliers. The lack of competition means prices remain high.
About a decade ago, Cyprus promised the European Union to open its wholesale and retail electricity markets to competition. However, the opening of the retail market to independent producers has yet to happen, allowing the incumbent utility to dominate the retail market and the electricity consumers to suffer the economic consequences.
On the wholesale market front, things are slightly better. Given the lack of a competitive wholesale market, the government decided in 2017 to establish a transitional wholesale regime, which allows independent generators to sell power to large business and industry consumers only. Today, there are several independent generators who use photovoltaics to power large businesses and the industry at cheaper prices.
Cyprus urgently needs to implement the new, competitive electricity market structure it has promised the European Union. In doing so, the country will install greater amounts of solar than it would through its subsidy schemes.

In the week of Nov. 6 changes in solar energy production in the main European electricity markets did not follow a homogeneous trend compared to the previous week. Solar energy production increased by 37% in Spain, 19% in France and 12% in Portugal. The Italian and German markets did the opposite and solar energy production fell by 7.7% and 1.7%, respectively.
It is expected solar energy production will increase in Spain and Italy for the week of Nov. 13, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s solar energy production forecasts.


Wind energy production in the main European electricity markets decreased week‑on‑week during the week of Nov. 6. This was after reaching very high levels at the end of October and the beginning of November. The Italian market registered the largest drop of 35% followed by the Portuguese market with 34%. The German market registered the smallest decline of 9.9% but the country's wind energy generated 897 GWh on Nov. 6 – the highest volume since mid‑March.
For the week of Nov. 13, AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts indicate that wind energy production will continue to decline in most of the analyzed markets except for Italy.

Electricity demand
In the week of Nov. 6 electricity demand increased in the main European electricity markets compared to the previous week. This was partly due to demand recovering after the previous week’s falls related to the celebration of All Saints’ Day in most of Europe. Increases ranged from 3.6% in the Dutch market to 12% in the French market.
During the same period, average temperatures decreased in all analyzed markets compared to the previous week. The decreases ranged from 3.1 C in Italy to 1.0 C in Portugal.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts, in the week of Nov. 13, electricity demand will increase in most of the analyzed markets. Only the French, German and Spanish markets will register lower demand.

In the week of Nov. 6 prices in the main European electricity markets showed an upward trend compared to the previous week. The MIBEL market of Spain and Portugal reached the highest price rises, 148% and 161%, respectively. In contrast, the N2EX market of the United Kingdom registered the smallest increase of 8.1%. Elsewhere, prices rose between 27% in the IPEX market of Italy and 69% in the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries.
In the second week of November, weekly averages were below €100/MWh in most of the European electricity markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting. The exceptions were the British and Italian markets, where the averages were €107.11/MWh and €121.54/MWh, respectively. For the third consecutive week, the Portuguese and Spanish markets registered the lowest average prices, €56.90/MWh and €57.11/MWh, respectively. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €72.56/MWh in the Nordic market to €95.54/MWh in the EPEX SPOT market of the Netherlands.
Despite the rise in the weekly average in the second week of November, the MIBEL market registered 36 hours with prices below €10/MWh on Nov. 6, 11 and 12. From 18:00 to 19:00 on Tuesday, Nov. 7, the Nordic market reached the highest price since the beginning of April with €149.86/MWh.
During the week of Nov. 6, the increase in demand and the fall in wind energy production in Europe caused electricity market prices to spike.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the third week of November prices in most European electricity markets might continue to rise. Declining wind energy production will contribute to this behavior.

On Monday, Nov. 6, Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market registered their weekly maximum settlement price, $85.18/bbl. This price was already 2.6% lower than the previous Monday. Prices declined on Tuesday and Wednesday to reach the weekly minimum settlement price, $79.54/bbl, on Wednesday, Nov. 8. This price was 6.0% lower than the previous Wednesday and the lowest since July. In the last sessions of the week, prices increased again. The settlement price on Friday, Nov. 10 was $81.43/bbl. This was 4.1% lower than the previous Friday.
Concerns about demand evolution in the United States and China exerted their downward influence on Brent oil futures prices in the second week of November. In addition, fears of supply problems related to instability in the Middle East diminished, reducing their upward influence on prices. But, Iraq’s support for OPEC+ production cuts pushed prices higher at the end of the second week of November.
According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, settlement prices of TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month were below €50/MWh in the second week of November. On Monday, Nov. 6, they registered the weekly minimum settlement price, €44.83/MWh. This price was 11% lower than the previous Monday. On the other hand, on Thursday, Nov. 9, they reached the weekly maximum settlement price, €48.13 /MWh. This price was still 0.9% lower than the previous Thursday.
During the second week of Nov. high levels of European reserves and abundant supplies of liquefied natural gas kept prices below €50/MWh. In addition, Israel ordered the reopening of the Tamar field and supplies to Egypt from this country increased. On the other hand, Bulgaria’s new tax on Russian gas might exert its influence on price evolution in the coming days.
As for the settlement prices of CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, at the beginning of the second week of November they continued the declines that began at the end of the previous week. As a result, the settlement price on Tuesday, Nov. 7, €75.25/t, was the weekly minimum. This price was 4.8% lower than the one on the same day of the previous week. It was also the lowest since the settlement prices of some November 2022 sessions for the reference contract of December 2022. But, in the last three sessions of the week, prices increased. On Friday, Nov. 10, these futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €78.70/t. This price was 1.4% higher than the one on the same day of the previous week.

AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s analysis is based on the potential for energy markets in Europe and the financing and valuation of renewable energy projects.

A Swiss scientist claims that redox flow batteries offer an alternative to lithium-ion batteries, as they do not use rare earths and toxic materials. However, they face challenges due to low energy density and limited market share.
David Robber, a researcher from Switzerland’s Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA), seeks to address this issue by enlarging the electrochemical cells of batteries for faster charging and discharging, while also developing larger tanks for higher storage capacity.
“Flow batteries have an energy density around ten times lower than batteries made of solid storage materials,” he said, noting that the more storage material that can be dissolved in the electrolyte, the higher the energy density of a flow battery. “However, high concentrations thicken the solution, and you need a lot more energy to pump it through the cell.”
Robber wants to develop a hybrid between a flow battery and a lithium-ion battery by embedding solid storage materials in the tank of the flow battery.
“If the dissolved material and the solid storage material are precisely matched, they can transfer energy between each other,” he said. “This allows the scalability of flow batteries to be combined with the high energy density of batteries with solid storage materials.”
Reber acknowledged he will first have to identify suitable materials that would ideally work stably for the storage tanks over an operating period of 20 years. He also mentioned chelate as a possible candidate for the dissolved storage material and described it as a multi-armed organic molecule that “wraps” around a metal ion. “Depending on how many arms the organic molecule – the ligand – has, the redox potential changes,” he said.
Reber said he doesn't have to start from scratch for the project, as during his postdoctoral period at the University of Colorado, he researched a chelate-based redox flow battery.
At the end of his Swiss research project, which is scheduled to last four years, Reber wants to have a well-functioning battery with additional solid storage. “If this approach works, the potential applications are very diverse,” he stated. “All it would take would be pumps and a few pipes.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/14/the-overproduction-conundrum/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 14, 2023",The overproduction conundrum,"From pv magazine 11/23
Despite 2023 thus far demonstrating that end demand in the PV market continues to be strong, spot prices per watt have been anything but. The first half of this year has shown what the consequences can be when supply and demand fall out of balance.
For many years, Exawatt’s production estimates across the PV supply chain have sat broadly within 10% of our global PV installation estimates. This began to change in 2021, when we saw production begin to pull ahead of installations by about 15%. In 2022, the gap grew significantly, to between 30% and 40% for wafers, cells, and modules.
Overproduction didn’t end in 2022. In 2023, comparing the initial production targets announced by manufacturers and Exawatt’s own installations forecast revealed that overproduction not only continued but was on course to increase.
It’s safe to say that the growing gap between production and installations has not been a reflection of weak end demand. Exawatt currently expects global PV installations to exceed 400 GW in 2023, an increase of approximately 60% compared with 2022 figures. Rather, the growing gap between production and installation is a consequence of the exceptional speed at which production has increased, even when compared to hugely impressive installation growth.
Based on our discussions with other PV industry analysts, we believe our figures, that suggest unsustainable levels of overproduction, are not unique. The same trend has also been observed by many of our peers. This leads us to question whether manufacturers’ initial production targets will prove to have been excessively optimistic.
When production levels significantly exceeded installations in 2022 and the first half of 2023, inventories built up throughout the supply chain, leading to an inevitable price crash. In the first half of 2023, spot prices, from wafers to modules, dropped to record lows, with polysilicon prices also taking a substantial hit. This has left limited room for further price declines. Any lower, and even the lowest-cost manufacturers will struggle to turn a profit.

In an attempt to avoid further inventory build-up across the supply chain, some manufacturers scaled back their production plans for 2023. This trend, combined with continued strong end-demand growth, and bolstered by the number of installations in China exceeding expectations, leads Exawatt to project that overproduction in 2023 will likely fall back to within a 20% to 30% range for wafers, cells, and modules.
As a result of the scaling back of production, we believe that current challenges around high inventory levels should prove to be temporary, with production volumes in the second half of 2023 somewhat dependent on how quickly inventory levels can be reduced. Note that we expect that when manufacturers release final production numbers for 2023, our final estimates for wafers, cells, and modules will converge somewhat.
Despite hitting levels higher than those seen before 2022, continued overproduction within the 20% to 30% range might not be so unreasonable in a rapidly growing market – especially when accounting for the delay between production and installation. To put this into perspective, Exawatt estimates the compound annual growth rate in PV installations to have been in the region of 25% in the 10-year period to 2023.
Although overproduction looks likely to return to a more stable level this year, substantial overcapacity seems set to remain throughout the supply chain. Existing major players and new, smaller entrants to the market continue to announce ambitious capacity expansion plans. With these plans far outstripping even the most optimistic forecasts for end demand, substantial overcapacity is unlikely to diminish over the coming years, making unsustainable levels of overproduction an ongoing risk. In 2022, annual module capacity stood at approximately 2.8 times greater than installations. Exawatt’s forecast, based on the expansion plans that have been announced so far, sees manufacturing capacity increasing to nearly four times that of forecast installations by 2025, assuming all announced capacity expansions come to fruition.
Taking a longer-term view, in Exawatt’s high-case scenario, we currently forecast that 1 TW of annual solar installations will be achieved shortly before 2030. Beyond this, a number of possible net-zero scenarios can be achieved with different energy generation mixes, and in most scenarios we model solar demand flattening off in the 2030s.
No matter what route is taken to decarbonization, solar will be key. The industry is well on track to deliver what is necessary, from a manufacturing point of view. Within just a couple of years, manufacturers will be capable of delivering production of the scale required in the 2030s onwards. Unless new capacity is replacing obsolete manufacturing lines, further capacity expansions will only exacerbate the overcapacity that already exists.

The researchers have assessed two kinds of communities – one in which prosumers share the surplus energy created on their own rooftops, and another in which consumers share the energy generated by collectively owned PV.
“Given the increasing interest in energy communities throughout Europe, we assessed how the regulated electricity charges, energy prices, solar potential and the energy sharing arrangement affect the benefits and cost savings due to energy sharing,” Professor Vladimir Gjorgievski told pv magazine. “While much of the literature on energy sharing has focused on internal rules, there has been less attention paid to the role of external factors. This study aims to address this gap.”
The researchers looked into the impact that the exemption of regulated charges could have on two energy community types across 39 European countries. They found that communities relying on collectively owned PV systems achieve higher savings.
The research group used SARAH-2 solar irradiation data to account for the different PV generation capabilities among communities. They incorporated average household electricity prices from the Eurostat database for 2021. The analysis was conducted under optimistic scenario (OS) conditions, assuming all potential exemptions, and pessimistic scenario (PS), assuming none.
Community energy sharing among prosumers resulted in an average 3.8% lower bill than in scenarios without PV, across all countries, in optimistic conditions. When sharing a collective PV generator's output, the rate reduction was also more significant, at 9.27%.
“In the second arrangement, when the prosumers share energy from a collective PV generator, the magnitude of their cost savings are larger, but are also more dependent on the fiscal environment,” the research group explained. “Since the amount of energy shared in this arrangement is much greater than in the previous one, the application of regulated charges more notably impacts the cost savings.”
For the prosumer community, network charge exemption has the most significant impact, reducing the bill by 1.42%. VAT exemption decreases it by 0.68%, and other taxes collectively reduce it by 0.59%. In the second arrangement, the reliefs have a much more substantial influence of 8.1%, 3.86%, and 3.36%, respectively.
“The results indicate that solar irradiation is not the only factor determining cost savings, and that there are countries in regions with high solar potential that have lower savings than their neighbors, and vice versa,” the academics said. “The savings may be proportional to both factor, meaning that largest savings are obtained by communities in areas with high solar potential, which are also exempt from paying relatively high regulated charges.”
The researchers also conducted an analysis of energy and supply cost increases, to the extent of two to six times more than the 2021 prices. They have found that in the prosumer community, as energy and supply costs increase, the benefit from avoiding regulated charges becomes smaller. That is because the most significant cost savings in this arrangement come from self-consumption, a quantity not affected by changing regulated tariffs.
However, in the case of the second community, the impact of the regulated charges on the cost savings is much more notable as prices rise.
“In order to avoid resistance from stakeholders, it was suggested to introduce energy sharing regulation when energy and supply costs are high, since during this period community members can highly benefit from self-consumption and energy sharing, even if they pay most regulated charges,” the academics said.
They described the results in an article in Energy titled “Energy sharing in European renewable energy communities: Impact of regulated charges.” The researchers – from North Macedonia’s University in Skopje, the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the International Center for Sustainable Development of Energy, and Italy’s Polytechnic University of Turin – have also looked into geographical patterns across the European continent.

A Florida new home subdivision signed a $4.2 million deal with Tampa-based Block Energy to install 77 solar arrays linked together in a community microgrid. The community in Lakeland, Florida, will be called Myrtlebrook.
Microgrids link solar, energy storage, and smart appliances. They offer benefits such as localized backup power, resilience, insulation from fluctuating utility rates, and more efficient energy use by connecting otherwise stranded assets.
Microgrid communities can operate separately from a utility’s electric grid, operating even when power outages occur. This is particularly appealing for Florida communities, which are no strangers to the impacts of hurricanes and power outages.
“This microgrid project is disruptive, it’s new and it’s everything emerging technology stands for,” Mike Dammer, manager of emergent technologies for Lakeland Electric. “We are going into the new.”
Each home will have an 8 kW solar array integrated into a roof membrane, and every two homes will connect via a 43 kWh battery, forming a microgrid named the “BlockLoop” by Block Energy.
The planned community is designed to be 77% self-sufficient, but Block Energy said it is optimistic the system can outperform expectations. It has a similar 37-home microgrid community in Wimauma, Florida that has achieved 93% independence, only drawing 7% of its electric load from utility Tampa Electric company.

Perovskite cells built with 2D hybrid materials are known for their stability and exhibit large exciton binding energy compared to conventional, 3D devices.
For the fabrication of the top cell, the research group used a generic 3D-to-2D perovskite conversion approach. It first deposited a lead-halide perovskite known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) layer by a hybrid evaporation/solution method and then transformed the layer into a 2D structure via a long-chain ammonium ligand.
The device is based on a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), the perovskite absorber, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, and a copper (Cu) metal contact.
“The resulting 2D/3D heterostructure effectively accelerates the charge extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface and thereby suppresses light-induced halide segregation,” the researchers explained, noting that this top cell achieved an energy bandgap of 1.78 eV. The device also achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.324 V, a short-circuit current density of 17.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 83.0%. It was also able to retain 95% of its original efficiency after 1,000 h.
For the construction of the all-perovskite tandem solar cell, the research team also used a 21.3%-efficient bottom perovskite cell based on an ITO substrate, a narrow bandgap perovskite, a C60 electron transport layer, a SnO2 layer, and a Cu metal contact.
The champion device built with this configuration reached an efficiency of 28.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.135 V, a short-circuit density of 16.2 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 81.5%. It also retained 90% of its initial efficiency after 855 h of continuous operation.
They introduced the novel cell tech in the study “Heterojunction formed via 3D-to-2D perovskite conversion for photostable wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells,” published in nature communications. The research group included academics from the Nanjing University  and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
“This study notably reveals the degradation mechanism of wide bandgap perovskite devices and proposes an unprecedented technical approach to simultaneously improving efficiency and stability,” they concluded.

The researchers designed panels with both rectangular and triangular shapes and solar cells connected in parallel, which have higher partial-shading tolerance compared with cells connected in strings. “However, the module voltage will be very low in a parallel connection,” they also stressed. “Designing a module with parallel connections of high-voltage and low-current cells is a basic solution but is impossible with commercial solar cells.”
The academics divided conventional cells measuring 60 mm × 60 mm into 12 cells with both triangular and rectangular shapes, measuring 15 mm × 20 mm and 30 mm × 20 mm, respectively.
“We connected 12 cells in strings to become one subgroup to form a pseudo-high-voltage low-current cell with the same dimensions as a conventional cell,” they said. “This design differs from that of shingled cells, where a module is divided into four to six pieces arranged in strings lengthwise and connected string subgroups to group with parallel connections to the side.”
Shingled panels feature a busbar-free structure in which only a small proportion of cells are not exposed to sunlight. The cells are bonded with electrically conductive adhesive to form a shingled high-density string and the resulting strips are connected. The reduced number of busbars reduces shadowing losses.
With these cells, the research group built solar modules measuring 240 mm x 180 mm and with an active area of 432 cm2. They also built a shingled module with four subgroup cells, where each subgroup cell consisted of 12 string cells, and a SAHiV module with 12 subgroup cells, where each subgroup cell consisted of 12 string cells. Finally, they also designed a SAHiV triangle module with 12 subgroup cells, where each subgroup cell consisted of 12 string cells.
Through a series of Monte Carlo-based simulations and verification experiments, the scientists tested the performance of all panels under different types of shading patterns and angles, including eight discrete shading scenarios and five continuous shading scenarios. They compared their performance with that of a reference shingled panel.
The researchers said the tests showed that both the SAHiV modules and the SAHiV triangle modules are less sensitive to partial-shading geometries. “We found that the SAHiV triangle module demonstrates better partial shading tolerance under most of the investigated scenarios,” they further explained, noting that this shading tolerance is particularly high under shallow shadowing of up to 50%.
“For the SAHiV and SAHiV triangle modules in the vertical shading pattern, slight changes in the total shading area result in the same power,” the group said. “The SAHiV modules are robust against changes in the shading shape as long as the shading area is similar.”
The scientists presented the novel module architecture in the study “Small area high voltage photovoltaic module for high tolerance to partial shading,” which was recently published in iScience. “The results of this study indicate that the SAHiV module is very suitable for urban applications with unpredictable shadows and limited land,” they concluded. “Under these conditions, the SAHiV module will increase its performance by 1.5–3 times compared to conventional modules, maximizing electricity production.”

Pure Hydrogen, a company positioning itself as a supplier of both hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen itself, showcased its 220 kW Taurus hydrogen fuel cell truck at Brisbane’s Truck Show earlier this year.
The company said at the time that the Taurus would be able to handle loads of up to 70 tons, but none of its channels specify its current haulage. Its website, however, states that the prime movers have a range of 400 kilometers, but in the  another recent announcement, a figure of 600 kilometers is given.
The 6×4 Prime Mover is supplied by HDrive, but was designed in Australia, according to the company's website.
Pure Hydrogen’s sales manager, Clint Butler, said that the Taurus prime mover “can be on the road in nine months from time of order,” adding that this turnaround is quicker than traditional diesel trucks.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/14/south-africas-largest-battery-storage-project-goes-online/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH AFRICA",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 14, 2023",South Africa’s largest battery storage project goes online,"South African utility Eskom has switched on a 20 MW/100 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) in Worcester, Western Cape province,. It has been billed as the largest such project in all of Africa.
Eskom said in the project announcement last week that the Hex BESS project serves as “a direct response to meet one of the urgent needs to address South Africa’s long-running electricity crisis by adding more storage capacity to strengthen the grid while diversifying the existing generation energy mix.”
The five-hour duration BESS is the first project to be completed under Eskom’s flagship battery storage rollout, which was announced in July 2022 to help alleviate the pressure on the national electricity grid.
The buildout will include large-scale batteries with capacities of 1,440 MWh per day and 60 MW of solar. The projects will be implemented in two phases across 12 sites in South Africa.
The first phase will include the installation of around 199 MW/833 MWh of battery storage projects alongside 2 MW of PV, while the second phase will involve the rollout of 144 MW/ 616 MWh of battery capacity and 58 MW of solar.
Eskom’s multi-site project represents the first part of a 500 MW BESS initiative announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, under the government’s measures to address South Africa’s long-running electricity crisis.
“If we do more of these kinds of projects in other parts of the country, which is what Eskom intends to do, we will see the end of load shedding pretty soon,” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said at the project launch last week.
Load shedding is a measure consisting of controlled power cuts that occur across South Africa on a rotating basis to prevent overloading the grid when the energy demand exceeds energy production. It occurs unpredictably and is predominantly cased by failures of poorly maintained infrastructure and aging coal plants.
“The rollout of these [solar and battery storage] technologies together with a disciplined execution of our Generation Recovery Plan which started in March 2023, and aimed at achieving energy availability factor of 70% by end March 2025, will give the country the most needed megawatts to address capacity constraints,” Eskom said last week.
In 2021 and 2022, Eskom's worst years of load shedding on record, it saw its average energy availability factor of generators falling to 61.7 % and 58.1 %, respectively.
The situation has further exacerbated this year with power outages in South Africa occurring as much as three to four times a day, for between 2.5 to 4.5 hours at a time. In the event of an area outage, the electricity can be off for a few days at a time.
In response to chronic power cuts, residential and commercial consumers in South Africa are expected to add 5 GW of solar capacity this year alone, according to BloombergNEF.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/14/vertical-rooftop-pv-specialist-switches-on-two-more-systems-on-green-roofs-in-norway/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,NORWAY",VALERIE THOMPSON,"NOVEMBER 14, 2023",Vertical rooftop PV specialist switches on two more systems on green roofs in Norway,"Norway-based PV system provider Over Easy has deployed two vertical solar arrays on green rooftops in Norway.
The company deployed a 102 kW installation covering 1200 m2 on a flat-roofed commercial building in Oslo. It also supplied a 45 kW system for a school rooftop project earlier in the year. Both flat roofs are planted with vegetation, so-called green roofs.
The installations were installed by Solenergi Fusen, an 11-year-old Norwegian project company specializing in commercial rooftop and building-integrated PV. The projects follow an earlier 5 kW pilot project, also located in Oslo.
Over Easy has a novel, low-height, all-in-one system design for flat rooftops. Its systems are delivered to the installation site in a pre-assembled single unit that includes its unconventional heterojunction bifacial modules, the mounting rack, and the cabling.
“The 102 kW installation was mechanically installed in less than two days with a team of four workers,” Over Easy CEO, Trygve Mongstad, told pv magazine.  
The company calls its prefabricated product a “vertical photovoltaic (VPV) unit” and each one has an output of 200 W. They come in two sizes, one for green roofs, with a size of 1,600 mm x 1,500 mm x 345 mm and a weight of 26, and one for roofs without vegetation, measuring 1,600 mm x 1,500 mm x 265 mm and weighing 25 kg. The clearance for both products is 120 mm and 40 mm, respectively.
“We can fit 6 kW or a bit more on each pallet, and the product comes completely ready with the mounting system, a true plug-and-play system for flat and green rooftop solar installations,” said Mongstad.
As for ballast, the low-height design and weight of 11 kg/m2 means the need for ballast units is reduced and, in some cases, it is not necessary, according to Mongstad, which he said also contributes to ease of installation and a lighter weight for the system.
The system's glass-glass modules are made with 3.2 mm solar glass and claim up to 95% bifaciality with an operating temperature range of -40 C to 85 C.
The company’s first green roof pilot was installed at an Oslo school. According to Mongstad, the pilot PV system integrated well with the rooftop vegetation and the energy yields were 20-30% higher than conventional east-west flat rooftop installations in the same area.
“We ticked in at above 1000 kWh/kW for the first year of operation, which is pretty good for our latitude,” said Mongstad.
Recently, pv magazine reported that Dutch scientists used thermal models to understand why vertical solar installations were delivering higher yields, attributing the performance boost to the systems’ consistently lower operating temperatures.
“We’ve also observed the same effect,” commented Mongstad who noted that his company’s collaboration with researchers from Institute for Energy Technology in Norway found that the heat exchange of the vertical panels was “indeed much higher than what is expected for tilted solar panels”, but he also attributes higher yields to the “increased irradiation that high-bifaciality vertical solar panels” receive.
