Algerian holding Zergoun Green Energy has inaugurated a 200 MW solar module factory in southern Algeria.
Located in the Sahara Desert province of Ouargla, the factory is equipped with lines provided by Spain's Mondragon Assembly and has an annual production capacity of 200 MW. It will manufacture PERC M3 modules with busbar technology with a power output of between 405 and 415 W. These products will be available in glass-backsheet or glass-glass versions as well as bifacial or monofacial panels.
According to information provided to pv magazine France by an industry source, the lines are expected to be adapted to the production of the M10 and M12 module formats at the beginning of 2023. The plant is already compatible with the TOPCon cell technology that is planned to succeed the mono PERC tech.
The total investment in the factory is DZD 1.7 billion ($11.6 million), which includes the building and the equipment. Zergoun Green Energy financed the project with 50% of equity and 50% via bank loans. Partnerships with the University of Ouargla and players in the solar sector, such as the Center for the Development of Renewable Energies (CDER) and unspecified EPC contractors in the Middle East are already in advanced discussions.
Synergies are also planned, such as the pooling of raw material purchases with the compatriot module maker Milltech in Mila, in the east of the country, which has an M3 module production capacity of 100 MW. The first orders are planned for Africa and the Middle East via the Algerian diaspora active in the United Arab Emirates and in Africa.
In order to meet the growing needs of the Algerian and African solar sector, Zergoun Green Energy has also created a joint venture with Greek company Elvan to set up a production plant for metal mounting structures in Ouargla to supply the Algerian, Greek and African markets.
The new fab will be the country’s fourth solar panel manufacturing facility. Condor operates a 130 MW factory in Bordj Bou Arreridj and Aurés Solaire runs a 30 MW facility in the Ain Yagout industrial area near Batna, eastern Algeria. The development of a solar module manufacturing industry is being supported by the Algerian government through domestic content requirements in tenders for large scale PV projects.

The order relates to the supply of 1 GW of n-type TOPCon bifacial modules with a power output of up to 560 W for use in large scale projects.
Module manufacturer Risen said on Thursday that its CNY 5 billion ($758 million) private placement of shares has been suspended for a month. The net proceeds from the transaction should be devoted to the construction of a new solar module factory that still needs to get final approval from the China National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC).
China's Shandong Province announced this week that its fourteenth five-year plan spanning 2021 to 2025 envisages deploying at least 65 GW of PV capacity by the end of 2025, including at least 12 GW of offshore PV for which a specific tender was issued last month. The provincial authorities have already identified 10 offshore sites along Shandong’s coast where the projects could be constructed. Binzhou, Dongying, Weifang, Yantai, Weihai and Qingdao are some of the preferred areas.
Shunfeng International's proposed sale of four solar projects has collapsed. The heavily-indebted developer announced in January plans to sell 132 MW of solar generation capacity to state-owned entity State Power Investment Group Xinjiang Energy and Chemical Co Ltd to raise CNY 890 million ($134 million). After postponing four times publication of details of the shareholder vote required to approve the sale, Shunfeng this week said the deal had fallen through. The transaction was complicated by the Changzhou Intermediate People’s Court of Jiangsu Province in April, which granted a freezing order on the 95% stake in one of the solar project companies held by a Shunfeng subsidiary. The order was granted at the request of two investors in a 2015 Shunfeng bond who claim money is owed them by the developer. “The board will explore other opportunities to dispose of … some or all of the target companies in order to improve the financial position of the company,” Shunfeng told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week.

The plant will be the second of its kind in the UK. The 13,500-ton facility will use Powerhouse Energy’s technology to produce hydrogen from non-recyclable plastics destined for landfill, incineration or export overseas. “The hydrogen will be used as a clean fuel for heavy good vehicles, buses and cars, with plans for a linked hydrogen refueling station on the site,” said Peel L&P. Peel NRE signed a collaboration agreement with Powerhouse Energy Group to develop 11 plastic-to-hydrogen facilities across the UK over the next few years. The first project in Cheshire, North West England, should begin construction this year. The company did not clarify the timing for this second project in Scotland. 
Plug Power revealed plans to build a 35-ton-per-day green hydrogen generation plant at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Belgium. The provider of turnkey hydrogen solutions signed a 30-year concession agreement. “Plug plans to erect a 100-megawatt green hydrogen plant, using its own electrolyzer and liquefaction technology, on 28 acres of land leased under the agreement,” the company said. Construction of the plant will begin upon completion of the permitting process, anticipated in late 2023. Initial production of green hydrogen is expected in late 2024, and plant commissioning is set for 2025. The Port of Antwerp-Bruges provides transportation connections to Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, the UK and France. “The site location provides the opportunity for a ready supply of electricity from on-site and site-adjacent wind turbines generating dozens of megawatts, with an electric interconnection point less than a mile away,” the statement reads. Plug Power and Renault will also provide fuel cell vans to decarbonize the logistic flows of the port. 
University of Cambridge and Imperial College London researchers have created photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices that mimick the photosynthesis of plant leaves to produce hydrogen fuels. These devices use bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI), a non-toxic semiconductor, instead of perovskites. Solar fuel applications do not usually use BiOI due to its poor stability in water. “Researchers found a way to increase the stability of these artificial leaf devices by inserting BiOI between two oxide layers. The robust oxide-based device structure was further coated with a water-repellent graphite paste, which prevented moisture infiltration. This prolonged the stability of the bismuth oxyiodide light-absorbing pixels from minutes to a couple of months, including the time the devices were left in storage,” stated the researchers. Their findings, published in the journal Nature Materials, demonstrate that the activity towards proton and CO2 reduction is, in this device, mainly limited by catalyst degradation. The British team also found that devices comprising multiple light-harvesting areas, called pixels, showed a higher performance over devices with a single larger pixel of the same total size. “Even if some pixels are faulty, we were able to disconnect them, so they don’t affect the rest. This meant we could sustain the performance of the small pixels on a larger area,” commented Virgil Andrei, a co-lead author from the Department of Chemistry in Cambridge. 
Terrestrial Energy, a UK-based thermal and electric power technology company, has signed an agreement with US ammonia production technology company KBR to investigate the application of zero-emission thermal energy for hydrogen and ammonia production.
Wood Mackenzie said that potential low-carbon hydrogen demand from the global refining sector could reach 50 million tons per annum (Mtpa) by 2050. According to the study, around 40 Mtpa would be needed to replace fossil fuels in combustion applications to generate heat and steam.
Worley, Voar and Wood Mackenzie said in a report that Scotland could export hydrogen to international markets. The analysts mentioned the blue hydrogen Acorn Hydrogen Project and the green hydrogen opportunities offered by the Cerulean Winds Project in Shetland.
Hydrogen Systems, a Saudi Arabia-based hydrogen solutions company, and US specialty gas compression systems manufacturer PDC Machines signed a memorandum of understanding to work together to create various hydrogen infrastructure solutions in the region.
Statkraft, the Norwegian state-owned hydropower company, has announced it will supply renewable electricity to H2 Green Steel’s operations in Boden, Sweden, under a power purchase agreement covering 2026-2032.
Eni, the Italian oil and gas company, has inaugurated in Mestre, Venice, the first hydrogen refueling station open to the public in an urban area in Italy. The system has two dispensing points with a capacity of over 100 kilograms per day, which can refuel vehicles in about five minutes.

The company offers the Frog Photovoltaic Water Heater with its own solar module, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller, and an 80 L water boiler with two resistances, of which one is activated by the photovoltaic panel.
“All the electricity generated by the module is injected into the water heater through the FROG V10 controller,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “It can work with a photovoltaic module with a power output of up to 450 W, a maximum short-circuit current of 50 V and a short-circuit current of 9.0 V.”
The controller is based on a Perturb and Observe algorithm, which consists of an artificial neural network that reduces the oscillations at the MPP. “It maintains the point of maximum energy transfer from the panel to the water heater following the variations in the lighting conditions of the panel,” the spokesperson further explained. “Moreover, a complete scan of the panel is periodically carried out to avoid the so-called ‘false maximum points' due to uneven illumination of the module itself.”
The FROG 10 controller is encased in a die-cast aluminum container equipped with perforated flanges for deployment onto a wall and cables with connectors for the solar panel. It also includes a plug connector with fixing screws for connecting the resistance and temperature sensor from the boiler to the control unit. “Once the connector has been inserted into the control unit, it practically turns it on,” the spokesperson added.
The boiler measures 45 cm x 75 cm and weighs 22 kg. It is sold by the manufacturer in combination with its own solar modules, preferably with its X Max XL panel with a power output of 320 W to 340 W and efficiency ranging from 19.18% to 20.38%. The panel weighs 18.3 kg and features busbar cell technology. It also has an IP67 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V. Its temperature coefficient is -0.36% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
According to the manufacturer, the solar panel can generate approximately 2,800 Wh per day and the heater is able to raise water temperature from 20 C to 50 C. The daily thermal energy supplied to the resistance is approximately 2.410 kCal.
“We offer the whole package for €1,200 ($1,29o) excluding VAT and installation costs,” the spokesperson explained. “It comes with a three-year warranty for the water heater and a two-year warranty for the FROG 10 controller.” For the panel, Sunerg offers a 25-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/10/new-photovoltaic-in-roof-system-from-switzerland/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JUNE 10, 2022",New photovoltaic in-roof system from Switzerland,"From pv magazine Germany
Swiss solar module manufacturer Megasol has conceived a new in-roof system that it claims can be used to deploy homogeneous and flush-fitting rooftop PV installations.
Called Nicer X, the in-roof system is available in two versions — the full-black and the translucent variants. The first system relies on 400 solar modules with a power conversion efficiency of 21.7%, black cell gaps, cross-contacts, and rear busbars. The second solution utilizes larger, transparent cell spacing enabling light to penetrate by around 10%.
Both solutions consist of three components: vertical supports, a ridge profile, and solar modules. The installation is easy, according to the manufacturer. In the first step, the vertical supports are screwed directly onto the existing roof battens after the old tiles have been removed. In the case of a new building, reduced roof battens can be installed.
In the second step, the ridge profiles are clicked and modules can be installed. “The modules are laid completely without tools — they are pushed up to the upper stop and then “closed, similar to a trunk lid,” explains Michael Reist, head of communications at Megasol. “An audible click and a corresponding haptic feedback confirm that it is securely locked in place.” In addition, it is also possible to visually check whether the solar modules are securely fixed. With the manufacturer's snap-lock fasteners, the modules can easily be attached and detached several times.
According to Megasol, 20 square meters of the Nicer X substructure and solar modules could be deployed in one person-hour. The manufacturer also offers matching eaves grilles for the system if required. The system is also claimed to be completely rainproof from a roof pitch of three degrees, which is achieved by a double labyrinth seal.
The system is not only suitable for in-roof photovoltaic systems, but also for solar parking lots, canopies or facades. Existing parking spaces could be retrofitted and, in the case of facades, the system is particularly suitable for hall-like buildings or steel structures. In the case of non-insulated hall constructions, no further facade elements are necessary and the trapezoidal sheets can be left out completely.

“The expansion plan is intended to host up to 1.5 million electric cars, a massive amount of heat pumps, and more solar panels,” the company said in a statement. “The plan will be submitted to the relevant authorities, stakeholders and public opinion in the spring. After a public consultation round, the Flemish energy regulator — VREG — will decide in the autumn whether it can be approved and whether the requested funds will be awarded in the coming years.”
Fluvius expects complete electrification of the public bus transport by 2035 and gradually more electric freight transport. “Mobility will have the biggest impact on the power network in the coming decade, along with the building heating in the second half of the decade,” it further explained, noting that about 12% of the buildings in the Flanders region will be heated with heat pumps in 2030.
The plan aims to deploy another 30,000 kilometers of the low-voltage grid, 6,000 kilometers of the medium-voltage grid and 22,450 distribution cabinets.
The Belgian federal government decided in March to reduce to 6% the value-added tax (VAT) for PV installations and heat pumps deployed in buildings erected over the past 10 years. This low percentage value was previously applied only to residential solar arrays and heat pumps installed on buildings that were more than 10 years old.
Belgium reached a cumulative installed solar power capacity of over 7 GW at the end of 2021.
According to a recent analysis by Belgian institute EnergyVille, rooftop PV and onshore wind have the technical potential to reach 118 GW of capacity in Belgium. Of the three Belgian macro-regions, Flemish-speaking Flanders is the one with the largest solar potential for rooftop systems, at 67.56 GW, followed by French-speaking Wallonia, with 31.54 GW, and the Brussels metropolitan region, with 4.23 GW.

US multinational General Electric (GE) is tripling its solar and battery energy storage manufacturing capacity in India to 9 GW per annum by the end of 2022. The capacity expansion is driven by strong growth in backlog over the past few months and a robust demand outlook, said the company.
The announcement comes four months after the opening of its Renewable Hybrids manufacturing site in Vallam, near Chennai, Tamil Nadu, where it manufactures these systems.
The Vallam site manufactures GE’s power conversion solution FlexInverter (formerly known as LV5+) and the FlexReservoir utility-scale energy storage solution. It also helps integrate these solutions with GE’s FlexIQ digital platform to solve customers’ needs for dispatchable, green megawatt-hours in solar, storage, and hybrid applications.
The FlexReservoir is scalable from a rated power of 3 MW to 500+ MW to serve multiple market applications.
The FlexInverter power station delivers a reliable, cost-effective, plug-and-play, factory-integrated power conversion platform for utility-scale solar and storage applications. It combines a solar inverter, medium voltage power transformer, and an optional MV Ring Main Unit, all integrated in a standard 20-feet high cube container.
“Solar and battery energy storage will continue to be a key driver in delivering hybrid systems that enable the energy transition. GE is committed to providing cutting-edge technologies around power conversion solutions and software-enabled controls to meet growing customer needs in the hybrids space. Our new factory has ramped up to meet increasing industry and customer demand,” said Prakash Chandra, CEO of GE's Renewable Hybrids.

The Biden Administration has lowered the land lease rates that facilities must pay as part of a drive to deploy 25 GW of renewable energy on public lands. The announcement by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) suggests that rents and fees will decrease by over 50% due to lowered rents and a reduction to the standard per-megawatt fees.
According to the official documentation, the rental rate for acreage was adjusted in different ways. First, the average lease rate for land within the state was discounted from 0.7% for New Mexico to as much as 7.5% for Arizona (Equation Variable: A in the below chart). This, of course, lowers the lease rate by those percentages.

The second, much larger adjustment, applies to the per acre rental charge. This change decreases the Rate of Return (Equation Variable: C) from 5.7% down to 2%. This downward revision will drop the price of the land lease rate by just over 62%.
BLM also adjusted the flat fee per megawatt deployed for all energy sources, down to $2,000. This downward adjustment ranged from $3,802/MW for wind, to $2,172/MW for solar power. The decrease in price for solar was 7.9% – leaving the cost at about two-tenths of a cent per watt.
Combined, the two rate deductions for solar power provide a discount that ranges from 3% to 4% in Arizona, to just over 21% in California.
Along with their announcement on price reductions, BLM delivered a presentation to Congress highlighting the progress they have made, and showing off their project pipeline. The BLM aims to get 25 GW of renewables installed by their target date of 2025.

The presentation notes that BLM permitted twelve projects totaling 2,890 MW, from geothermal and solar power in 2021. The solar facilities make up 96.5% of the total capacity deployed across projects located in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, and California.
This represents a 35% increase in capacity over the 2,148 MW deployed in 2020.
Going forward, the BLM has enough capacity in the pipeline to meet the 2025 goals via solar power alone, because the 39 projects in the queue total 29,596 MW of capacity. 28 of these projects were driven by applicants, while 11 of the potential facilities were initiated by BLM offering up specific, pre-approved land up for development.
Among the BLM initiated lands is a 600 MW plot being developed in Utah. Wind power in the queue totals just over 2 GW, and geothermal capacity totals 188 MW. There are also six power lines in the planning stages, with a total of 1.7 GW of transmission capacity.

According to the press release, BLM has created five ‘Renewable Energy Coordination Offices’ in western states that will help push these projects through processing steps, and they are actively hiring project managers to accelerate the permitting work.

Mitrex, a buildings-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) provider based in Toronto, announced it is teaming up with noise barrier industry leaders Durisol and Silentium Group to create photovoltaic highway noise barriers.
The made-in-Canada barriers are designed to improve highway aesthetics, while offering a noise reduction coefficient of up to 0.7 and emissions-free electricity production. Both transparent and opaque options are available. Three design types include a retrofit option, a vertical unitized system, and an angled design for increased production and aesthetics.
The integrated PV has a capacity of up to 22 W per 0.09 square meter on a single face, and up to 37 W per square foot in bifacial applications. On average, each kilometer would become a power plant generating over 1.2 MW of electricity. Rather than using conventional absorptive sound barriers to dissipate the sound with low-density porous materials such as concrete and foam, the PV noise barrier panels are designed with a proprietary acoustic interlayer that minimizes sound transfer. Mitrex said the product has a low carbon backpack, and a negative carbon embodiment of –1000 kg of C02 per square meter.
The three companies have partnered with the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario to establish product approval guidelines and create a pathway to retrofit the BIPV technology into existing highway noise barriers. As the guidelines are developed for the new technology, Durisol and Silentium Group have selected several existing highway barriers built for government entities to run pilot programs. The pilots will capture data and analyze the PV noise barrier performance.
“Partnerships like these allow us to decentralize energy and change the way we power our cities,” said Mitrex CEO, Danial Hadizadeh. “We won’t stop here—we will continue to push the envelope to produce the next generation solar-integrated products. Cooperating with companies in other fields is where we can truly make a difference, and it’s essential to developing better, more efficient products and allows us to bring this technology to North America and beyond.”

The project will be undertaken by Terra Solar, a joint venture between Razon’s Prime Infra and PV module manufacturer and project developer Solar Philippines.
Manila-based Solar Philippines is the nation’s largest solar company with an estimated 400 MW of operation projects and multi-megawatt pipeline projects under construction, including a 500 MW solar farm being built in the province of Nueva Ecija, about 100 kilometers north of Manila. It also partnered with Prime Infra to develop a 150 MW solar farm in Tarlac, about 70 km west of Nueva Ecija.
No details about the cost or location of the new solar farm were provided, with Solar Philippines saying only that it would look to identify potential sites for the project on the island of Luzon. Prime Infra chief executive officer Guillaume Lucci described the project as “a model of dependable renewable energy”, saying it would be transformational for the nation’s renewable energy landscape.
“We are delighted to move forward on this record-breaking project that highlights solar power’s important contribution to strengthening the country’s energy security,” he said, adding that Prime Infra was looking to take advantage of a steep decline in solar installation costs over the past decade and improved battery energy storage system technology.
“It allows the company to build an economically critical and socially relevant infrastructure at a scale the world has never seen before,” he said, noting that the project is backed by a long-term power purchase agreement with Manila Electric Company (Meralco). The Philippines’ biggest power retailer has inked a 20-year offtake agreement for 850 MW of renewable energy per annum. The agreement stipulates that 600 MW will be available by 2026, with the additional 250 MW to be delivered in 2027.
Figures released by Terra Solar said the 850 MW supply will displace an annual consumption of approximately 1.4 million tons of coal or 930,000 liters of oil, reducing both carbon emissions and import dependency for the country from 2026 to 2046.
The Philippines gets about 57% of its electricity from coal but the nation has made a big push for renewable energy projects in recent years as it seeks to lessen its dependence on fossil fuels, in line with its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The government aims to increase the share of renewables in the power mix to 35% by 2030, from 21% in 2020, and to 50% by 2040. Renewables currently account for 29.1% of installed capacity.
Meralco, which distributes electricity in metropolitan Manila and nearby provinces, is aiming to have 1.5 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2027. Meralco is “embarking on a just, orderly and affordable transition to clean and earth-friendly energy,” chairman Manuel Pangilinan said in a statement.
