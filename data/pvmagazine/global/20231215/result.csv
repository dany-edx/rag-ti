French wooden frame provider Azélan has developed a solar carport made of Douglas wood, a kind of wood with pink to reddish brown hues from the Massif Central, a highland region in south-central France.
“Douglas wood has the advantage of being naturally rot-proof, so it does not require any treatment product and can resist for decades,” the company's sales manager, Rémi François, told pv magazine France. “Another advantage is that the CO2 footprint over the entire life cycle is 25 times lower than that of steel. For a 100 m2 carport, you avoid the emission of 3.34 tonnes of CO2.”
The carport structures are fixed to the ground using galvanized steel. The additional cost of the wooden structure alone is approximately 30% more than its steel equivalent.
“However, the cost of the structure only represents 25% of the total price of a photovoltaic carport project, the rest being devoted to roads and various network work, masonry, connection of the systems to the electrical network,” François stressed. “The capex is only 10% higher in the end.”
The company has already developed several projects with its solar carport structure.
Bordeaux-based real estate company Société de Création Immobilière et d'Aménagement de l'Université de Bordeaux (SRIA) recently deployed a 2,500 m2 carport that was installed in eight months. On this project, the carbon footprint was 36.7 kgCO2/tonne, whereas it would have been 937 kgCO2/tonne for recycled steel.
An unspecified installer of fast charging stations for electric vehicles also called on Azélan for the construction of an 820 m2 solar carport with charging stations on the A62 motorway in the Garonne area. “Many of our customers are looking for the aesthetic appearance of our products and the integration of wood into the landscape, particularly in natural areas or in city centers,” said François.

The Brussels-based association said data collected from 10 European countries shows heat pump sales were strong in the first quarter of the year, but by the third quarter, dropped by 14%.
Sales were down 66% in Finland, 55% in Denmark, and 45% in Italy. Germany was the only country that bucked this trend with 60% growth in the third quarter, but “even here, the gap is closing as the year progresses,” according to EHPA.
The almost unanimous third quarter drop – across Austria, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland – is an “alarming trend” that could put the EU’s decarbonization targets at risk, the association said in a press release.
It blames “ambiguous communication” and “changing government policies and subsidies” for creating an uncertain market leading to the drop.
EHPA Secretary General Thomas Nowak said policymakers need to correct the record by “committing unambiguously” to heat pump technologies and by establishing favorable economic conditions. “As an immediate measure, policy must aim at reducing the cost of electricity for residential, commercial and industrial applications. It should not be more than twice the price of fossil gas,” he said.
EHPA said these concerns must be addressed in the European Commission’s upcoming “Heat Pump Action Plan” planned for publication in early 2024. The program aims to accelerate the heat pump market and deployment through partnerships between the government, communication with interest groups, legislative support and accessible financing.
The association said national governments should also propose solutions in their national energy and climate plans and make energy taxation more “balanced,” phase out fossil subsidies and reduce the burden of electricity from taxes and levies.

The first hub in Wentzville, Missouri, should be followed by two other inaugurations in 2024. “These upcoming hubs are strategically planned to be located in Northern California and Southern California,” the company told pv magazine. The company is also working on developing 12 other sites across the country. “The selection of these sites is driven by the company's keen attention to market demand, ensuring that we can effectively meet the growing needs of our customers.” The company said it wants to produce hydrogen close to the point of demand. BayoTech's proprietary hydrogen production technology is Steam Methane Reforming (SMR). “We use a blend of natural gas and renewable natural gas to produce carbon-neutral hydrogen.”
Versogen said it has achieved membrane production capacity to support 1 GW of AEM electrolyzers per year. “From the company's roots in a research lab at the University of Delaware, Versogen has scaled up the production capabilities of its proprietary PiperION polymer by a factor greater than 2,000 times,” said the Delaware-based startup.
Lhyfe has inaugurated its renewable hydrogen production site in Buléon, France – the first of its kind to be built in Brittany. “Lhyfe Bretagne will mainly supply the region's mobility and the industrial processes of regional companies,” said the French company in an emailed note. Lhyfe will produce up to 2 tons of green hydrogen per day, or up to 575 tons per year, banking on 5 MW of installed electrolysis capacity.
The UK government has announced backing for 11 green hydrogen projects and confirmed suppliers will receive a guaranteed price for the clean energy they supply. In return for this government support, the projects should invest over GBP 400 million in the next three years, delivering 125 MW of new hydrogen. The government mentioned a project in South Wales, one in Scotland and one in England. The first will lead Port Talbot paper mill to replace 50% of the current gas boiler consumption with hydrogen, the second plans to run a boiler on 100% hydrogen for use in InchDairnie Distillery's distilling process, the third will allow PD Ports in Teesside to use hydrogen to replace diesel in their vehicle fleet, decarbonizing port operations from 2026. “Today's announcement represents the largest number of commercial-scale green hydrogen production projects announced at once anywhere in Europe,” said UK Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho.
The British government has also decided not to proceed with the proposed trial in Redcar as designed. It said that the decision was “due to issues in obtaining a robust, local hydrogen supply.” The authorities will decide in 2026 how hydrogen will contribute to decarbonizing household heat.
Jan Rosenow, director of non-governmental organization RAP, has published a summary of 54 independent studies assessing the scientific evidence for using hydrogen for heating buildings. “The analysis concludes that the scientific evidence does not support a major role for hydrogen in cost-optimal decarbonization pathways being associated with higher energy system and consumer costs,” he said in “A meta-review of 54 studies on hydrogen heating,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Sustainability. Rosenow concluded that electrification and district heating are deemed preferable due to higher efficiency and lower costs in the majority of analyzed studies. “Roughly speaking, you could say that heat pumps and distract heating are between three to five times more efficient,” Rosenow told pv magazine. “In terms of costs to consumers, the median of all estimates would suggest that hydrogen would be almost twice as expensive as the other alternatives.”

Akcome Technology has announced a planned investment of CNY 2.1 billion ($295 million) in fixed assets to expand its HJT cell capacity by 4.6 GW, with the first production line scheduled for completion in January 2024. Currently, Akcome's Suzhou, Ganzhou, Huzhou, and Zhoushan production bases have a total capacity of 3.2 GW of HJT cells, 0.8 GW of passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) capacity, and 10.4 GW of solar panels. Despite on-hand orders for 2.95 GW of HJT modules, the company's current HJT cell production capacity falls short of meeting demand for new orders.
Daqo New Energy has announced plans to add new production capacity, including silicon metal, in Shihezi, in China's Xinjiang region. It plans to invest a total of CNY 15 billion. The development is two-phased and is expected to add 300,000 metric tons (MT) of silicon metal capacity, 100 MT of polysilicon, and 2.2 million seed rods when complete. The company said that implementation hinges on market conditions, shareholder approval, government filings and approvals, and energy consumption approvals.

The reform – originally introduced in March, 2023 – aims to make electricity prices less dependent on “volatile” fossil fuel prices, protect customers from price-spikes, expedite renewable energy projects and improve customer protection, according to the European Council press release.
The reform would do this by introducing new power purchase agreements (PPAs) exclusively for renewable projects, allowing the European Council to declare an “energy crisis”, creating contracts for difference, and other mechanisms.
Minister for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Teresa Ribera, said the agreement was “great news” for the EU as it would reduce the region’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels and gas, as well as stabilize long-term renewable markets.
It would also expedite the deployment of renewable and fossil-free energy sources, offer more affordable electricity to the EU’s citizens, and enhance industrial competitiveness, Ribera said in the press release.
A clause regarding two-way contracts for difference is also part of the revision, according to the announcement, which stipulates financial investments from member states for new renewable power-generating facilities, spanning wind, solar, geothermal, hydro without reservoir and nuclear energy.
Capacity mechanisms would also be made a more “structural element” of the electricity market, according to the release, with the potential for the introduction of “exceptional derogation” for CO2 emission limits, according to the announcement.
Brussels-based solar lobby SolarPower Europe welcomed the revision, with the organization’s Head of Regulatory Affairs Naomi Chevillard saying the shift was a “clear path forward” for long-term investment in renewable projects and would be an end to market caps.
But she did “regret” the provision’s capacity remuneration mechanisms, as they were “prolonging Europe’s dependency on coal.”
“Member States should be betting on, and investing in, clean flexibility of the future – like batteries or demand-side response – rather than the outdated fossil ‘baseload’ of the past,” she said.
Chevillard did laud, however, the provisional agreement’s encouragement of businesses signing up to PPAs through new national guarantees, as well as other “positive provisions” that would allow smoother and more flexible grid connection, she said.
“The new market design will empower Europeans with some real tools for decarbonizing and fighting future energy crises, thanks to solar’s low cost and versatility.”
The provisional agreement needs to be formally endorsed by the European Parliament and European Council before being enshrined as law.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/15/bolivian-wildfires-el-nino-impact-south-american-pv-irradiance/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA",,"DECEMBER 15, 2023","Bolivian wildfires, El Niño impact South American PV irradiance","Moisture from El Niño, high pressure and the Andes all played a role in irradiance patterns across South America in November, but smoke from the wildfires in Bolivia is present clearly in the irradiance anomaly for the month, according to analysis conducted using data from the Solcast API.
Aerosols from smoke in the atmosphere absorb and scatter direct irradiance, decreasing overall irradiance and increasing the diffuse fraction of irradiance. These effects decreased irradiance over Paraguay, Northern Argentina, Southern Brazil and Uruguay, while South America's west coast also saw lower-than-normal November irradiance, due to increased moisture from El Niño. The Andes mostly protected the rest of the continent from that moisture, and additional effects from high pressure over central Brazil meant that utility-scale solar in that region received much more irradiance than normal for this time of year.

Wildfires in Bolivia generated aerosols that depressed irradiance up to 30% below long-term averages across Paraguay, Northern Argentina, Southern Brazil and Uruguay. Whilst the fires were most active through mid-November, they were concentrated enough to clearly
show in the monthly average aerosol impact (Aerosol Optical Depth), shown below.

Aerosols in the atmosphere have a significant impact on irradiance, by scattering direct irradiance high in the atmosphere. As you can see in this breakdown, aerosols had significant impacts in Sao Paolo, reducing irradiance.

Central and Eastern Brazil saw some impacts from the smoke, but not enough to prevent irradiance 20-30% over November averages. A high-pressure system in the upper atmosphere suppressed storm formation, leading to clearer skies and higher irradiance. This is a change from normal November patterns, where warm, moist air feeds showers and thunderstorms throughout Brazil. This year the many Brazillian utility-scale solar assets based in this region have benefitted from the anomalous high-pressure system, which pushed that moisture away from the area.

El Niño was fully named “El Niño de Navidad” or ‘the little boy of Christmas’, in the 1600s by fishermen who noticed warmer ocean temperatures off the coast South America in December of stormy years. Warmer Pacific waters are a key indicator of the phenomenon and bring with them increased atmospheric moisture and storms along the west coast of South America, hence the fisherman’s interest. This year these effects are already being seen, with increased cloud activity through November along the coast leading to irradiance around 10% lower than long-term averages. The Andes form a natural barrier that stops the extra moisture from pushing further east into the continent, keeping the biggest impacts of El Niño on the west coast.
Interestingly northern Chile had the highest average irradiance across the continent, but lower than normal for November. This pattern has also been present in other months, as the region from the Atacama Desert to the Altiplano Plateau is one of the most irradiated places
in the world.

A detailed study is still necessary in order to determine actual connection capacity.”
The map shows that the Belgian grid may still have space to host another 3.3 GW of solar and 2.8 GW of batteries. The country currently has around 8.3 GW of installed solar power and 0.2 GW of storage capacity.
The map also shows the available capacity for flexible connections.
“Connecting new grid users with limited expected flexibility of 5% creates two to three times more room on the grid,” Elia said. “Under flexibility contracts, Elia has the option of not supplying 5% of total annual energy if the grid would otherwise become overloaded.”

In the paper, “When do circular business models resolve barriers to residential solar PV adoption? Evidence from survey data in Flanders,” published in Energy Policy, the scientists acknowledged the problem with end-of-life PV waste and noted the need for sustainable approaches to solar adoption. The researchers examined how circular business models – specifically solar product-service system (PSS) models and PV reuse – could address the waste problem while overcoming barriers to adoption.
A survey of 3,996 households in Flanders, Belgium, found that the circular business models presented would only address the cost barrier.
Survey respondents were asked about their interest in a use-oriented PSS model. It consists of solar leasing with a transfer of ownership after 20 years, which is the dominant PSS model for the residential solar market in Flanders. “For PV reuse, we surveyed customer interest in second-life PV panels in the context of a user-oriented PSS model, where the operation of these panels would be guaranteed by the supplier,” the researchers said.
Researchers determined that a high interest in PSS models is found significantly more frequent among female respondents, and respondents living in houses with a flat roof, an older dwelling, having experience as a Netflix user, and having high trust rates in energy suppliers and technology. Those with a high interest in PSS were more likely to favor the removal of the PV panels at the end of the contract period, as they did not want to be stuck with a technology that was 20 years old.
“Note that the user experience of Netflix differs from Spotify and car lease,” the research group stressed. “Unlike Netflix, Spotify is also accessible for users who do not pay, and respondents who have experience with car lease often did not have to pay themselves for the lease program.”
A lower interest in PSS models was found among male respondents and those who live in recently built houses. “Having no interest in solar PSS is found to be related with respondents who are a member of a renewable energy citizen cooperative, living in houses with a good roof quality, having no Netflix subscription, and low trust rates in the Green political party,” the researchers stated.
For those who are interested in PSS, regulatory uncertainties and not knowing anyone else in a PSS model act as barriers to choosing this option. To counter these barriers, the study’s authors recommend that policymakers develop energy policies showing complementarity across multiple policy levels and domains and provide legal certainty for households to invest in renewable energy solutions.
The researchers cautioned that while most policies that support PV adoption are focused on houses, policymakers should recognize the increase in people living in “collective housing settings” such as apartment buildings, and who did not own their place of residence.
“Given the increasing waste problem that stems from solar PV investments, policymakers and service providers should collaborate to design future-proof, sustainable, and incentive-compatible contractual regulations enhancing improved recycling, remanufacturing, repair, and reuse, substantiated by policy research,” the academics concluded.

The recent surge in energy storage installations in the United States is seen in the residential and grid-scale sectors, while the commercial and industrial segment posted a slight decline quarter on quarter, according to a recent Wood Mackenzie and American Clean Power Association (ACP) report.
“Energy storage deployment is growing dramatically, proving that it will be essential to our future energy mix,” said Frank Macchiarola, ACP chief policy officer. “This industry will serve as the backbone of our modern grid. As we continue to build a strong domestic supply chain, streamlined permitting and evolving market rules can further accelerate the deployment of storage resources.”
The grid-scale sector’s 2023 forecast increased just slightly due to strong third-quarter volume, however, the remainder of the forecast lowered by 7% on average. The sector faced multiple challenges, which caused volatility in the market and hindered project completion, according to Witte.
 
“Grid-scale declines were more focused on challenges not only with supply and permitting, but also with the backlog of applications in most ISOs interconnection queues that are preventing projects to move through the development process,” said Witte.

The government said it expects to allocate 3.2 GW of onshore capacity and 1.8 GW of solar PV capacity through the procurement exercise.
Interested developers have until April 30 to submit bids.
“Bidders should note the available areas of supply on the Generation Connection Capacity Assessment (GCCA) of 2025,” the ministry said.
This auction is the first to be held in line with a plan issued by the South African government in December 2022 seeking to procure 14 771 MW of new generating capacity. The capacity includes 3,94 GW of solar, 9.6 GW of wind, and 1.23 GW of storage.
In the sixth round of the REIPPPP program, the South African authorities selected five solar plants with a combined capacity of 860 MW, with the final average price coming in at ZAR 0.49048 ($0.027)/kWh, up 8% from the fifth round, when the average price reached ZAR 0.45423/kWh. The government had originally planned to allocate up to 1 GW of solar in the auction.
The fifth round of the REIPPPP scheme was launched in March 2021. Overall, the authorities allocated 2.6 GW of renewable energy capacity across 25 projects, ranging in size from 75 MW to 140 MW.
The sixth and fifth procurement exercises were part of a plan to tender almost 12 GW of capacity.
South Africa had 5,826 MW estimated installed PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

The price spread for PERC M10 cells has widened this week. As M10 cells fall to an average price of around CNY0.389 ($0.055)/W, a major cell manufacturer continues to offer them at about CNY0.41/W, saying that “production will cease if the price drops any further.”

In contrast, an integrated player said cell buyers are unwilling to pay for PERC M10 cells at CNY0.4/W. The market has even reported transaction prices of CNY0.35/W, a project developer said.
PERC M10 cells have an “excessively high production capacity” and “there are quite a lot of irrational prices on the market at the moment,” according to a cell producer.
PERC G12 cells meanwhile plummeted 16.69% this week as demand dropped, more than shedding recent gains from November’s demand spike, a market watcher said. This suggests that the peak demand season for this year’s installations has passed, he added.
TOPCon M10 cells hold steady as sources concur that the market faces a scarcity of high-efficiency N-type cells. However, an increase in n-type cell prices is unlikely, according to a large integrated manufacturer. The next two months are an “off-season” because of the Christmas and Chinese New Year holidays, he said. “Depending on how low demand and shortages interact, n-type cell prices may remain steady in the near future,” he continued.
A significant amount of PERC cell production capacity is reportedly closing, with a faster than expected shift towards n-type cell production taking place, according to a major solar manufacturer. According to the manufacturer, half of PERC cell capacity is predicted to shut, leaving only 200-300 GW of PERC capacity available in 2024.
