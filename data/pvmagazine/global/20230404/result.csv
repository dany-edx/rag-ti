It said that more than 4,300 km of pipelines already transport hydrogen, with more than 90% of them in Europe and North America. It estimates that there are about 91 planned pipeline projects throughout the world, with 30,300 kilometers set to go online by around 2035. “Spain, France, and Germany are among the countries committed or considering cross-border pipelines to facilitate energy flows, while the UK with its extensive gas grid finds itself in a fantastic position to switch from natural gas to hydrogen,” it noted.
Dominion Energy Utah (DEU) has launched hydrogen blending in Delta, Utah, as part of an ongoing project. It said it tested a 5% hydrogen blend for almost a year and found “that hydrogen was safe, compatible with current residential appliances and helpful in reducing emissions from appliances using already clean-burning natural gas.” The second phase consists of a blend of up to 5%. It will be introduced to the city and several surrounding towns, serving about 1,800 customers in total.
Ingeteam has developed a new rectifier to power electrolyzers based on insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) technology. The new product is designed for large-scale green hydrogen production plants. The company said it will supply the first units in September for projects in Germany and Spain.
H-TEC Systems has developed a modular hydrogen electrolyzer for large-scale projects above 10 MW in size. The German company said it can combine 10 MW blocks of the modular hydrogen platform into systems with an electrolysis performance of 100 MW and above. The overall system efficiency of 77%, along with high system availability, results in low hydrogen costs, it claimed. The blocks are based on S450 stack technology and the systems are designed for indoor installation.
Toyota and the Japan Fine Ceramic Center have developed a new observation technique in which test samples are placed in an exact simulation of a fuel cell stack, in order to observe the coarsening process at all stages during electricity generation. “The focus of its research is the way in which platinum in the fuel cell stack catalyst ‘coarsens' over time,” said Toyota. “These changes at particle level have an impact on the metal’s performance supporting the chemical reaction between hydrogen fuel and airborne oxygen to create the electricity that powers the vehicle engine.” Coarsening is the process through which particles of different sizes transform into fewer particles with larger average sizes.
Nigerian researchers have shown that energy systems combining diesel generators, solar, wind, hydrogen, and batteries could reach “renewable fractions” of between 98% and 100% in the city of Abuja and the town of Anyigba. “Like the battery bank, the operational analysis of the hydrogen system shows that it can mitigate intermittency of solar PV panels and wind resources,” the team said in “An energy balance and multicriterial approach for the sizing of a hybrid renewable energy system with hydrogen storage,” which was recently published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. “This present study elucidates the prospects and benefits of adopting hydrogen energy storage.”
The European Commission has approved a €450 million ($490 million) scheme in Italy to support the production of renewable hydrogen. The public support will take the form of direct grants to cover investment costs, with a maximum amount of €20 million per project.

It said the new solar projects will be built in the districts of Kot Addu and Muzaffargargh, Punjab province.
Selected developers will be expected to build the plants on a build, own, and operate transfer (BOOT) basis. They have until May 8 to submit project proposals. The deadline was originally set for April 17.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Pakistan had 1,234 MW of installed PV capacity by the end of 2022. Last year, the nation newly installed 166 MW of solar capacity.
NEPRA, the country's energy authority, recently granted 12 generation licenses, with a total capacity of 211.42 MW. Nine of those approvals were granted to solar projects with a total capacity of 44.74 MW.
In May, NEPRA launched the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM), a new model for Pakistan’s wholesale electricity market. The Central Power Purchasing Agency said the model will “introduce competition in the electricity market and provide an enabling environment where multiple sellers and buyers can trade electricity.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/04/what-frances-renewable-energy-acceleration-law-means-for-ppas/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,FRANCE",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"APRIL 4, 2023",What France’s Renewable Energy Acceleration Law means for PPAs,"From pv magazine France
The French government issued the Renewable Energy Acceleration Bill on March 10, with new provisions for the legal framework for renewable-energy PPAs.
“These new rules, mainly listed in article 86, are acting in a double way,” said Céline Ciriani, a lawyer for Gossement Avocats. “On the one hand, with the energy crisis, big electricity consumers need to buy electricity at stable prices. On the other hand, there is a desire on the part of the government to reduce public support, given the drop in production costs and the rise in electricity prices.”
The first important change is related to the possibility of power producers securing administrative authorizations to resell electricity to end consumers or grid operators from next July.
“This authorization for resale aims to verify the financial capacity of the supplier and, in the case of a PPA, to avoid electricity supply failures,” said François Versini-Campinchi, a partner at French law firm LPA-CGR avocats.
However, for special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that manage single assets, this authorization request could become a headache.
“Each producer must describe his portfolio of renewable energy plants, as well as the human, material and financial resources at its disposal or that it undertakes to implement directly to ensure his activity as a supplier on the French market,” said Versini-Campinchi. “The form also requires a description of the activities it plans to outsource. This is totally disproportionate for an SPV that has only one asset.”
This is why legislators have authorized the “designation of a third-party producer or supplier, already holder of such an authorization, so that it assumes, by delegation, with regard to end consumers, the obligations incumbent on electricity suppliers,” said Philippe Jacques, associate lawyer at LPA-CGR avocats. “Given the complexity for an SPV to obtain this authorization, it is likely that this will become the norm and that the majority of producers will use it.”
Jacques said it is difficult not to see this as a measure in favor of utilities and energy suppliers, in order to allow them to maintain some control over the electricity market.
The introduction of this derogation raises other questions. Will it be valid for the entire duration of the PPA, or will it have to be renewed, or even renegotiated, at regular intervals? Will these services result in higher transaction costs? Will intra-group delegations be possible? “One thing is certain – this adds constraints for producers,” said Jacques.
While local authorities could previously establish PPAs in a legal manner, in practice it was almost impossible, due to the limited duration of public energy contracts, which generally spanned two to four years. But from now on, the law takes the needs of local authorities into account. In concrete terms, this means that local authorities will now have the ability to conclude long-term PPAs. This change will make it easier for renewables producers to secure financing, as the duration of PPAs will now have to be aligned with the amortization periods of projects.

The so-called UK Technology Center will develop and test low-carbon heating solutions such as air-source heat pumps.
The new R&D center will house test equipment and environmental chambers to simulate a range of climate conditions, including extremely cold temperatures, according to a statement by Ideal Heating. The research is expected to lead to the development of new heat pump solutions at Ideal Heating’s Hull factory.
The facilities will also include chambers to verify noise and vibration levels and extreme condition testing. The investment will expand Ideal Heating’s R&D workforce from 70 employees at present to around 100 people.
Separately, Dutch heat pump installer Heat Transformers has announced that it has secured €15 million in a Series A funding round to expand its services in the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The financing round was led by the global investment firm Energy Impact Partners (EIP).
Heat Transformers offers a digital platform that connects consumers to a network of heat pump manufacturers and installation services. It also offers maintenance and optimization services, as well as online monitoring. Its partners include Engie, Bosch, and dozens of local and national installers.
“The unprecedented demand for heat pumps in Europe is good news for the energy transition, security of supply and consumers,” said Matthias Dill, CEO of EIP Europe. “As the Netherlands paves the way for the heat pump market and Heat Transformers is a leading player there, it is perfectly placed to play a significant role in decarbonization of heat across the continent.”

For many project owners, repowering, not building, will make the most sense, to increase production capacity, since it uses existing land, grid connection points, and other infrastructure. Repowering helps maximize project return-on-investment (ROI), which can help make up for losses during the recent slowdown. Many of the country’s solar projects are almost 10 years old – 8 GW of assets will offer repowering opportunities in the year ahead.
Identifying the optimal time to repower begins with a smart asset management strategy that addresses predictable and unexpected performance issues as well as opportunities to maximize system returns. Changing market dynamics and emerging applications can make updating PV plants with new technology a profitable decision.
To successfully plan for maximum return on a repowering investment, asset managers should understand the key technical challenges and commercial benefits of repowering activity, as well as the most well-suited technology.
With inverters having a five-year to 10-year lifespan, replacement can become cumbersome as manufacturers quickly move on to products for higher system voltages. Instead of defaulting to legacy inverters which may not be available, are less efficient, lack modern technology, and cost more per Watt than newer products; system owners can use a low-cost adapter so newer inverters added to the existing system can be used at full rated power.
Voltage sag is generally caused by a faulty aspect of a project, such as accelerated module degradation, and results in the DC bus voltage performing below the inverter’s required level to produce AC output at full power. Addressing voltage sag-related issues can be a catch-22: it’s expensive to find matching replacement parts and labor-intensive to replace them, but if nothing is done, system owners lose revenue from reduced energy production. Plus, replacing large numbers of modules or swapping inverters can further complicate voltage mismatch losses. To address the issue, the DC bus voltage needs to be stable and operate at a fixed voltage so it is always within inverter operating range to ensure long-term system health.
Solar modules are installed to withstand harsh outdoor environments but module damage and degradation inevitably occur. Higher-power modules can significantly improve the ROI of a system so replacing panels before they suffer performance problems is a good pre-emptive measure. However, having a mix of modules with different output characteristics creates electrical mismatch in the system, often resulting in considerable performance losses.
Historically, inverter loading ratios (ILRs) – the ratio of DC power of the solar array to the AC power of the inverter – were significantly lower than is common today. Increasing ILR improves revenue because the system can generate more power even during periods of lower sunlight. The problem with increasing the ILR of an existing system is that during periods of high sunlight, the amount of DC current being generated by the PV array can exceed inverter rated capacity. The challenge is to find a way to increase ILR while staying within the operating range of the inverter.
As solar cells and modules naturally degrade over time and at different rates, voltage imbalances and mismatch between strings can occur, affecting system performance. Integrating string-level maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a well known repowering approach to mitigate such impacts. Many multi-megawatt systems employ string inverters to increase the array’s MPPT resolution compared to central inverters but introducing string inverters to an existing system is costly because it often requires expensive, labor-intensive rewiring.
Coupling PV plants with storage is growing in popularity as project owners seek to capitalize on fiscal incentives or solve performance issues where the inverter is frequently curtailing power. Adding storage also helps meet grid-facing demands and changing electricity load profiles. Unfortunately, it involves the aforementioned constraints associated with adding DC power and upgrading inverters. Furthermore, adding storage components to the variable voltage DC bus between the inverter and the PV array can be complex to program, difficult to control, and requires expensive battery converters that must both buck and boost voltage when either charging or discharging.
Repowering is a worthwhile investment for many solar projects but is not without challenges. By identifying the correct supporting technology, system owners can mitigate the aforementioned technical limitations while significantly controlling costs.
DC-DC conversion technology enables project owners to replace legacy inverters without rewiring arrays, and to correct voltage sag without replacing modules or inverters. It eliminates the string mismatch issue when mixing new and legacy modules and system ILR can be increased without overloading the inverter or electrical BOS (balance-of-system equipment) to generate and deliver more energy. DC-DC conversion also recovers energy lost from the degradation of solar cells and modules, as well as other sources of voltage imbalance, in a much more economical way than introducing string inverters. Finally, DC-DC conversion technology enables the addition of DC-coupled storage at a lower cost because battery converters only need to buck voltage when charging and boost voltage when discharging.
A good repowering strategy demonstrates solar assets are not only something to be monitored and maintained but can drive additional revenue with built-in, future-proof flexibility. With access to the features and capabilities DC-DC conversion technology provides, system owners can maximize annual project returns across the life of their portfolio and better compete to meet growing demand for clean energy.

“Our new product adopts digital signal processor (DSP) control and advanced control algorithm, with high response speed and high reliability,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The China-based battery and inverter manufacturer said the new product is available in two versions, with storage capacities of 10 kWh and 20 kWh. The devices have a maximum charging and discharging current of 80 A and 80 kWh of maximum battery power.
It relies on a grid module with a rated input voltage of 220 V to 230 V and an efficiency of more than 95%. The inverter module has 5,000 VA of rated output power, 10,000 VA of peak power, 230 V of rated output voltage, and an efficiency rating above 92%.
The system has a maximum PV input voltage of up to 145 V and a PV operating voltage range of 60 V to 145 V. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) voltage ranges from 60 V to 115 V.
The new product uses forced air cooling for heat dissipation and also features short-circuit protection, over-voltage and under-voltage protection, overload protection, and back-feed protection.
“The battery inverter has two output modes of grid bypass and inverter output and has the function of uninterrupted power supply,” the spokesperson said. “There are four charging modes to choose from: solar only, grid priority, solar priority and hybrid charging.”

“We report the development of a stable device architecture that can be processed with industry-compatible techniques, such as sputtering, evaporation, and slot-die coating,” researcher Anurag Krishna told pv magazine.
The panel is based on 17%-efficient perovskite solar cells built with a p-i-n configuration, an electron transport layer made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx), a perovskite layer deposited via slot-die coating, an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60) and lithium fluoride (LiF), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a copper (Cu) electrode.
The scientists constructed a 56-cell monofacial panel with an active area of 784 cm2, a power conversion efficiency of 13.08%, and a geometrical fill factor (GFF) of about 89%. They then built a second bifacial module by replacing the Cu electrode with one based on indium tin oxide (ITO).
“Under thermal and light stress, the electrode metals like Cu, Au, Ag, etc. are known to diffuse into the perovskite layer and thus compromise long-term stability, whereas devices with transparent conductive electrodes have shown much better stability under accelerated aging,” they explained. “The ITO has lower conductivity as compared to metal electrodes, which can lead to resistive losses and consequently a lower fill factor. To minimize that, we created a module design with reduced subcell width leading to 93 subcells.”
The bifacial panel has an aperture area of 781 cm2 and is able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 11.9%.
“Moreover, the encapsulated bifacial mini-modules (4 cm2) developed exhibited high tolerance to the IEC 61215-based damp heat [85 C, 85% relative humidity (RH)], the best ones retaining around 92% of initial efficiency after 1,000 hours,” Krishna said, noting that interfacial passivation could further increase the efficiency of the device.
The researchers said the results show that the proposed device stack is thermally stable, and that encapsulation is robust enough to ensure stability.
The academics presented the module in “Stable Device Architecture With Industrially Scalable Processes for Realizing Efficient 784 cm2 Monolithic Perovskite Solar Modules,” which was recently published in IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.
“This work is an important milestone in the development of up-scalable manufacturing technologies for perovskite photovoltaics,” said Krishna.

California-based Enteligent has introduced a new rapid shutdown device (RSD) with module-level power optimizers and a production monitoring system.
The Enteligent NMax Rapid Shutdown with Optimization device can be attached to a single panel, or it can be paired with two panels. The paired unit can support up to 900 W of maximum power. It offers a pass-through efficiency of 99.8% in full sun, and a maximum power consumption of 1.8 W.
Power optimizers are designed to overcome inherent limitations in PV string installations. In traditional stringed solar arrays, an entire string of panels can only produce as much as the weakest link in the string. This means that shading, soiling, or faults in the panels can severely reduce electricity generation. Power optimizers avoid this issue, allowing each individual panel to achieve its highest output without being affected by others in the array configuration. 
The RSD/optimizer dynamically switches in and out of optimization mode when required, resulting in an average of 10% higher electricity from a typical rooftop solar installation, the company said.  
The NMax model also has module-level monitoring for reporting solar generation statistics. The monitoring allows installers to validate the panels are functioning properly, helps service providers to diagnose and troubleshoot module issues, and helps homeowners to monitor performance. 
The model monitors information such as voltage and current inputs and outputs, status errors, internal temperatures, and performance modes, such as pass-through and optimization. The rapid shutdown offers real-time response management. 
Enteligent claims that the new product offers a competitive alternative to the power optimizer space, which has long been dominated by market leaders.
The April issue of pv magazine, due out tomorrow, takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
“Currently, over 80% of North American rooftop solar installations benefit from power optimization and panel-level monitoring, but this solution is only available from the two leading solution providers who form a market duopoly,” said Sean Burke, chief executive officer of Enteligent.“It also brings alternatives to the solar installer community, who are eager to provide new offerings to differentiate from the large regional and national dealers.”
The product is available for order on the company’s website and sells for $65 or $70 per unit, before tax. The Enteligent NMax RSD with Optimization is compliant with the NEC 2017 and 2020 and UL 1741 standards. It has a NEMA Type 6P enclosure and is SunSpec RSD certified. The company says it will be available in the third quarter, and will be sold through major industry distributors, such as Power Store and ABC Supply.

On quick inspection, RELA Australia looks like a solar lease buyout company, which it is. But its scope, especially for new projects, travels deeper. The company has set up what it describes as a “marketplace” for willing landholders and developers.
In a way, the model is an inversion of the business-as-usual approach. That is, interested landowners approach RELA, and it then assesses the viability of their property as a developer would, by considering things like grid-connection points and capacity, solar and wind resources. If a property is suitable, RELA approaches developers in a closed tender format, iterating the requirements of the landholder. If a match is made, RELA continues to work with the landowner to assess proposals, table lease contracts, and manage the process.
“We bring the same skillset as the developer, but to the benefit of the landowner,” RELA Australia Director Michael Katz told pv magazine. “For the marketplace to function, landowners need to be equipped with same resources and knowledge as the developers have.”
Broadly speaking, the philosophy behind the company focuses on the idea that by better informing landowners, greater confidence and trust can be developed, and this ultimately helps to realize superior projects more smoothly.
This same sentiment was largely borne out in a study published by the New South Wales government in March on the renewable sector’s land-use conflicts with agriculture. In the review, the government said that far more effort needs to go into providing “accessible” information to landholders and their communities. It suggested that both governments and the renewable energy sector should publish standard agreement “templates,” as well as timely indicative lease prices to boost transparency.
Katz and RELA Australia Director Co-Director Eren Rimmer both have backgrounds in renewables, and they saw that they could leverage their industry knowledge to make projects happen in a different way. They say the company has “struck a chord” with landowners, but developers have also been excited by the concept, as it cuts the notoriously tricky human aspect out of their workloads.

India is set to install 16.8 GW of new solar capacity in 2023. The new additions will likely include about 14 GW of utility-scale solar projects and 2.8 GW of rooftop solar projects, according to a new report by JMK Research.
In 2022,  India installed 11.4 GW of utility-scale solar capacity and 1.9 GW of rooftop PV, aggregating to 13.3 GW in 2022, said the analysts. As of Dec. 31, 2022, India’s cumulative utility-scale solar capacity stood at about 53.6 GW installed, while another 44.6 GW was in the pipeline.
In 2022, JinkoSolar was the largest module supplier in India. It was followed by Trina Solar and Longi. Domestic players also recorded significant sales increases from April 2022 onwards, following the imposition of a 40% basic customs duty. Waaree, Adani, and Vikram Solar were the leading domestic suppliers in 2022.
String inverter shipments reached 10,302 MW (AC) in the January-December 2022 period. Sungrow led the market with a 20.9% share, followed by Huawei and Solis. Central inverter shipments reached 5,716 MW, led by Sineng, Sungrow, and Fimer.
NTPC, Adani, and Avaada were the top three utility-scale solar developers in 2022. Tata Power and L&T were the leading third-party engineering, procurement and construction contractors for utility-scale PV.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/04/spain-portugal-to-cap-wholesale-electricity-prices-until-end-of-year/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,EUROPE,PORTUGAL,SPAIN",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 4, 2023","Spain, Portugal to cap wholesale gas prices until end of year","The Portuguese government has revealed that the European Commission has informally approved its joint request with Spain for the extension of the so-called “Iberian exception” until the end of 2023.
The mechanism artificially reduces wholesale electricity prices on the Iberian Peninsula by capping the price of natural gas for electricity generation. It went into force in June 2022 and was scheduled to end in May 2023. However, the European Commission has now given the green light to maintain the mechanism until Dec. 31, 2023.
Portugal and Spain’s proposal includes a new progression of the gas price for electricity generation, from €55 ($60)/MWh in March to the limit value of €65/MWh in December, with monthly increases of €1.10/MWh.
Originally, the Iberian exception was designed so that the price of gas would be capped at €40/MWh until December 2022, and then subject to monthly increases of €5/MWh until May, when it would reach a value of €65/MWh. However, the price curve will now be smoother, with €65/MWh to be reached in December.
The new price caps until the end of the year are as follows:
April: €56.10/MWh
May: €57.20/MWh
June: €58.30/MWh
July: €59.40/MWh
August: €60.60/MWh
September: €61.70/MWh
October: €62.80/MWh
November: €63.90/MWh
December: €65.00/MWh
“So far, the mechanism has reduced the price of electricity by about €43/MWh, which has translated into a benefit for Portuguese customers exposed to the wholesale electricity market of about €570 million,” the Portuguese Ministry for the Environment and Climate Action said on its LinkedIn account.
The original Iberian exception required an investment of €8.4 billion – €6.3 billion for Spain and €2.1 billion for Portugal – according to a European Commission statement. It was to be financed by income from the Spanish transmission system operator related to cross-border electricity trade between France and Spain, and a charge imposed by Spain and Portugal on buyers that would benefit from the measure.
The investment that will now be needed for the Iberian exception extension has yet to be publicized.
