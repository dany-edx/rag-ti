The demonstrator will provide backup power to the campus data center and will be powered by green hydrogen.
“The demonstration stationary fuel cell unit has a capacity of approximately 500 kW and reuses the fuel cell systems of previously leased Honda Clarity Fuel Cell vehicles, with a design that allows the output to increase every 250 kW packaged with four fuel cells,” Honda said in a statement. “It features the flexibility to change the layout of the fuel cell units to suit the installation environment and to accommodate cubic, L-shaped, Z-shaped, and other packaging configurations.”
The Japanese group said the Clarity Fuel Cell's fuel cell stack is four times more impact-resistant than other fuel cells, as it supports the cells with a fastening bar. It is designed to prevent hydrogen leakage in collisions. The Clarity fuel cell features a fuel cell powertrain, a hydrogen/air supply system, an air compressor, a fuel cell voltage converter unit (FCVCU) and a drive motor.
“With the Clarity Fuel Cell, improved cell performance allows a 30% reduction of the number of cells, and improved cell structure allows a 20% size reduction of each cell,” said the company. “These improvements lead to a 33% smaller fuel cell stack.”
In early February, Honda revealed plans to launch an all-new fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) based on the CR-V 5-seater SUV next year. It said it will also sell its fuel cell systems on the open market to promote its hydrogen fuel cell systems, in cooperation with General Motors. This will allow it to reach economies of scale.
Honda said fuel cell stack costs should become comparable with diesel engines by 2030, at about one-third to half of current costs.
“We have identified four core domains we will focus on during the early phase of our hydrogen business: Honda FCEV models, commercial vehicles, stationary power stations and construction machinery,” said Arata Ichinose, head of business development at Honda.
The company will also collaborate with original equipment manufacturers on commercial vehicles and construction machinery in Japan and China.

“The TOPCon series is now in full production, and it is expected to reach an ongoing capacity of 4 GW of components by the end of 2023, providing enough volume to supply the market,” the company said in a statement released, noting that the new new producst can be used either for distributed generation PV projects and or ground-mounted power stations.
The new SIV N-TOPCon series comes in four versions, with power outputs between 565 W and 580 W. The power conversion efficiency ranges from 21.87% and 22.45%.
The open-circuit voltage ranges from 51.50 V to 52.10 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.89 A and 14.07 A. Each module measures 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs 32.0 kg.
The panels feature a junction box with an IP 68 rating and a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy. Both sides of the modules are covered with anti-reflecting, semi-transparent 2 mm glass. They have an operating temperature of between -40 C and 85 C, and a temperature coefficient is -0.30 % per degree Celsius.
The panels can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V. The company offers a 30-year power output guarantee for 87.4% of the initial yield and a 15-year product warranty. It claims a bifaciality factor of up to 80%, with power gains ranging from 10% to 30%.
“With the expansion of the capacity layout of N-type TOPCon modules, Seraphim will continue to develop and sell PV modules with high conversion efficiency and high quality to meet the demand,” said Seraphim President Polaris Li.
Seraphim's current module production capacity stands at roughly 5 GW. It is primarily based in China, but it has significant cell and module capacity in South Africa. It also has plans to set up a solar module factory in Vietnam.

The technology will be powered by electricity from renewable sources such as solar, hydro, geothermal and wind, according to a MAN statement. It will produce steam to dry dairy ingredients for Frontera, a dairy cooperative based in New Zealand.
“After integration into Fonterra’s production infrastructure, the heat pump could produce more than 30 metric tons of process steam per hour, equivalent to a thermal output of 25 MW,” MAN said in a statement without adding more technical details. The dairy farm’s CO2 production could be reduced by 60,000 metric tons annually.
The first step of the project will carry out an engineering study to develop the integration of the heat pump solution into the cooperative’s existing milk powder production. This study is expected to be completed by the end of April 2023, according to MAN. The findings will then be used to design a heat pump system at one of Fonterra’s manufacturing sites.
“With Fonterra being the third biggest milk ingredient producer in the world, we are very much looking forward to supporting their decarbonization journey with our expertise and cutting-edge technology solutions,” said Uwe Lauber, CEO of MAN Energy Solutions.
The dairy producer announced the installation of a biomass boiler to replace a coal boiler at one of its sites last year, which is expected to become operational at the end of November 2023. Its investment in heat pumps using renewable energy sources is part of its commitment to transition away from coal in its manufacturing operations.

French manufacturer Carbon said its TOPCon and IBC solar module factory in Fos-sur-Mer, in southern France's Bouches-du-Rhône department, will be fully operational by 2025. Upon completion, it will have an annual production capacity of 5 GW of solar cells and 3.5 GW of PV modules.
Carbon said it considered 15 sites throughout France for the project. It will build the factory on a site that benefits from direct road, rail, river and maritime connections. The site is in the heart of an industrial area that is implementing an incentive policy to encourage the establishment of sustainable industrial projects.
“Carbon’s announcement comes at a key time,” said Agnès Pannier-Runacher, minister for energy transition. “France and Europe must quickly reposition themselves in the photovoltaic value chain so as not to switch from one dependency to another.”
The factory is scheduled to begin manufacturing by the end of 2025, with plans for full operations in 2026. It will include three production buildings focusing on wafers, cells and modules. It will make products based either on interdigitated back contact (IBC) tech or tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) tech.
French research institutes CEA-Liten, INES, and IPVF will support Carbon, in cooperation with German research center ISC Konstanz. The manufacturer aims to reach a production capacity of 30 GW by 2030.
The €1.5 billion investment will be financed through a combination of equity, public funds, and bank financing. Shareholders have already committed nearly €5 million for the project, which is now in an initial fundraising phase, to be completed by the end of the first half of this year.

Spain deployed approximately 8,312 MW of new renewable energy capacity in 2022, according to provisional figures from local renewable energy association APPA Renovables.
In total, 5,663 MW of large scale renewable energy power plants were connected to the grid. Wind accounted for about 1,382 MW of that, along with 4,281 MW of PV.
Self-consumption projects accounted for roughly 2,649 MW of the total capacity.
José María González, the general director of APPA Renovables, has urged the national government to deal with potential overcapacity and price cannibalization, as Spain has already reached a cumulative PV capacity of more 25 GW. If investments are not made in storage, grid expansion and management, low prices and solar curtailment will remain big risks for PV system owners.
APPA Renovables said that prices have sometimes fallen below €10 ($10.64)/MWh in the past year. This situation will only get worse in the summer months, when consumption could reach 45 GW, it said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/06/solar-desalination-via-photovoltaic-thermal-energy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 6, 2023",Solar desalination via photovoltaic-thermal energy,"A research team in the United Kingdom has looked at how the combination of photovoltaics and solar thermal (ST) energy could improve the efficiency and viability of different solar desalination processes. The scientists said their work builds on past research showing the advantage of combining PV and solar thermal energy for desalination purposes.
“However, most previous PVT-desalination studies to-date have focused on the development of system integration solutions between conventional PVT collectors and desalination modules, and have not considered opportunities for synergistic electro-thermal coupling mechanisms,” the scientists said, in reference to the novelty of their study. “Variation in the use of heat and electricity in desalination can improve the performance of the system even when it is operated at similar solar-energy efficiencies.”
The researchers made a distinction between desalination technologies that are preferable for use with electricity, and technologies that rely on heat. The former are reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis (ED), mechanical vapor compression (MVC) and capacitive deionization (CDI) solutions, while the latter are multiple-stage flash (MSF) and multiple-effect distillation (MED), and membrane distillation (MD) technologies.
They described all available photovoltaic and solar thermal technologies and provided a short description of the integration mechanisms of non-synergistically integrated PVT-desalination systems. They also noted that their paper is designed to investigate new mechanisms that smartly co-use electricity and heat from photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems.
Through preliminary techno-economic analysis based on performance and cost metrics, the scientists assessed several PVT-desalination integrated solutions and their levelized cost of desalinated water (RLCOW). They compared the data with figures from pure PV desalination or ST desalination systems. They also assumed that the capital and operational costs of desalination systems, accessory equipment and hydraulic systems are the same between PV-RO and ST-MD systems and alternative PVT systems.
“However, the two variables considered are: (1) the water productivity of PVT-desalination relative to PV desalination and ST desalination; and (2) the capital costs of PVT systems relative to PV and ST systems,” they said. “Currently, the cost of a commercially available PVT system is usually 1.5 to two times that of an equivalent PV system due to the more complicated structure and the requirement for additional accessories of PVT systems.”
Through their analysis, the researchers found that the most common desalination technology – reverse osmosis (RO) – may see its RLCOW reduced by 20% if energized by PVT systems compared to pure PV installations.
“Given the dominance of RO in newly installed desalination capacity and the prominent scalability of MD as a thermally driven desalination process, the potential water cost saving indicates opportunities for immediate positive impact, which could help address water challenges in off-grid area,” they stated.
They presented their findings in “Synergies and potential of hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal desalination technologies,” published in Desalination. The research team includes academics from the Imperial College London and King's College London.
“More research should be conducted to elucidate the electro-thermal coupling mechanism and to develop parametric theories/models for the co-use of electricity and heat in different desalination processes,” they concluded.

Agrivoltaics solve at least two critical needs. Solar provides the renewable energy needed to mitigate climate change impacts while meeting global energy demand. And crops grown alongside solar help to feed the burgeoning global population, which is anticipated to grow to nearly 10 billion people by 2050, according to the United Nations.
Cornell University researchers have examined agrivoltaics to find out if there is merit to the perception that co-located sites will see major tradeoffs between food and energy production. Their study has shown how solar and crop production cannot only exist side by side, but how co-location improves the microclimates of farms and the surface temperature of solar modules.
The researchers have developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) microclimate model, which they evaluated against experimental data to investigate the effects of panel height, light reflection (albedo), and how much water is evaporated (evapotranspiration) in a PV site. They published their results in Applied Energy.
“We now have, for the first time, a physics-based tool to estimate the costs and benefits of co-locating solar panels and commercial agriculture from the perspective of increased power conversion efficiency and solar-panel longevity,” said lead author Henry Williams, a doctoral student in Cornell University's engineering department.
The team demonstrated an agrivoltaic facility with soybeans growing under solar modules mounted about 13 feet (3.9 meters) above the ground. The project resulted in solar module temperature reductions of up to 50 F (10 C), compared to solar farms mounted just 1.6 feet over bare soil.

Its BESS subsystem is intended for integration into the BESS applications of OEMs. It can be scaled up to hundreds of megawatt-hours.
“As our solution is application agnostic, we see huge potential for its adoption,” says Hannes Norrgren, president of Volvo Penta Industrial. “Together with OEMs, our solution provides possibilities to store energy from and add resiliency to renewable solar or wind-powered sources, opening new business models that appeal to end customers on their road to net-zero emissions.”
Volvo Penta's  subsystem solution includes a battery system, battery management, monitoring, thermal management, power distribution box, and cabling. It says it “demonstrates high-power output from an energy-dense and small footprint” and is optimized for tough environmental conditions.
It remains unclear which battery cells will be used in the BESS component.
“The batteries themselves are lithium based and may take in different geometries and power output pending the manufacturer's BESS set up,” a Volvo Penta spokesperson told pv magazine.
Last year, the Volvo Group revealed plans to invest in battery cell and pack manufacturing around the world to secure capacity and large-scale series production. It initiated processes to establish cell manufacturing production in Sweden's Skaraborg region and opened its first battery assembly plant in Ghent, Belgium, where it uses cells and modules from Samsung SDI to make its battery packs.
Volvo Penta’s subsystem solution will be first made available to customers in North America and Europe, followed by other markets.
