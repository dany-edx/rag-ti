The contract for 13,849 Trina Vanguard 2P solar trackers will cover two PV plants: a 417 MW installation in Mesaieed Industrial City, and a 458 MW installation in Ras Laffan Industrial City. They are both expected to start commercial operations by the end of 2024.
Chint has revealed that it will sell up to 8 GW of its residential solar assets by the end of 2023, in order to streamline its assets and optimize its business model. Chint is China's largest private investor in C&I and residential solar assets.
Huasun said it supplied 50 MW of its G12 Himalayan heterojunction (HJT) solar panels for China’s largest HJT solar plant, which was recently commissioned in Weifang, Shandong province.
Haiyuan Material said it will invest CNY 8.02 billion ($1.1 billion) in 15 GW of new solar cell production capacity and 3 GW of supporting manufacturing lines at its factory in Chuzhou, Zhejiang province. The first phase will include 10 GW of TOPCon cell lines, valued at CNY 4.47 billion. The second phase will include 5 GW of HJT cell lines and 3 GW of PV panel capacity, at an investment of CNY 3.55b billion. The company says that it aims to commission 4 GW of TOPCon cell capacity by the end of September 2023.
Longi Solar has claimed a world-record efficiency rating of 26.56% for a gallium-doped, p-type HJT solar cell. It said it also achieved a 26.09% efficiency rating for an indium-free HJT cell. Both of the new cells are based on M6 wafers.

Jenny Chase: We have been surprised by the strong build in China, especially for residential and commercial – we initially expected 99 GW new build in China this year and have upped that to 126 GW (DC). Our current estimate for the year's build is 268 GW (DC). Europe has bought a lot of modules – well over 72 GW – though we expect it has only installed around 42 GW, so there is considerable inventory.
 
What were the biggest surprises for you this year?
How high polysilicon and module prices have remained right up to the end of the year, indicating strong buying activity counteracting the effect of increased supply. We were also surprised the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed in the United States. The incentives in the law are very generous.
Will a shortage of components affect the development of global PV markets?
It's still not as easy as it could be to get transformers and inverters, and module prices must continue to fall. But these are not major bottlenecks.
What price development do you expect in the coming year?
We expect the polysilicon price to fall from the current $35/kg to $10-$15/kg next year, and free-on-board (FOB) module prices to $0.22/W in markets without major trade barriers.
How will the expansion figures develop in 2023 throughout the world – especially in Europe?
We expect 316 GW new build worldwide, and 48 GW in Europe next year.

The projects must be at least 1 MW in size. At certain sites, capacities could range from 10 MW to 30 MW. The tender is open to companies from any country. Interested developers have until Feb. 26, 2023, to submit their bids.
Selected projects will be granted 25-year PPAs. In March, the NEA set a maximum PPA price of NPR 5.96 ($0.043)/kWh. Since 2017, the utility has concluded PPAs with developers at a rate of NPR 7.30/kWh. However, project developers oppose the price gap and have refused to participate in the tender if prices aren't raised, according to local media reports.
“Our executive committee meeting reached a conclusion after the calculation that less than NPR 7.30 per unit is not feasible to recover the cost in 10 years,” said Prakash Bikram Basnet, the president of the Solar Electric Manufacturers Association of Nepal. “We have also decided that our member companies won’t participate in the bid invited by the NEA until our demand is addressed.”
Only developers that offer prices equal to or lower than NPR 5.96/kWh will be eligible to sell electricity to NEA after developing their projects, according to the tender notice. Local media reports indicate that NEA is not in favor of revising the rate. Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai, an NEA spokesperson, said the authority set the PPA rate based on global market trends.
“Those who want to participate in the bid are welcome,” he said. “We have not forced them to join the bid.”
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Nepal had installed 93 MW of cumulative solar capacity by the end of 2021.

Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) has confirmed that it has acquired a suite of projects that make up the Bowen Renewable Energy Hub, a giga-scale integrated generation and storage project under development in the Australian state of Queensland.
The project, which will be renamed the Capricornia Energy Hub, will integrate 1.4 GW of pumped hydro projects with more than 1 GW of solar, a 500 MW wind farm, battery energy storage, and a hydrogen electrolyzer to support export-scale hydrogen production.
The original developers, Renewable Energy Partners and Bowen River Utilities, said the first stage of the pumped hydro project was designed to deliver 750 MW and 16 hours of storage (12,000 MWh). The second stage is expected to deliver an additional 12,000 MWh of storage.
CIP Australia Vice President Matthew Stuchbery said the energy hub aligns with the company's strategy to pursue multiple energy storage technologies to support Australia’s switch to renewables.
“We are absolutely investing in things like battery storage, but we’re of the view that a portfolio approach even for storage is going to be required to meet Australia’s needs,” he said. “Batteries are a technology that are fit for purpose for shorter time periods, but there is no other commercial technology available that operates in the same time period to the same scale as pumped hydro does.”
The original developers indicated that the first stage of the pumped hydro project will be online by 2028. Stuchbery said CIP would review the timeline, but will ensure that the project remains on track to deliver large-scale storage by the end of the decade.
“We would be targeting a final investment decision in the middle of this decade,” he said.
CIP, a major player in developing renewable energy projects throughout Europe, said it will now look to advance the approvals process and geotechnical investigations. It will continue to work with Queensland state-owned utility CS Energy, which signed a deal earlier this year with the previous project proponents for a potential power purchase agreement. The investment adds to CIP’s rapidly growing pipeline of renewable energy projects in Australia, which includes a stake in the 2.2 GW Star of the South wind project in the Bass Strait, off the coast of Victoria.
CIP has also partnered with Hydrogen Renewables Australia to develop the 5 GW Murchison Renewable Hydrogen Project near Kalbarri, Western Australia.

India-based Sunbond Energy has unveiled a new line of monocrystalline PERC modules. Its Pacific series has power outputs ranging from 520 W to 550 W and efficiencies of 19.83% to 21.23%.
The modules are built with 144 half-cut M10 cells and 10 busbars. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 49.15 V to 49.45 V, and the short-circuit current is 13.35 A to 13.90 A.
The modules measure 2,300 mm x 1,140 mm x 40 mm and weigh 28.5 kg. They feature IP67/68 junction box, an anodized aluminum frame with a twin wall profile, trilayer backsheet, low-shrinkage PID-resistant ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulation, and high transmittance anti-reflective glass. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V DC. The temperature coefficient is -0.39% per degree Celsius.
