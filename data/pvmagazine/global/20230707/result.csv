Kai Schuhmacher spent years traveling around Germany as a consultant for  PV system owners. He said the question that all customers immediately ask is: “When will my photovoltaic system pay off?” The answer depends on many individual factors, with the amortization period generally spanning from eight to 16 years.
Schumacher said that many consultants currently still carry out these calculations in Excel spreadsheets that they create themselves, which reportedly is the best way to give their customers the most precise answer possible.
“The online tools that have been available on various websites for years have not really convinced me,” he stated.
He always wanted a uniform and, at the same time, simple calculation method that can be used directly at the customer's site. He now claims to have developed such a tool himself and called it Amortisator. It is an app that can be bought initially in the Apple Store, and soon in the Google Play Store, and is available in German, English, Spanish, and French.
He said the app is aimed primarily at customer advisors and costs €9.99 ($10.9) per month. It can be canceled on a monthly basis.
The app offers advisors and customers a quick amortization calculation, which can also be sent to non-users of the app by email. For the calculation, it utilizes inputs such as system performance and size, as well as details on rooftops and financing requirements.
Schuhmacher also wants to use the app to give potential photovoltaic customers the opportunity to find a customer advisor in their area. In this regard, there is an integrated chat that customers can use to contact them. Furthermore, the app reportedly helps customers evaluate previous consulting services. All of this is free of charge for those who are potentially interested in photovoltaics, Schumacher said.

French railway operator SNCF said this week that it has set up SNCF Renouvelables, a new clean energy unit.
SNFC, with its fleet of 15,000 daily trains and its 3,000 stations and industrial buildings, is France's top electricity consumer, using 9 TWh per year, including 8 TWh for train electrification.
SNCF Renouvelables plans to allocate 1,000 hectares of its land to develop 1 GW of PV plants, aiming to meet 20% of its electricity needs by 2030. This initial phase constitutes a small portion of SNCF's total land ownership of approximately 100,000 hectares, making it the country's second-largest landowner after the state.
“Energy consumption costs have more than doubled in 2022 and 2023,” said SNCF president Jean-Pierre Farrandou. “This represents more than €700 million ($764.6 million) just for the energy used for train traction in these two years.”
SNCF already produces its own electricity, with solar panels on the roofs of its stations or in shades, via its subsidiary SNCF Gares et Connexions.
Its SNCF Energie unit has also been piloting a “corporate PPA” program since 2018. It has already signed several PPAs, including one with French energy giant EDF, one with Switzerland's Axpo, and one with French independent power producer Reden.

The provisions could be implemented in July 2024, with initial details expected to be announced in September of this year. It appears that the ban will cover nature grounds and agricultural land.
“With this unclear statement, the dutch solar sector is unable to develop solar plants on agricultural land,” a spokesperson for Dutch PV association Holland Solar told pv magazine. “We think this will have a great impact on of the energy transition.”
The trade body said in a press release that the Dutch authorities implemented initial soft restrictions for solar parks on agricultural land in 2019. These regulations stipulated that large-scale solar projects had to adhere to the “Zonneladder” preference scheme, commonly used by local entities, but it has not yet been formalized as part of the law.
The preference scheme, known as the “Zonneladder,” prioritizes solar rooftop locations over ground-mounted projects. It establishes a hierarchy for assessing location suitability, with large solar parks only allowed if no higher-ranking alternatives are viable.
Holland Solar said the new ban could harm farmers and solar developers. It also noted the importance of local administrations having a final say on authorizations.
“Municipalities can properly assess the situation on site,” it said. “There could be exceptions to the ban, but they have not yet been determined.”

“Built with tall racks and no fence, the project enables integration of green energy and husbandry by using the upper space for photovoltaic power generation and the meadow for grazing at the same time,” said the company.
It did not explain how PV power generation has been integrated with animal farming. The facility covers an area of approximately 930,000 square meters and is located at an altitude of 3,000 meters, the company said, noting that it owns a 100% stake in the project.
Despite recent plans to expand its renewable energy business, CNOOC has prioritized its oil exploration and development efforts, with production of 163.9 million barrels of oil in the first quarter of 2023, up 8.6% year on year increase.
“During the period, the company made 2 new discoveries and successfully appraised 6 oil and gas structures,” CNOOC said in its financial report. “The construction of the key projects progressed steadily. Among the nine new projects scheduled to commence production during the year, 5 projects have started installation.”

“VTA leads to compact, dense, and hard morphology while suppressing trap states at surfaces and grain boundaries, which are key culprits for exciton losses,” they stated, emphasizing the importance of the second step to produce a high quality perovskite layer. “As indoor light intensity is at least 300 times lower than that of sunlight, dense and homogeneous perovskite formation enticed by vacuum thermal annealing is valuable.”
The researchers implemented the process via a vacuum flask connected to a vacuum pump with controllable pressure and located on top of a hotplate to regulate the temperature. They used a perovskite material known as FA0.45MA0.49Cs0.06Pb(I0.62Br0.32Cl0.06)3 treated with bromide and chloride. After the treatment, its energy bandgap was 1.80 eV.
They built the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), the perovskite absorber, a hole transporting layer (HTL) made of Spiro-OMeTAD, a carbon top electrode, and another FTO layer. The device has an active area of 0.04 cm2.
Tested under indoor light at 1000 lux, the cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 27.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.93 V, and a short-circuit current of 0.16 mA/cm2, with peak efficiency reaching up to 32.0%. A reference device without VTA treatment achieved an efficiency of 25.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V, and a short-circuit current of of 0.16 mA/cm2, with peak efficiency reaching 30.7%.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
“VTA leads to reduced surface roughness and electronic traps both at the bulk and the surface,” the group said referring to the superior performance of the VTA-based cell. “VTA opens doors for robust perovskite formation and could practically be adapted for various perovskite compositions towards desirable optoelectronic applications for modern society.”
The solar cell is introduced in the study “Robust perovskite formation via vacuum thermal annealing for indoor perovskite solar cells,” published in Scientific Reports.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/07/using-existing-fences-as-near-zero-cost-racking-solution-for-pv-deployment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 7, 2023",Using existing fences as near-zero-cost racking solution for PV deployment,"A US-Canadian group of scientists has suggested using existing fences in animal farms as a low-cost racking solution for solar modules.
“This is perhaps the lowest-cost approach to racking,” the research's corresponding author, Joshua M. Pearce, told pv magazine. “What we did is show that at least one PV module between two upright posts is mechanically acceptable for every type of conventional farm fencing. In this case, the racking is almost free.”
The researchers identified three main typologies of fencing: fences based on multiple battens placed between the main posts to support the fence wire; fences using posts on which the fence wires or mesh are attached; and fences utilizing prefabricated meshes of various designs suitable to the need and sometimes aesthetics. “Normally for fences, high tensile steel wires and mild steel wire are predominantly used,” they noted. “Their diametric dimensions are generally 4 mm, 3.15 mm and 2.5 mm for high tensile (HT) wire and mild steel wires.”
In order to ascertain if an existing fence may be used for solar deployment, developers should first investigate if the fence can withstand a certain wind load in a specific location with the addition of PV panels, as well as the region's topological, geographical and climatic challenges. In this regard, the group said special attention should be given to line post size and spacing play, adding that the main factors to be carefully considered are the height of the fence, footing depth, design and size of mesh fabric, as well as the material strength of the posts.
The scientists also explained that wind load measurements should be taken via the Main Wind Force Resisting System (MWFRS) and Components & Cladding (C&C) procedures, as well as by the Open Source Wind Load Calculator, which is a tool used to calculate the wind load on a fence in a given region in the United States. “The program outputs the wind loads in terms of the base shear force in pound force (lbf) and base moment in feet pound force (ft- lbf),” they specified, adding that they calculated for a range of wind loads from 80 mph to 150 mph (129 km/h to 241 km/h).
The academics conducted a series of field tests using three Cheetah HC 72 M monocrystalline PERC panels manufactured by China-based JinkoSolar. They said their installation was performed quickly by two people, with the mounting of a single module requiring seven minutes and a total of four zip-ties.

They also conducted a series of simulations for retrofitting existing farm fencing for a wide range of farms, including sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and alpaca, and found solar projects based on the proposed approach would be economically viable in the United States.
“The cost of the racking retrofit is only the cost of four stainless steel zip ties per module, which can be purchased in 120 packs for $11 or about 37 cents per module,” they explained. “If the modules range in power from 250 to 500 W then the racking cost of an existing fence is less than a penny a Watt.”

Pearce said the research group also laid out what would be an optimal inverter strategy depending on how much energy a farmer would need. “Small-scale farmers can use the free ebook to set up the design for the system, do the install with metal zip ties themselves, and then only need to call an electrician to attach to the grid,” he concluded.
The scientists presented their findings in the paper “The potential for fencing to be used as low-cost solar photovoltaic racking,” published in Solar Energy. “Future work is necessary to determine the full scope of the benefits of this approach of vertical PV agricultural fencing on a global scale,” they said, looking forward to how to improve the proposed methodology.
The research team comprises academics from the Western University in Canada and the Michigan Technological University in the United States.

What looks like a moment of calm – arresting almost six months of successive, sometimes-dramatic downslides – reflects a market busily assessing what happens next.
Industry players diverged on where they saw prices heading after an important polysilicon conference in China last week, with bearishness as the predominant mood. Low values around the CNY60/kg mark, generally regarded as China polysilicon’s cost figure, continued to be the majority of figures revealed during OPIS’ market survey early this week, although talk of a price rebound has emerged.

A source who saw polysilicon climb to CNY67/kg read the lower prices of the prior two weeks as manufacturers are clearing inventories before the second quarter ended. One polysilicon maker’s inventory, estimated at 10,000 MT last week, was said to have halved by the week’s end. Power cuts have affected the operating rates of monocrystalline plants, a source said, noting cuts in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, and claiming the same in Leshan, Sichuan.
Discussions of price upticks even extended downstream. Wafer prices have found their bottom, concurred most market participants, and the wafer segment is starting to signal possible notches up to come. Numerous sources confirmed to OPIS that limited new wafer capacity will come online in the second half of 2023, potentially keeping more than 140 GW of annual nameplate capacity off the market, according to OPIS data.
Chatter aside, the specter of oversupply continues to loom over the China polysilicon market. “It is obvious that polysilicon is in excess,” one contact reiterated, while another said that overall “stockpiles are very large.” A major producer’s new June capacity of around 120,000 MT has been delayed, but only till the third quarter.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The scientists also sought to answer questions about water retention and grassland ecosystem resistance to weather extremes such as droughts or heat waves but the answer to this was not clear at the end of the study.
“Indeed, we did not find that the agrivoltaic array increased grassland resistance to drought,” the corresponding author Steven A. Kannenberg told pv magazine. “However, as noted in the paper, I would like to clarify the possibility that this is because the structure of the model does not allow the grass to die back and then regrow after drought, which is commonly observed in natural settings,”
To discover more about the impact of the reduction in light availability caused by solar photovoltaic arrays on grassland photosynthesis, the researchers used a combination of field measurements and a well-established plant hydraulic and soil hydrology model to simulate grassland physiology and hourly carbon-water fluxes over a 23-year time period.
They found that although the agrivoltaic array reduced light availability by 38%, photosynthesis and above ground net primary productivity were reduced by 6 to 7%. Another metric analyzed by the researchers, evapotranspiration, showed a 1.3% decrease compared to a reference land plot with no solar plant.
The grassland plot in the study is dominated by smooth brome (Bromus inermis), a common C3 pasture grass, said the researchers. It is located in Colorado with an east-west oriented 1.2 MW plant equipped with single-axis trackers, installed at a flat panel height of 1.8 m with 5.2 m between rows. The paper notes that care was taken to minimize the impact on soils and vegetation. For example, the land was not graded for installation.
The researchers said the minimal changes in carbon-water cycling occurred largely because plant photosynthetic traits underneath the solar panels changed to take advantage of the dynamic shading environment. They conclude that agrivoltaic systems can serve as a scalable way to expand solar energy production while maintaining ecosystem function in managed grasslands, especially in climates where water is more limiting than light.
“We are planning to continue this research. This paper is one of the first of hopefully many that will come out of work done in Colorado. And we would always be interested in hearing about research from industry on this topic,” corresponding author Steven A. Kannenberg told pv magazine.
The scientists presented their findings in “Grassland carbon-water cycling is minimally impacted by a photovoltaic array,” published in communications earth environment. They come from Colorado State University and the Technical University of Madrid in Spain.

As part the US government's “Investing in America” agenda, the Department of Energy (DoE) announced $45 million in funding, including $18 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to support pilot manufacturing of solar components.
The Investing in America agenda intends to bring manufacturing back to America after decades of offshoring, which will relieve the US dependence on foreign countries for imports, but will also create new, good-paying jobs.
The funding to bolster manufacturing for the solar sector supports the Biden Administration’s goal of reducing carbon emissions in the United States by roughly 40% in 2030. Specifically, it will support the development of new dual-use solar technologies such as agrivoltaics and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) to create new markets for American products.
“President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has led to a surge of solar manufacturing announcements and has created thousands of good paying, union jobs in solar deployment,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “With these innovative, made-in-America technologies, the Biden-Harris Administration is powering the clean energy transition, lowering electricity costs for hardworking Americans, and protecting the future for our children from the impacts of the climate crisis.”
Agrivoltaics, BIPV, floating PV, and vehicle-integrated PV are all examples of dual-use solar in which solar is generated in an application that can serve a secondary purpose. By integrating solar energy systems into existing landscapes, such as in agrivoltaics, which pairs solar with agricultural use, dual-use PV has the potential to minimize land-use challenges.
To date there have been 63 domestic manufacturing announcements across the solar supply chain since the beginning of the Biden administration, according to the DoE. More than 40 of these have been announced since the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act just about one year ago. One these facilities are operational, they will contribute important domestic components needed for the build out of a clean energy industry in the United States while also creating jobs, simplifying shipping and logistics, and reducing supply chain uncertainty.

In early summer, a ridge of high pressure known as the “Azores High” usually sits over the North Atlantic Ocean. This June, the high pressure extended much further northeast than usual, and was centered over the North Sea, and was weaker than usual over the North Atlantic.
The persistent high pressure over the North Sea brought drier easterly winds to large areas of western Europe, whilst also limiting the passage of cloud-bearing weather systems from the Atlantic. This pattern delivered a sunshine excess of up to 20% above normal over England and France, and a smaller excess of around 5-10% above normal for Italy, Switzerland, northern Spain, and western Germany.
Central and eastern Europe and southern Spain were also affected by this weather pattern. However, their irradiance boost was dampened by local convective and storm outbreaks, resulting in their overall irradiance being close to normal.

When looking at the absolute total irradiance for June, the result was that France experienced about the same total irradiance as the typically sunnier Spain and Italy, whilst irradiance totals were lower over central and eastern Europe and Scandinavia.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.
