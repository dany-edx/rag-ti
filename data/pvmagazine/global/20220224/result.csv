The market for plug-in PV systems has reached an unexpectedly big size in Germany.
According to a new report from the HTW Berlin – University of Applied Sciences, and German consumer association Verbraucherzentrale NRW, more than 190,000 plug-in solar devices have been installed in Germany in recent years. In 2020 and 2021 alone, up to 128,000 of these photovoltaic systems, with a total output of up to 51MW, were added.
The two entities surveyed all providers of plug-in solar systems in Germany and 58 of 156 active market participants took part. The market shows what they define as a colorful picture of small and large suppliers. “So far, a few larger providers have dominated the market while, at the same time, new providers and many smaller companies are ensuring lively competition,” explained Barbara Praetorius, professor at HTW Berlin and co-author of the study. About 75% of the plug-in solar systems are sold directly to end customers. “Sales channels via retail chains have so far hardly been used. This means there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of market development,” Praetorius continued.
This was also confirmed by Thomas Seltmann, from Verbraucherzentrale NRW. “The study makes it clear that politicians and network operators must finally clear further hurdles,” said Seltmann. There are still arguments about standard-compliant connection and “unreasonable” demands from the electricity network operators. Therefore, simplifications for the use of plug-in solar systems are urgently needed, according to the consumer association.
Officially, plug-in balcony solar arrays must be reported in the market master data register managed by the Bundesnetzagentur – the German federal network agency. However, the study showed that not all users file the registration. “The reporting processes are too complex for plug-in solar systems. Only 10 to 20% of the systems are registered,” said Praetorius.
“We also assumed that the balcony does not play the greatest role as a location for the solar module,” explained the HTW professor. “Only every third device can be found there. Half of the devices are placed in an elevated position on the flat roof or in the garden.”
The Berlin researchers are currently investigating what the main obstacles are to reaching more tenants and thus, better tapping the potential for the plug-in solar market in Germany.

“The robots are built at our headquarters in Saint-Émilion, in the Gironde department of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in southwestern France,” the company's CEO and founder, Arnaud de la Fouchardiere, told pv magazine.
The 20 W device relies on polycrystalline solar cells, a battery and MPPT optimization. “Their price depends on the terrain, the state of the soil, the number of obstacles per hectare, the height of the solar panels, the way in which the motors are installed if they are trackers, and many other variables,” de la Fouchardiere explained.

The robot measures 750 x 390 x 290 mm and weighs 20 kg. It is equipped with four wheels and one motor per wheel. It can operate with a maximum slope of 15% and reach a speed of 300m/h. It is claimed to be able to work under all weather conditions and to cut any kind of grass between 4 and 10 cm in height.
The system also uses a mobility management software that helps it detect obstacles to get as close as possible — less than 1 cm — to cut the grass around them. An AGPS tracker system with 15 days of battery autonomy embedded in the robot ensures anti-theft security.
The mower can be used in a 50-unit herd across a property of around 50 hectares and a radius of 20 km. Each of the robots is connected to an operator, which the company calls the “shepherd,” by means of cellular networks. If necessary, the shepherd can take control of the robot remotely to carry out the necessary maintenance or intervene on-site, for example, to unblock a robot.

“In recent years, the building sector across the world has shown increasing interest in placing PV on building façades and roofs by either closely integrating PV panels with conventional building materials or replacing them,” researcher Rebecca Yang told pv magazine. “The interests are driven by electrification and decarbonization of the built environment, growing demand for self-consumption, and the need for architecturally ‘good’ integration of PV, as well as technological innovations in PV materials and systems leading to better design options and feasibilities in the adoption.”
According to her, the enthusiasm of the downstream value chain stimulates upstream advances and opens dialogues between the solar industry and building professionals. Leading PV manufacturers have started to collaborate with major building entities aiming for mass production and customization for massive application potentials on building facades, roofs and shading devices of new developments as well as renovations. “In Australia, I observed that many large property developers, leading design and engineering firms and local councils are very interested to apply BIPV, but the market is still not open yet due to some issues which are common in other similar countries,” she also explained.
In the paper A multi-objective optimization framework for building-integrated PV envelope design balancing energy and cost, recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Yang and her colleagues explained that the design variables for a BIPV envelope optimization model are related to either the building envelope or the operational setting of the building. “A set of envelope design features, as well as PV-related features such as tilt angle, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), PV placement and PV product type, are included as design variables in the framework,” they pointed out, noting that the proposed module includes objective functions and constraints such as the net present value and the payback period. “The selected design variable set for each optimization scenario may vary according to the selected BIPV application type or inputted user preferences.”
After applying the model to several business cases, the scientists concluded that there is no best alternative design or, better, that the ideal design can only be found when all user preferences are considered. “The study provides BIPV designers and building professionals with a method to produce and compare different BIPV designs based on their preferred application types, design preferences and criteria,” they stated.

Adani Group and Canadian PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) fuel cell producer Ballard Power Systems have signed a memorandum of understanding to consider joint investment in the commercialization of hydrogen fuel cells in India, for mobility and industrial applications.
Under the agreement, the partners will examine various co-operate opportunities including fuel cell manufacture in India.
Green hydrogen could be a logical move for Adani, given its experience in large scale renewables and electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure. The group sees itself as well-positioned to become a big green hydrogen producer.
Adani's efforts under the deal signed with Ballard will be led by newly formed green hydrogen subsidiary Adani New Industries Limited, which is focused on production of the energy carrier including via downstream products, green electricity generation and the manufacture of electrolyzers and wind turbines.
“Green hydrogen is the fuel of the future and fuel cells will be a game-changer in India’s energy transition,” said Vneet S Jaain, director of Adani New Industries. “Our ability to build a world-class green hydrogen value chain will be critical in facilitating the energy transition and we are excited to partner with Ballard, a global leader in fuel cell technology, to create a shared fuel cell ecosystem in India. We will be deploying innovative use cases across our businesses with fuel cell trucks, mining equipment, marine vessels, off-road vehicles, and critical industrial power. We will shape the industry through this strategic collaboration.”
The Adani group, founded in 1988, has a market capitalization of $151 billion, comprising seven publicly listed companies with businesses spanning power generation and distribution; renewables; infrastructure; seaport, airports, shipping, and rail; mining and resources, and other sectors.
“We are excited to partner with Adani, given [Adani Group chairman and founder] Gautam Adani’s inspiring leadership and the highly complementary assets across the group portfolio,” said Randy MacEwen, Ballard’s president and CEO. “India represents a new growth opportunity for Ballard and we look forward to working with the Adani Group to support and accelerate their energy transition and decarbonization goals.”

Madagascar-based renewable energy company Filatex has agreed to invest €10 million in Energiestro, a French start-up specializing in the development of a storage technology for residential PV based on a flywheel system based on concrete.
Filatex and Energiestro have also signed a partnership agreement to deploy the storage solution in Madagascar and Mauritius, with the aim of pursuing an international development strategy in the renewable energy sector.
The proposed solution consists of a hollow or solid cylinder that is rotated around an axis and connected to an electric motor and generator. The flywheel system is able to store electricity by converting it into kinetic energy using the motor and the flywheel rotates at such a high speed that the electrical power is transformed into mechanical power.
The device is claimed to have a lifetime of one million cycles, good resistance to high temperatures, a carbon footprint of 10g of CO2 per kWh. The flywheel has a diameter of one meter and weighs three tons, and can be placed in the garden of a private house. The system capacity should be increased, initially, to 20 kWh, and then 50 kWh, to eventually reach 24 hours of storage.
According to French financial newspaper LesEchos, Energiestro will begin production of the storage systems this year and the first products should be tested by French companies EDF, Engie, and Voltalia.

With solar deployment levels continuing to ramp up, and sustainability issues coming increasingly to the fore, calls for meaningful domestic manufacturing capacity to be re-erected have grown louder over the past few years. 2022 might be the time they are answered.
Last April, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) said that at least 75% of PV demand in Europe should be covered by domestic production. However, as pv magazine outlines in the upcoming March issue, in 2020, Europe had 22.1GW of polysilicon production capacity in operation, but just 1.25GW of solar wafer production capacity, 650MW of solar cell capacity, and 6.75GW of solar module production capacity, based on figures issued by the Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy Systems (ISE) in its 2021 Photovoltaics Report. Thus, the industry has a way to go if it is to achieve meaningful capacities.
In the following interview, Johan Lindahl, ESMC secretary general talks to pv magazine about the current state of play, the challenges and opportunities facing European solar manufacturers, and the plans that have been identified to achieve GW-scale capacities.
Plans to power up a competitive European solar and battery manufacturing landscape abound. Ambitious proposals are in place to establish a booming, sustainable industry with investment earmarked, factories planned, and political strategies outlined. Will they be realized? The UP Initiative will spend Q2 delving into these questions.

Johan Lindahl: We have identified several challenges for the competitiveness of the European PV manufacturing industry:
With regards to opportunities, we have identified several, including:
We don't have numbers for every part of the value chain but these are the general figures in 2020:
And this is in a context where Europe installed 15% of all PV capacity in the world in 2020. So, we need to strengthen wafer, cell, and module production if we want to be more self-reliable.
Currently, Europe has a quite severe negative trade deficit when it comes to PV cells and modules. The table below features the total traded value out and into Europe as a region of the international customs category; Photosensitive semiconductor devices, including photovoltaic cells whether assembled in modules or made up into panels; and light-emitting diodes.
Below are some examples of capacity expansion plans that have officially been communicated. We are aware of some additional large projects, but they have not yet been officially released:
The ESMC has been working on two fronts. Firstly, we have convinced the EU Commission about the need for a new Solar Strategy that addresses the situation of PV manufacturing. Regarding this, the acknowledgment of the need for strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty was completed in May 2021 in the updated EU New Industrial Strategy and accompanying documents by recognizing that building a sizeable EU PV manufacturing industry would also reduce supply disruptions and quality risks.
Secondly, in the summer of 2021, ESMC initiated the IPCEI framework for PV manufacturing in cooperation with the partner organizations of the European Solar Initiative. The PVIPCE initiative is open for all European PV manufacturing industrial partners and research institutes dedicating their efforts to ensure the sustainable competitiveness of European PV manufacturing along all the full value chain.
Fifty members, comprising PV manufacturing companies and research institutes, from 14 European countries have already joined the initiative and work is ongoing in five IPCEI Project Groups.
The PV-IPCEI framework is dedicated to creating the demand for support incentives by securing at least 20GW of sustainably competitive PV manufacturing capacities along the full value chain by 2025 in the EU with a view to scaling it to 100GW by 2030, thus representing at least 15% of the future global market share.
The PV-IPCEI framework and the gigawatt-scale projects are targeted to boost PV manufacturing capacities in the EU by addressing strategic dependency issues and enabling breakthrough research innovations and infrastructure projects through the integrated industrial framework. The circularity of PV production and integrated PV solutions are essential components of the framework to ensure the sustainability and competitive advantage of the European PV upstream sector. Local PV production in Europe could benefit the green transformation and the whole economy as it has lower CO2 emissions and will reduce the import dependency on Asia.

The European Battery Academy was launched at yesterday's high-level meeting of the European Battery Alliance, which was founded in 2017 to establish a European battery supply chain.
Plans to power up a competitive European solar and battery manufacturing landscape abound. Ambitious proposals are in place to establish a booming industry with investment earmarked, factories planned, and political strategies outlined. Will they be realized? pv magazine‘s UP Initiative will spend Q2 delving into these questions.
The academy, under the auspices of EU body the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and its sustainable energy-focused subsidiary entity EIT InnoEnergy, aims to provide the training needed to prepare the estimated 800,000-strong European battery workforce which will be required by 2025.
The commission allocated €10 million for the training program from the €50.6 billion Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU) segment of its NextGeneration EU Covid recovery initiative.
The battery alliance was meeting to consider its priorities for this year which will include, according to a commission announcement yesterday, removing red tape associated with the sourcing of battery raw materials in EU member states.
The battery academy funding came on the same day the commission announced plans to regulate to ban products made from forced labor entering the bloc.
The “communication on decent work worldwide” document issued by the EU executive aims to combat forced labor and child labor around the world. The European Parliament and member state representative body the European Council will now be asked to consider the document and be part of the legislative process, the commission said yesterday.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/24/polysilicon-price-fluctuations-expected-to-continue-until-late-2023/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",Polysilicon price fluctuations expected to continue until late 2023,"Polysilicon prices have been rising significantly since February 2021 and reached unprecedented levels over the past four months, with the average selling price peaking in December at $38/kg without VAT.
“Polysilicon prices are surprisingly high at the moment, despite the fact that polysilicon production in China has increased during the first two months of 2022,” Alex Barrows, research director at UK-based market research company Exawatt, told pv magazine. “The increase in production was a little lower than we had expected, and what we hadn't seen coming is a very high demand for polysilicon that is a little unusual for the first quarter of the year, which traditionally can be a relatively weak quarter for the polysilicon industry.”
According to another polysilicon specialist, Johannes Bernreuter of Bernreuter Research, the ramp-up of new polysilicon production capacities of Chinese producers such as Tongwei, Daqo and GCL-Poly has been slower than expected, while demand is still growing faster than supply. “Concluding from the latest weekly reports of the price data providers, however, buyers seem to become more reluctant in view of the rising prices,” he told pv magazine. “The situation may relax somewhat once the ramp-up has reached higher volumes and Xinte‘s 20,000 MT debottlenecking project goes online.”
Bernreuter added that, as long as demand will remain strong, suppliers won't have any reason to make concessions on price. “When demand is higher than available capacity, the price is determined by the buyers' willingness to pay. The market tested this willingness in 2021,” he emphasized.
Barrows explained that some signs of the current trend for prices and demand were already observed last year, when increasing prices were not followed by a drop in demand. “On the contrary, demand stayed high, especially in the second half of the year, and keeps being at unprecedented levels right now, which makes the future scenario very difficult to predict, even in the short term,” he stated. “We expect, however, that polysilicon prices may decline in the course of the year, to reach around $20/kg by the end of December. In the longer term, we expect that the global polysilicon industry will be able to meet total demand and by late 2023 there is likely to be overcapacity. Until then polysilicon prices may be subject to many fluctuations.”
Looking at late 2023 and through 2024, Barrows explained that much will depend on how gross margins for polysilicon manufacturers evolve and how electricity prices in China develop. “Gross margins should come down as new polysilicon capacity comes online, but electricity prices for some industrial users have increased recently in China,” he added. “If this trend continues it could push up costs for some polysilicon manufacturers, thereby pushing up prices. We currently expect poly prices to come back down to around $10/kg by the end of 2023, but this is reliant on electricity prices not increasing too aggressively.”
When asked if non-Chinese producers may help change the current scenario, Barrows said this will be unlikely, at least in the near term. “The planned capacity expansions during 2022 and 2023 are very much focused in China. We could see some capacity in India under the PLI scheme there, but probably not until 2024 or 2025. It’s also possible that we’ll see capacity additions in the USA if the proposed manufacturing incentives are introduced,” he concluded.

The ministry has set a fixed FIT of ¥11 ($0.096)/kWh for PV systems with power capacities of between 10 and 50 kW and a FIT of ¥10 ($0.087)/kWh for installations with capacities of 50 to 250 kW. Both these project categories will be granted fixed tariffs without having to be selected in the procurement scheme, although projects belonging to the second group will be given the chance to participate in auctions awarding feed-in premiums and will be included, for the procurement exercises, in the 50-1000 kW group.
For the latter, the METI has set a ceiling price of ¥10 ($0.087)/kWh and has decided to exclude all PV systems connected to the grid before January 17, 2022. Through the auction scheme, the minister hopes to allocate 665 MW of solar capacity across three different auctions.
Both the FITs and feed-in premiums will be valid for 20 years and will also apply to agrivoltaic and floating PV installations.
“These FITs are not expected to encourage the expansion of solar power generation in Japan,” said Japanese PV expert Takeshi Magami.
Magami told pv magazine that the new FIT levels will not make projects profitable, as the cost of constructing solar power generation facilities in Japan is rising. “At present, the necessary business profitability can only be secured at a FIT price of about ¥14/kWh. It appears that METI is not looking to expand solar power generation through these FITs, but simply to keep FITs alive. This is because the Japanese government has not set a target for the introduction of solar power under FITs. For that reason, the current FITs are not consistent with the Japanese government's renewable energy introduction targets for 2030.”
According to his estimates, the cost of solar projects has grown by around 20% from last year, and the tariffs are now being reduced by 10% compared to 2021 levels. “In 2021, Japan should have deployed between 4 and 5 GW of new PV capacity, as there are still unutilized projects from past FITs,” Magami further explained. “In 2022, there will be no more of these unfinished projects, and if the Japanese government does not expand its support measures, the newly installed solar power is estimated to be no more than 3 GW.”
The METI allocated 675 MW of PV capacity across three different auctions in 2021. “The average bid price ranged from ¥10.31/kWh to ¥10.82/kWh, with the lowest bid price at ¥10.23/kWh,” Magami emphasized, noting that all these prices are significantly above the ceiling price proposed for this year's procurement exercises.

Sydney-headquartered professional services outfit GHD announced on Wednesday it has secured funding from the UK government to install a demonstration plant in England featuring Lavo’s hydrogen-based battery technology, which contains both a water purifier and an electrolyzer, and is specifically designed for incorporation with a solar PV system.
GHD, a cornerstone investor in Lavo, has secured $264,000 (£141,000) from the UK government’s Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to demonstrate the feasibility of a grid-connected energy storage system based on storing hydrogen in Lavo’s innovative and patented metal hydride.
GHD project manager Tej Gidda said the demonstration facility, to be installed at the University of Chester’s Thornton Science Park in England’s northwest, will allow it to effectively demonstrate and prove the concept of Lavo’s hydrogen energy storage system.
“We’re delighted to have the support of BEIS and to be working with our partner and the University of Chester on this important project to demonstrate the feasibility of longer duration hydrogen storage in the UK energy system,” he said.
“Collaborating with clients and industry partners around the world to develop and commercialize new solutions, such as Lavo, puts us in a strong position to harness the enormous opportunities presented by the global energy transition.”
Developed in partnership with the University of New South Wales’ Hydrogen Energy Research Centre, Lavo’s energy storage system contains both a water purifier and electrolyzer, so that solar energy can separate the hydrogen from the water, release the oxygen, and store the hydrogen safely as a solid material by combining it with a patented metal hybrid.
When stored energy is needed, the hydrogen can then be released through a reduction in pressure and diverted into a fuel cell to produce useable electricity.
GHD said the project would help illustrate the economics of creating hydrogen in times of excess renewables electricity generation and storing in long-duration energy storage medium. It will also demonstrate the scalability of Lavo’s modular, stackable hydrogen energy storage device.
Lavo’s hydride technology has seen initial demonstration in Australia but GHD said this project will apply the technology at a larger scale to demonstrate how it can support energy storage for the UK electricity network by providing low cost, and low carbon, hydrogen to local users in the northwest of England.

The funding is part of the BEIS’s Longer Duration Energy Storage Demonstration program which is in turn part of the UK government’s $1.87 billion (£1bn) Net Zero Innovation Portfolio which aims to accelerate the commercialization of innovative longer duration energy storage technologies which provide grid flexibility.
The BEIS said the latest round of funding aims to demonstrate first-of-a-kind energy storage system prototypes in relevant or operational environments.
“This should build a pipeline of longer duration energy storage systems to be commercially deployed,” it said in a statement.
UK Energy Minister Greg Hands said the project offers the potential to be an important enabler for an emerging hydrogen economy, providing hydrogen for customers at low cost.
“Driving forward energy storage technologies will be vital in our transition towards cheap, clean and secure renewable energy,” he said.
“It will allow us to extract the full benefit from our home-grown renewable energy sources, drive down costs and end our reliance on volatile and expensive fossil fuels.”
The UK government is not the only supporter of Lavo’s hydrogen battery. The company last month secured $5 million in funding from the NSW Regional Job Creation Fund and late last year the Queensland government announced funding for Lavo to help it establish a $15 million hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing facility.

Following yesterday's news that Korean electronics manufacturer, LG, will be folding its solar module business by the end of June, LG will also be ceasing production and solar operations at its 550-MW solar module assembly plant in Huntsville, Alabama, also set to happen in June.
Completed in 2019, the facility was among the largest module manufacturing plants in the US, providing jobs for some 160 plant employees and 60 contracted workers. According to LG, those employees will be offered transition support and severance packages commensurate with their tenure with the company. No word has yet been shared about the future of the LG technical call center and service training center also located at the Huntsville campus.
In exiting solar, the company explained that the decision came due to increased material and logistics costs, as well as severe supply constraints. The company said it will now focus on energy storage systems and home energy management.
(Read: “LG exits solar module business“)
In November, LG announced a partnership with Sunverge to develop a residential virtual plant project with customers in Northern and Central California. The project is intended to explore ways in which intelligent and dynamic load control and solar/energy storage can be aggregated as dynamic multi-service and multi-asset VPPs to create value on both sides of the meter and help utilities transition to more resilient and flexible distribution grids.
In its latest financial results, LG reported a slight increase in revenue for the BS division despite the “sluggish performance” of its solar module business. However, the most recent Solar Market Intel Report, released by EnergySage, LG was shown to be the third-most quoted manufacturer in the US, trailing just REC and Panasonic. Moreover, Industry analyst Roth Capital Partners suggests that LG represents 14% of U.S. residential solar module supply, with data from Ohm Analytics supporting this claim and showing a roughly 13% market share. 
In transitioning to energy storage systems and home energy management, LG has made significant advancements in those fields in recent history. LG is the battery supplier for  Vistra’s Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility in California, providing more than 4,500 TR1300 battery racks for the installation.
