The company also posted a net profit of CNY 9.53 billion in the first half of the year, up 341% year-on-year. It said the strong performance must be attributed to high polysilicon prices. At the end of June, the manufacturer reached an annual production capacity of 105,000 MT. In the first six months of the year, polysilicon output was 66,700 MT, which accounted for 18.3% of polysilicon demand in China, according to recent figures provided by the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA). Daqo also said some production lines will have annual maintenance in the second half of the year and estimates the output of polysilicon in Q3 will be 31,000 to 32,000 MTs, and in Q4 will be 31,500 to 34,500 MT.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/05/n-type-cell-with-aluminum-titanium-passivating-contact-achieves-21-9-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 5, 2022",N-type solar cell with aluminum-titanium passivating contact achieves 21.9% efficiency,"As single-junction silicon solar cells push closer to their practical efficiency limit (somewhere around the 30% mark), it becomes more and more difficult to find further improvements to performance. And while plenty of PV research is already looking to multijunction devices and other alternatives to keep the numbers going up, there’s still plenty of work going into optimizing silicon.
Passivating contacts are still relatively new in manufacturing and have plenty of room for improvement. Currently, doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) or polycrystalline silicon (Poly-Si) are the most commonly used, and have achieved the best results in passivation quality and low resistivity to date.
However, the limited transparency of these materials means they can only go so far in improving cell performance. Several material classes are investigated as possible replacements, and transition metal oxides are among the leading candidates for a replacement, and are the subject of newly published research led by scientists at Australia National University (ANU).
Transition metal oxides – in particular, titanium oxide (TiO2), offer many of the ideal qualities for a passivating contact layer. But attempts to use them so far have struggled with passivation quality, thermal stability and other practical issues.
“A general trend apparent in these previous studies is that improving the surface passivation of pure or doped TiO2 single layers or Al2O3/TiO2 stacks generally comes at the expense of increasing contact resistivity, and vice versa,” the ANU researchers said. “We demonstrate an innovative method for obtaining an outstanding silicon surface passivation combined with a low contact resistivity.”
They described their method in “Outstanding surface passivation for highly efficient silicon solar cells enabled by innovative AlyTiOx/TiOx electron-selective contact stack,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. The group combined aluminum alloyed TiO2 and pure TiO2 in a stack formation, deposited using atomic layer deposition. By testing various film thicknesses and deposition temperatures they were able to optimize the passivation quality and electrical performance of the layers, which was observed and characterized using various imaging techniques.
Crystalline silicon cells fabricated with this layer achieved a top efficiency of 21.9%, which the group says is already comparable with other passivating contact materials, and offers more room for further optimization.
“The electron-selective passivating  contact  enabled  by  our  novel stack (AlyTiOx/TiOx) at 75 C appears to be highly competitive with state-of-the-art poly-Si electron-selective  passivating  contacts  (SiOx/n+-poly-Si),  which  are  currently  expected  to enable the  next generation of c-Si  solar cells (while  having  better optical performance),” they said.
To achieve this potential for higher performance, the group says it will now focus on further improving passivation stability after metallization.
“We believe that by definitively addressing these challenges, our novel stack has the potential to match, and possibly outperform, Si-based contacts (a-Si:H and poly-Si) in terms of fabrication cost, simplicity, and performance,” they said.

They aim to develop a way to use solar power for LED illumination systems in order to reduce electricity costs.
“The scope of the work is to design an effective solar photovoltaic system which would meet the complete energy demand of a proposed business complex without consuming conventional energy supply,” they said.
In “Design of LED lighting system using solar powered PV cells for a proposed business complex,” which was recently published in Scientific Report, the researchers said that commercial PV projects for LED lighting should follow nine steps. They include the identification of a location, the determination of a grid connection point, and the pre-construction documentation and negotiations. The scientists also noted the importance of building infrastructure such as roads and fences, purchasing equipment and logistics, installing mounting structures, building transformer substations, setting up grid connections, and installing monitoring systems.
The academics assumed that the PV system would be built with 6,097 solar modules, with power outputs of 150 W and a total capacity of 914.4 kW. They also assumed the array's tilt angle to be 49.3 degrees. The PV array design would have 41 stings and 24 modules in series.
In addition, they included an adjustable lithium-ion battery with 512 cells, with 16 connected in series and 32 connected in parallel. For the commercial building complex, the scientists assumed annual electricity demand of 190,830.7 kWh.
“The battery is to be operated at standard room temperature at 24 C in a fixed air-conditioned room,” they said.
The scientists concluded that the standalone energy system would provide complete energy independence for the building. The solar array's transposition factor could reach a value of 0.98 in the proposed system configuration, they noted.
The modeling also showed that the system's solar fraction and performance ratio achieved values of 0.740 and 0.569, respectively. The latter measures the quality of a solar plant, independent of location, and the former defines the percentage of the total thermal load satisfied by solar energy. 
“The cost estimation shows that the acquisition and installation cost of PV systems is economically feasible for a typical business complex,” the research team said. ” It is very much possible to use them in individual buildings to attain complete energy independence in the future.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/05/high-performance-aqueous-calcium-ion-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 5, 2022",High-performance aqueous calcium-ion battery,"Against a backdrop of soaring prices and predicted shortfalls of lithium-ion battery materials, the search for inexpensive, abundant, safe, and sustainable battery chemistries has never been more critical. Calcium has been considered in batteries, but the larger size and higher charge density of its ions, relative to lithium, have posed challenges for their insertion into electrode materials.
Now, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the United States have reported progress in addressing this issue and unlocking the potential of high-performing calcium-ion batteries.
“The calcium ion is divalent, and hence one ion insertion will deliver two electrons per ion during battery operation,” said Nikhil Koratkar, the John A. Clark and Edward T. Crossan Professor of Engineering at Rensselaer. “This allows for a highly efficient battery with reduced mass and volume of calcium ions.”
However, the larger size and higher charge density of calcium ions relative to lithium impairs diffusion kinetics and cyclic stability, he added. The team has overcome this problem by developing oxide structures containing big open spaces (heptagonal and hexagonal channels). In their work, an aqueous calcium-ion battery is demonstrated using orthorhombic and trigonal polymorphs of molybdenum vanadium oxide (MoVO) as a host for calcium ions.
The researchers have demonstrated that calcium ions can be rapidly inserted and extracted from the material, with these tunnels acting as “conduits” for reversible and fast ion transport. The findings indicate that MoVO provides one of the best performances reported to date for the storage of calcium ions.
Specifically, for trigonal MoVO, a specific capacity of ∼203 mAh g−1 was obtained at 0.2C and at a 100 times faster rate of 20C, an ∼60 mAh g−1 capacity was achieved. The open-tunnel trigonal and orthorhombic polymorphs also promoted cyclic stability and reversibility. These findings were recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
“Calcium-ion batteries might one day, in the not-so-distant future, replace lithium-ion technology as the battery chemistry of choice that powers our society,” says Koratkar. “This work can lead of a new class of high-performing calcium-based batteries that use earth abundant and safe materials and are therefore affordable and sustainable. Such batteries could find widespread use in portable and consumer electronics, electric vehicles, as well as grid and renewable energy storage.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/05/solar-plants-should-work-for-35-years/,"SPONSORED,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",,"AUGUST 5, 2022",Optimizing O&M strategy key for 35 year solar assets,"In the C&I sector, it’s approximately 400 assets, but in total is only 150 MW capacity. In the ground-mount sector, we have approximately 100 sites, but at 850 MW. Regardless of sizes and installation form, the access cost pertaining to maintenance is uniform. Therefore, we should take into account the proportion of maintenance costs relative to the total revenue. That also means that in ground-mount installations we proactively exchange spare parts as preventative maintenance, whereas on rooftops, we only practice corrective maintenance, exchanging broken equipment. This is simply because the financial impact of downtime is much bigger than the additional Opex to exercise preventive maintenance for ground-mount installations.
A big challenge of our 400 rooftop assets is, that during the time of construction we did not have a single policy on how to choose components and how to design the assets. The result is a multitude of unique plants. The challenge today is setting the Opex budget. In practice, we calculate the financial impact of materialized and potential defects, then we calculate the cost to fix the problem to see if the feed-in-tariff rate still justifies the cost of the repair. For our C&I fleet, this must be done manually for each site. By contrast, for our ground-mount systems, we have automated most of these processes. Not just the monitoring but also the cost-efficiency calculation of maintenance work.
This year, Huawei's special edition looks at technical challenges to a power system mostly run by inverter-interfaced power sources. The leading topic: Smart PV and Storage – Anytime for Anyone, is achieved by a high degree of digitization, a new business division within the Huawei corporation and strong network of partners.

For the rooftop segment, there was no procurement strategy a couple of years ago and that was a mistake for ORIX. But today, we only procure power conditioners, inverters, and dataloggers from selected manufacturers. For us, suppliers must be highly bankable, with a good track record and reputation for reliability, and demonstrate a high throughput. Huawei is among the list of suppliers that fulfill these requirements. With solar modules, it is a bit easier as no such strict procurement regime is necessary.
That is pretty much the key. Making successive improvements in plant design to bring down Capex has been successful in the past. But under a high feed-in tariff regime for 20 years nobody cares about operational and technical asset management. It doesn’t matter if you consider the rooftop or ground mount sector. In order to achieve a lower LCOE, we have to extend the lifespan of solar plants. The operational life should be 30 or 35 years so that solar maintains a competitive edge against other energy sources.
Within our company, I was leading the ground-mount sector nine years ago. So, from this time all the assets are equipped with digitally enabled equipment because I was the one insisting on them. Regarding the rooftop sector: I would say 20% of the assets have advanced digital communication features. If we invest additionally, 60% of the fleet could have these features. For the remainder, there would be no economic rationality to retrofit such digital capabilities.
In 2014, we calculated to take JPY 3,300 ($26) per installed kilowatt-peak and year to run proper O&M on a 450 MW ground-mount project in Japan. Today, it will cost JPY 1,000, or a little less than one-third, to do the same job. But instead of letting O&M determine the cost reduction, we decided to take on more add-on services catered to improve profitability and improved the quality of maintenance with drone inspections and the use of AI since 2018. This shift has added to the cost of O&M. Based on the above, the yearly O&M cost is JPY 2,100 per kilowatt-peak. Even with the increased O&M cost, the amount of revenue improvement exceeds the invested costs.
The easy answer is that for every plant we need to take into consideration the cost and effect of an O&M measure. Without a high FIT, the revenue per produced watthour becomes smaller. In that case, there are fewer measures that are worthwhile applying. But the basic principle of calculating the loss resulting from damage and matching that loss against the cost of repair to see if a repair is economically justified remains the same.
What I would suggest adding is artificial intelligence to calculate how much loss is accruing and then match that with the cost to fix the problem. We can then make decisions based on cost-effectiveness. We have currently installed that function in our software. What I would like to add as the next step is to include the CMMS. In this case, the system will learn the conditions of each site, automatically changes the maintenance schedule and engineers will make certain actions based on it. Furthermore, I would also like to connect the weather forecast, eventually enabling the system to predict tomorrow’s production. In two or three years, the operation will shift in this direction for sure.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/05/improving-gettering-tech-for-topcon-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 5, 2022",Improving gettering tech for TOPCon solar cells,"Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) have looked at the effects of gettering mechanisms on passivating contacts based on polysilicon and silicon monoxide (SiOx) for tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cells. The getting technique, which reduces defects in wafer manufacturing, could become more important in the future, as cell efficiencies increase and become increasingly sensitive to traces of metallic impurities.
This technique involves three steps and is used during crystal growth to remove containments and other forms of defects in wafers. Via this process, the impurities are initially released into a solid solution and then undergo diffusion through the silicon. Finally, they are trapped in an area away from the active circuit regions of the wafer.
In “Comparing the Gettering Effect of Heavily Doped Polysilicon Films and Its Implications for Tunnel Oxide-Passivated Contact Solar Cells,” which was recently published in RRL Solar, the scientists considered deposition techniques such as plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) or low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). They also looked at different doping techniques such as in-situ doping, ion implantation, or thermal diffusion, and with different dopant types and doping concentrations. 
“In our work, we surveyed a wide range of poly films, which were made by different techniques, in order to identify the factors that affect the gettering effects of poly-Si/SiOx during its formation,” researcher Zhongshu Yang told pv magazine. “Our findings are applicable to commercial TOPCon cells.”
The scientists analyzed the gettering strength of poly-Si films from four different types of P-doped poly-Si and three different types of B-doped poly-Si.
“P-doped poly are commonly used in n-type TOPCon cells, which is still the focus of many manufacturers, due to the excellent surface passivation of the P-doped poly and the absence of light induced degradation. The application of P-doped poly in n-type TOPCon cells can significantly remove impurities from the silicon bulk,” Yang said. “On the other hand, the application of the p-type TOPCon cells based on B-doped poly is limited, although the p-type TOPCon cells have their unique advantages that easy to transfer from the existing PERC cell fabrication system and less sensitive temperature coefficient. From our finding, the gettering strength by B-doped poly varies significantly depending on the film deposition and doping techniques.”
They said the gettering strength of the P-doped poly mainly depends on the doping concentration, but attributed the gettering by B-doped poly to inactive boron, which relates to the fabrication process.
“It is worth noting that the Si wafers used in our article are flat zone (FZ) wafers with implanted iron (Fe) impurities. While in industry, Czochralski (CZ) wafers are most used, which may have different impurities and defects,” Yang explained. “The contamination level from the fabrication process in industry is also difficult to be generally quantified. However, the remaining fraction of the impurity in the bulk after the fabrication process is still valid, at least for Fe impurities, the one of the most common and harmful transition metal impurities.”
The research group recently built a 27.6%-efficient monolithic perovskite-silicon n-type tandem solar cell based on TOPCon tech for the bottom cell. They built the 1 square-centimeter cell with a dense hole transport layer based on nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) with a thickness of 10 nanometers. The research group said this minimizes the likelihood of pinholes that can result in shunt paths.
The group also compared the firing resistance of p-type and n-type poly-Si/SiOx passivating contacts and found that the former have better resistance to hydrogen diffusivity and higher passivation quality after firing. The scientists concluded that the diffusivity of hydrogen in p-type poly-Si is lower than in n-type, which prevents the accumulation of excess hydrogen around the oxide which deteriorates the passivation quality.
“The results extend our understanding of the firing effect on poly-Si/SiOx structures, which may help to further improve the performance of doped poly-Si contacts,” they said.
The scientists also recently conducted a review of all gettering technologies in solar wafer manufacturing and offered a comprehensive analysis of the possible gettering sinks and routes for different solar cell architectures.

Frontier Energy said that results from a pre-feasibility study (PFS) into its proposed Bristol Springs Solar project in Western Australia show that it has the potential to be an early mover, low-cost green hydrogen producer.
The PFS, conducted by Perth-based Xodus Group, is based on the development of a large-scale green hydrogen production facility at Bristol Springs, with power sourced from the company’s planned first stage 114 MWdc solar farm. The solar would power a 36.6 MW alkaline electrolyzer, producing an estimated 4.4 million kilograms of green hydrogen per year.
Including the estimated capital outlay, the study forecasts a total unit cost of AUD 2.83 per kilogram of hydrogen produced which Frontier said “places the project as one of Australia’s lowest cost green hydrogen producers.” The projected cost of production also places the project within reach of the economic goal of producing green hydrogen for AUD 2 per kg, which would be cost-competitive with gas produced from fossil fuels.

Terabase Energy announced a $44 million Series B financing round co-led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Prelude Ventures, with additional investments by SJF Ventures and others, to bring the company’s total funding to $52 million.
The California-based company was founded in 2018 by SunPower alums. Matt Campbell, a founder and CEO, took part in pv magazine’s 2021 roundtable, where he introduced the company’s approach.
“A lot of the work that needs to be done to optimize plant economics becomes pretty complex and computationally intensive, which lends itself to a modern software-based solution,” Campbell said.
Terabase is on a mission to use software and automation to reduce the cost and accelerate deployment of utility-scale solar. Its suite of software includes cloud-based apps for plant design, solar energy modeling – PlantPredict – acquired by Terabase from First Solar, and construction management. The company also offers power plant controls and SCADA solutions.
Founded by Bill Gates and backed by top business leaders, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) has raised more than $2 billion in committed capital to support companies that are leading the world to net-zero emissions. BEV seeks to invest, launch and scale global companies that will eliminate carbon emissions throughout the economy as soon as possible. BEV invested in Terabase because it sees software and automation as the path to reducing costs and accelerating large-scale solar.
“In recent years, the solar industry has been focused on technological improvements of solar panels and other hardware components while the means and methods of engineering and construction have been largely unchanged. The way the industry designs and builds large scale projects needs to be rethought if we are to reach the very rapid growth required to meet net-zero goals,” said Carmichael Roberts, business lead of the investment committee of Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “To enable the terawatt-scale deployment of solar needed to decarbonize, we believe a breakthrough is needed to transform how PV power plants are built. Terabase’s solution has tremendous potential to reduce costs and accelerate the deployment of large scale solar, and we look forward to working with them on that mission.”
Terabase said its digital platform can transform the way solar plants are built. The automated factory can be set up at the site of the solar plant and can run 24/7 with its robotics-assisted workflow. Three months ago, the company announced the first commercial deployment in which robots installed 10 MW in a 400 MW project in central Texas.
“Terabase’s software and automation platform allows for developers and EPCs to effectively design and manage their projects from the point of land acquisition to rapid and high-quality construction through automation. This is an essential solution for solar to get to gigawatt-scale projects around the world,” said Tim Woodward, managing director of Prelude Ventures.

India had 691.4 MW of cumulative solar capacity by June 30, through the installation of standalone solar pumps and the solarization of existing grid-connected agriculture pumps under the PM-KUSUM Scheme. The states of Rajasthan (282.6 MW) and Haryana (246.5 MW) led in PV capacity additions under the scheme.
The PM KUSUM Scheme, under its Component-B section, supports farmers in installing standalone solar agriculture pumps to replace existing diesel agriculture pumps in off-grid areas. Under Component-C of the scheme, individual farmers with grid-connected agriculture pumps are supported to solarize their pumps. Farmers can use solar power to meet irrigation needs, with excess solar power sold to distribution companies under a fixed tariff. 
A 2016-17 survey by the Ministry of Agriculture estimated India to have 11.2 million diesel agricultural pumps. As of June 30, the nation had installed 123,180 standalone solar pumps under Component-B of the scheme. The pumps are estimated to reduce 85 million liters of diesel consumption per year. Cumulatively, the nation had installed 385,000 standalone solar pumps by June 30, including solar pumps installed under the PM-KUSUM Scheme.
