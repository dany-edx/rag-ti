Mumbai-based Waaree Energies has secured approval from the Delhi Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal for its planned acquisition of Indosolar.
Indosolar, an Indian PV cell manufacturer, has incurred significant losses, eroding its net worth. As of March 31, 2021, it had a negative net worth of INR 99,779.49 ($1,285). Lenders initiated insolvency proceedings against Indosolar in October 2018 under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.
Waaree’s acquisition of Indosolar will help it to expand its solar cell manufacturing capacity to 5.4 GW, from current plans for 4 GW. The deal will also complement its planned expansion into solar module manufacturing. Waaree expects to start manufacturing within about six months at the Indosolar plant. 
Waaree currently operates four PV module manufacturing facilities in India. It has shipped solar modules to customers in 19 countries and has been ranked as a Tier-1 PV module manufacturer by BloombergNEF (BNEF) for four consecutive years, from 2018 to 2021.

The researchers achieved a 99% yield in three hours, reportedly eight times faster than conventional batch reactors. The room-temperature reactor resembles a thin, clear tube packed with micron-scale grains of titanium oxide (TiO2). The hydrogen-carrying liquid is pumped into one end of the tube. Only the outer grains of titanium oxide, the ones exposed to the sun at the other end of the tube, are coated with rhodium. These photoreactive catalysts react with the liquid carrier to release hydrogen molecules as a gas. “In a conventional batch reactor, 99% of the photocatalyst is titanium oxide, and 1% is rhodium. In our continuous flow reactor, we only need to use 0.025% rhodium, which makes a big difference in the final cost. A single gram of rhodium costs more than $500,” said Milad Abolhasani, corresponding author of the paper recently published in ChemSusChem. According to the researchers, the system should be easy to scale up or scale out to allow for catalyst reuse on a commercial scale. “You can simply make the tube longer or merge multiple tubes running in parallel.” The flow system can run continuously for up to 72 hours before losing efficiency. The catalyst can be “regenerated” without removing it from the reactor in about six hours. The system can then be restarted and run at full efficiency.

Chile development agency Corfo signed agreements with regasification plant GNL Quintero, iron producer CAP, and industrial gas supplier Air Liquide to finance the development of the first green hydrogen production plants on an industrial scale in Chile. The GNL Quintero’s 10 MW project aims to develop, construct, and operate a green hydrogen plant in the Valparaíso Region. CAP’s 12 MW project focuses on the Biobío Region, while the Antofagasta Region will host Air Liquide’s 80 MW project. The three companies were awarded US$5.7 million (€5.3 million), US$3.6 million, and US$11.7 million, respectively. “These three initiatives are part of the six selected by Corfo last December, which, once installed, will have a total electrolysis capacity of 388 MW, equivalent in size to what is currently in operation worldwide. They are expected to generate investments of US$1,000 million and produce more than 45,000 tons of hydrogen per year,” Corfo wrote. 
The German Parliament passed the bill tabled by the Government to bypass specific procedural steps, like the need for an environmental impact assessment, to install two floating terminals in Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel by the coming winter.  The LNG facilities should be “hydrogen-ready.”

They described all degradation mechanisms affecting solar cells and modules, with the aim of summarizing current knowledge about PV system reliability.
“We intend this article to be a concise and up-to-date introduction to this topic for the general reader and specifically for newcomers into the PV reliability engineering domain,” they said.
They divided the research into three sections: a summary of reliability metrics, a review of all factors affecting PV module performance, and a presentation of all degradation and failure modes in panel components. They also reviewed all mainstream crystalline silicon and thin-film PV technologies, including perovskite cells and organic solar cells, while providing general definitions for reliability, quality and testing standards.
They categorized the primary forms of stress for solar modules according to irradiance, temperature, moisture, mechanical stress, soiling and chemicals.
“Many PV technologies consist of similar architectures in terms of the module materials and components,” the scientists said. “These elements include the module packaging, internal electrical circuit, bypass diodes, junction boxes, wiring and connectors, and frames.”
The study also presents some of the most common strategies that are implemented to mitigate module failures at different levels.
“Through extensive testing and failure analysis, researchers now have a much better overview of stressors and their impact on long term stability,” said the research group.
The researchers published “Review of degradation and failure phenomena in photovoltaic modules” in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review. The team includes academics from the Eindhoven University of Technology and the University of Twente in the Netherlands, Switzerland’s École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL),the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU in Spain, the University of Lisbon in Portugal, and the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom.
“A future research gap is to consider the impact of performance, cost and reliability on the PV module sustainability,” said the researchers.

“We developed a low-cost and simple hot-air method and we also used terbium doping and quantum passivation techniques to stabilize the perovskite phase in the ambient conditions,” researcher Sawanta S. Mali told pv magazine. “One of the promising advantages is that all processes are carried out in ambient conditions.”
The scientists fabricated the cell with a perovskite known as CsPbI2Br, which has a remarkable energy bandgap of 1.91 eV. However, it is also known for stability issues.
“Its phase stability in ambient air still needs improvement due to role moisture plays in accelerating the perovskite-to-non-perovskite phase transformation,” they explained, noting that the addition of quantum dots within the perovskite crystal bulk, and at surfaces and interfaces, reduced the density of surface defects.
They used bulk passivation (BP) and surface passivation (SP) techniques to implement terbium doping. The cell has a tin oxide (FTO) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on mesoporous titanium oxide (TiO2), the perovskite layer, a hole transporting layer (HTL) made of the polymer Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a top electrode based on gold (Au).
This cell configuration achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.51%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.315 V, a short-circuit current of 16.34 mAcm-2, and a fill factor of 81.53%. The device was also able to retain more than 90% of its initial efficiency after aging in 50% to 60% relative humidity for more than 500 hours.
The researchers claim they were also able to build a larger 5 cm x 5 cm (25 cm2) perovskite solar cell module with an efficiency of 10.4%.
“We are planning to make a 15 cm x 15 cm (225 cm2) module using by combining hot-air, blade coating and air-knife methods,” Mali said.
The research group introduced the cell technology in “Terbium-doped and dual passivated γ−CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 inorganic perovskite solar cells with improved air-thermal stability and high efficiency,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials. The group includes scientists from Chonnam National University in South Korea, Shivaji University in India, the Belgian research institute KU Leuven, and Cardiff University in the United Kingdom.

The new monocrystalline modules are purportedly suitable for gable roofs with large installation surfaces and different roofing materials.
“The module has a 14% higher output than our conventional panels,” the Japanese electronics manufacturer said, attributing the improvements to its multi-wire technology and larger solar cells. “The number of busbars is also increased compared to our conventional products to reduce electrical resistance. By shortening the length of the finger electrodes that connect the busbars to each other, the electrical resistance of the finger electrodes is reduced and power loss is suppressed.”

The modules have a nominal power of 375 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.4%. The open-circuit voltage is 41.08 V and the short-circuit current is 10.83 A. The panels measure 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 40 mm and weigh 21.5 kg.
The company said the new panels can be deployed on roofing materials such as slate, metal horizontal rooftops, and metal tile bar roofing. It recommends the use of the Smart Rack mounting system developed by Japanese specialist Takashima Co. Ltd., which it said is ideal for gable roofs.

Germany chemical producer Wacker Chemie has launched a feasibility study for a new plan to expand silicon metal production capacity at its plant in Holla, near Trondheim, Norway.
Wacker plans to build a new melting furnace that will increase capacity at the manufacturing facility by around 50%. It is currently in talks with the local authorities and energy suppliers to evaluate the feasibility of its plan.
The company will decide whether to build the new melting furnace at some point later this year, assuming that final approvals are secured. The new facility could then be completed on schedule by 2025.
Silicon metal is one of Wacker's most important raw materials. The group needs it for the production of high-purity polysilicon, among other things. The silicon metal produced in Holla currently covers about one-third of the requirements of Wacker's German sites.
“The planned expansion measures in Holla are an important prerequisite for accelerating our growth as planned,” said CEO Christian Hartel.
The expansion of in-house production of silicon metal makes Wacker less dependent on raw material price fluctuations and increases the security of supply, both in times of high demand and in the event of global supply chain problems.

Frontier Energy has chosen alkaline water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen using clean energy supplied by the proposed Bristol Springs Solar (BSS) project, which is being developed near the town of Waroona, south of Perth, Australia.
The solar farm would have an initial generation capacity of 114 MWdc, but Frontier said additional land acquisition opportunities are available that could allow for an increase up to 500 MW. The company is also exploring the potential of adding a battery energy storage system and the development of green hydrogen production using clean energy from the BSS project.
Frontier Managing Director Mike Young said the company remains on track to commence construction of the Bristol Springs solar project in 2023. A study into the production of green hydrogen incorporating clean energy generated by the solar farm is due to be completed mid-year. The study, which is being conducted by Xodus Group, has already assessed the most appropriate hydrogen plant design, initial plant size and scalability, input power characteristics, and preferred technologies.
Frontier said it chose alkaline water electrolysis technology (AWE) for the hydrogen production process due to its lower cost, technical robustness, and “technical maturity” compared to alternative methods. Another advantage of AWE is the modular nature of its installation, which “allows for hydrogen production earlier than originally anticipated and for staged future expansion.”
The Perth-based company also announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Norwegian company Nel Hydrogen, a division of Nel ASA, and Victorian-based gas transport and storage business ENGV, to assist in the development of the production plant and market distribution.
“The development of our Bristol Springs project is well advanced, but the current project is only the first stage of our long-term vision,” he said. “We aim to become one of the first commercial green hydrogen producers in Australia. The MoU with Nel and ENGV ensures that our green hydrogen strategy is carried out in the most efficient manner.”
Under the terms of the deal, Nel and ENGV will assist with the advancement of Frontier’s hydrogen study, including furthering the development of the green hydrogen production plant. Nel is expected to provide the hydrogen technology solutions, while ENGV will provide integration services.
Frontier said construction on the initial stage of the Bristol Springs Solar project is expected to commence in early 2023. It said it remains on track to release both the renewable expansion and the complete green hydrogen study by mid-year.

Tata Power has revealed that its Tata Power Renewable Energy unit has commissioned a 100 MW/138 MWp solar project in Partur, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. 
The installation features more than 4,11,900 monocrystalline PV modules and spans 600 acres. It will supply electricity to Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL). It is expected to help offset around 234 million tons of CO2 emissions per year. 
The project was executed by Tata Power’s EPC unit, Tata Power Solar Systems, within the stipulated timeline of 3.5 months. Tata Power’s operational renewables capacity now stands at around 3.6 GW, with 2.7 GW of solar and 932 MW of wind. Its total renewables portfolio stands at 4.9 GW, including 1.3 GW of projects under various stages of implementation.
In a separate development, Gurugram-based Acme Solar said that it has switched on a 300 MW solar power project in the Jodhpur district of Rajasthan. The project in the village of Badiseed is Acme’s largest single-location project thus far. 
The plant in Rajasthan will supply electricity to Maharashtra, with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) to serve as the offtaker. Acme Solar said it was able to finish the project in the shortest possible time, despite pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and rising module prices.
“We faced two consecutive rounds of the Covid-19 pandemic that brought working at the sites to a standstill. It was burdened with disruption in the supply chain and sky-rocketing prices of solar modules and other equipment,” said Sandeep Kashyap, chief operating officer of Acme Solar. “Prices of nearly all components peaked, and freight increased many folds. We could overcome all the challenges … and commission the project successfully in the shortest available time.”
Acme Solar is currently implementing another 1.75 GW of solar projects.

Q Cells has revealed that its new solar panel manufacturing facility will be located in Dalton, Georgia, near its 1.7 GW module factory. It is expected to come online as early as the first half of 2023, pushing the company's total production capacity in the United States beyond 3 GW.
“Our additional investment in Dalton will help Q Cells better serve the needs of U.S. customers with increased local manufacturing capacity,” said CEO Justin Lee. “Georgia has become the clean energy manufacturing heart of America, and we are proud to contribute to the state’s advanced manufacturing economy.”
The new facility will produce 1.4 GW of TOPCon solar modules per year.
“We are excited to see Q Cells continue to expand in Georgia. The state of Georgia and Korea have enjoyed an outstanding partnership for decades, supported by a dedication to relationship building. We have been focused on bringing jobs and opportunities to hardworking Georgians across the state,” said Brian Kemp, the governor of Georgia.
The company's expansion in Dalton is expected to bring 470 new jobs to Whitfield County, and with more than 750 people employed at the existing factory, total local employees will exceed 1,000 when the expansion is complete. Groundbreaking is planned for fall 2022.
In March, Hanwha Solutions, the parent of Q Cells, said that it was stepping up efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products when it became the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, a major US manufacturer of polysilicon. Following its initial $160 million acquisition to acquire a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha said that it was acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons, in a deal valued at around $44 million.
Hanwha’s US initiative supports the US government's efforts to increase solar power generation by 40% and to decarbonize all electricity by 2035. Hanwha sees the enactment of the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) as critical to a US-based solar supply chain. While Hanwha had stated that it would “implement a multi-phase, multi-billion-dollar expansion across the full solar energy supply chain” once SEMA was passed, the expansion has begun.
