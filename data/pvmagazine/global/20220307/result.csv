The analyst, which has produced a list of cleantech trends for 2022, also said current green hydrogen project timescales will have the world on schedule for a supply crunch of the energy storage medium in 2025.
Amid fierce EV demand for lithium-ion phosphate batteries, London-based, S&P Global-owned IHS has predicted a battery module price increase of 5% this year will drive up the overall cost of stationary battery projects around 3%.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

With the analyst having recorded lithium-ion battery price rises of 10-20% in the “later months of 2021,” it predicted price tags will not return to a downward trajectory for another two years and even that development will depend on manufacturers expanding production capacity and seeing off demand from EV makers.
The green hydrogen bottleneck anticipated mid decade is in part a result of project announcements which included plans laid last year for almost 250GW of electrolyzer capacity – up from 70GW worth of announcements in 2020, and less than 15GW in 2019. IHS, however, predicted further electrolyzer production plans this year and next will help ease any supply squeeze and reiterated an estimate Europe's green hydrogen demand alone is expected to require up to 250GW of solar generation capacity this decade.
Noting moves by the US and India to onshore solar manufacturing, IHS said it expects the logistics and input cost headaches which drove up the price of solar panels last year will continue to inflate costs this year, particularly for the next four months. The market data firm did state, however, new manufacturing capacity of solar panel raw material polysilicon is coming online faster than expected, solar wafers are becoming more efficient, and new wafer producers are entering the market.
While solar and wind prices may continue to rise this year, IHS said, clean energy remains competitive, in part thanks to cheaper financing costs as banks become accustomed to backing such projects and the world experiences a continued enthusiasm for green finance.
Solar projects with generation capacities no larger than 5MW will account for 45% of new arrays this year, according to IHS Markit, with China and Germany driving more than 60% of demand in the segment.
Brazil will continue to see demand for sub-5MW projects, with net-metered arrays installed through next year not subject to grid charges, and established smaller-scale solar markets in the US and France will be joined by new entrants, with a graphic produced by IHS Markit suggesting they could include Japan, India and Italy.
Home and business rooftop arrays continue to be competitive despite rising panel prices, IHS said, because they are competing against retail energy prices rather than the wholesale levels which utility scale projects have to contend with.

As Indian solar manufacturers expanded their module production capacities last year, the volume of imports of foreign-made cells to assemble into those panels rose.
The value of solar cells imported from April to the end of last year stood at US$633 million, topping the US$572 million figure reported for the whole of the previous fiscal year.
China was the biggest source of imported solar cells from April to December, accounting for US$578 million worth, with Malaysia the source of US$20 million worth of products, and Thailand banking solar cell trade worth US$16 million in India, according to Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry data.
During the same period of the current fiscal year, India imported US$2.5 billion worth of solar panels, with China accounting for 90% of that trade, with US$2.25 billion worth of exports. Panels from Hong Kong accounted for US$201 million of Indian imports, Malaysia exported US$25.3 million worth of modules to India, and Singapore US$20 million.
In terms of solar module trade flows out of India, for the first nine months of fiscal year 22, the nation exported US$81 million worth of products. The US was the biggest destination for Indian panels, and imported US$59 million worth of them, to account for 73% of Indian module exports.
India also exported US$6.8 million worth of panels to Somalia, from April to year-end, and US$4.55 million worth to South Africa.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/07/equality-must-begin-at-birth-solar-power-is-the-solution/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"MARCH 7, 2022",Equality must begin at birth; solar power is the solution,"In light of women's week 2022, I want to focus on equality, which takes various shapes and sizes and differs significantly between the developed and the developing world.
It starts with the most natural thing that a woman can do – give birth. While women across Europe, America, and Asia usually deliver in well-lit rooms, with proper equipment at hand and a staff of trained medical professionals, women in sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region globally, have a very different experience. Maternal health refers to women's health during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, and maternal mortality refers to the death of a woman due to causes related to or aggravated by her pregnancy or childbirth.
Maternal mortality, which historically affected all of society, has long been eradicated from developed parts of the world. Yet it continues in developing regions, and most notably in sub-Saharan Africa. Today, almost all (99%) of maternal deaths occur in developing countries, and 68% occur in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, according to The Trends in Maternal Mortality report. The publication, a joint effort by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division, showcases huge global health disparities that leave African mothers extremely vulnerable.
Despite vast progress being made during the past two decades, statistics are bleak. Sub-Saharan Africans suffer from the highest maternal mortality ratio – 533 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births – and 200,000 maternal deaths a year. And for every maternal death, and for every woman who dies, approximately 20 others suffer serious injuries, infections, or disabilities. The numbers show significant disparities between the richest and poorest countries; the lifetime risk of maternal death in high-income countries is 1 in 5,400, compared to 1 in 45 in low-income countries.
The significant disparities of maternal care are hurting more than global equality. According to the UN, maternal deaths slow economic growth and lead to some $15 billion global productivity losses each year. Alongside the losses, investing in improved health for women and babies has far-reaching benefits for nations. For example, between one-third and one-half of Asia's economic growth from 1965 to 1990 has been attributed to improvements in reproductive. Providing women with a good pregnancy and birthing scenario is crucial in every aspect.
Most maternal deaths can be prevented through access to skilled health personnel, proper facilities, equipment, and supplies. Many women who experience maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa live in extreme poverty conditions and do not receive adequate care to address complications. Electricity is a big part of the inadequacy.
Across sub-Saharan Africa, 600 million people, 300 million women, have access to only 98,000 health clinics, and from those, only 28% have electricity, according to McKinsey. Without electricity, the most basic infrastructure a clinic can have, women in rural areas give birth in dark rooms, and health workers are sometimes forced to ask pregnant women to cover the charges of candles, something many cannot afford. These women are hindered from any medication or drugs that need cooling and, with big hospitals often days away, have no option to get timely blood tests or ultrasound scans. In the last-mile areas of the SSA region, healthcare personnel are often undertrained, and the lack of proper infrastructure and equipment makes it that much harder for women (and the population in general) of the region to get decent care.
Solar energy has the power to change the gaps of global maternal care and is already impacting millions across the SSA region. Thanks to a growing focus by local governments and a thriving private sector, Africa's solar industry is growing by the day, with healthcare and maternal health specifically addressed by multiple organizations and companies.
Affordable solar systems provide clinics across rural communities with the basic infrastructure they need to begin elevating their healthcare practices. Solar systems can be set up immediately without waiting for expensive transmission lines and other grid infrastructure. They are clean and safe, preventing fire hazards from faulty kerosene lamps or candles.
Depending on their size, solar systems can provide cooling options for vaccines and medication. Through electricity, internet access can be secured, and local teams can consult with global physicians, helping them perform procedures or diagnose specific conditions. Finally, electricity is also an essential enabler of medical equipment that is often crucial in testing and treating various conditions, and in multiple pregnancy and birth-related conditions.
Maternal health should be targeted as the first frontier in reaching global equality, crucial for gender equality. Women everywhere deserve to give birth safely, and solar power is the most affordable, scalable, sustainable solution.

The device is based on a silicon bottom cell relying on Hanwha Q Cells' monocrystalline Q.antum half cell technology and a perovskite-based top cell. “This latest record efficiency result, of 28.7%, is an improvement of almost one percentage point compared with the 2020 record value of 27.8%,” the module maker said in a statement. “This boost in tandem efficiency has been enabled by improvement of both the perovskite and the silicon subcells.”
“Our experts have achieved several world records for tandem cells combining perovskite top cells with other bottom cells on a laboratory scale,” added HZB researcher Bernd Rech. “It is remarkable how close the jointly achieved efficiency with a mass-production ready bottom cell already comes to what we can reach at a lab scale.”
No more technical details on the solar cell technology were provided.
In November, the HZB claimed to have produced a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with a world record efficiency of 29.80%. That result, which has been certified by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems’ (ISE) CalLab, was also included in the charts of the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It improved upon the previous world record, achieved by perovskite developer Oxford PV in December 2020, when the UK-based company announced a power conversion efficiency of 29.52% for its perovskite/silicon tandem device.
All the technical details of the Hanwha-HZB record solar cell can be found in the paper “Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with >29% efficiency by enhanced hole extraction,” which was published in Energy in December 2020, when the same research team achieved an efficiency of 29.15%.

In particular, they used the Optical Pump THz Probe (OPTP) technique, which is a well-established spectroscopy method for monitoring bulk photo-excited carrier dynamics. They also used time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC), which is commonly used to evaluate the electronic properties of semiconductors.
“The expertise from 15 laboratories is combined to quantitatively model the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell from such measurements,” the scientists said, adding that both techniques can be used to assess the formation and kinetics of photoexcited electrons, holes, and excitons by measuring photoconductivity transients, as well as mobilities.
They applied their proposed approach to solar cells with efficiencies of more than 20%, based on a halide perovskite known as (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I,Br)3. The cell was operated under standard illumination conditions, while OPTP and TRMC were measured after pulsed excitation.
“To characterize the measurement variations, we studied the charge carrier mobility in 15 TRMC and OPTP laboratories and were thus able to statistically decouple the inter-laboratory variations from the intrinsic material properties,” they said.
The research group reported alignment between the predicted and actual performance of the solar cell among the 15 laboratories.
“We could identify some neuralgic points that have to be considered before the actual measurements takes place, which allows us to arrive at significantly better agreement of the results,” said Hannes Hempel, the research coordinator.
The scientists described their approach in “Predicting Solar Cell Performance from Terahertz and Microwave Spectroscopy,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. They claimed that the study outlines best practices for the interpretation of terahertz and microwave measurements on photovoltaic materials.
“We believe that this analysis is of great interest for photovoltaic research, because it predicts the maximum possible efficiency of the material in a solar cell and reveals the influence of various loss mechanisms, such as transport barriers,” said researcher Thomas Unold.

A press release issued this morning by Scatec, to announce plans for a 50/50 Omani green ammonia project company joint venture with Acme, indicated plans for the port facility have been scaled up by almost a third.
pv magazine reported Acme's plans for the Omani plant in August, when the Indian developer said the facility would produce 2,400 tons of green ammonia daily for annual output of around 876,000 tons.
However, Acme founder and chairman Manoj Upadhyay, quoted in today's Scatec announcement, said: “This facility will have 1.2 million tons per annum capacity of green ammonia production and can potentially be further expanded in the future at the same location.”
The next print edition of pv magazine, which will hit the streets on Wednesday, will investigate the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
With Acme in August having put an investment figure of $3.5 billion on the project – planned for the special economic zone at the port of Duqm – it was not clear how much the raised ambition would raise that sum as the Scatec press release did not include a cost estimate.
Scatec was also vague about the timescale for a project Acme in August said would see its first phase operational this year, with the Norwegian company stating: “The overall schedule for the project is under development, but the partners share the ambition for this facility to be one of the first commercial large-scale green ammonia facilities in operation globally.”
Phase one of the Omani plant, Scatec said, will produce 100,000 tons of green ammonia per year with the help of 300MW of electrolyzer capacity and 500MW of solar generation capacity.
Acme in August said the site would be powered by 3GWp of solar, upon completion, plus 500MWp of wind turbines, and those figures could rise in line with the raised ammonia output capacity today announced for the project.
Acme's Upadhyay in August said construction at Duqm would begin “soon after” his company commissioned a green hydrogen and green ammonia site at Bikaner, in the Indian state of Rajasthan, to be powered by 5MWp of solar capacity – scalable to 10MW – and to produce five tons per day of green ammonia for annual output of 1,750-1,800 tons.
With Scatec today stating Acme had “set up” what the Norwegian company described as “the world’s first single-location integrated solar-power-to-green-ammonia facility at Bikaner, Rajasthan,” that would suggest ground could be broken in Oman before too long.
Acme's announcement in August coincided with the developer having signed a land agreement for the Duqm project with Oman's Public Authority for Special Economic Zones and Free Zones. Scatec today said its JV partner has been developing the green ammonia project for 18 months.
The announcement follows the news, revealed last month, that another Acme-Scatec joint venture – a 900MW solar field, also in Rajasthan – has been put on hold because of a combination of the 40% import duty to be applied on non-Indian solar modules from next month by the Indian government, and a lack of Indian products to fill the resulting shortfall.

Reden told pv magazine in October that its sale process “was under way,” with France's TotalEnergies bidding on it along with Macquarie.
The Macquarie consortium, which also includes Canada-based investment firm British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) and Germany's MEAG Munich Ergo Assetmanagement GmbH, has invested €2.5 billion in the transaction, which is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.
Reden Solar, with offices in France and Spain, develops, finances, builds and operates solar photovoltaic power plants in Europe and Latin America with an installed portfolio of 762MW and a portfolio under development of 15GW. France and Spain are its main markets, and it has recently expanded its presence in Greece and Italy.
Macquarie Asset Management's stake in Reden Solar will be purchased on behalf of institutional investors through the Macquarie Global Infrastructure Fund and the Macquarie Green Investment Group Renewable Energy Fund 2 (Mgref2, which raised €1.6 billion at closing in February 2021). Reden Solar is the fourth investment for Mgref2, having recently completed the acquisition of Apex Energies Group, in France.
The Macquarie Group has invested or disposed of around €40 billion in green energy deals since 2010 and has more than 50GW of green energy projects under development, construction and operation around the world.

“There is a constant debate on land allocation in our country,” the director of Israel's Green Energy Association, Eitan Parnass, told pv magazine. “Israel is a small country and the voices of land preservation activists are effective, allowing our zoning authority legitimacy to block ground-mounted solar. But the national renewable energy goals of Israel make it an impossible mission to preserve all land. We will need a few more megawatt-sized solar parks and much more land allocations. As this debate has reached the boiling point, we believe that  compromise will be reached in 2022, allowing the market to grow.”
According to Israeli media outlet Haaretz, the country's National Planning and Building Council decided, last week, to postpone the decision on how much land to allocate for ground-mounted PV projects until the end of this year. The article reveals that the Israeli authorities have already allocated 11,600 acres (4,693 hectares) for solar plants, and that another 9,000 acres is what is at stake in the conflict between the two ministries.
In 2020, when the government approved a plan submitted by energy minister Yuval Steinitz to deploy around 15 GW more solar capacity to help raise the 2030 target for the proportion of national electricity drawn from renewables from 17% to 30%, the Israeli Environmental Protection Ministry published a report in which it said that solar should have been deployed mostly on roofs and the facades of hundreds of thousands of buildings, as well as on parking lots, transportation infrastructure, and other existing areas and structures. “The land reserve in Israel is small and intended for a range of national uses, most notably residential construction, industrial and commercial development, and agriculture and military facilities,” it said at the time. “There is also the national need to keep open spaces open, for both current and future generations.”
Israel supports PV through tenders for large scale projects and operates an incentive scheme for rooftop PV, offering feed-in tariffs. In an effort to encourage the dual use of land, the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Ministry of Energy, in January launched a tender to deploy around 100MW of agrivoltaic capacity across 100 locations in the country.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/07/spectrum-splitters-to-raise-efficiency-of-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 7, 2022",Spectrum splitters to raise efficiency of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells,"Scientists at the University of Waterloo, in Canada, have sought to determine the theoretical maximum efficiencies of different two-terminal (2T) perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells and have demonstrated enhanced efficiencies in cells with a spectral splitter introduced between the top and bottom terminals. “We have already demonstrated similar metasurfaces experimentally in other work on four-terminal perovskite/silicon configurations, together with Solliance and TNO,” the research's corresponding author, Stefan Tabernig, told pv magazine. “In this work, we mainly focused on estimating the potential of the concept from a simulation point of view.”
According to him, integrating optical metasurfaces in tandem for the purpose of spectrum splitting can help with getting closer to the potential maximum efficiency for 2T perovskite-silicon tandem devices, that is estimated at over 45%. “Overall, if issues like the perovskite stability can be overcome, there isn't really anything stopping perovskite/silicon PV from overtaking all current silicon-only PV markets, due to the higher limiting efficiency,” he further explained. “Furthermore, as spectral splitting would specifically benefit perovskite/silicon tandems that use large top cell bandgaps, specific applications such as combined solar cell-water splitting architectures, which require large open-circuit voltages, stand to benefit even more from metasurface spectrum splitters.”
Through their calculations, the scientists found that the use of spectral splitters, when applied to commercially available top cells with energy gaps of 1.73eV, may result in overall efficiency gains of up to 6% if the limit of infinite thickness is set at 500nm for the top cell. “The limiting efficiency gradually decreases as the top-cell bandgap approaches the Si bandgap (1.12 eV), where all light up to that energy is absorbed in the top cell with no current left for the bottom cell,” they highlighted.
 
Image: Neder, Tabernig, and Polman, doi 10.1117/1.JPE.12.015502.
Two kinds of spectral splitters were considered in the study: “planar” and “Lambertian” splitters. The first ones are described as devices that reflect the light specularly back to the top cell and create one extra path for absorption in the top cell, and the second ones are splitters that reflect the light back in a cosine angular fashion such that enhanced light trapping can be achieved in the top cell. “The Lambertian splitter further enhances absorption in the top cell due to the larger angular scattering range and, as a result, less light is lost from the front of the cell. Consequently, the top cell current of the cell with [a] Lambertian spectral splitter is consistently higher than that of the planar spectral splitter while the bottom cell current of both cases is equal,” the academics stated.
According to the research group, the proposed cell architecture should be economically competitive. For a range of between 0.75% and 1.33% efficiency gain per perovskite top cell layer that is added to a silicon bottom cell, previous research estimated manufacturing costs between €0.462 and €0.195/W, respectively. “The referenced range for c-Si modules goes from €0.25 to €0.30/W, which shows that perovskite/Si tandems can be economically interesting,” Tabernig emphasized. “Assuming similar costs for the fabrication steps, and no significant loss in spectrum splitting performance with upscaling, the efficiency gains per fabricated layer found in this work lie within an economically competitive range.”
The cell design was described in the study “Detailed-balance efficiency limits of two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with planar and Lambertian spectral splitters,” published in Photonics Energy. “Overall, our work shows there is a bright perspective for the integration of spectral splitters in perovskite-Si tandem solar cells, even if unity reflectivity cannot be achieved experimentally,” the scientists concluded.

Sacyr Industry, a Spanish engineering services provider, is building a heating system based on PV, geothermal heat pumps and vanadium redox flow batteries at the Moncloa multimodal bus and metro station in Madrid.
The main goal of the demonstrator is the hybridization of geothermal sources with energy storage to create sustainable buildings with practically zero energy dependence on the conventional grid. Spanish battery provider E22 Energy Storage Solutions is participating as the supplier of the redox flow battery technology.
Underground geothermal drilling was conducted at a tunnel of the station's metro line to install heat pumps that produce cold air and heat for a space spanning 41,000 square meters.
“We have drilled 150 meters deep,” said Daniel Muñoz, director of geothermal energy and energy efficiency at Sacyr Industrial. “The height available in that tunnel for the drills is four meters, and a standard small drilling rig is already between seven and nine meters, so the drilling cannot be deeper. In addition, we have to install a larger vent to evacuate the fumes from the drill's motors, which makes the project more expensive compared to a traditional geothermal solution drilling from the surface. But the existence of this tunnel allows us to drill with less disturbance and impact.”
The Moncloa station also houses platforms for Madrid's metro lines. The area is affected by all the heat generated by the subway and buses, and especially by the solar radiation that heats the asphalt on the outer surface, and cooling requires a lot of energy in the summer.
As chillers, the project uses heat pumps that work by producing only cold and dissipating heat into the atmosphere. Currently, they can produce 2MW of cold air, but the goal of the project is to scale the installation up in the future to provide about 1MW of geothermal energy.
“We could obtain 50% of all the energy demand of the station in a renewable way,” said Muñoz. “In addition, we have included some demonstrative vanadium flow batteries. If this works out, in the future we could ensure that all the air conditioning energy consumed by the station is renewable, considering that the system may be powered by photovoltaics. The thermal energy would be used to air-condition and the electricity to activate the compressors of the heat pumps and chillers.”
Muñoz said the demonstrator features two containers.
“The one with the heat pumps that we connect with the wells and thus provide energy in the form of heat and cold. The other, with the batteries that are recharged through a photovoltaic solar installation, is connected to an electrical panel,” he said.
The Spanish consortium claims this is the first project in which geothermal heat pumps have been hybridized with flow batteries. The developers said it could be replicated and made larger in the same facilities, with more drilling and more heat pumps, or heat pumps with greater capacity or cooling capacity.

Bird Control Group sells an autonomous laser deterrent that has been shown to reduce specific bird populations in sensitive areas by more than 99%. The company is confident enough to guarantee at least 70% fewer birds, and it is currently developing a machine-learning algorithm that will further increase the laser system’s effectiveness.
The lasers are class 3B, with an output power of 5 and 499 milliWatts. Class 3B can be hazardous for the human eye when exposed directly and for an extended period. Bird Control Group states that their deterrent products have an expanded beam, which ensures that only a small percentage of the laser’s potential can enter the eye.
The unit can plug into standard 240V electricity, or run on its own 24V solar and battery standalone system. The beams are green because birds perceive green lasers best, and they have an effective distance of 300 to 600 meters in full sun. At night, the lasers can be effective as far as 1.5 miles away.
In New England, gulls can be a nuisance, as they are known to drop quahogs onto solar panels. And even when they’re not directly damaging panels, their droppings can be a nuisance, covering panels, roofs and cars in droppings and clogging drains. One laser installed on a roof in the Netherlands in 2014 showed a 90% reduction in seagull activity – a figure that ought to raise a few eyebrows among solar developers and owners of larger solar power facilities near oceans and lakes.
For crop protection, most bird problems were addressed at dawn and at dusk, when birds were actively feeding. The reduced sunlight at these times also helps the laser work more efficiently.
In its online videos, the company notes that a standalone unit costs around $20,000 with the 24V solar panels, battery, controller, and wiring. Alternative bird control devices rely on noise, like propane cannons or bird squawkers. These devices are cheaper (a professional squawker is around $1,600), but your neighbors won’t appreciate the noise, and after a while most birds learn to ignore them anyway.
Another excellent use for these devices is to limit the spread of avian influenza from wild to farmed populations on free-range poultry farms. When lasers were tested on such farms during the day and night, the university team found a decrease of 99.7% in wild ducks visiting the area. Other wild birds decreased their visits by greater than 96%.
When the laser was turned off, wild geese returned to the surrounding grass pastures.
For farmers and solar developers seeking to integrate agrivoltaics, and may be concerned with damage and contamination from bird feeding and droppings – the unit has already been proven effective across several agricultural scenarios. Berries, grapes, sunflowers, sweetcorn, and many other farmed products are delicacies for local bird populations. Despite the temptation, birds at these sites were well deterred by the lasers.

One corn farmer said that he believes his system paid for itself in the first year, by decreasing his sweetcorn losses by 70%.
The Frankfurt Airport is using the handheld, manual version of the laser. The airport is surrounded by forests and grassland that birds love. They have extensive experience dealing with birds, and are of course conscious of the hazards lasers present to pilot’s eyes when operating aircraft. Wildlife Control Coordinator Jürgen J. Ebert explains that the device’s patented Horizon Safety System, “makes it easier for authorities to permit the use of [the] laser at airports.” Prior to using the Aerolaser, the airport used pyrotechnics, shotguns, and loudspeakers. The best results were found among birds that tend to sit on the ground more.
The company now believes its product will fit in well with the solar industry, especially as the market shifts toward agrivoltaic systems.

A team of researchers from Monash University’s Faculty of Engineering have redesigned the heart of a lithium-sulfur battery, creating a new interlayer that allows for exceptionally fast lithium transfer, as well as an improvement in the performance and lifetime of the batteries.
“It’s world-leading,” said Professor Matthew Hill, deputy head of the university’s Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. “A lot of our research has been about making the battery more stable and lasting longer, so this particular discovery is really exciting.”
As the world’s switch to emissions-free electrification accelerates, lithium batteries are playing an increasingly vital role as energy storage tools to facilitate that transition. Lithium-ion batteries are the dominant technology, but Hill said lithium-sulfur batteries already offer higher energy density and reduced costs. They can store two to five times more energy per kilogram than the lithium-ion alternatives but previously, the electrodes in lithium-sulfur batteries deteriorated rapidly during the recharge process.
The research team believes it has fixed that issue by developing a battery interlayer that allows for very fast charging, as well as an improvement in the life and performance of the batteries.
“The interlayer stops polysulfides, a chemical that forms inside this type of battery, from moving across the battery; polysulfides interfere with the anode and shorten the battery life,” Hill said. “The new interlayer overcomes the slower charge and discharge rates of previous generation lithium-sulfur batteries. It means the battery can be charged and discharged hundreds of times without failing.”
Hill said the key to this latest discovery was going against the accepted norms and conventions of lithium battery construction.
“It’s ground-breaking technology, because in a regular lithium battery there’s about half-a-dozen components that make up the battery,” he said. “Most people research those, but hardly anyone has looked at changing the interlayer or separator in the middle. They tend to be fairly standardized, and until now we’ve assumed it didn’t matter too much if you changed them. Now we’re saying it actually does; we’re going against the accepted convention.”
Hill said the development shapes as a game-changer for lithium-sulfur batteries which do not rely on metals like cobalt, nickel and manganese, which are critical minerals found in lithium-ion batteries.
“These batteries are not dependent on minerals that are going to lack supply as the electrification revolution proceeds, so this is another step towards cheaper, cleaner and higher performing batteries that could be made within Australia,” he said.
This latest breakthrough, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, comes just weeks after scientists in the United States announced that they have developed a lithium-sulfur battery using a commercially available carbonate electrolyte, that retained more than 80% of its initial capacity after 4000 cycles.
The group used a vapor deposition process, which unexpectedly produced a form of sulfur that did not react with the electrolyte, overcoming one of the key challenges for this battery chemistry.
