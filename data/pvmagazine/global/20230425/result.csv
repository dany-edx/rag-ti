They found that connecting close-to-shore wind farms via power cables benefits the electricity system more. “We find that the electricity system benefits more from connecting close-to-shore wind farms via power cables,” they said. “In turn, electrolysis is more valuable for far-away energy islands as it avoids expensive long-distance cable infrastructure.” The capacity investment in electrolyzers depends on hydrogen prices and onshore network congestion, they wrote in “How to connect energy islands: Trade-offs between hydrogen and electricity infrastructure,” which was recently published in Applied Energy. 
DNV says that repurposing pipelines could cost just 10% to 35% of new construction costs, leading to a potential saving of more than 50% of hydrogen pipelines globally, and up to 80% in some regions with significant natural gas infrastructure. Transporting hydrogen in pipelines presents safety and financial risks, and end-user demand may limit the quality and quantity of hydrogen transported. DNV is expanding its testing capabilities in its labs in Groningen (Netherlands) and Singapore.  
The Danish Energy Agency has announced the launch of a support scheme for renewable hydrogen. It is allocating DKK 1.25 billion ($184 million) to reach 5 GW to 6 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. The Power-to-X (PtX) tender is now moving into the tendering phase, and the agency invites applicants to submit their bids. The deadline is Sept. 1.
E.ON said in a new report that Germany needs to quickly invest in electrolysis capacity, hydrogen import infrastructure, and a “high-performance H₂ network. The German government wants to build up at least 10 GW of electrolysis capacity to produce green hydrogen by 2030. Its current electrolysis capacity stands at 68 MW. 
Canada is stepping up its hydrogen investments, betting on contracts for difference (CfD) supported by the Canada Growth Fund and on refundable investment tax credits under its 2023 budget. “The levels of support will vary between 15 and 40% of eligible project costs, with the projects that produce the cleanest hydrogen receiving the highest levels of support,” said the Canadian government. “If we are to preserve this advantage and position Canada to compete in the next generation of electricity-intensive sectors, such as clean hydrogen and green steel and aluminum, significant investments must be made today. Industry's need for electricity is only slated to grow.”

The Chinese inverter supplier says the S6 series features added generator connections and control functions, making them particularly suited for markets that experience frequent power outages, such as South Africa.
“Solis has launched a new S6 Advanced Power Hybrid Inverter which combines solar generator and battery connectivity to liberate power-starved households and businesses in South Africa from the unpredictability of daily electrical outages,” said James Frank, Solis country manager for South Africa. “In particular, peak shaving control in both self-use and generator modes allow users to prioritize backup power for their most mission-critical loads more flexibly and cost-effectively.”
The inverters are available in five versions, with power outputs of 3 kW, 3.6 kW, 5 kW, 6 kW, and 8 kW. The first four versions measure 440 mm x 598 mm x 205 mm and weight 24 kg. The 8 kW inverter measures 437 mm x 675 mm x 215 mm and weighs 27 kg.
The new products have an efficiency rating of 97.5% and a European efficiency rating of 96.2%. They feature two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) points, with MPPT voltage range between 90 V to 500 V for the 3 kW and 3.6 kW versions, and up to 520 V for the more powerful versions.
The maximum input voltage is 600 V and the recommended maximum PV power ranges from 4.8 kW to 12.8 kW. Solis says the inverters support both single-phase and three-phase connections of up to 36 kW in parallel for the smaller devices and of up to 48 kW for the 8 kW inverter. The S6 series is compatible with lithium-ion or lead-acid batteries with battery voltage ranges of 40 V to 60 V.
The 8 kW device has a maximum charging and discharging current of 190A, to allow for incorporation of generators with multiple input methods and automatic on/off control.
“This flexibility avoids over-specifying higher capacity inverters, PV arrays, generators and batteries than necessarily required, with considerable capex and opex savings over our competition,” said Frank. “Thanks to an automatic UPS switching function and a 10-second, 200% surge overload capability, users can be confident of a seamless supply during grid interruptions, even for the most sensitive electronic equipment.”
The inverters have an operating temperature range of -40 C to 60 C and are IP66 rated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/25/tuv-offers-guidance-on-plug-in-balcony-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"APRIL 25, 2023",TÜV offers guidance on plug-in balcony solar panels,"From pv magazine Germany
Nobody knows exactly how many plug-in solar modules are currently installed in Germany. What is certain is that their number is increasing every day. In view of the high electricity prices, homeowners without their own roofs are resorting to these devices to lower their energy bills.
In Germany, so-called “balcony solar modules” are currently allowed up to a size limit of 600 W.
“In the best case scenario, a 600 W balcony panel pays for itself after just a few years,” said Hermann Dinkler, an energy expert at the German technical inspection association TÜV. With a shade-free southern orientation, an optimal inclination angle of 35 degrees without shade and 2,000 kWh of electricity consumption per year, a typical 600 W system pays for itself after about five years, according to German institute HTW Berlin.
Nevertheless, there are a few things to consider when installing and using plug-in solar devices, according to the TÜV. Before buying, for example, users should check whether their apartment with a balcony, terrace or exterior wall surface is suitable for these modules, as there must also be an outside socket in the immediate vicinity of where the plug-in solar devices are installed in order to enable the use of the generated electricity.
The photovoltaic balcony system usually consists of one or two solar modules, an inverter, which can be integrated into the module or must be attached separately. According to TÜV, the connected load of the inverter should be a maximum of 600 W. There is also a connection cable that connects the inverter to the outside socket.
“As an option, a suitable ammeter can be attached for the function check. In this way, consumers can check whether the plug-in solar device is working and measure how much electricity is being produced,” said Dinkler.
Furthermore, the association recommends following the instructions provided by the manufacturer during assembly. The plug-in solar devices should be fastened with suitable mounting material, which should ensure the product withstands wind and weather.
“There are different brackets for balcony parapets, facades, or roofs. Consumers should make sure that the components fit the installation site and are supplied by the manufacturer,” Dinkler explained. All building regulations must be observed for the installation and the façade insulation must not be damaged when installing the panels on external walls.
“Only one solar device should be connected to a socket or circuit,” Dinkler said. “Multiple devices should never be connected to a multiple socket in order to avoid overloading and a possible smoldering fire. In order to avoid damage to property or injuries, consumers should only use devices and assembly parts that comply with standards and have been tested for safety.”
TÜV also advises making sure that a modern electricity meter is installed. A Ferraris meter without a backstop could run backward when using photovoltaic balcony modules. The German network operator is responsible for changing the meter, and they usually do this free of charge. In the event of a move, the plug-in solar devices could simply be dismantled and taken to another location.
In addition, the permission of the landlord or property cooperatives must be obtained before assembly.
“As long as no monument protection or building regulations are violated, the installation of a plug-in solar device is generally permitted in Germany,” said Dinkler.
The balcony modules should also be registered with the local grid operator. According to TÜV, many network operators have simplified forms or the option of online registration for plug-in solar devices.

And we expect to begin full-scale commercial production at our base in Jiangsu province in the first half of the year. By the end of the year, we will be producing heterojunction modules at a similar cost to PERC and TOPCon. In production, the highest cell efficiency is above 25.6% and average efficiency is 22.5% for modules.
The first lines in operation will be 5 GW for cells and 10 GW for modules. The second phase will add another 4 GW of cell production and 6 GW for modules, so in total our current plans for heterojunction technology are for 9 GW of cell capacity and 16 GW of module.
For cell technology, our policy is heterojunction first. This is our first choice and our main focus. However, we will also work with TOPCon.
We see TOPCon as more of a “PERC plus” technology. If you have PERC capacity, you need to upgrade it to TOPCon, otherwise your production lines will soon be useless. We will follow up on TOPCon technology and look to upgrade our PERC lines and keep them operational for a while longer.
Last year we announced an investment in 10 GW of new capacity that will also be TOPCon, and this is more about bringing our capacity for cell production closer to what we have for modules.
Silver-coated copper is the technology we are working on right now, and we think that will soon become an industry standard used by most companies producing heterojunction cells.
At Risen Energy, we have reduced silver consumption to 9-10 milligrams per watt, when a few of our competitors are still at around 12, and the industry average is 14. So we are already leading in this area, and once we start working with copper-coated silver, we can reduce this again by around 50%.
We have established a research and development team focused on this, which is focused on building more knowledge and ability at both the cell and module level for tandem technology. This is still in the research phase, and we are hoping to have some achievements to announce later this year.
But for our R&D team overall, the priority is to reduce the cost of heterojunction production. That will really be our focus for the rest of this year and next. After this, we can look at adding more technology and capabilities, but for now there is still work to do on HJT.
That’s right, we are mostly doing engineering, procurement and construction work for large, utility-scale battery projects. In the United States, I think we are already among the top three suppliers in large-scale energy storage. We are also active in Europe, and starting out in Australia as well. Worldwide, we are around the ninth or tenth largest player in large-scale energy storage projects.
A lot of these are batteries co-located with solar, we try to provide a one-stop shop for developers – PV and storage.
Yes, and we do have a 300 MWh battery factory, this is producing a different technology though, which we usually only sell in Japan.
For us it is more the business of combining battery cells together, and shipping them, to the US for example. Similar to the PV module business.

“We are currently planning to set up an experimental production line in Turkey,” researcher Gorkem Gunbas told pv magazine. “It could be operational in 2025.”
Perovskite cells built with 2D hybrid materials are known for their stability and exhibit large exciton binding energy compared to conventional, 3D devices. Different organic ammonium salts have been tested to develop 3D/2D solar cells, with halogenated analogs of PEAI salts being the preferred choice due to their potential to enhance hole extraction.
For their 3D/2D solar cell, the team used three organic ammonium salts: 2-methoxy-PEAI (o-OMe-PEAI), 3-methoxy-PEAI (m-OMe-PEAI), and 4-methoxy-PEAI (p-OMe-PEAI). They built the device with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a commercially pure titanium oxide (cp-TiO2) electron transport layer, a mesoporous titanium dioxide (mp-TiO2) layer, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, the perovskite layer, the OMe-PEAI layer, a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
“A solution of methoxy-substituted salts in isopropanol (IPA) was coated on it by spin coating to form the 3D/2D perovskite structure,” they explained. “Perovskite films treated with methoxy-substituent salts have fewer bright grains on the surface, indicating that OMe-PEAI salts react with excess lead(II) iodide (PbI2) on the 3D perovskite surface.”
The resulting solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.08%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.120 V, a short-circuit current of 25.55 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.6%. A reference cell without the PEAI treatment reached an efficiency of 20.86%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.091 V, a short-circuit current of 24.55 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 78.0%.
“All 3D/2D PSCs treated with methoxy-substituted salts showed lower hysteresis than the reference solar cell, indicating suppressed ion migration and accumulation by passivating the defects on the perovskite surface,” the researchers stated, noting that the champion device retained 95% of its initial efficiency after 900 hours, while the reference cell maintained only 49%.
“The unique orientation of the o-OMe-PEAI on the 3D perovskite surface revealed higher hydrophobicity compared with other salts, which in turn reflected the higher stability of the resulting devices,” they added.
The team introduced the cell technology in the paper “Drastic influence of substituent position on orientation of 2D layers enables efficient and stable 3D/2D perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
The team includes scientists from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, Odtu-Gunam and the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Turkey, the Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia,  and the University of Tokyo in Japan.

US President Joe Biden plans to veto a move by Congress to end a two-year suspension on tariffs for goods shipped from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, which make up around 80% of the US supply of solar components.
“The administration strongly opposes H.J. Res. 39, which would disapprove a rule issued by the Department of Commerce that temporarily suspends the collection of certain duties on imports of solar cells and modules,” said the White House in a press release. “The four Southeast Asian countries were allegedly harboring tariff-dodging products from China, which under antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws could lead to tariffs that range between 50% to 250% of the cost of shipped goods.”
This looming threat of tariffs created an untenable level of risk that cascaded into cancelled and delayed projects. The effect was so stark that it led the Solar Energy Industries Association to cut its project deployment forecast in half for the year.
About 20% of utility-scale solar capacity was delayed or cancelled in the first half of 2022 due to supply problems and uncertainty. This uncertainty was temporarily lifted when President Joe Biden placed a 24-month moratorium on solar tariffs from the four nations on June 5, 2022.
This April, the House Ways and Means Committee voted 26-13 to end the moratorium and restore tariffs via the Congressional Review Act.
“We cannot allow foreign solar manufacturers to violate trade laws, especially when it comes at the expense of American workers and American businesses,” said Representative Dan Kildee (D-MI).
The tariff exemption applies to modules that are imported before June 6, 2024, or modules installed on project sites before December 2024. Biden’s two-year moratorium is meant to act as a bridge while US domestic solar manufacturing ramps up, said Reuters.
“The United States currently lacks the capacity to produce solar panels and cells in adequate volumes to meet domestic demand,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association. “This strategic approach protects existing jobs while new ones are added, but it also helps sustain the robust environmental, national security and job-creating benefits offered by US solar deployment.”
Commerce made a preliminary ruling in December that some companies in the four nations were found to be in violation AD/CVD laws. The final decision for this ruling is scheduled for May 2, 2023.

Stiebel Eltron, a Germany-based heating manufacturer, will invest €450 million ($496 million) to expand heat pump production capacity at its main factory in Holzminden, Lower Saxony, Germany. The company aims to quadruple the capacity and wants to triple the number of employees at the facility to about 1,200.
The expansion plan has already started, and the production area for heat pumps will be extended to the size of four soccer fields. Stiebel Eltron's decision to expand is attributed to the increasing demand for heat pumps in Germany.
Stiebel Eltron's COO, Kai Schiefelbein, said the expansion is part of the company's efforts to support the energy transition and create new jobs in Germany. Unlike many competitors, the company is expanding its capacities for environmentally friendly heating technology at domestic locations. Bosch, for instance, recently announced plans to build a heat pump factory in Poland.
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
Over the past three years, Stiebel Eltron has more than tripled its employees in Germany from 1,000 to around 3,200, despite a shortage of skilled workers. The company has been training unskilled applicants internally, and they can be deployed at production sites within weeks.

PVsyst is a globally popular software package to study, size, simulate, and analyze data from PV systems. Comsol Multiphysics software is capable of solving the complete Maxwell equations and carrier transport equations, offering a detailed thermal model including the main self-heating processes that occur in a solar cell.
Both software programs use the View Factor method to estimate irradiance incident on both sides of bifacial modules. PVsyst and Comsol use different simulation methods, but PVsyst is capable of calculating different parameters based on the albedo, irradiances, and view factors.
PVsyst software simulates a bifacial PV system by calculating the irradiance on the front and rear side of a panel, and the energy generated. Comsol software can perform simulations with more steps, including input data such as mesh, materials, boundary conditions, and solver setup.
The analysis considered geographical site parameters, orientation, system configuration, detailed losses, and module layout. The parameters that affect PV system performance are albedo, inclination, the distance between panels, and the height to the ground.
After conducting several simulations, the research group concluded that PVsyst is more direct in calculation after defining the components and installation location. Comsol provides more detailed studies of module performance and precise thermal analysis.
“With the same simulation method between software, PVSyst gives us a higher value for solar production in almost all cases,” it stated.
The academics found that an increase in albedo values or distance between modules increased PV power generation.
“As far as height is concerned, there is a slightly illogical behavior in both software, given that a significant increase in production was expected but the result has been a minimal increase,” they said.
They presented their findings in “Multiphysics simulation of bifacial photovoltaic modules and software comparison,” published in Solar Energy.

The first part of the project was launched last week together with the Moshavim settlement movement and Israel’s Environment Protection Ministry. It is expected to start operations in the first half of 2024 and will require a total investment of approximately ILS 470 million ($120 million).
The Ta'anach solar project will include 550 MWh of battery energy storage, according to a LinkedIn post by Teralight’s business development economist Doron Koll. He added that the first part of the project, totaling 150 MW of solar, is based on a 23-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state of Israel, while the remaining 110 MW of solar and 550 MWh of storage will be based on a private PPA.
“This private PPA is expected to be the largest private PPA to be signed in Israel within the new wholesale electricity market that is being established,” Koll said.
