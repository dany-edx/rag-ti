https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/23/china-pledges-not-to-build-new-coal-plants-abroad-questions-remain/,"GEOPOLITICS,MARKETS,POLICY,ASIA,CHINA",ILIAS TSAGAS,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",China pledges not to build new coal plants abroad yet questions remain,"“China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,” said China’s President Xi Jinping via a video recording at the United Nations General Assembly annual summit, which this year follows a hybrid virtual-physical presence format after being hosted almost entirely online a year ago.
China is using its so-called ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI) to finance and build several infrastructure projects in developing nations, including power plants, ports, and roads, among others.
The announcement is welcome news because it holds the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the developing world. However, Xi Jinping’s pledge did not include enough details to see climate activists celebrating just yet. Specifically, it remains to be seen when China’s pledge will come into force, whether it includes older coal plants that have been approved but not yet built, and whether financing coal plants to be built by others remains on paper.
To many, the news of China’s recent pledge did not come as a surprise. For example, about a year ago, Pakistan’s prime minister said Pakistan would stop commissioning new coal plants. Although the announcement did not include existing projects under development, the decision nevertheless demonstrated that partners to China’s BRI do not have to take whatever China offers.
Similarly, a report published in January by the Global Energy Monitor (GEM), a non-profit organization funded by the U.S.-based Ford Foundation, the German Institute for International Cooperation, and the European Climate Fund, found that since 2014, the coal project pipeline of the world’s leading coal power nations has shrunk by around two-thirds. Of these countries, only South Africa is not in Asia.
Despite the promising market trends and China’s pledge to stop building new coal plants abroad, the transition from coal to low carbon energy sources won’t necessarily be immediate.
pv magazine recently published a feature examining the factors that inhibit solar power in Asia. The analysis showed that such factors include the lack of an adequate business and regulatory infrastructure to help smaller businesses develop and deliver PV and the associated supply chains; institutional inertia, with many of the developing nations’ institutions (e.g., large electric utilities) exhibiting an outdated attachment to fossil fuel investments; and the availability of financing, given that Asia’s new coal-fired power investment is predominantly underpinned by export credit agency finance.
What is urgently needed is a set of reforms across the Asian and other developing nations to bring competition in their electricity markets and, thus, allow their countries to grasp the new opportunities afforded by low-cost renewables like solar PV.
China’s pledge to stop building new coal plants abroad will also mean nothing if it continues to finance coal plants built by others.
A few months ago, Michael Grubb, a professor of International Energy and Climate Change Policy at University College London (UCL), and lead author in several reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – the United Nations’ body for assessing the science related to climate change – told pv magazine that China finances “a lot of everything” and it is unclear whether the country’s leadership has arrived at a decision as to whether it favors coal over renewables.
“Still, I’ll predict one thing: almost all those countries keen to host Chinese-funded coal plants will end up regretting it – so even might China,” he said.
It appears China has realized that building coal plants abroad is not a wise business. It now remains for the other nations to realize that coal is an economically and environmentally disastrous business; as well as China to stop building coal plants at home.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/23/solarwatt-brings-new-module-and-battery-factories-online-in-germany/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",Solarwatt brings new module and battery factories online in Germany,"German solar module and battery manufacturer Solarwatt today inaugurated 300 MW of new module production lines, bringing its total PV module production capacity to 550 MW. The company is also bringing new battery pack assembly lines online, at its headquarters in Dresden, Germany.
The company says it invested around €35 million in the new PV and storage capacity, as part of a plan to invest €100 million in further development of the company over the next few years. The module lines will produce glass-glass modules based on half-cut M6 (166mm) cells, and the new storage lines will assemble nickel-manganese-cobalt modules into battery packs for the residential storage market. Cells for the battery pack are obtained from BMW, consisting of the same technology used in the automakers electric vehicles. The cells are assembled into modules by German company Webasto, as part of a cooperation with Solarwatt.
The new production capacity was officially announced at an event earlier today. Solarwatt CEO Detlef Neuhaus introduced the new factory, and was joined on stage by Michael Kretschmer, Prime Minister of the State of Saxony, and Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe – both of whom spoke of the need for new renewable energy manufacturing capacity to keep up with rising demand, and for both Germany and Europe to maintain leadership in development of the technology and not to rely solely on other regions to power its energy transition.
“Demand from customers for photovoltaic solutions for private homes and the commercial sector is increasing – not only in Germany but all over the world,” said Neuhaus. “That’s why it is important that we also have a strong solar industry in this country that drives innovation and offers solutions that enable people to supply themselves with clean energy as quickly and easily as possible.”

The new production capacity will be powered by 100% renewable energy, including from a rooftop PV installation. The end products – both modules and batteries – will be destined primarily for residential systems in Europe, though Solarwatt also has a presence in the Australian market. By offering both PV modules and residential battery packs to end customers, the company hopes to drive electrification and decarbonization. “The potential for CO2 savings through sector coupling is huge,” added Neuhaus. “A homeowner who operates an electric car and a heat pump with a PV system and energy storage reduces his own CO2 emissions by up to 90%. Extrapolate that to about 16 million homes in Germany, that’s about 160 million tons that could be saved annually in this area alone.”
The new module line is fully automated up to the junction-box attachment stage, and will produce glass-glass modules sold under a 30 year, 87% performance warranty. Solarwatt is currently working with roundwire, multi busbar interconnection, and 166mm M6 cells in a half cell format, and says that the new lines could process the larger M10 cells without major changes. Solarwatt CTO Armin Froitzheim told pv magazine that he sees any cell format larger than this as likely too big for the rooftop segment.

Including the €35 million invested in the new production capacity announced today, Solarwatt says its plans to invest €100 million in further development. Froitzheim also spoke of plans for a new pilot line, and research & development to investigate optimized module assembly processes and materials for new cell technologies, including perovskite-silicon tandem cells.

German PV module provider Sonnenstromfabrik has announced it will use half-cell technology and large wafers with a size of 182 mm in its glass-film and glass-glass solar modules.
The product launch is planned for the first quarter of 2021, while prices and products sheets should be available by the end of this month.
The smallest of the three module series features full black products with a size of 1,560 x 1,145 mm and a maximum output of 350 W. Sonnenfabrik will also offer a Full Black & Smart module series measuring 1,745 x 1,145 mm and exhibit a power output of up to 400 W. Both series are available as glass-backsheet and glass-glass solar modules. The largest of the three series features glass-backsheet modules with a size of 2,110 x 1,145 mm and an output of 490 W.
The smaller solar modules are intended for use in the residential and commercial PV rooftop market, whilethe most powerful are more suitable for ground-mounted PV projects.
According to Sonnenstromfabrik, orders can be placed as early as this October. The first deliveries are then planned for January.
In addition to the new series, the manufacturer will continue to produce the “Brilliant” and “Solrif” module series at its Wismar location. Part of the capacity of the old module series will be reserved in the long term to ensure the supply for replacement in older PV systems, the manufacturer said.
Sonnenstromfabrik previously invested in the automation of its new production facilities in its production facility in Wismar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/23/pv-powered-autonomous-sea-access-for-people-with-disabilities/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GREECE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",PV-powered autonomous sea access for people with disabilities,"Greek startup Tobea Ltd., a spinoff of the University of Patras, has developed a solar-powered system that provides autonomous sea access for people with disabilities. It can be installed during the early summer period and can be uninstalled at the end of the season.
The so-called Seatrac system consists of a fixed-track mechanism in which a moving chair can be shifted in and out of the water. It is connected to two heavy-duty cables – one on each side. A single solar panel is used to charge a battery that provides all the electricity needed to operate the platform.
The system's drive train does not use any tension mechanism for the cables and a friction clutch is used to ensure smooth operation.
“This approach makes Seatrac a completely standalone apparatus that does not depend on the grid for its operation and eliminates electricity-related hazards,” Tobea CEO Ignatios Fotiou told pv magazine, noting that the PV panel is a safe solution due to its low voltage. It also accounts for just 5% of the platform's costs.
“The PV unit is not just for the energy supply as it also offers shade to the person sitting on the chair,” Fotiou added.
Any conventional solar module measuring 1 m x 1.6 m can be used. The electricity is injected into a valve regulated lead–acid (VRLA) battery manufactured by Greek battery specialist Sunlight. It works via a solar charge controller provided by Victron Energy. After it is uninstalled, the system can be stored in a space of just 3 square meters, ready to be reinstalled the following summer season.
Tobea says the platform can be controlled by a radio frequency remote control, with no special training required for the system operator.
“We use computer vision with artificial intelligence in order to provide to people with disabilities live images from the beach,” Fotiou said. “For people with impairments, it is essential to know sea conditions in advance, as they cannot always handle wavy sea.”
The platform can be used by disabled people without the need for assistance, and people with lower limb impairments can use it autonomously.
“What is really encouraging is that it is used as an assistive device, even for people with severe disabilities use as the caregivers are helped by Seatrac to move them in and out of water,” Fotiou said.
The company has already deployed its solutions across several Greek beaches and now plans to expand into Italy and Cyprus.

Aerocompact, an Austrian solar racking solutions maker that launched operations in India in November 2019, has started exporting its made-in-India products to the Middle East and Southeast Asian nations such as Thailand and Malaysia, in addition to catering to the local market.
Aerocompact Country Manager Mandar Mainde told pv magazine that the company's India operations have supplied 7 MW of sheet-metal roof mounting products since February 2020 in the domestic market. It also plans to soon start shipping its products to Vietnam, said Mainde.
Aerocompact has its products contract-manufactured in India. It has also started manufacturing flat-roof PV racking products in the country. The new offerings will be available from next January. Its Indian operations are also supporting the requirements of its European business and will eventually support its presence in the U.S. market, too, said Mainde.
The company sees most of its demand coming from the commercial and industrial segment, particularly from owners of factories with sheet-metal rooftops. It’s following the approach of reaching out to end customers such as factory owners and developers, said Mainde.

The M3 panel is available in two versions: a device with a size of 2,131×1,055×65 mm and an output of 450 W; and a module with a size of 1,791×1,055×65 mm and a power of 375 W.
Compared to the company's previous products, the new panel is said to be 10% larger and have a 15% higher output compared to its other products. “We switched to larger half solar cells with more power,” a spokesperson from Triple Solar told pv magazine. “Triple Solar has also developed a new mounting rail that saves installers time during installation.” In the new solution, the mounting clamps are pre-mounted on the mounting rail and the middle clamp profile is removed and replaced by a pre-mounted hook on the rail.
For a heat pump with a capacity of 6 kW, at least six modules covering 16m² would be required. For other capacities, 2.7m² of panels are needed for each kW of the heat pump. Stainless steel or synthetic piping can be used to connect the panel with the heat pump.
The piping outside the building does not need to be not to be insulated, while in the building it must have a 1.9 mm insulation. The internal diameter of the pipes must be 26 mm for heat pumps with capacity ranging from 6 kW to 8 kW, 32 mm for capacities between 8 kW to 15 kW, 41 mm for a 15 kW-28 configuration kW, and 51 mm for outputs of 28 kW to 50 kW.
The solar module technology used in the panel is provided by Slovenian manufacturer Bisol.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/23/the-worlds-largest-solar-parks/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",The world’s largest solar parks,"The concept of the solar park was first developed in India and China a decade ago. Regional energy agencies in states such as Gujarat, Qinghai, and Gansu identified suitable locations where several solar power plants could be sited together. The coordinators provided for high-capacity grid connections and often procured or provided the land.
Probably the most notable early example is the Charanka Solar Park in India’s Patan district. When this was first opened in 2012 by Gujarat’s then chief minister, Narendra Modi, it had a combined capacity of 224 MWP from 19 individual solar power plants, of which the largest were 25P MW each. It has since been expanded to 500 MW of overall capacity.
The largest solar parks now house up to 80 individual solar power plants, achieving higher capacities than single plants. The concept has subsequently been adopted elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. A similar approach was implemented by the Bureau of Land Management in the USA, when it designated several ‘Solar Energy Zones’, such as that at Dry Lake in Nevada.
The following list selects the solar parks which are thought to have at least 1 GWAC of current operational capacity (typically equivalent to 1.25 GWP). The position each held in the 2019 lists are shown in brackets. The list is still dominated by China and India, joined by single entries in Egypt and the UAE, and a likely future entrant in the USA.
Located in the desert to the East of Golmud in Qinghai Province in China this solar park now houses about 80 solar power plants with a combined capacity of over 2.8 GWAC – up by a gigawatt since the last list – and includes a 200 MW ‘power tower’ CSP plant. It also houses a 200 MWP PV plant by Huanghe – the largest individual solar power plant in the world, when it was first built in 2011.
It is not known what the final capacity will be, but the overall area would be sufficient for an eventual 4 to 5 GW.
 
The Bhadla Solar Park, covering about 160 km2 at Bhadlachuhron Ki in the north of India’s Rajasthan state, has also expanded by around 1 GW since 2019, with several new plants, the largest of which is 300 MW. It will eventually accommodate nearly 30 solar plants with a total capacity of 3.5 GWAC.
 
This group of solar plants located beside the Longyangxia Reservoir in Eastern Qinghai, China, delivers its power in conjunction with a nearby hydro-electricity plant. It has been progressively expanded since the first phase in 2013 and now stands at an estimated 2.4 GW.
United Photovoltaics’ smaller Tara Beach Solar Park is visible to the north and the 50 MW Gonghe CSP power tower to the East.
Originally developed by China Power Investment – now State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) – this was previously listed as an individual plant (where it ranked #3).
This compact solar park scraped into the last list before it was officially commissioned. It is now largely complete with 27 blocks mostly of a nominal 50 MW, though there is space for around a further 400 MW.
The solar park covers 37 sq.km. in the desert in Egypt’s Aswan governorate and is the only solar park outside Asia on this list.
 
Also known as Anantapur Ultra Mega Solar Park, this solar park covers some 90 km2 in the Nambula Pulakunta district of Andhra Pradesh, India.
Promoted by Andhra Pradesh Solar Power Corporation, it is scheduled for a total capacity of 1.5 GW, of which about 1.2 GW is currently believed to be operational, though the site has been dogged by various delays.

The fourth and fifth phases are now under construction to the north-east and south of this solar park in the south of the UAE emirate of Dubai. Phase IV includes CSP plants using both parabolic trough and power tower technologies.
One of only two listed parks outside China and India, the eventual capacity of this complex is scheduled to be 5 GW, which may make it the largest in the world, covering up to 200 km2.
Jinchuan in China’s Gansu province is almost surrounded by solar power plants. The solar park covers almost 90 km2 of semi-desert to the north west of the city, while a further cluster of projects is to the south.
The solar park has now been increased to 15 plants with a combined capacity just over 1 GW. Jinchuan’s largest plant has a capacity over 200 MW.

A new entry at #8, covering 92 km2 of semi-desert in the Mori Kazakh district of Changji Hui prefecture of China’s Xinjiang Province is this solar park to the north of the town of Danangouxiang.
The current capacity of its 13 plants is just over 1 GW, and it has sufficient space to at least double in size in future years.
Located on some 80 km2 of low grade agricultural land in Karnataka state in India, to the north-east of the city of Pavagada, this solar park is now largely complete with its 19 plants giving a combined capacity of 1 GWAC.
The solar park was sponsored by Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited (KREDL) and the off-taker for most of its output is India’s National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).

Delingha Solar Park is located in the Haixi Prefecture, and is the third on this list in Qinghai Province. It houses about 40 projects with a combined capacity of over 1 GW. This includes 3 CSP plants together delivering about 200 MW (edged in red on this aerial view).
Plants now in construction will take the capacity over 1 GW, while Delingha Solar Park has enough site area for an eventual capacity of at least 2 GW.
The highest U.S. solar park on the list, the Dry Lake Solar Enterprize zone, is at #20. Way below even that, Westlands currently has only one small plant in service. However, most of its 10 plants are now in construction, and it will reach 1.5 GW when they are all complete.
The Westlands Zone covers 120 km2 of mainly agricultural land in the San Joacquin Valley, south of Fresno, California. There are also several existing solar power plants in the vicinity.
 
The term “solar plant” is used for an individual project that has been developed by a single developer or consortium. The largest of these were listed previously. Where, as described in this article, multiple plants are co-located in a discrete area under the coordination of an identified agency, this is called a “solar park”. The  word “cluster” is used where multiple solar farms are co-located in an area without formal coordination.
For consistency, all capacities are quoted in MWAC to allow direct comparison between PV and CSP plants (and other forms of generation). Readers will be aware that the DC peak capacity of PV plants is typically ~25% higher than the rated AC capacity, quoted here.
The final article in the series will identify the world’s biggest solar clusters.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/23/fraunhofer-ise-develops-solder-free-aluminum-interconnection-tech-for-shingled-pv-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",Fraunhofer ISE develops solder-free aluminum interconnection tech for shingled PV modules,"Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have developed a busbarless, electrically conductive adhesive-free, and solder-free aluminum interconnection that they claim is a cost-effective and flexible solution for the interconnection of separated cells in shingled solar modules. “We will show a mini-module made with our technology at our Fraunhofer ISE Booth at the upcoming Intersolar in Munich,” the Head of Department Production Technology at the Fraunhofer ISE, Jan Nekarda, told pv magazine.
Conventional processes to connect shingled solar cells usually adopt electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs), with which the rear side busbar of one cell is attached to the front side busbar of an adjacent cell. According to Nekarda, it is still unclear how much cheaper the proposed interconnection technology is when compared to the relevant ECA stringing. “Nevertheless we are confident, that a significant cost reduction will remain, due to the very high silver reduction of our technology,” Nekarda said, noting the Fraunhofer ISE started a cooperation with German PV production equipment provider Manz AG to build a machine for industrial implementation via a publicly funded project.

Through the proposed approach, ECAs and screen-printed busbars on both sides of the cells are replaced by an 8-μm-thick aluminum foil, called FoilMet. The foil is joined to the silicon nitride (SiNX) passivation via laser metal bond (LMB) process, which the researchers describe as a non-invasive technique that creates bonds between the passivation of the cell and the foil without penetrating the passivation.
“The silver (Ag) fingers and the aluminum (Al) fingers are microwelded to the foil using 300- to 700-μm-long line-shaped joints performed with a single 1-kW infrared continuous-wave laser leaving no necessity for busbar-like structures,” the scientists said. “The simplicity of FoilMet, which connects the fingers of adjacent cells without more intermediate layers than a single Al foil, is of great advantage compared to an ECA interconnection, with joints from the Al finger to the Ag busbar, to the ECA, to the Ag busbar, and to the Ag finger, and therefore consisting of a multitude of layers.”
The German group compared the performance of the novel interconnection technology with that of a conventional interconnection relying on ECAs. The measurements showed that the module fabricated with the foil achieved an efficiency of 21%, while the device without the foil reached 20.3%, with the 0.7% efficiency advantage being attributed mainly due to the increased fill factor. “Regardless of the cause leading to the disparity in the filling factor, in general, good interconnections using ECA can be achieved,” explained the scientists, adding, “FoilMet Interconnect, however, demonstrates the ability to reliably create interconnections with low series resistance and strings with high efficiencies.”
Image: Fraunhofer ISE
They analyzed the performance of the foil in a TC200 aging test to assess the long-term stability of the aluminum interconnection and found that the majority of all shingle strings withstood the stresses of encapsulation.
When asked about the applicability of this new technology in a commercial production line, Nekarda said that unfortunately new processes are never “immediately” applicable to commercial production and need some adaptations. “Compared to other innovations the necessary adaptations seem to be little,” he stated. “The metallization layout has to be changed and the new machine for stringing has to be implemented in the production line. Since new materials are used extensive testing is needed, too.”
The device is described in the paper FoilMet-Interconnect: Busbarless, electrically conductive adhesive-free, and solder-free aluminum interconnection for modules with shingled solar cells, which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/23/how-long-do-residential-storage-batteries-last/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",How long do residential storage batteries last?,"From pv magazine USA
In Parts 1 and 2 of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of residential solar panels and inverters. Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households showed that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents who are actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they plan to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The idea here is to maximize the value of the home’s solar system. And some batteries are optimized to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
Although deployment of energy storage is on a steady climb, attachment rates of batteries remain low. In 2020, just 8.1% of residential solar systems included attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL).
Many options exist with multiple battery chemistries available for home energy storage. The bottom line, however, is that in the United States, two brands dominate the space. More than 90% of the market is served by LG Chem and Tesla Powerwall, which are lithium-ion batteries, according to LBL. Tesla controls more than 60% of the entire market.
The Tesla PowerWall has a limited warranty that says the device will be free from defects for 10 years following installation. It also warrants that the PowerWall will start its life with a capacity of 13.5 kWh, and will retain energy capacity based on a degradation schedule.
LG claims that its system will retain at least 60% of its nominal energy capacity (9.8 kWh) for 10 years. The battery must operate between -10 C and 45 C to remain covered by the warranty. Total throughput of energy within the warranty is limited to 27.4 MWh.
Battery life
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between five to 15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20 to 30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.
Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: overcharge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said the Faraday Institute. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
Maintenance matters
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but potential threat) can be minimized. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (build-up on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.

The residential battery inverter is described by the manufacturer as compatible with any residential solar system – new or existing, AC or DC – and expandable to 24.4 kWh with its optional NV24 battery, without the expense of a second inverter. “We have a production capacity of 400 NV14s per month now,” the company's CEO, Brent Wilson, told pv magazine. “We can ramp up higher with demand.”

Enclosed in a NEMA Type 3R cabinet, the battery inverter has a size of 96x96x25cm and weighs in at 254 kg. It includes a sub-panel provided by Irish energy-management specialist Eaton that features a 40 Amp power input breaker, with the system providing 32 A of AC output power to the household, which the company said is 54% more than its competitors.
The inverter can accept 9.6 kW of solar AC power and 8.4 kW of DC solar. It features two MPPTs with 5 kW, 500 V, and 18 A maximum per MPPT. “With this superior inverter, the NV14 can typically power up to fourteen 120 V circuits, whether the grid is on or off,” NeoVolta said.
The battery has a nominal voltage of 48 V and an energy charge efficiency of 94%. The NV24 storage system adds 9.6 kWh of storage capacity storage to the NV14 device for a total of 24.0 kWh. According to the manufacturer, the additional battery can be retrofitted to the NV14 at any time and it takes 90 minutes to install.
NeoVolta said that, with a trained install crew, the system can be installed in up to eight hours. “Half of the time is spent pulling circuits out of the main service panel and into the provided Eaton sub-panel,” it further explained. “Most of this time is spent making sure that the right neutral is pulled with the corresponding positive.”
The battery inverter must be installed in an indoor environment or protected if installed outside facing south or where summer ambient temperatures will exceed 49 Celsius degrees.
NeoVolta said in a statement it recently reached a five-year supply agreement with an undisclosed provider. “We are excited to reach this agreement with our inverter manufacturing partner, who shares our commitment to performance and reliability,” Wilson stated. “This move will ensure the strength of our product as we continue to expand the NeoVolta brand.”

Brisbane-based energy producer Energy Developments Ltd. (EDL) has been contracted to build, own and operate a 4 MW solar plant and 4 MW/4 MWh battery energy storage system that will connect to the existing minigrid at Weipa on Queensland’s Cape York Peninsula.
Work on the battery facility is scheduled to commence later this year, with construction of the entire project expected to be complete by late 2022. The new solar plant and battery storage system will complement the existing 1.7 MW solar farm and connect directly to the Weipa electricity network, helping to provide reliable power for Rio Tinto’s Weipa bauxite mine and processing facilities, as well as the surrounding community.
When complete, the combined 4 MW solar capacity and 4 MW/4 MWh battery will provide about 11 GWh of renewable energy annually. The solar+storage plant will be backed up by diesel-fired generators. It is expected that the upgrades will reduce diesel consumption at Rio Tinto’s Weipa operations by an estimated 7 million liters per year and lower its annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 20,000 tons.
Rio Tinto Aluminium Pacific Bauxite Operations General Manager Michelle Elvy said the battery storage will help stabilize the existing Weipa power generation network, while the thermal generation will be used to fill the gaps in the evening or when there is low sunlight.
“The new solar farm and battery storage at Weipa will help us lower our carbon footprint and diesel use in a reliable way,” she said. “The original Weipa solar farm was the largest solar facility at an off-grid Australian mine site at the time it was built, and it played an important role in showing the viability of renewable energy systems in remote locations. The new solar farm and battery storage system is part of Rio Tinto’s group-wide commitment to reduce emissions across our operations. There is clearly more work to be done, but projects like this are an important part of meeting our climate targets.”
The existing 1.6 MW solar farm was completed in 2015 and purchased by EDL in 2018.
EDL Chief Executive Officer James Harman said since then, the Queensland-based developer had delivered a string of “high-penetration, award-winning hybrid renewable microgrids in other remote locations around Australia. We’ll be leveraging expertise from these projects to increase our supply of clean energy for Rio Tinto’s operations and the local community, with no compromise on power quality or reliability.”
The Weipa project forms part of Rio Tinto’s commitment to reduce its carbon footprint, targeting net zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year, the miner appointed Perth-based civil contractor NRW Holdings to deliver a 34 MW solar and battery energy storage system at its Gudai-Darri mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region.
