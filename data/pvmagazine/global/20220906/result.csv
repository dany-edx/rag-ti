Under the terms of the agreement, the heterojunction solar cell equipment maker will supply 12 production lines with a total capacity of 7.2 GW per year for Huasun Solar's factory in China's Anhui province. Maxwell Technology said the supply contract value exceeded 50% of its revenue for 2021, which was CNY 3.1 billion ($445.5 million). In April, it also announced a contract with India-based Reliance Industries for eight lines, totaling 4.8 GW.
Golden Solar said last week that it will supply approximately 300 MW of heterojunction solar cells and modules to Hong Kong-based First Holding Group, which supplies materials for Swiss rooftop PV brand Megasol. First Holding will have the option of extending the one-year agreement.
Tongwei has announced new solar cell prices, with increases for all of its monocrystalline PV products. The polysilicon supplier and solar cell maker priced its PERC 182 mm cells at CNY 1.31 per watt and its PERC 166 mm cells at CNY 1.29 per watt. It also increased the price of its PERC 210 mm cells to CNY 1.30 per watt.
TBEA has agreed to sell 336,000 metric tons of polysilicon to module manufacturer JinkoSolar in the 2023-30 period. The companies will periodically set the purchase price to reflect market prices.
Solargiga said this week that it has agreed to lease CNY 76.8 million of monosilicon furnaces from Zhejiang Zheyin Financial Leasing for that figure plus around CNY 6.47 million of leasing interest. The equipment – supplied by Xi’an Chuanglian New Energy Equipment to Zhejiang Zheyin – will be used to make solar ingots at Solargiga’s base in Yunnan province, under a 30- month lease.
China Shuifa Singyes Energy’s pivot toward wind ahead of more costly solar projects in the first half was reflected by solar engineering, procurement, and construction revenue of CNY 103 million, versus a wind figure of CNY 1.55 billion. The company announced a six-month net profit for shareholders of CNY 115 million, up from CNY 102 million a year earlier.

The team from Technische Universität Dresden, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, and the US Oak Ridge National Laboratory used high-resolution cryo-adsorption studies with characterization by inelastic neutron scattering vibration spectroscopy. The low temperature reduces the volume of 1 kg of hydrogen to only 5 liters. The scientists used mesoporous silica with smooth connected surfaces, as the super-dense hydrogen monolayer may not form on highly fragmented surfaces.
Delft University of Technology researchers have performed, for the first time, H2/water multiphase flow experiments at core scale under medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, in order to test hydrogen transport properties in porous rocks. “The interplay between gravitational, capillary and viscous forces can lead to complex displacement patterns during UHS [underground hydrogen storage] in reservoir rock. The high density contrast between the H2 and water phase can result in gravity segregation. Capillary barriers can counteract this effect, and enhance the spreading of hydrogen,” the researchers wrote in “Experimental characterization of H2/water multiphase flow in heterogeneous sandstone rock at the core scale relevant for underground hydrogen storage (UHS).” The paper, published in Scientific Reports, said that visualization of the saturation distribution is necessary to ensure the validity of relative permeability and capillary pressure measurements for the H2/water system. They said storing hydrogen is not like storing CH4 and CO2 for three reasons. The cyclic loading and frequency of injection will be determined by “the intermittent green energy production;” the purity of the gas stream reproduced from the reservoir will be more critical in the case of hydrogen due to problems stemming from hydrogen impurities;  and hydrogen's low density and low viscosity could lead to complex interplay of gravitational, capillary and viscous forces.
Itochu and Air Liquide Japan have teamed up to construct a hydrogen refueling station for large commercial vehicles in Motomiya, in Japan's Fukushima prefecture. It is set to start operation in the first half of 2024. Itochu also signed a memorandum of understanding on green ammonia projects with Sasol. “The parties will jointly study the development of ammonia supply chain including green ammonia production facility which Sasol plans to develop in Boegoebaai, Northern Cape province, South Africa. The study will include an export-orientated project of green ammonia for power applications, bunker fuel, and other conventional applications,” said Itochu.
Jera and Uniper have agreed to procure and sell energy from the United States, to facilitate large-scale “clean ammonia production projects.” Japanese power producer Jera also announced plans to collaborate with ConocoPhillips on a proposed US hydrogen gas project on the US Gulf Coast.
Energinet and Gasunie Deutschland have signed a memorandum of understanding to accelerate preparations for cross-border hydrogen infrastructure between Denmark and Germany. The companies conducted a techno-economic pre-feasibility study showing that Denmark could potentially supply 10% to 25% of future German hydrogen demand.
Hyundai Motor has announced investments in three companies – Impact Coatings, H2Pro and GRZ Technologies – to strengthen its position in the hydrogen fuel cell ecosystem. Sweden's Impact Coatings is a supplier of PVD1-based coating solutions for fuel cells, and Israeli startup H2Pro developed E-TAC (electrochemical, thermally active chemical) water splitting technology. Switzerland's GRZ Technologies, meanwhile, specializes in hydrogen storage.
BAM has converted a diesel-powered, asphalt-spreading paver into a machine with a hydrogen combustion engine. “Often fuel cells are used to convert hydrogen into electricity. Instead, BAM and Van Twist have used a hydrogen combustion engine. Unlike a fuel cell, the quality of hydrogen is not important for a hydrogen combustion engine,” said the Dutch construction-services business.
Transport Enterprise Leasing has signed a letter of intent to purchase 15-liter hydrogen internal combustion engines from Cummins.

The investment will allow the factory to start production of outdoor units within the next fiscal year, in addition to the indoor units already being manufactured. The air-to-water heat pump system technology allows heaters to maintain their heating capacity even at low outdoor temperatures, according to the company.
Panasonic aims to increase its annual production capacity to 500,000 units by March 2026.
“Currently, a shift in energy sources reducing gas and other fossil fuels while enabling for more electrification is rapidly taking place in Europe. Due to the rising environmental awareness and the recent circumstances surrounding energy supply, there has been a pressing need for Panasonic to establish a production capacity to meet such growing demand,” the company said.
Since April, Panasonic has offered an air-source heat pump that can be combined with residential rooftop solar for water heating. The Eco Cute solution includes a heat pump and hot water storage unit that purportedly saves energy by maintaining bathwater temperatures at a constant level.
It also helps homeowners to save energy at night by using heat from their bathwater. In addition, the device reduces energy and water use.
Panasonic started production of air-to-water indoor heat pumps in Plzen, Czechia, in 2018. It also launched an Internet of Things (IoT)-based maintenance business in Denmark in the last fiscal year.

The theft of PV modules and other solar technology is increasing in Germany.
The Criminal Police Office of Saxony has already sounded the alarm. There were 27 such crimes in the state in the first half of 2021.
The year before there were 24. In the first six months of this year, however, the officials counted 34 cases. Damages from the first half of the year alone in Saxony surpassed €250,000.
In the past two weeks alone, there have been a number of reports, including the theft of 114 solar modules from a construction site in Arzberg, Germany. About €30,000 ($29,790) of solar tech was also stolen in Nauen, Brandenburg, for example.
The authorities said that the thieves are members of organized gangs that use vans to steal PV tech. Components are most frequently stolen from large commercial rooftops and ground-mounted systems, but thieves are increasingly targeting smaller residential systems, too.

They have also provided an overview of potential applications in desalination projects.
The scientists set criteria to evaluate the performance of seawater batteries. These considerations include capacity, efficiency, stability, performance longevity, safety, and environmental friendliness.
The researchers described seawater storage systems as a derivative of rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (NIB), which offer a series of advantages in terms of raw material costs and safety. However, they also have limited ability to hold a charge after repeated cycles of charging and discharging.
“A typical rechargeable seawater battery contains an organic electrolyte side and an aqueous electrolyte side, separated by the solid sodium diffusion membrane,” they explained. “The organic parts resemble the typical NIB with elemental sodium as an anode. If the seawater battery is contacted with seawater, the catholyte's free and abundant sodium ions can migrate into the anode compartment during the charging process.”
They looked at all components and properties of rechargeable seawater batteries, while providing an overview of all possible challenges and opportunities for them. They looked at materials, design and cell-structure adjustment.
“Conventional seawater batteries enable the storage of electrochemical energy by combining a sodiation/desodiation anode and an electrolysis cathode,” they said. “Based on the evaluation and continuous improvement of the cell parts, the electrochemical performance such as the stability, power, voltage efficiency, Coulombic efficiency, and other parameters of the resulting cell is then evaluated and reflects the current state of the art.”
The main technological hurdles to address, according to the academics, are shot lifetime, safe battery operation, low Coulombic/energy efficiency, and low stability, as well as side reactions and non-optimized cell components. They also described the most recurring issues with the anode or the stability of the membrane and cathode in saltwater, and also introduced all current approaches to improve present-day seawater battery technologies.
The group said that the typical structure of the battery should be modified to pair renewables storage via seawater batteries with desalination.
“Unlike conventional seawater batteries, the system used stilled water as the catholyte and seawater as the feed water,” they said. “Oxygen evolution reactions occur at the cathode part during the charging process, producing protons; sodium ions insert into the hard carbon anode.”
They said seawater batteries could easily replace some seawater reverse-osmosis components and might also be useful to extract sodium ions from seawater.
“In addition, using other ion-selective membranes would enable elemental harvesting within the context of lithium extraction,” they said. “Alternatively, nonselective membranes would boost the performance in seawater because cations beyond sodium would be removed.”
The scientists presented their findings in “Dual-Use of Seawater Batteries for Energy Storage and Water Desalination.”
“The advantages of seawater batteries provide a perspective toward sustainable, environmentally friendly, performance-oriented, and cost-efficient applications at the energy/water nexus,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/06/a-game-changer-for-ppa-markets/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2022",A game-changer for PPA markets,"This summer season has witnessed a series of unprecedented climatic events, including record-breaking temperatures reached amid consecutive heatwaves, wildfires, extreme drought, and water shortages. Hopefully this shall encourage wider collective ambition to hasten the development of renewables and limit the accelerating impacts of climate change.
PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) are one way to support the development of renewables and limit the negative impacts of climate change. But what is the current status of the PPA market, set within the context of these extraordinary times? We propose taking a step back and reminding ourselves where we have come from, in order to realize where we stand, and most importantly, ask what comes next?
Firstly, let's look back to where it all started with a focus on the development of energy and power markets. Back in September 2021, the markets were still rather tranquil, with energy prices moving up or down within a reasonable range: a comfortable configuration for PPAs, with a significant number of transactions being reported at competitive prices over the long term.
According to Bloomberg, 2021 recorded 31 GW of cumulative capacity of PPAs signed globally. However, by late 2021, a combination of factors led to an exceptional scenario for energy commodities in Europe.
Phase 1: Between the end of Q3 and beginning of Q4 2021, cold temperatures landed in Europe, resulting in stronger demand for gas and power. Nothing surprising, except as the chart below demonstrates, for the fact that gas stocks in Europe were at the lower-end of the range, with the necessity to refill stocks, while entering the winter period. As demand for heating started to increase, this combination resulted in pushing European gas prices up, and quickly.
In the meantime, prices for European Emission Allowances (EUAs) which had been moving smoothly upwards over the course of 2021 on the back of more ambitious climate targets (such as the EU Fit for 55), also experienced a rapid increase from October 2021 onwards, trading just below 100 EUR/T by early-2022. Higher gas and CO2 prices accordingly pushed power prices up marginally, through still within “reasonable” and expected ranges.
Phase 2: In the middle of a winter (21-22) already hit by tight supply/demand conditions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine propelled the whole energy complex to historically high prices on the back of fears of shortages and supply issues. The series of EU restrictive measures against Russia contributed to further tighten the supply/demand balance, such as the abandonment of the Nord Stream pipeline project (further reducing Europe’s gas sourcing capacity), or the consecutive bans on Russian imports, including alternative fuels such as coal, biomass, and oil.
Phase 3: More recently, extreme summer weather conditions, marked by severe droughts and consecutive heatwaves across Europe, poured more oil on the fire. Demand for air conditioning increased, while record-breaking temperatures also lowered water levels, emptying reservoirs, thus reducing hydropower capacity. Nuclear power production has been impacted as well, facing constraints to use river water to cool plants.
France, the most pro-nuclear power country in Europe (with 56 reactors, representing approx. 70% of the country’s electricity generation) has been the most affected in that respect, while the country was already struggling with maintenance and unplanned work to repair corrosion of reactors.
In another unprecedented event, France switched from being a reliable net exporter of electricity to a net importer, further augmenting the pressure on its neighboring countries including the UK which traditionally relied on its steady outflows.
The combination of all these factors reinforced the upward pressure on energy prices.
On August 11, the Q1 2023 Baseload contract in France even managed to reach the 4 digits threshold on EEX; trading above €1,000/MWh (followed shortly after by the calendar 2023 Baseload contract, which traded above €1,000/MWh as well on August 26).

Therefore, at the time of writing (end of august) the bullish momentum in the energy and power markets remains intact, recording unprecedented and extreme levels of volatility, whilst high energy prices have become the new norm.
How do these short to medium term events impact the (long-term) PPA markets? It can be argued that the impact of these fundamental events should short-lived and impact spot prices only.
This is partly true as the chart below demonstrates, where we can observe a very strong backwardation:

Focusing on PPAs and long-term power contracts, it is important to note that not only have prices skyrocketed, but also:
In Germany the year-ahead contract (2023 power baseload) rose by 623%, moving from €122/MWh on 03/01/2022 (Close EEX) up to €760/MWh on 29/08/2022. To a lesser extent the 10 Years baseload average rose by 282% (from €87/MWh to €245/MWh) during the same period (see above chart).
This bullish trend is being replicated all over Europe. As an example, in Spain the 10-year pay-as-produced PPAs were trading below the €30/MWh mark at the end of 2021. Price references are now above the €40/MWh mark. Regulated tariffs and governmental auctions are following suit.
Winning bids at the next Spanish auction, which will be launched in November this year for 3.3 GW of renewable energy projects, are expected to be higher for the second consecutive time since the late-2021 auction, which already resulted in higher tariffs than the previous auctions. In France under the new PPE2 ground-mounted tender, the average awarded tariff in August experienced an unprecedented increase (+16.4%).
This upwards price adjustment is logical. Developers need it. They are directly impacted by increased Capex (modules & transport) and financing costs. Central banks are now moving towards tighter monetary policy, and increasing interest rates, to limit inflation, which in turn resulted from the largest quantitative easing programme in history after the Covid-19 pandemic.
On the demand side, the appetite of corporates for PPAs has grown drastically. PPAs are no longer seen as a support to their decarbonization strategies. PPAs stand today as the main tool to hedge long-term against skyrocketing wholesale power prices, thereby protecting them against the uncertainty of a significant input cost to their business.
This extraordinary market configuration, with a number of factors combining at the same time, has severely impacted the PPA market, mainly in Europe but also globally. As a result, 2022 will record less transactions, higher prices, and some slowness in closing deals. Looking ahead over the short-to-medium term, it is evident that the PPA Prices observed before this “crisis” are gone for good.
So, what’s next? Well winter is coming…again!
European energy prices may set new records in a worst-case scenario which can happen in the case of:
At the other end of the scale, a best-case scenario is probable too, and there must be a stop somewhere, sometime anyway. The EU has just warned that it will intervene to fight against high energy prices which started to trigger losses. Additionally, the higher energy prices go, the lower the demand for gas in the European industrial sector.
As time goes on, energy buyers are being exposed to a larger portion of spot prices (result of S-curve power purchase strategies). Some may face an incapacity to pay, leading eventually to insolvency and payment defaults, or a total shutdown of activity.
Recent market conditions have offered projects the opportunity to hedge short-term, eventually Baseload or even to finance on a full merchant basis. A market price correction is looming. The question is when and by how much? At least lower volatility would support a return to more realistic, and stable, market conditions. This is a must for the confidence of all PPA stakeholders.
In the meantime, and until the storm is over, the key for successfully closing PPAs is: (1) projects shall be (really) Ready-To-Build (“RTB” – ie. incl. clearance of permit access and licenses, modules procurement & EPC closed, financing engaged, etc.); (2) bankability of players; and (3) willingness from buyers and sellers to reach an agreement. With these ingredients in place there is always room for executing a PPA.

In a document published on the Dutch parliament's website, Jetten said that Internet of Things devices such as PV inverters can pose a risk to the electricity grid.
“To mitigate the risks of these devices, we focus on prevention, awareness, and additional legislation that makes products more resilient to digital attacks,” he said. “The Radiocommunications Agency will enter into discussions with the relevant manufacturers on how to improve cybersecurity.”
A Dutch hacker known as “Jelle Ursem” recently gained access to PV systems operated via a monitoring tool developed by Chinese manufacturer Solarman, according to Tweakers, a Dutch media outlet.
“The hacker was able to view the personal data of Dutch customers, create new customers and delete existing users,” reported Tweakers. “He was also able to find out how much electricity customers' solar panels generate via GPS coordinates, and download, adjust and upload inverter firmware.”
The Solarman spokesperson said the problem has been resolved, without any real impact on the affected PV systems.
“We've contacted the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), which is also involved in the matter, and explained a bit of facts, but unfortunately the talk was made in the last minutes before disclosure, so we don't have enough time to review the whole process together,” the spokesperson told pv magazine. “We appreciated DIVD's efforts to reduce security vulnerabilities and help address any possibile risks, and will communicate with them in order to improve cyber security of the energy sector.”

The New South Wales (NSW) government has announced a AUD 44.8 million ($29.9 million) funding package for five pumped hydro projects with a combined capacity of almost 1.75 GW and 60 hours of storage. It aims to accelerate the development of long-duration storage to help manage the anticipated closure of coal-fired power plants in the coming years.
The state government said funding agreements are already in place with developers of hydro projects in the New England, Hunter Valley, Central Tablelands, Southern Highlands and South Coast regions with funds to help cover private investment barriers and upfront costs. NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the funding will go toward pre-investment activities, including feasibility studies and developing business cases for the projects.
“NSW has the most ambitious renewable energy policy in the nation, which is needed to replace ageing coal-fired power stations and build a clean energy future for NSW,” he said.
With four of the state’s five remaining coal-fired generators scheduled for retirement between 2023 and 2035, and more variable renewable energy entering the market, New South Wales has a target to build at least 2 GW of new long-duration storage by 2030 to maintain system reliability and security.
Kean said pumped hydro is a key component of the state’s renewable energy plans, providing clean, reliable power and creating infrastructure jobs right across regional New South Wales.
“If these pumped hydro projects proceed to construction, they are expected to create more than 2,300 jobs and attract AUD 4.4 billion of private investment, which will help grow the economy and support the regions,” he said.
Kean said the funding, given as part of the NSW Pumped Hydro Recoverable Grants Program, will be repaid to the government if a project reaches a financial close, and could be reinvested into future projects. Among the projects to receive grant funding is the Oven Mountain pumped hydro energy storage project being developed near Armidale in the New England region. If built it has the potential to provide 600 MW of electricity with about 12 hours of storage duration.
AGL Energy COO Markus Brokhof said the funds will enable the project to advance development studies to a stage that means the project is ready for investment.
“As we transition to more renewable energy sources, pumped hydro provides a reliable on-demand generation source and acceleration of our development studies will help us understand how the project could be delivered,” he said.
NSW has a target to build at least 2 GW of new long-duration storage by the end of the decade, and has committed AUD 97.5 million to accelerate pumped hydro projects that could meet that target. This includes funding for private projects, as well as funds to undertake site investigations for pumped hydro potential on existing WaterNSW dams.

There are many paths to reach 100% emissions-free electricity. The US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has released “Examining Supply-Side Options to Achieve 100% Clean Electricity by 2035,” which looks at multiple scenarios.
NREL concludes that a 90% clean grid will have a low incremental cost, and that it can be built primarily with new wind, solar, storage, and transmission. However, the last 10% will present financial challenges, requiring research and new technologies.
The lab points to four “critical hurdles” to reach 100%:
Across all of their main scenarios, the lowest cost electricity mix is dominated by wind and solar, which provide most of the generation (60% to 80%). By the end of this decade, solar will require additions of 40 GWac to 90 GWac per year, and wind will require additions of 70 GW to 150 GW per year. By 2035, the United States will need to have added 2 TW of wind and solar combined.
Other accomplishments that must also happen by 2035 include the deployment of 5 GW to 8 GW of new hydropower, 3 GW to 5 GW of geothermal, and 120 GW to 350 GW of diurnal storage. Hitting these targets will require $330 billion to $740 billion in overall capital.
Another complex issue is that the models require between 1,400 and 10,100 miles of new high-capacity lines each year. NREL says this will triple the deployment volume rate being installed today.
Solar in the United States will need to massively increase deployment, with installation rates two to eight times that of the 15 GW of capacity that was added in 2020. These future annual installation volumes will be 25% to 110% of the entire capacity installed throughout the world in 2020.

Under the RO program, which closed in 2017, renewable energy generators receive a fixed tariff for every kilowatt-hour they produce and then sell the power on the open market, where the gas crisis has seen prices skyrocket. That has prompted calls from across the political spectrum to curb excessive energy company profits, with suggestions including a windfall tax on generators and a price ceiling for electricity.
The UK Energy Research Centre has suggested two measures to cap the price clean energy generators would receive for the power they produce. One proposal involves generators receiving a fixed final price for their power, rather than being able to trade on the open market, whilst retaining their fixed RO incentive payments per kilowatt-hour.
A second suggestion would see RO contracts exchanged for deals in line with the current contracts for difference (CFD) incentive scheme. Under CFD contracts, applicants competitively bid to secure the lowest guaranteed “strike price” for the electricity they generate. Generators receive the wholesale electricity price for the power they produce and, when that figure is below the strike price agreed through the auction tender, the government tops up the difference. When the money received from the wholesale market for the clean electricity is higher than the strike price – as it is now and is likely to be for some time – the generator hands the difference back to the government.
With both proposals already endorsed by RenewableUK and wider membership association Energy UK, Solar Energy UK said this week that its members would be open to such reform.
“We have begun considering the proposals to reform support for renewable power, which we will need to be sure will function as intended to both support the sector and combat the rising cost of living,” said Solar Energy UK Chief Executive Chris Hewett in a press release. “There is much to be worked through on the detail, but senior industry players are very supportive of the principle.”
Coming up with a voluntary approach to limit excessive profits could help the solar industry head off the threat of a windfall tax which would be far more detrimental to investor confidence, according to Solar Energy UK. The trade body was also at pains to point out the fact that solar energy tends to be sold far in advance has meant generators are yet to receive the profits bonanza which has been reported among fossil fuel companies of late.
Prime Minister Truss, whose appointment was confirmed this week after a vote by Conservative Party MPs, has refused to specify how she plans to help UK households and businesses with soaring energy bills, other than by reducing taxes. She pledged to set out her strategy on the UK cost of living crisis this week.
As environment secretary, new prime minister Truss was an outspoken critic of solar power because of the visual impact of panels, their potential intrusion into agricultural land, and because of the cost their incentive schemes add to household bills after energy suppliers pass on such commitments to consumers.
