The US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has looked at sponge-like materials known as “metal-organic frameworks.” The have found that they could be cost-competitive with other energy storage technologies for backup power with further development. Hydrogen can be stored in the porous crystal materials made of metal ions. The techno-economic analysis and process modeling analyzed system performance in “Cost and potential of metal–organic frameworks for hydrogen backup power supply,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. “Specifically for backup power applications, they have a simple charge/discharge mechanism, allowing the stored hydrogen to be released immediately upon discharge without the use of chemical reactions, which typically require high temperatures,” said Berkeley Lab postdoctoral researcher Peng Peng. 
The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) said perovskite materials could play a key role in a chemical process to produce renewable hydrogen. “NREL scientists analyzed an emerging water-splitting technology called solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH) production, which can be potentially more energy efficient than producing hydrogen via the commonly used electrolysis method … STCH relies on a two-step chemical process in which metal oxides are exposed to temperatures greater than 1,400 C and then re-oxidized with steam at lower temperatures to produce hydrogen,” said a team of researchers in “System and Technoeconomic Analysis of Solar Thermochemical Hydrogen Production,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.
HydrogenOne and Foresight hae signed a final agreement to invest in Germany’s HH2E. They will acquire a minority stake and the right to a board seat for at least GBP 10 million ($12.5 million). The investors “will provide a substantial part of the development and construction capital covering five large projects. These projects are expected to be at industrial locations across Germany and will cost in excess of €500 million ($526.8 million) to fully develop,” HydrogenOne said. “The first project HH2E is expecting to launch is likely to be at an industrial site in Germany, where there are plans for a new facility starting up in 2025, supplying on-site industrial customers.”
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has announced plans to potentially turn old coal infrastructure into a green hydrogen production facility in Washington state. “FFI’s intention would be to seek to employ the existing coal workforce for the proposed project, facilitating a transition into the emerging green energy economy,” the company said.
Bureau Veritas has approved the second generation of the REXH2 developed by EODev, a turnkey power generator for the supply of low-carbon electricity on ships. “The procedure to obtain Type Approval on the definitive version of the new REXH2 has already started and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022,” EODev said. EODev also noted that it has signed a collaboration agreement with MobyFly “for the design of the first hydrogen hydrofoil for passenger transport.”
Empresa Municipal de Transportes de Madrid has awarded a €10.86 million contract to build a hydrogen plant and a PV installation at the Entrevías Operations Center. “The new refueling station will provide several green hydrogen refueling stations for the fleet of 10 buses that EMT plans to acquire in a first phase. The project involves the implementation of the necessary facilities for the production, storage and distribution of hydrogen. It also includes the installation and commissioning of photovoltaic panels capable of generating all the energy necessary for the production of H2 from renewable sources,” said the company, which operates Madrid’s municipal transportation network. It will take around 19 months to execute the project.
Air Liquide, Portugal’s CaetanoBus, and Toyota Motor Europe have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop integrated hydrogen solutions in Europe. “This will include infrastructure development and vehicle fleets, to accelerate the expansion of hydrogen mobility for both light and heavy-duty vehicles,” the three companies said in a joint statement this week.

It will be built in two 10 GW phases, to be finalized in the second quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2024.
Three Gorges New Energy (CTGE) has wrapped up a recent tender for solar panels and inverters, and Dasolar, Longi, Huawei and Sungrow were the biggest winners. In the 410 MW module tender, Dasolar secured 239 MW at an average price of CNY 1.89 ($0.28) per watt. Longi won the remaining 181 MW at an average price of CNY 1.19 per watt. In the 333.2 MW inverter exercise, Huawei took the largest share of 230 MW for string inverters, while Sungrow won the largest portion of 100 MW for central inverters, and 3.2 MW of string devices.
JinkoSolar said polysilicon prices hit CNY 261/kg on May 11, up 2.23% from April 27. “This price increase has to filter through the supply chain. Module manufacturers will be forced to sell at higher prices to cover the higher bill-of-materials cost. This will eventually get passed on to the end customer,” it said. “As the logistic bottleneck deepens, other raw material prices including glass rose sharply. It is expected that a domino effect will be seen in module prices and will continue for a while. As a result, the average module prices will inevitably increase by 1.58% as compared to half a month ago.”
China Huaneng Group and the government of Anda, Heilongjiang province, have agreed to build a 1.3 GW renewable energy project with integrated storage. The project will require an investment of around CNY 7 billion.

The company is co-developing the project with Germany's Green Rock Energy. They plan to start construction on the facility in June 2023. Lightsource said the project will be one of the largest fishery solar farms in Taiwan and will be able to generate 210,000 MWh per year.
“Alongside providing locally generated renewable energy and creating new jobs, Lightsource bp’s fishery solar project has been designed to benefit the local environment and community,” the company said. “Throughout the process, Lightsource bp engaged environmental specialists as well as local fishermen to provide expertise and design a project with multiple benefits.”
It said that other benefits involve the addition of saltwater storage ponds to optimize the water management process for the fish farmers. However, it did not disclose any additional technical or financial details.
Lightsource said the project was made possible by the $1.8 billion credit and trade finance facility it secured last year. The credit facilities were provided by BNP Paribas and Société Générale, Santander, NatWest, Lloyds,Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and Wells Fargo.

Compared to Joule heating alone, which would be too energy-dependent for the viability of the proposed technology, pulsed joule heating drastically reduces energy consumption and the time needed for desnowing, defrosting, and deicing.
“We tested the system on a lab-scale prototype where we used a solar simulator to simulate the sunlight, and we attached the solar cell to a low-temperature chiller and a humidifier to simulate the outside icing/snowing condition,” researcher Siavash Khodakarami told pv magazine. “The cost of the technology was not evaluated in our work. But we have studied the benefit of using this method rather than just leaving the snow on solar cells by themselves to melt over time.”
The scientists applied superhydrophobic (SHP) coating on the module glass, through a method that they describe as simple and ultra-scalable. They initially deposited a nanoscale-thick aluminum (Al) layer on the cover glass, followed by immersion in hot deionized water to create aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlO(OH)) nanostructures.
“The density and porosity of the nanostructures can be modified by varying the immersion time and temperature during fabrication,” they explained. “We chose the conditions used in order to achieve higher superhydrophobicity and minimized droplet–surface adhesion.”

The film becomes optically transparent after hydrothermal treatment. And as the surface roughness remains lower than 30 nm, it does not cause visible light scattering.
“The combination of optical transparency and superhydrophobicity in the same coating allows for multi-functionality to enable pulsed Joule heating for desnowing and defrosting on PV panels,” the researchers said. “For desnowing of PV panels, the cover glass needs to be capable of efficient pulsed surface heating, superhydrophobicity, and optical transparency.”
Indium tin oxide (ITO) was used as a layer for Joule heating, due to its remarkable optical transmittance of more than 85%, as well as certain electrical characteristics. The thin-film heater with a superhydrophobic surface acts at the interface of the substrate and snow/frost/ice and is said to achieve interfacial defrosting by confining the heat to a very thin region.
Through a series of tests, the academics found that pulsed Joule heating is divided into three different regimes of interfacial desnowing/defrosting, partial melting, and refreezing, depending on the energy input, pulse width, and inclination angle of the surface. The claim their new technique can remove snow and ice at a rate that is three times faster than convetional approaches.
“Our method only requires a single pulse of electrical current for heating the surface to completely remove accreted snow, frost, or ice,” they said.
The scientists introduced the technique in “Enabling Renewable Energy Technologies in Harsh Climates with Ultra-Efficient Electro-Thermal Desnowing, Defrosting, and Deicing,” which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.
“We are continuing the work to make it a possible commercial product for solar cells and other applications as well,” Khodakarami said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/17/novel-technique-to-turn-semi-finished-thin-film-solar-modules-into-colored-bipv-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 17, 2022",Novel way to turn semi-finished thin-film solar modules into colored BIPV panels,"A group of scientists in Germany has come up with a new way to refine conventional thin-film panels into building-integrated (BIPV) products. They claim that their approach can reduce production costs, while ensuring supply chain flexibility.
“This approach can not only reduce costs, but also opens up the possibility of separating the production process into the manufacture of semi-finished PV products and their refinement into colored BIPV modules,” they said. “For example, semi-finished PV panels could be produced in Asia and the refinement can be done locally in Europe.”
The proposed technique consists of cutting the semi-fabricates into desired shapes and then applying a conductive oxide-metal-oxide (OMO) electrode with the requested color. The elements are then structured into modules via the backend interconnection process.
“All materials and methods, including sputtered aluminum oxide and silver layers, are widely available in the industry and are part of other products which are mass-produced, like climate glass for windows,” researcher Nils Neugebohrn told pv magazine.
The group developed a prototype to cut or separate thin-film PV semi-fabricates into custom shapes and sizes. They used OMO electrodes measuring 30 cm × 30 cm, based on aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), and applied them onto semi-finished 30 cm × 30 cm copper, indium, gallium and selenide (CIGS) circuits. The pre-lamination modules have an efficiency of up to 19%.
“The modules were structured with P1 and P2 lines and had a reduced AZO front contact thickness of only 200 nm,” the group explained. “The front contact was not removed completely in order to keep the optimized and stable absorber/buffer/front contact interfaces and to avoid degradation of the samples during transport.”

 
The proposed manufacturing process, after the deposition of the OMO electrode, also requires P3 structuring, edge deletion, and a lamination technique developed by German CIGS specialist Avancis. For the backend interconnection process, the scientists used amorphous silicon thin-film solar cells and transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated glass, supplied by Japanese manufacturer Asahi Glass.
“An amorphous p-i-n silicon layer stack (a-Si:H) with a total thickness of about 300 nm was deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) on top of the front contact TCO,” the group said.
The researchers said they were able to produce colored modules in red, green and blue with 1% absolute less efficiency than a reference module.
“Further optimization of these processes to increase the efficiency of the prepared modules may be necessary for commercial adaption, however, technical feasibility has been demonstrated,” they said. “The largest loss is found for the open-circuit voltage. Here the cell stripes show on average a loss of 21 mV compared with the reference cells. The origin of this loss is not clear yet.”
They explained their project in “Flexible design of building integrated thin-film photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

“Our microinverter is equipped with reactive power control that makes it interactive with power grids,” Olivier Jacques, president global for APsystems, told pv magazine. “This helps better manage photovoltaic power hikes in the grid while offering a robust and compelling solution for small and medium commercial solar across the world.”
The QT2 microinverter has an efficiency rating of 97% and a nominal maximum power point tracker (MPPT) efficiency of 99.5%. The nominal output voltage is between 400 V and 438 V, and the adjustable output voltage ranges from 277 V to 478 V.

The manufacturer said this is applicable to any type of three-phase network in the world, including 208 V and 380 V grids in the United States and 400 V in Europe. The recommended PV module voltage range is between 400 W and 670 W, and the maximum input voltage is 60 V.
The microinverter measures 359 mm x 242 mm x 46 mm and weighs 6 kg. It features an IP67 enclosure rating and a cooling system based on natural convection. It also offers Encrypted Zigbee wireless features for faster communication speed and better system security.
“The new platform architecture, built from the ground up by the power electronics design experts comprising APsystems’ engineering and R&D teams, employs the latest breakthroughs in power inversion circuitry, semiconductor device technology, high-speed communication and intelligent control,” saids Jacques.
The product comes with a 10-year product warranty, but that can be expanded to 20 years on request in Europe and 25 years in the United States. The company said the components are encapsulated with silicon.
“This reduces stress on the electronics, facilitates thermal dissipation, and improves waterproof properties,” Jacques explained. “The QT2 has been engineered for safety and ties directly to the low-voltage PV module and connects to the public power grid via standard AC voltages, enhancing human and building protection, making sure safety is no more a concern in solar projects. It is well known that building-integrated solar projects involving human protection issues, high voltage DC running on the roof can create problems causing arc-fault risks which may lead to fire hazards.”
The company will start selling the inverter in Europe and the United States this summer. It will release it throughout the rest of the world by the end of this year.

Tata Power Solar has secured a 300 MW solar project in India from state-owned hydropower producer NHPC, following a recent 1 GW win from SJVN.
The 300 MW project, worth INR 1,731 crore ($223 million), will be developed in Rajasthan under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) scheme. Under the CPSU scheme, state-run power producers are provided financial support to set up solar plants for self-use or for use by other government entities, either directly or through electricity distribution companies.
The CPSU scheme mandates the use of domestic solar cells and modules. It provides viability gap funding to cover the cost difference between domestic and imported solar cells and modules.
The project is scheduled for commissioning within 18 months from the award of the contract. Once operational, it is expected to generate approximately 750 million units of electricity per year. With this win, Tata Power’s pending order book has reached INR 13,500 crore, and its total utility-scale solar project portfolio has hit 9.7 GWp.

Rising US dollar exchange rates are also driving up costs, as shipping costs soar due to the lingering impact of the pandemic, say stakeholders. Imran Chowdhury, country manager for Sungrow Renewables Development, said the last two years of Covid-linked disruptions and rise of the dollar against the Bangladeshi taka are having “serious impacts” on renewables.
Higher panel and inverter prices are driving up total EPC costs. Chowdhury said that prices of Tier-1 solar modules have increased by 15% to 18%, while prices of reputable inverter brands have risen by up to 8%. Due to rising prices, project developers are not reaching their targeted internal rates of return. This is one of the key factors for banks to see a project as bankable.
Masudur Rahim, chief executive officer of Omera Renewable Energy, said developers are a bit hesitant to move forward on projects now, as shipping costs have doubled and panel prices have increased by 10% to 15%.
“After signing a PPA, one has to commission a project within a year,” he said. “Many projects now may need to tenure extension due to procurement delay.”
Ezaz Al Qudrat A Mazid, managing director of Solar EPC Development Ltd., said that prices of modules increased several months ago. He said prices of electric cables and aluminum have also risen.
Bangladesh now has the capacity to generate 787 MW of renewable energy, with 553 MW coming from solar. The country aims to generate 40% of its total electricity from renewable sources by 2041.

Weighing in at a remarkable 1.6 kg, the product is a sleek, black solar module that can be clipped onto balcony railings, or anywhere there is sun and a power socket. Taking the idea of plug and play a step further, the kit is designed for anyone to install it themselves, without the need for an electrician or engineer.
Overall, it comprises eight 90 cm x 54 cm x 2 mm 640 Wp solar panels, manufactured in China. Each feature 99 monocrystalline shingled solar cells with an efficiency of 21.33%, and ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) backsheets. A 600 W MPPT PV inverter is also included. The kits have been certified and include 25-year performance guarantees.
According to the company, people can cut their annual electricity bills by up to 25%, in addition to reducing their carbon footprint. There is also has an app that allows you to track live data and check how much green electricity you have generated and how much CO₂ you have saved.
Innovative models
Currently, there are three business models on offer:
Given the recent shift to home office for many of the world’s workforce, rising energy prices, and the topic of corporate sustainability climbing up the agenda, the third model is particularly attractive.
Essentially creating a virtual power plant with its employees, employers can rent the kits on monthly basis and distribute them to employees with balconies. While the company receives CO2 certificates for generating clean electricity, the employees save on their electricity bills.
Karolina Attspodina and Qian Qin met in the German capital at 1.5 Degrees Ventures, a company builder pushing startups that are looking to quickly reduce carbon via their products and/or services. As Qin told pv magazine, the idea was to improve upon an existing product on the market – developing a completely new product would take too long – for a fast and wide uptake.
The balcony solar modules presented the perfect opportunity, said Qin, because they can enable many people to generate their own clean electricity. Moreover, because they are easily installed and deinstalled, people can take them along when they move.
The improvements on existing balcony modules included reducing their weight; allowing people to install and deinstall the systems themselves by redesigning the internal connections so just one cable comes out of the modules; allowing for easy mounting with the clip function; and building insurance into the package to cover instances like fire.
With a nod to sustainability, Qin said that due to their light weight, the modules can be shipped as packages, which reduces the carbon footprint compared to the shipping of normal weight modules. It also allows for faster delivery times. The company also avoids plastic packaging, preferring to wrap the modules in paper.
“There is no reason to say no,” said Qin.
We Do Solar was founded in September 2021. While Qin could not divulge how much has already been invested in the company, he did say that there are several business angels on board. The next step is to find more investors for further growth.
Initially, the company will serve the German market because Germany has the highest electricity prices. It intends to turn its attention to expand further in Europe in the near future, however.

Origin Energy has secured planning approval from the Australian state of New South Wales for a 700 MW mega battery that will help replace the 2.88 GW Eraring coal generator the utility plans to close in 2025.
With an overall capacity of up to 700 MW and a dispatch duration of four hours, the proposed Eraring big battery is Australia’s largest battery project to achieve planning approval to date. Origin’s head of energy supply and operations, Greg Jarvis, said the battery energy storage system would help to replace the coal-fired power station, which supplies about one-quarter of the state's energy needs.
“Our proposed battery forms part of our plans to replace Eraring’s capacity and maintain reliable energy supply to customers as we plan for the potential accelerated closure of the coal-fired power station in August 2025,” he said. “Eraring Power Station is well suited to battery storage and potentially other energy infrastructure over time, as there is extensive electricity connection infrastructure already in place nearby.”
Jarvis said Origin will now focus on finalizing vendor and constructor negotiations and transmissions connection agreements, so the project can progress toward a final investment decision. The battery is one of at least two energy storage systems, including the state government’s proposed 700 MW/1,400 MWh Waratah Super Battery, that are set to replace the capacity of the Eraring power plant.
Origin said in February that it would bring forward the closure of the power station. It submitted notice to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) that it would shut the facility in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled. The company said the move is reflective of the “rapidly changing conditions in the National Electricity Market, which are increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations and challenging their viability. The reality is the economics of coal-fired power stations are being put under increasing, unsustainable pressure by cleaner and lower cost generation, including solar, wind and batteries.”
Meanwhile, the New South Wales government says it has received more than 30 proposals from local and international bidders to build its planned Waratah Super Battery. State Energy Minister Matt Kean said the state government has secured strong interest from potential suppliers for the big battery system and will now prepare a formal tender process.
The proposed battery will have an overall capacity of 700 MW and a dispatch duration of two hours. Kean said it will help to release grid capacity and secure the state’s energy future. Among the possible locations being suggested for the new battery is the former Munmorah Power Station site adjacent to the 667 MW gas-fired Colongra Power Station near Doyalson on the Central Coast. The former 1.4 GW coal-fired power plant was closed in 2012.

If it feels as if the solar industry has crossed a major milestone, that’s because it has. Cumulative industry deployments reached 1 TW of installed capacity at some point in the first quarter. And now, only a couple of months later, it is time to move on from these accomplishments and ask the industry, “what will you do for us by 2030?”
The industry is asking for 1 TW of solar power, installed each and every year, starting in 2030. At InterSolar Munich last week, Longi Solar, the global leader in solar panel manufacturing, projected that global solar deployment will reach 1 TW per year by 2030.
To elucidate this point, pv magazine USA assembled this chart based upon BloombergNEF solar deployment data from 1980 through 2021. The vertical axis shows the amount of growth in each year versus the three years prior. Based on the deployment volume of 7 MW in 1980, divided by 20 MW of volume in 1983, we saw 286% growth – almost tripling deployed capacity in three years. This is an average that saw “slower”
127% to 286% growth in the 1983-2003 period, which turned into explosive 224% to 661% growth from 2004 to 2013, before settling into 156% to 224% growth from 2014 through to the present.
The trend line shows that we’ve slowly been increasing deployment growth rates since 1980. And if we were to have actually doubled our deployment volume every three years since that 7 MW built in the 1980s, we would have built somewhere between 100 GWdc and 114 GWdc of capacity in 2021, instead of the ~183 GW which was actually deployed.
Looking at these numbers, it is easy to see how Longi and others have arrived at their projections. Several industry analyst groups have reported that global solar deployment in 2021 totals 150 MW of capacity, versus BloombergNEF’s 183 GW. Starting with the lowest estimate, and assuming that installed capacity continues to double every three years, the capacity deployed in the near future will be immense:

The trend of relocating PV industry assets in France continues. At the recent Smarter E exhibition in Munich, Moez Ben Amar, general manager of French glass manufacturer Alliaverre, told pv magazine France that by the end of this year or early 2023, the company plans to build a solar glass plant in Amiens, France, where its head office is located. This could see the light of day at the end of 2022, or even at the beginning of 2023.
At the moment, Alliaverre manufactures glass under OEM contracts with industrial interests in South Asia.
“Manufacturing and delivery times are currently 10 to 12 weeks, which mobilizes significant cash for our customers,” said Amar. “In addition, since the start of the Covid crisis, container transport prices have increased tenfold.”
To overcome these constraints, the fully automated site would therefore produce 50 MW per month or 600 MW per year of solar-grade glass. It would cover three market segments: 2 mm glass for glass/glass modules, glass in 3.2 mm for classic modules, and solar tiles.
The shaping of flat glass will be handled by cutting, coating and tempering the glass.
“We will have a large stock of large flat glass plates in France, which will allow us to reduce the processing and delivery time of solar glass to less than two weeks,” said Amar.
The company is now wrapping up a €5 million ($5.2 million) investment, in cooperation with a French investment fund.
