High availability of Belgium's nuclear power stations last year saw the energy source account for 52.4% of the nation's electricity, according to Elia, up from 32.8% in a Covid-hit 2020. The tendency of Belgian nuclear reactors to eat into gas-fired power generation was exacerbated last year by rising gas prices, according to Elia, which on Friday reported gas had made up 24.8% of the power mix in 2021, down from 34.7% in 2020.
Those figures were published a day after GlobalData noted Belgium's seven nuclear plants – chiefly owned by the Electrabel subisidiary of French energy company Engie and by the Luminus business of French state controlled utility EDF – were on track to halt generation before 2026. According to the London data company, the Doel 3 reactor is due to go offline this year, with Tihange 2 to follow next year and Doel 4 and Tihange 3 by 2025.
GlobalData said on Friday: “Alongside renewables, Belgium will rely on gas-fired capacity to meet power demand.”
In terms of solar, Elia reported 17% more electricity was generated by the power source last year than in 2020, to hit 4.64TWh for a rise of 9%, although an accompanying table put the raised figure at 4.67TWh and almost 10%.
With solar plants generating 4.7TWh of electricity– some of it exported – to contribute 5.1% of 50Hertz-owner Elia's power mix for its Belgian and German customers last year, that marked a rise from 4.3TWh in 2020, although it meant solar retreated slightly from the 5.2% of Elia's power mix it accounted for in the previous year.
GlobalData predicted Belgium will overshoot its 2030 target of installing 6.9GW of solar by achieving 11.8GW by the end of the decade.

The project, called H2@Home, is the first of its kind in continental Europe as it combines an underground-pipeline hydrogen network similar to a natural gas network and hydrogen pipes that run through the building and are connected to an H2 heating boiler in the attic.
According to the research group, hydrogen has a lower energy density than natural gas and, when existing infrastructure is used, the hydrogen flow rate must be increased considerably in order to meet the same energy demand. “These high speeds and volumes are expected to result in noise pollution and undesirable resonances in the indoor installation,” they also warned. “Moreover, hydrogen is very flammable and colorless and odorless, which are all properties that require additional safety and management measures for the use of hydrogen.”

The building's existing gas pressure regulators and the smart gas supply shut-off, which were not immediately suitable for the application of hydrogen, needed to be adjusted, as well as the gas meter and piping. Furthermore, the researchers added a communication module for the network operators to ensure the system's safety, through monitoring.
Through the proposed configuration, the building's residents should not perceive any difference in use, warmth, and comfort compared to a system based on a conventional central heating boiler.
The system and of all its components have been online since November and will be tested until July 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/10/india-may-add-12-5gw-of-solar-in-2022-23/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 10, 2022",India may add 12.5GW of solar in 2022-23,"From pv magazine India
Ratings agency ICRA expects India to add 16.1GW of renewable energy generation capacity in the next fiscal year. The analysts told pv magazine clean energy capacity additions in 2022-23 will be driven by solar, with 12.5GW coming from PV projects. Wind projects are expected to contribute 2.2GW and hybrid plants 1.4GW.
ICRA analysts attribute the strong outlook for renewables to a pipeline of more than 55GW of announced projects, close to 40GW of which are solar plants with the balance made up from wind and solar-wind hybrid facilities. The competitive energy price tariffs offered by renewables are another reason for the expected boom in new capacity.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The commitment to climate change goals announced by Narendra Modi at the recent COP26 summit has further strengthened the investment prospects for renewables, according to Gurgaon-based ICRA.
Prime Minister Modi announced India’s pledge to increase non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500GW by 2030 at the climate change summit in Glasgow. The government also wants to increase renewable energy’s share in the power generation mix to half the total this decade.
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head for corporate ratings at ICRA, said: “The backlog of the projects awarded by the central nodal agencies and state distribution utilities remains large with, under-development solar, wind, and hybrid capacities of more than 55GW. [Based on] this pipeline, ICRA expects the RE [renewable energy] capacity addition to increase from [the] 7.4GW reported in FY2021 [fiscal year 2020-21] to 12.5GW in FY2022, and further to 16GW in FY2023.”
The progress shown by state body the Solar Energy Corporation of India in signing power sale and power purchase agreements in the last six months also supports new renewables capacity additions, according to Kadam. He added, the ability of developers to secure solar modules within budget and a cost of debt funding of less than 8.5% remained important to make new clean power projects viable.
Headwinds in the execution of projects and supply chain challenges in procuring modules and wind turbine generators pose near-term risks for renewables developers. Moreover, the average price of imported, mono PERC solar modules has increased by more than 35% over the past 12 months, putting upward pressure on PV project capital costs. Notwithstanding the recent hike in goods and services tax for solar power equipment in India, however, the solar electricity tariffs set by developers continue to remain highly competitive, as seen in a December bid of INR2.17/kWh ($0.029) highlighted by the ratings agency.
ICRA has estimated India would require up to $500 billion of investment to meet the renewables capacity targets announced by the prime minister at COP26 in November and Vikram V, vice president and sector head for corporate ratings at ICRA said: “The investment requirement for achieving the non-fossil [-fuel] capacity target of 500GW by FY2030 remains large, at close to $300 billion. This apart, investments would be required in augmenting the transmission infrastructure to integrate the renewable power with the electricity grid as well as investments to create storage infrastructure. ICRA expects the investments towards transmission infrastructure and storage capabilities to be about $150-200 billion over the next 8.5 years, taking the overall investment requirement to $450-500 billion. The availability of adequate funding avenues at cost-competitive rates remains critical to achieving these capacity targets.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/10/reducing-interface-resistance-in-solid-state-lithium-batteries-via-annealing/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 10, 2022",Reducing interface resistance in solid-state lithium batteries via annealing,"Though promising in terms of energy density and charge-discharge cyclability, the performance of all-solid-state lithium batteries is undermined by significant resistance at the interface between the solid electrolyte and positive electrode. While the origin of the electrical resistance has not been fully determined, it is well known it increases more than tenfold when the electrode surface is exposed to air.
Several attempts have been made to lower such resistance but none have managed to bring it down to the 10Ωcm2 (ohm centimeter-squared) interface resistance value of devices which are not exposed to air. Now, researchers from Japanese bodies the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, and Yamagata University have reported promising results and demonstrated a drastic reduction of electrical resistance is achievable by annealing entire battery cells.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

The team prepared thin film batteries comprising a lithium negative electrode, an LiCoO2 positive electrode, and an Li3PO4 solid electrolyte. Before completing fabrication of a battery, they exposed the LiCoO2 surface to air, nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), and water vapor (H2O) for 30 minutes.
The researchers found exposure to N2, O2, CO2, and H2, did not degrade battery performance compared to a non-exposed battery. “Only H2O vapor strongly degrades the Li3PO4-LiCoO2 interface and increases its resistance drastically to a value more than 10 times higher than that of the unexposed interface,” said Taro Hitosugi, from Tokyo Tech.
The team then performed annealing, with a sample undergoing a heat treatment at 150 degrees Celsius for an hour in battery form: with the negative electrode deposited. As a result, resistance was reduced to the initial 10.3Ωcm2. Simulations and measurements revealed the reduction could be attributed to the spontaneous removal of protons from within the LiCoO2 structure during annealing.
“Our study shows that protons in the LiCoO2 structure play an important role in the recovery process. We hope that the elucidation of these interfacial microscopic processes would help widen the application potential of all-solid-state batteries,” said Hitosugi.
The results are described in the paper “Drastic Reduction of the Solid Electrolyte–Electrode Interface Resistance via Annealing in Battery Form,” published in ACS Publications.

The Brazilian government published the long-anticipated Law 14.300 in the country's official journal on Friday.
The provisions have introduced a new regulatory framework for the distributed generation segment, which includes all renewable energy power generators not exceeding 5 MW in size operating under a net metering regime. The segment currently accounts for more than 8.4 GW of the 13 GW of installed grid-connected solar capacity in Brazil.
The new rules will introduce a new net metering regime from 2023, which means that PV systems installed this year will not be subject to the grid fees that will be applied in January 2023. However, these grid fees will still guarantee a reasonable level of profitability for Brazilian prosumers and will be gradually increased over the years.
According to Rodrigo Sauaia – the president of the Brazilian solar association, ABSolar – the new rules will ensure legal certainty by maintaining the net metering scheme until 2045.
The National Council for Energy Policy (CNPE) and the energy regulator, ANEEL, will now have 18 months – counted from the publication of the law – to establish the guidelines, costs and benefits of distributed generation to be implemented after the transition period.
According to the CNPE, the Brazilian rules to be stipulated after the transition period, based on CNPE guidelines and Aneel's calculations, will have a positive impact on the continued growth of distributed generation systems in Brazil. Furthermore, the lower remuneration levels for net metering tariffs could increase the payback time of a residential PV system by only up to six months, according to the agency.
“For more than 10 years, Brazilian rules allowed full offsetting of energy credits from distributed renewable generation. When we compare the new Brazilian rules with good international practices, Brazil is well-positioned to further support its distributed-generation segment,” said the vice president of distributed generation at ABSolar, Barbara Rubim.

Speaking to Washington DC-based thinktank the Atlantic Council on Wednesday, DTEK chief executive Maxim Timchenko said Ukraine could hold the key to Europe's energy security at a time when the continent's reliance on Russian gas supplies has been highlighted by ongoing wrangles over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany and by rising energy prices.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
Timchenko mentioned the role renewables could play in Ukraine but also emphasized the importance of liberalizing the nation's gas market so supplies could flow more freely to Ukrainian and European energy consumers.
Easing European dependence on Russian gas would require regulatory change in Ukraine, said the DTEK chief, including “ensuring the development of green energy and stable domestic gas production, which is key both for the energy transition and for Ukraine’s energy security. And that has to involve the deregulation of Ukraine's gas industry.”
With Russian and U.S. negotiators having last night met in Geneva ahead of talks this week to try and de-escalate a situation which has seen Russia mass troops on the Ukrainian border, the role energy – and the energy transition – will play in international relations was again highlighted by Timchenko's remarks, which were reported on Thursday by the press unit of the Ukrainian energy company.
Timchenko's call for a more prominent role for Ukrainian gas came as two EU advisory bodies prepare to submit their thoughts on the European Commission's recommendation gas and nuclear power be included in the bloc's definition of sustainable energy investments. As reported by SOAS London's Felicia Jackson for pv magazine, the commission's Platform on Sustainable Finance and the EU Member States Expert Group on Sustainable Finance will have until Wednesday to submit their thoughts on the proposal.

ILs are non-molecular compounds that are composed solely of ions. They are claimed to have several advantages over traditional organic solvents, such as negligible vapor pressure at room temperature and high thermal stability.
The cell was built with a perovskite material known with the formula CH(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3), which was treated with an IL known as 1-ethyl-3methylimidazolium bromide ([EMIM]Br). “The IL can stabilize the perovskite by forming strong chemical bonds with the soft perovskite
thin films that can largely impede the loss of perovskite components and suppress trap-state density in the grain boundaries and at the interfaces,” the scientists explained.
The device was built on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, the perovskite film, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
According to the scientists, the [EMIM]Br molecules on the perovskite surface are able to suppress the non-radiative recombination that mainly occurs at the perovskite defects that are passivated, thus improving charge carrier transport with reduced non-radiative recombination loss, which in turn leads to an increase of both open-circuit voltage and fill factor.
The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.33%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.192V, and a fill factor of 80.67%. For comparison, a reference device with no [EMIM]Br-treatment reached an efficiency of 22.67%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.147V, and a fill factor of 78.49%.
With this cell technology, the academics also fabricated a mini perovskite solar module with an active area of 10.75cm. The panel achieved an efficiency of 20.33%, an open-circuit voltage of 5.97V, a short-circuit current of 47.76mA, and a fill factor of 76.67%. “Moreover, the bare device maintains over 90% of its initial efficiency after 700 hours of aging at 65 degrees Celsius,” they emphasized. “It also shows outstanding stability with only about 10% degradation after being exposed to the ambient environment for 1,000 hours.”
A full description of the solar cell can be found in the paper “Ionic-Liquid-Perovskite Capping Layer for Stable 24.33%-Efficient Solar Cell,” published in Advanced Energy Materials. The research team comprises scientists from China's Shaanxi Normal University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/10/sungrow-talks-solar-supply-chains-and-remaining-competitive-in-a-challenging-business-environment/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"JANUARY 10, 2022",Sungrow talks solar supply chains and remaining competitive in a challenging business environment,"
Jack Gu, Senior Vice President of Sungrow: The 2021 solar market did not meet our expectations, with anticipated total annual installations of around 150 GW. I think the main causes were the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain issues, particularly the rise in polysilicon costs and integrated circuit chip shortages. The fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) market affected chip supply in many fields, including inverters. Overall, 2021 saw average growth with supply issues affecting installation numbers.
The supply chain challenges had two major negative effects on PV inverter manufacturing. One was the cost rise which was a big challenge for the industry. Luckily, Sungrow is a market leader for inverters, and we lead in technical innovations, which made our products competitive in the market. The other one is equipment shortages, especially for integrated circuit chips and IGBT modules, which directly impacted production. Again, Sungrow had the advantage of being well supplied by our vendors due to our order sizes and long-term partnerships. The company achieved significant growth in the 2021 inverter market.
I think the supply shortage will continue, very probably for the whole of 2022 and even in the year after. Considering that demand in the EV industry grew so fast and the capacity expansion of integrated circuit companies is much slower, we should not be optimistic about the situation.
I think there is a misunderstanding that the storage inverter market is the only business of Sungrow. It is not; however, storage systems are big business for us. Our storage inverter, the PCS (Power Conversion System), is merely one component of a bigger system. Different from solar PV systems, where the inverter is decoupled from PV panels, the PCS component in our storage systems is coupled with other components like a Battery Management System (BMS) and an Energy Management System (EMS). Including the control center of the PCS, there are three brains in the storage system which must be well coordinated to maximize its total efficiency and protect its safety.
Thus, Sungrow provides the entire storage system for its customers rather than just the PCS inverter. We are very cautious in providing our PCS products alone unless we clearly understand the specifications of the battery to be matched. Overall, we have experienced high growth in sales of our storage systems since 2020 and have become the market leader globally, especially in the North America, EU, Middle East, and China markets.
Sungrow occupies around 30% of every major overseas PV inverter market. Overall, around 70% of our sales revenue for PV inverters and storage systems comes from overseas markets while China comprises the remaining 30%. In terms of our businesses like wind power, EV, and hydrogen, China is the only market focus.
China will be one of the most important markets for us. Overseas, Europe, the Americas, and Australia will be key markets, although India and the Middle East, are also important.
By the end of 2021, Sungrow will have over 90GW of production capacity, and we have new capacities under construction.
Sungrow now has five business areas: wind power, solar PV, storage systems, EVs, and hydrogen. We have products and solutions, and of course R&D investment, in all these areas. In general, our inverter products are one of our fundamental focuses and we have invested a lot to increase not only their efficiency but also the efficiency of the system they work for. Furthermore, we have tried to improve the efficiency of the future operation and maintenance (O&M) of the systems. Meanwhile, with help of new technologies like AI and big data, our R&D team is working on better collaboration between inverters and storage systems.
Our primary goal is to satisfy our customers with the best quality products, and fast and good service. To achieve these goals, we have set up a qualified international team with local offices across the world. Communication with overseas colleagues in different backgrounds and different cultures is often different from that between our Chinese colleagues. We have adopted processes to improve the internal communication and coordination mechanism provided by world-class consulting firms, which has greatly improved our internal communication process and efficiency.
Like many people, I think 2022 will be a good year for solar PV. We expect that cumulative installations will be around 200GW globally. There is still uncertainty surrounding the supply of chips and IGBT modules which might be negative for installations. Especially in Q1 2022, the supply situation will remain tense. However, opportunities also lie ahead. For example, the electric power price in China might be adjusted to be more commercial and better reflect cost rises, in addition to encouraging energy conservation and emission reductions. If residential electricity prices, which have been lower than China’s average electricity price for a long time, are raised, the residential solar PV market will flourish.

The annual additions for 2021 are slightly higher than the 4.1 GW deployed a year earlier. In 2019 and 2018, new additions reached 3.8 GW and 2.4 GW, respectively.
“Despite the upward trend in South Korea’s solar capacity, the country's clean energy transition is still hampered by land and maritime policies, which overregulate where solar and wind power can be built,” Eunbyeol Jo, a researcher at Seoul-based NGO Solutions for Our Climate, told pv magazine. “In addition, up to 64% of the solar PV capacity that requested to enter the grid sat idle during the first half of 2021 due to the lack of distribution networks in the country.”
He said state-owned utility Kepco, the sole distribution company in South Korea, must focus on expanding grid infrastructure to ramp up the deployment of renewables. By the end of December, the country's cumulative installed PV capacity stood at roughly 22 GW.
South Korea is currently supporting rooftop and large-scale PV systems through tenders. In the latest two procurement exercises held in 2021, the authorities allocated a total of 4.2 GW of PV capacity. In two tenders held in 2020, the KEA allocated 1.2 GW and 1.41 GW. In 2019, it contracted 350 MW and 500 MW. In 2017 and 2018, the total allocated capacity was 600 MW for each year.
South Korea currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.

The South Korean smelting giant is the latest major company to back Energy Vault ahead of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this quarter.
The new investment upsizes previously announced private investment in public equity funding from $100 million to $150 million, in conjunction with Energy Vault’s agreement to become a publicly traded company through a merger with Novus Capital Corporation II. Its previous funding round included investments from Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, BHP Ventures, Volta Energy Technologies, and Softbank Vision Fund, among others.
The new strategic partnership supports Korea Zinc’s strategy to decarbonize its refining and smelting operations under Sun Metals, its wholly owned subsidiary in Australia. The companies expect to begin project deployment of Energy Vault’s proprietary energy storage and energy management software technology in mid-2022. The size and cost of the project have not been disclosed.
The investment comes hot on the heels of Korea Zinc’s acquisition of Epuron, a major utility-scale wind and solar energy developers in Australia, with a pipeline of over 9GW. In late December, Ark Energy, an arm of Korea Zinc which runs the company’s decarbonization efforts in Australia, said Epuron's pipeline of projects will be used to help decarbonize its zinc metal processes and to power green hydrogen production.
Energy Vault’s technology is another piece of the puzzle in Korea Zinc’s ambitious plan to make its Sun Metals refinery in Queensland the world’s first refinery to produce green zinc. In November, Sun Metals – the second largest single-site energy consumer in Queensland – vowed to power its entire operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2040, with an interim target of 80% by 2030.
Previously, Sun Metals developed its own 125 MW solar farm, which became operational in 2018, to lower the cost of running its refinery, which was then on the verge of expansion. Today, the solar project provides some 22% of the refinery‘s energy needs. Sun Metals has also announced that it is considering buying wind assets in Queensland that could increase that renewable component to almost 90% of its energy needs.
“Energy Vault’s innovative storage technology and energy management software platform can play a key role in enabling and accelerating our decarbonization strategy as we enhance our ability to power our operations with renewable energy,” said Yun B. Choi, vice chairman of Korea Zinc.
Energy Vault’s EVx storage system is comparable to pumped hydro, using grid-scale renewable energy when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-ton blocks on a six-arm crane tower, rather than water, up to a height. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the blocks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
According to the company, there is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time. Its composite blocks are developed in cooperation with Mexico’s Cemex, using local soil at sites where it builds its storage systems, as well as other materials such as recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and decommissioned wind turbine blades.
Energy Vault’s EVx tower features 80% to 85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.
The company says its technology can economically serve both higher power/shorter duration applications with ancillary services from two to four hours and can also scale to serve longer-duration requirements from five to 24 hours or more.

The state of New York has released a set of policy recommendations that will drive the next 4GW(dc) of distributed solar power. The state aims to reach 10 GW of installed capacity by 2030.
The recommendations can be found in a long-form report, “New York’s 10 GW Distributed Solar Roadmap: Policy Options for Continued Growth in Distributed Solar,” which describes the logic in the section-specific recommendations for an expanded NY-Sun MW Block program, as per the Governor’s Office.
The program will cost approximately $1.47 billion, which will be collected from electricity ratepayers at a cost of $0.00082 per kilowatt-hour. It is expected that an additional $4.1 billion of private capital will be invested to build out the 4 GW capacity.
The NY-Sun program is administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).
Within the New York City Con Edison market, a target of 150 MW is sought from each of three sectors: residential, small commercial (specified as less than 1 MW of modules), and large (greater than 1 MW) commercial projects. The rest of the capacity – 2.94 GW – will be deployed upstate from the highly populated metropolitan area.
Long Island is expected to contribute an additional 560 MW to the 4 GW target, despite running out of incentives in 2016. The policy recommendation for the region is to press on without incentives, as installations on Long Island appear robust without them.
According to NYSERDA, the state currently has 6 GW of solar capacity either installed or officially in the pipeline, as a result of the first round of this energy procurement program.
In total, the program’s budget will increase by $1.474 billion. The funds are to be spread across a series of programs:
Recommendations are based on each regions’ performance, needs, and project sizes, as well as environmental and labor justice concerns. The Governor’s Office states that the program will deliver at least “35% of the benefits, with a goal of 40% from the investments to statutorily defined disadvantaged communities and low-to-moderate income New Yorkers.”
The aforementioned $0.00082/kWh fee, which is paid by all customers and based on the state’s current electricity usage, will be collected over an 11-year period, from 2022 through 2032. The document notes that the yearly price will vary depending upon the progression of the solar program. Average residential electricity accounts should expect an increase of $0.70 to $0.92 per month.
The state says that if the Build Back Better Act is signed, it could save the program more thabn $525 million. That’s because the New York program takes into account the money that solar investment groups will earn. The state has access to some of the world’s most talented financial professionals, who have likely been consulted to help predict just how much each incentive will move the program forward.
NYSERDA has said that if the Build Back Better legislation is signed, they will refile the proposed operating plan – lowering state incentives in response to increased federal incentives.
 

To reach the upstate goal of 2.9 GW of installed capacity, the state will extend and increase incentives of the existing MW Block program.
The program’s incentives will restart with Block 18, with 800 MW of capacity. Participants will receive a check for $0.17/watt of installed solar panel capacity. The increase from $0.11/watt to $0.17/watt is due to a lowered community solar adder and upcoming decreases to the investment tax credit.
The ConEdison program will pay out $1.30/watt for small projects and $0.75/watt for large projects. The 150 MW block sizes will be cut into 30 MW segments, with each following segment paying out a lower amount per watt.
The 10 gigawatt roadmap requires all projects greater than 1 MW of capacity to pay a prevailing wage. NYSERDA predicts that this will cost approximately $0.125/watt for upstate projects, and $0.20/W for ConEdison projects. Consequently, NYSERDA has asked for an additional $239 million for the NY-Sun program to be paid to contractors to offset the cost of this new requirement.
