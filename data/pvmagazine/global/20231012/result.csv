The European aim to establish a PV value chain faces the sector's substantial raw material requirements. Given the energy transition context, recycling valuable materials is of strategic importance. With this objective, CEA has harnessed its technical expertise to create an innovative process for recycling silver and silicon at the end of their life cycle.
“The CEA has been deploying R&D for more than 60 years in a circular economy context, with the nuclear fuel cycle which is part of this logic of circularity,” Virginie Basini, head of CEA's sustainable technologies department, told pv magazine France.
The agency developed the innovative recycling process for silver and silicon, drawing from techniques initially designed for nuclear power. This method involves the use of a supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) delamination process to separate critical elements, such as silver and copper, from a key raw material like silicon.
The process employs supercritical CO2, which represents a state of carbon dioxide with properties intermediate between a liquid and a gas. It is achieved when CO2 surpasses its critical point at 31°C and 73.8 bars of pressure. In this state, CO2 infiltrates solids, particularly the polymer encapsulating the solar cells. When researchers conduct depressurization, the CO2 within the encapsulating polymer transforms back into a gaseous state, causing the polymer to expand and foam. This deformation results in the separation of different layers in the PV module, enabling their individual recovery.
Silver represents more than 30% of a panel's value.
“The whole challenge of recycling is to guarantee maximum purity of this high-value material in order to allow its reuse,” Basini said. “This is also the case for silicon, the majority of which recovered could be directed towards the high purity silicon sectors used in microelectronics or photovoltaics. The glass, which remains intact after delamination, can also be recycled in the flat glass sector.”
While there isn't an established channel for repurposing panels, a significant growth in such utilization is anticipated in the near future. In the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region, an emerging industrial sector is being shaped by Solreed, a company established in 2023 as a CEA spinoff. This startup is set to forge partnerships among private, public, and ESS entities to drive the development of this novel sector.

They have investigated the BFO/WO3 combination to assess the aggregate benefits of the two compounds, in terms of multiferroic and insulating properties.
“The high leakage current of BFO thin films is a major concern while handling it for device applications,” the group said. “Fabrication of bi/multilayer thin film of BFO with other materials to provide an insulating intermediate layer, has been put forward to resolve this problem.”
To analyze the properties of the bilayer thin films, the researchers initially deposited WO3 nanostructures onto silicon corning and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates coated with glass. They then grew the BFO thin film layer over the nanostructures using the Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique, employing various laser energy levels ranging from 150 mJ to 250 mJ. PLD is a method used to precisely control the composition, structure, and thickness of thin films.
After comparing laser energies of 150 mJ, 175 mJ, 200 mJ, 225 mJ, and 250 mJ, the scientists determined that 200 mJ stands as the optimal standard for producing these films. They observed that, when exposed to light, the BFO/WO3 bilayer with a 200 mJ laser energy exhibited an open circuit voltage of 320 mV and a short-circuit photocurrent density of approximately 18 mA/cm^2.
“The enhancement in the PV response obtained at 200 mJ sample may be due to the better crystallinity, lower band gap, least leakage current density, high value of polarization,” the scientists explained in “Studies on photovoltaic properties of BFO/WO3 bilayer thin films for solar energy harvesting applications,” which was recently published in Results in Optics.
Regarding electrical leakage, the 200 mJ BFO/WO3 film displayed superior performance under an applied voltage of approximately 2 V. In terms of crystallinity, it outperformed the other examined laser energy levels, featuring a BFO size of 33 nm, a WO3 size of 28 nm, and a grain size of 25 nm. Additionally, it exhibited the lowest energy bandgap, measuring 2.3 eV for the BFO and around 3.3 eV for the WO3.
“The enhanced photovoltaic response at 200 mJ may be the consequence of enhanced crystallite sizes, lower band gap, reduced leakage current, and larger values of remnant and saturation polarization,” the researchers concluded.

However, this type of technology is likely to assume a more important and versatile role on the grid in the years to come, according to NREL's new publication.
NREL’s earlier studies identified economic opportunities for hundreds of gigawatts of six to 10-hour storage even without new policies targeted at reducing carbon emissions.
“Longer-duration energy storage may lead to better grid resilience,” said Paul Denholm, NREL model engineering senior research fellow and lead author. “There's an upside to developing and deploying greater storage, whether that value is in the ability to store more renewable energy or meeting winter energy demand.”
Historically, four-hour storage has been well-suited to providing capacity during summer peaks, and its ability to serve summer peaks is enhanced with greater deployments of solar energy.
As a result, several wholesale market regions have adopted a fixed “four-hour capacity rule” that fully compensates storage with at least four hours of duration and has no additional capacity revenues for longer durations. That means that a six-hour battery does not receive any more revenue than a four-hour one.
“This rule, along with limited additional energy arbitrage value for longer durations and the cost structure of Li-ion batteries, has created a disincentive for durations beyond 4 hours. Based in part on this rule, in 2021 and 2022, about 40% of storage capacity installed was exactly 4 hours of duration, and less than 6% had durations of greater than 4 hours,” NREL writes in its new publication.
However, the addition of solar, extreme weather conditions and building heating electrification are changing the equation and peak demand is becoming more significant in the winter than in the summer, as already seen in the Southeast and Texas.
“Energy storage could help meet increasing winter demand,” Denholm said. “Increased storage can also support transmission and resilience, further increasing the value of developing energy storage with more than four hours of capacity.”
Various technologies – such as thermal storage or next-generation compressed-air energy storage – have the potential to reach cost parity with lithium-ion batteries and longer service lifetimes. However, the new technologies must compete with the established lithium-ion, which had a decades-long head-start, and will require deployment at scale.
“We have promising technologies that, with development, can meet winter demand peaks and compete with lithium-ion technology,” Denholm said. “Reliability of the grid is the goal – greater storage can help us get there.”

This brings the year's total PPA count to 182, up sharply from the 116 recorded during the same period in the preceding year.
Germany stood out as the most active country in September 2023 with four PPAs, bringing its year-to-date total to 28 and securing its position as the second-most active country for the year. Solar was a dominant force in September, accounting for 14 of the 17 agreements. PV accounts for nearly 62% of this year's total PPAs, with 112 in total.
The Pexa Euro Composite, Pexapark's global index for average PPA prices across various technologies and regions, fell 1.8% from August. In September, most energy and commodity prices fell. The German Cal24 electricity futures contract dropped to a nearly four-month low at the end of September due to declining European gas prices. European gas storage reaching 95.6% full was perceived as bearish for the market leading into the winter season.
Expectations for greater availability of the French nuclear fleet following extended maintenance disruptions have also eased concerns about the winter, leading to lower future European electricity prices. Production is set to reach 50 GW to 52 GW in January, from 43 GW in the previous year.
Pexapark has also introduced new Green Fuel Pricing, offering daily marginal cost reference prices for renewable hydrogen and ammonia. These prices are determined based on the input costs of renewable PPAs and the risk profile associated with producing green fuels using renewable energy. The objective is to enhance certainty in Power-to-X markets, the Swiss company said.

Italian research agency ENEA and Enel Green Power, the renewable energy unit of Italian utility Enel, have developed a PV system that could be used in combination with the production of microalgae for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical use.
“The algovoltaic plant, just completed at the ENEA Research Center in Portici, Naples, as part of an agreement between ENEA and Enel Green Power, allows an annual production of approximately 30 kg of dried algae on a surface area of 40 m2 and a power of 7 kW,” said the Italian research entity.
The system allows the cultivation of microalgae with a high commercial value, from €100/kg to €600/kg for pharmaceutical or cosmetic use, through a fully automated cultivation system integrated with the solar array.
“Algae allow us to exploit the energy coming from the sun better than traditional crops since they have greater photosynthetic efficiency,” said Carmine Cancro, a researcher at the ENEA Smart Grid and Energy Networks laboratory at the Portici Research Centre. “Furthermore, they have a high environmental value as they consume carbon dioxide, transforming it into biomass through photosynthesis and releasing pure oxygen into the atmosphere.”
Cancro said that the system could also be used to retrofit existing PV systems.
The microalgae thrive in an aqueous solution flowing within transparent glass tubes positioned beneath the PV modules, shielded from direct sunlight. These modules are arranged in two parallel vertical arrays and interconnected to form a continuous coil that facilitates fluid circulation.
Thanks to the photosynthesis triggered by solar energy and the consequent absorption of carbon dioxide, the microalgae grow within the solution until they reach a density and a state of maturation such that they can be collected, through a powerful centrifuge that separates them from the water.

INTEC Energy Solutions
Finally, though, acceptance of the necessity of clean power is dawning. Italy will need to add 50 GW of solar generation capacity by 2030 as part of 70 GW of new clean power facilities needed to meet European targets.
A notoriously sluggish permitting system has resulted in less than 1.5 GW per year of new photovoltaics, with around 800 MW added in 2020 and 940 MW in 2021, rising to around 2.5 GW last year. Residential solar, at least, has advanced markedly in the last two years.
The government has also set a target of sourcing 55% of Italian-generated electricity from renewables by 2050.
Solar has been boosted by regional residential-PV incentives and a move to simplify permitting for clean energy plants under the procedura abilitativa semplificata (PAS), which came into force in April 2022.
Italy’s European Union-funded, post-Covid economic recovery plan, the Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) – approved in July 2021 – allocated €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) for the installation of solar on agricultural buildings, referred to as “agrisolar,” and €1.1 billion for agrivoltaics. None of the PNRR funds were allotted to conventional, ground-mounted solar parks.
That was mainly because of permit delays for conventional ground-mounted solar. While the PNRR millions fired the starting gun on agrivoltaic projects with a generation capacity of more than 1 MW, the drawn-out nature of the “autorizzazione unica” central permitting process for photovoltaics, and the diverse planning policies of local governments, have led to inevitable development hold-ups for ground-mounted solar.
The PAS has at least shaken things up, with many projects that were awaiting autorizzazione unica approval withdrawn and resubmitted as clusters of smaller sites, with generation capacities no larger than 20 MW in order to be eligible for the simpler permitting process. Numerous projects, in fact, have reappeared with a capacity ceiling of 14 MW, as securing connection to the medium-voltage grid is far easier than to the high-voltage network applicable to larger sites.
The raised cost of agrivoltaics reflects the fact panels cannot be as tightly packed as in conventional ground-mounted sites, due to the requirements of the crops planted under and between them.
INTEC Energy Solutions' experience is that agrivoltaic installations with panels installed anywhere from 2.1 m to 6 m off the ground require 30% to 60% more expense than ground-mounts, when it comes to their racking and installation cost. That is because more steel is needed and work is performed at height.
Working at height and removing the extra dust generated by farm vehicles adds 20% to 40% to agrivoltaic array operation and maintenance costs, versus ground-mounted sites.
The lower panel density means agrivoltaics require 10% to 40% more expense to generate electricity and an additional €20 to €50 payment per hectare is needed to cover the cost of mandatory statements by the farmer proving the continuation of agricultural production at such facilities.
Those expenses ensure agrivoltaic sites are, on average, around 40% more expensive than ground-mounted facilities.
At INTEC, we are keenly following the progress of agrivoltaic-related legislation in Italy and also monitoring the details of projects our customers have submitted in pursuit of PNRR incentives.
There is great enthusiasm about the potential of agrivoltaics for Italy, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict has emphasized not only the European Union’s dependence on Russian gas – triggering a general energy crisis – but also a reliance on certain foodstuffs sourced from Ukraine.
The two problems must be tackled hand in hand and agrivoltaics represent an ideal method of ensuring agriculture and energy production coexist without imbalance.
Getting the policy right is essential to ensuring the nascent agrivoltaic and agrisolar sectors do not become another missed opportunity, with practically-inaccessible incentives for farmers.
At the time of writing, we are still awaiting detail of the operating rules for agrivoltaic systems to be eligible for public incentives and PNRR cash. Developers need to know what design, construction, and monitoring requirements will apply and how the PNRR eligibility of such sites will be verified.
Regarding agrisolar, on farm buildings, a tender for such arrays was issued on July 21. Online applications must be submitted to the organization set up for the purpose by government renewables body the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE), with an application window due to have opened on Sep. 12 and set to close today.
The tender included an increase in PNRR financial aid of up to 80% for companies involved in, or set to switch to primary agriculture; the option of multiple farms sharing consumption of the solar power they generate and of combining as single agrivolatic-project applicants; and a raising of the maximum eligible rooftop array generation capacity to 1 MWp.
The procurement document also doubled the previous maximum PNRR-eligible expenditure, up to €100,000 for accumulation systems, and to €30,000 for recharging devices, with a PNRR total per single project ceiling of €2.33 million.

The government made the announcement in its 2024 Budget, handed down on Tuesday, under the banner of “energy transformation.” The government said the allocation “will continue to build momentum in delivering on our national retrofit targets” and is a €24 million spend increase on last year.
Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan TD, said in the first half of 2023 solar panel installation increased 231% from last year. This was followed by the government’s move to slash VAT. It is expected that 21,000 households will receive solar support by the end of the year, the announcement states.
But Conall Bolger, CEO of the Irish Solar Energy Association (ISEA), told pv magazine today that the budget was “perhaps not quite so generous as it first appears.” While he welcomed certain government measures, such as the new low-interest loan scheme for rooftop solar, and doubling the tax disregard when a household sells excess solar electricity back to the grid, some instruments lacked urgency and “fail to deliver meaningful actions.”
There was 616 MW of rooftop and ground-mounted solar PV connected to the Irish grid at the end of 2022, according to data provided by the Irish Distribution System Operator, ESB Networks, Bolger said. He said the department is forecasting 1,060 MW connected at the end of 2023.
In a wider commentary on the budget, Bolger said he was critical of the government’s failure to scrap tax barriers preventing farmers from leasing land for solar developments. “Central to Ireland’s decarbonisation plan is the government’s own stated ambition to develop 8 GW of solar energy by 2030,” he explained.
“This will require approximately 25,000 acres of solar farms within this decade and making this a reality will require the cooperation of farmers across the country. All farming families are conscious of tax exemptions to allow land to be passed on to the next generation without punitive tax bills. Inexplicably, this does not apply in instances where more than 50% of land is utilised by solar panels.”
He also expected the government to remove the “arbitrary rule” that “punishes” farmers who engage in renewable energy. Bolger said there is growing demand from home and business owners to implement rooftop solar PV panels, and meeting this demand would require more trained tradespeople to install the technology.

Consequently, both of these have grown rapidly over the past few years, and now represent the mainstream in solar cell and module manufacturing.
New research, which was among the winners of a poster award at the EU PVSEC conference held in Lisbon last month, has demonstrated that the combination of half-cut and bifacial cell designs may contribute to hotspot formation and performance issues, under certain conditions. And current testing standards, the study’s authors warned, may not be equipped to spot modules vulnerable to this type of degradation.
The researchers, led by Spain-based technical consultancy Enertis Applus, covered parts of a PV module to observe its behavior under partial shading. “We forced shadowing to take a deep dive into the behavior of monofacial and bifacial half-cell modules, focusing on hot spot formation and the temperatures these spots reach,” explained Sergio Suárez, global technical manager at Enertis Applus. “Interestingly, we identified mirrored hot spots that emerge in the opposite position with respect to normal hot spots without apparent reasons, like shadowing or breakages.”
The study indicated that the voltage design of half-cell modules may cause hotspots to spread beyond the shaded/damaged area. “The half-cell modules presented an intriguing scenario,” continued Suárez. “When a hotspot emerges, the module's inherent voltage parallel design pushes other unaffected areas to develop hotspots as well. This behavior could hint at potentially faster degradation in half-cell modules due to the appearance of these multiplied hotspots.”
The effect was also shown to be especially strong in bifacial modules, which reached hotspot temperatures up to 10 C higher than the single-sided modules in the study. The modules were tested over a 30-day period under high irradiance conditions, with both cloudy and clear skies. The study is soon set to be published in full, as part of the proceedings of the 2023 EU PVSEC event.
According to the researchers, these results reveal a route to performance loss that is not well covered by module testing standards.
“A singular hotspot on the lower part of the module might instigate multiple upper hotspots, which, if not addressed, could accelerate the module's overall degradation through increased temperature,” said Suárez. He further noted that this could place additional importance on maintenance activities such as module cleaning, as well as system layout and wind cooling. But spotting the problem early on would be preferable to this, and require new steps in testing and quality assurance at the manufacturing stage.
“Our findings spotlight a need and an opportunity to re-evaluate and possibly update standards for half-cell and bifacial technologies,” said Suárez. “It's essential to factor in thermography, introduce specific thermal patterns for half-cells and adjust the normalisation of thermal gradients to Standard Test Conditions (STC) for bifacial modules.”

For buildings with rooftop spaces exceeding 92.2 square meters, net-metered solar power systems is obligatory. Owners seeking single-phase grid connections must install a net-metered solar system with a minimum capacity of 1 kW, while those requiring three-phase connections must meet a 3 kW capacity requirement. The same rules apply to schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations with at least 1,000 square feet of rooftop space.
Additionally, the new regulation stipulates that industrial and commercial customers in need of grid connections up to 80 kW must install a rooftop PV system equivalent to 15% of their total load. Customers requiring connections between 80 kW and 500 kW must install a PV system representing up to 12% of their load capacity, while those with loads exceeding 500 kW must install a rooftop array representing up to 10% of their load capacity.
Furthermore, existing buildings wishing to enhance their grid connection load capacity must adhere to the same rules by installing additional rooftop solar systems. Dipal C. Barua, former president and current adviser of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, told pv magazine that there is strong support for this new measure.
“Hundreds of megawatts of electricity now will be added from rooftop solar every year,” he said. “The implementation of the rules of mandatory net-metered pv system will be easier in case of new buildings since they will be obliged to follow the rules as they need grid connection.”
Barua stated that every year, approximately 40,000 new residential buildings are built in Bangladesh, and if, on average, each of them installs a 2 kW system, this would contribute about 80 MW of power. He also noted that industrial and commercial buildings, which require a substantial electricity load, would install larger rooftop solar systems, further increasing electricity generation.
Bangladesh has the capacity to produce a total of 1194.63 MW of clean electricity. Of this capacity, 84.837 MW is generated from net-metered rooftop solar systems, while 70.301 MW is derived from non-net-metered rooftop PV systems.

The “MRac Waterproof” design ensures waterproofing through its inherent structure, using surface-component structures for drainage. The upper rail support components are secured by side pressure blocks and middle pressure blocks, with aluminum alloy cover plates placed between component connections and EPDM single-ply roofing membrane strips installed.
“This tight component connection structure can block most rainwater,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
The carport also relies on a dual-track design at the bottom of the components for bidirectional water leakage prevention.
“Horizontal gutters are used on the upper level to direct excess water into the main gutter, which then guides the surplus rainwater to the drainage gutter,” the spokesperson said. “This ingenious multi-structural approach effectively addresses leakage concerns and achieves comprehensive waterproofing.”
The carport structure allows for the installation of both framed and unframed solar panels, offering a tilt angle ranging from 5 degrees to 15 degrees, in either portrait or landscape configuration.
According to Mibet, the carport mountings can be constructed from materials such as aluminum alloy, magnesium-aluminum-zinc, and carbon steel, demonstrating the capability to withstand 1.2 KN/m2 snow loads and 45 meters per second wind loads under standard conditions.
“Mibet's carport mountings are pre-assembled before leaving the factory, eliminating the need for cutting and welding on-site,” the spokesperson said. “Installation is completed by tightening bolts, significantly reducing construction time and lowering installation costs for users.”
The product comes with a 10-year warranty and is certified by TÜV Rheinland and SGS.

The offering pairs Panasonic’s CO2 Heat Pump with Reclaim Energy’s hot water system design. It will be available in Australia from December.
Panasonic’s CO2 Heat Pump boasts a 6.1 coefficient of performance, meaning for every unit of electrical energy used, 6.1 units of heating energy is produced. 
Heat pumps are gaining traction in Australia, with a recent report from Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator noting that air source heat pumps installations are up 70% compared to the first half of 2022.
The heat pump system collects heat from the external air using a heat exchanger and uses it as energy for the refrigerant. It then transfers this energy from the hot refrigerant to produce hot water. Both the heat pump and storage tank are designed for external installation.
Panasonic said it has installed approximately 2 million hot water heat pumps in the Japanese market.

The company said in a statement it inked a €100 million ($106.0 million) contractual loan from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), with the money going towards partially funding the construction of €360 million twin solar PV plants located in the mining towns of Benguerir and Khouribga.
The projects are expected to have a combined capacity of 400 MW and to be linked with 100 MWh of battery storage. The two solar plants will provide energy to the unspecified mine's operations.
OCP group chairman and CEO, Mostafa Terrab, said the agreement is a “major milestone” towards the company achieving its target of 100% renewable energy in fertilizer production by 2027.
OCP's first started mining Khouribga for phosphate – a common fertilizer ingredient – in 1921, and touts the Benguerir open-pit mine as one of its most important research facilities in the country. Together, these towns form the Gantour system, which is the third-largest phosphate mine in the world.
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, allocated its first green loan – financing offered to projects with a positive environmental impact – to OCP Group in April for the mining company's 1.2 GW solar program, which consists of four solar power plants.
A spokesperson from OCP Group told pv magazine France in April that construction of the projects was expected to start at the end of that month, with a building permit granted at the end of 2022.
OCP Group, one of the largest phosphate and fertiliser companies in the world, is expected to convert its operations to exclusively “green” energy by 2027, the announcement states.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/12/bifacial-perovskite-solar-cells-for-indoor-applications-achieve-30-3-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 12, 2023",Bifacial perovskite solar cells for indoor applications achieve 30.3% efficiency,"Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi (IIT-Mandi) have designed a bifacial perovskite solar cell for indoor environments that use multiple artificial lighting sources.
“Indoor bifacial photovoltaics (i-BPVs) offer the potential to surpass traditional monofacial photovoltaics (i-MPVs) in terms of power output per single cell, all without significantly increasing manufacturing expenses and while occupying less space,” the research's lead author, Ranbir Singh, told pv magazine. “We have developed i-BPV cell based on perovskite that can efficiently harvest maximum artificial indoor light from both the front and back sides of the modules.”
Singh and his research group described the solar cell in the study “Indoor bifacial perovskite photovoltaics: Efficient energy harvesting from artificial light sources,” published in Solar Energy.
They built the device with a semi-transparent substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport layer (ETL) relying on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), a MAPbI3 perovskite layer,  a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, and a semi transparent electrode made of gold (Au) and ITO. 
The scientists explained that the electrodes were designed to maintain transparency and improve artificial light harvesting from both sides. “For different Au/ITO layer thicknesses, the transmission decreases significantly with increasing Au layer thickness from 5 nm to 30 nm,” they added. Furthermore, they noted that the multilayer electrode (Au/ITO) exhibits a “good amount” of transmittance in the 450 nm to 800 nm wavelength range where most of the indoor light spectrum exists.
The researchers tested the bifacial cell under 1,000 lux LED light illumination and found it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 30.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.93 V, a short-circut current density of 148.3 μA/cm2 and a fill factor of 71.7%.
“The cell achieves a remarkable power output per single cell of 152.01 µW/cm2,” Singh stated. “Theoretical calculations suggest that bifacial devices have the potential to double the power generation at a 50% lower cost compared to their monofacial counterparts.”
According to the research team, the bifacial devices also showed a significant reduction in non radiative recombination losses, lower hysteresis and better operational stability in ambient air conditions compared to conventional monofacial PV structures. “The champion bifaciali cells display an excellent bifaciality factor of 0.73 and demonstrated superior operational stability when subjected to continuous illumination,” it also stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/12/australian-competition-regulator-issues-warning-about-lg-home-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 12, 2023",Australian competition regulator issues warning about LG home batteries,"From pv magazine Australia
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says all households with solar storage systems need to urgently check whether they have recalled LG-branded batteries, as they should switch off all affected batteries immediately.
“When these batteries malfunction there is a serious risk of injury or death due to the affected batteries overheating and causing a fire,” the ACCC said.
LG first issued a recall in February 2021 for 7,200 affected batteries that were installed in LG, SolaX and Opal home energy storage systems. The scope of the recall has been expanded over time. The manufacturer now urges all consumers with affected LG batteries in their solar energy storage systems – including LG-branded RESU systems, SolaX Power Station, SolaX X-Cabinet, Opal Storage, Redback SH5000, Red Earth Sunrise, Red Earth Drop Bear, Eguana Evolve, and VARTA Pulse Neo – to promptly power down their energy storage systems and keep them off until they are repaired or replaced.
“It is critically important that anyone with a solar energy storage system checks their battery’s serial number, as this recall has been updated to include new models, affected systems and dates of manufacture,” said ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe. “Even if you don’t have an LG-branded solar storage system, you may still have an LG-branded battery that has been recalled. For peace of mind, check your system again and turn off your battery straight away if it has been recalled.”
The warning for Australian battery owners comes amid reports of a spate of battery fires in Europe that have been linked to LG-branded batteries. Australian consumers with affected batteries should contact LG or SolaX to arrange remediation of their batteries.
LG will replace the recalled batteries at no cost or provide refunds, including removal from the consumer's property. Additionally, households facing higher electricity bills due to battery usage limitations will receive compensation from LG, according to the ACCC.
The October issue of pv magazine turns the spotlight back onto agrivoltaics. We’ll consider how solar on farmland is taking root in Australia and South Africa, how agrivoltaic data harvesting could help more farmers take the plunge, and how an insistence on expensive minimum heights for agrivoltaic panels is hindering the technology in Italy.
The affected battery models, available for sale between April 2017 and December 2019, include RESU3.3, RESU6.5, RESU10, RESU13, RESU7H Type-R, RESU10H Type-C, RESU10H Type-R, RESU10H Type-R (Secondary), S/A Gen2 1P (EM048063P3S2), S/A Gen2 1P (EM048063P3S4), S/A Gen2 1P (EM048063P3S5), S/A Gen2 2P (EM048126P3S7), and S/A Gen2 2P (EM048126P3S8).

The Dutch team is driving a so-called Challenger Class vehicle, which limits solar PV plate to 4 m2 size, according to the race’s regulations limits. “There are about 400 tandem cells in the entire solar deck array,” Stewart Hooper, manager of Product Realisation and Advanced Products, Oxford PV, told pv magazine.
“The tandem cells are a custom size, cut from our regular M6 size production cells,” said Hopper, adding that the standard Oxford PV cells were cut down to 100 cm2 for the vehicle's solar plate. In addition, to keep the weight in check the solar deck array is not enclosed in glass.
This is the first time that Oxford PV is participating in the competition. It has been making efficiency progress in recent months with heterojunction-perovskite tandem cells made at its production facility in Brandenburg, Germany.
“Over the past year our team has been studying how to capture the sun's energy as best as possible using new, innovative technologies that will allow us to compete against teams with over 10 years of experience. Tandem silicon solar cells from Oxford PV can outperform traditional silicon solar cells by at least 20% and represent the next big leap forward for solar power, as silicon cells approach their theoretical limits,” said Laura de la Fuente Esteban, PV Engineer at Top Dutch Solar Racing.
The Bridgeston World Solar Challenge will be on 20-27 October 2023. There are 32 entries in the Challenger Class from 18 locations around the world. Competitors participate from schools and universities around the world. In the The competition was last held in 2019. The  2021 event was cancelled due to the travel restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic.
