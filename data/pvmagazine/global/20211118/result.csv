“The scale of work outlined in this roadmap will be very challenging to deliver,” stated the 183-page technical version of the Shaping our electricity future report published last week.
In the shorter version of the strategy prepared for non-specialists, Mark Foley, chief executive of Republic of Ireland state-owned network company Eirgrid said: “This transition to clean electricity will affect everyone in Ireland and will unquestionably be difficult.”
Just how difficult that could be for consumers was spelled out only in the technical version of the document, which stated: “Eirgrid and SONI [the cross-border System Operator for Northern Ireland, which is owned by Eirgrid] believe it will be challenging to maintain electricity prices at current levels.” The fact failing to phase out fossil fuels will be even more costly in the long run was reflected by the line: “The scale of this challenge is enormous – but the benefits will be immeasurable.”
In terms of solar, the two grid companies have estimated 1 GW of large scale PV generation capacity will be needed in Ireland this decade to help the nation generate at least 70% of its electricity from renewables, en route to net zero by mid century. A further 300 MW of big solar will be needed in the North.
The volume of small scale, household and business solar arrays needed this decade was revised up from an initial estimate of 200-400 MW for the whole island, to 500 MW in EU member state Ireland and 100 MW in Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K.
That change was made following an extensive, 14-week consultation period to gather views from interested stakeholders from March onwards. The feedback generated – which included the fact people prefer solar to wind turbines when it comes to onshore renewables – also prompted Eirgrid and SONI to plan for 1.65 GWh of energy storage capacity to be added to the network this decade, more than double the initial 750 MW estimate.
The strategy also envisages 7.5 GW of wind by 2030, on and offshore, as well as 2.6 GW of derated gas with the latter “helping to fill any gaps while we make the changes needed,” according to the report. The dispatchability of the electricity sources this decade will be ensured by the use of batteries; demand-side response; the pending Celtic interconnector which will again hook up Ireland to the EU energy network; and ‘renewable-gas-ready conventional power capacity.' Further out, longer-term energy storage technology and pumped hydro can be part of the network, the report added.
With the island of Ireland already having plans in place for €2.2 billion of network infrastructure upgrades, Eirgrid and SONI reckon a further €1 billion will need to be spent this decade, on 40 new projects in Ireland and a dozen in the North. The former is set to need 24 upgrades, 11 new technology projects, four new circuits – underground lines and overhead cables – and a new transformer. Northern Ireland is set for seven upgrades, three new circuits and two new tech facilities.
The report stated Ireland currently draws on renewables for around 40% of its electricity and said the 70% target for 2030 was a minimum ambition, and could ramp up to 80%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/18/shingled-solar-modules-and-shading/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 18, 2021",Shingled solar modules and shading,"Shingled modules – where silicon solar cells are cut into five or six strips and interconnected using an electrically conductive adhesive – have been around for a while, and though never a mainstream solution they have kept the industry’s attention thanks to potential for flexibility in the size and shape of modules, better aesthetic appearance and improved tolerance to shading.
Recent interest in building integrated and other applications for PV beyond standard rooftop or ground-mounted modules, as well as concerns over the use of lead and improvements in electrically conductive adhesives, have led to renewed interest in the approach lately.
Last month Germany’s Fraunhofer Insititute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) introduced a new layout for shingled cells, developed in collaboration with interconnection equipment supplier M10, which it calls Matrix Shingle Technology. The approach sees cell strips laid out in staggered rows, similar to how bricks are placed in a wall. Fraunhofer ISE claims that this leads to higher module efficiencies and even better shading tolerance, and is now setting about evaluating the technology’s performance in various installation scenarios.
The institute’s latest work, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, demonstrates that Matrix shingled modules offer a significant advantage in certain shading conditions. The institute conducted lab experiments for various shading scenarios by partially covering modules with black sheeting and then testing them in a solar simulator.
Where shade moves diagonally across a module, and in conditions with random shading, the Matrix modules were shown to perform significantly better. Under diagonal shading, the group recorded up to 73.8% power increase, and under random shading as much as 96.5% more power, compared to a state-of-the-art shingled module using the standard stringing approach.
The group explained that its approach allows more electric current to flow out of the module, without being blocked by shaded areas. “This is caused by currents bypassing the shaded area via the busbar metallization crosswise to the normal current flow. “Besides higher power outputs, this leads to significantly less MPPs where reverse biasing of parts of the module increases the risk of hotspot occurrence.”
While shingled modules are already known to be less susceptible to hotspots thanks to better heat dissipation through the touching cells, the group also found a 40% reduction in the chance of parts of the module being bypassed, leading to an even lower chance of hotspots forming.
The ISE scientists further note that they expect the increased current extraction to improve energy yields for modules in power plant applications that would not have to deal with shading, although they would have to do further work to demonstrate this.
Fraunhofer ISE previously stated that it has a prototype production line for Matrix shingled cells up and running in Freiburg, and now adds that it sees the technology as particularly interesting for building or vehicle integrated PV, and other applications where frequent shading would be inevitable. “Huge potentials for solar power generation meet a huge variety of irregular shading conditions, making shading tolerance a very important aspect,” they conclude. “Above this, matrix modules fulfill other requirements like a highly aesthetic appearance without losing power due to, for example, coloring or printing patterns on the front sheet.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/18/canadian-solar-prepares-to-rein-in-production-capacity-expansion-plans/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CANADA,CHINA",MAX HALL,"NOVEMBER 18, 2021",Canadian Solar prepares to rein in production capacity expansion plans,"With the Covid and post-Covid headwinds that have assailed the solar industry having thus far failed to dampen the rush by many manufacturers to expand production capacity, Canadian Solar has hinted it will wind in its expansion plans to reflect a “prudent capital allocation strategy.”
That was the phrase used by senior VP and chief financial officer Huifeng Chang, quoted in the Sino-Canadian company's third-quarter update today. Chang said: “We have scaled up manufacturing with approximately US$420 million of capital expenditure, year-to-date, and plan to reduce our full-year capital expenditure plan to approximately US$500 million.” The executive added the company “will remain disciplined in capital deployment.”
Solar PV could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. This year, pv magazine’s UP initiative shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
Chairman and CEO Shawn Qu, presenting the outlook for the business, said Canadian Solar would invest in upstream manufacturing capacity “while benefiting from overcapacity in the wafer and cell manufacturing levels,” and that statement was fleshed out in a table illustrating the production capacity plans of the China-based CSI Solar manufacturing business unit, which is set to float on the Shanghai exchange.
The Chinese business is still due to expand its annual solar wafer capacity from the current 9.5 GW to 11.5 GW this year, and will add another 600 MW of cell lines by year-end, to reach 13.9 GW. However, neither wafer nor cell capacity is due to be expanded next year. CSI Solar president Yan Zhuang explained the operation, next year, will be “selectively slowing capacity expansion plans to optimize utilization rates.”
Ingot capacity, due to rise from 5.1 GW at the end of September to 5.4 GW this year, is still due to go up next year, to 10.1 GW, and the same is true of module output, which will go up from 22.1 GW at the end of the last quarter to 23.9 GW this year and 32 GW next year.
Chief executive Qu said the company believes the material costs afflicting solar manufacturing – chiefly a rising polysilicon price – and the logistics problems represented by soaring post-Covid shipping costs are both temporary problems. Ontario-headquartered Canadian Solar expects to shift 3.7-3.9 GW of panels in the current quarter, with CSI Solar to ship 840-860 MWh of battery systems for total quarterly revenue of US$1.5-1.6 billion, helped by the sales of 1.5-2.1 GW of project capacity, although some of the latter may overrun into the opening months of next year.
Next year, the company said, it will ship 20-22 GW of modules, 1.4-1.5 GWh of batteries and 2.4-2.9 GW of projects, for revenue of US$6.5-7 billion.
That is in part down to the company's ability to pass on some of those, apparently temporary shipping and polysilicon expenses. That was a strategy mentioned on more than one occasion in the latest update with CSI Solar's Zhuang stating his business has been “raising prices more aggressively.”
Qu too said the company was walking away from low-priced orders and would “control shipment volume to protect margins,” in the current trading period.
The same headwinds appear to be affecting Canadian Solar's project business, with Ismael Guerrero, corporate VP and president of the Global Energy, non-Chinese business unit stating: “Certain project construction schedules are starting to be delayed due to rising costs.” However the same solution to the problem appears to be doing the trick in the project business with Guerrero adding: “We continue to sign higher-priced PPAs [power purchase agreements].”
In terms of the third-quarter numbers, Canadian Solar shipped 3.87 GW of modules, up 6% from the previous window, but generated net revenue of US$1.23 billion, down 14%, quarter on quarter. Gross profit was up 24% on a quarterly basis, to US$229 million, helped by a US$12 million ‘true-up' supplied by the final numbers related to the anti-dumping and countervailing duty applied on products shipped to the U.S.
Higher shipping and handling costs pushed operating expenses up from US$158 million in Q2 to US$176 million, and a weakening Brazilian real against the dollar saw the business' foreign exchange losses in the quarter more than quadruple, from US$3 million to US$14 million, reflecting the fact the company is very active in Latin America.
That all added up to net income for shareholders for the quarter of US$35 million, up from US$11 million in the April-to-June period.

The special feature of the proposed design is that excess heat from the photovoltaic modules is stored in a phase change material. “This thermal energy can be converted into space and water heating – which is usually the biggest energy consumption of a household,” the researchers explained.
Phase change materials (PCMs) are substances capable of storing thermal energy, allowing for the stabilization of temperature. They can absorb or release large amounts of so-called ‘latent’ heat when they go through a change in their physical state, like during the melting and freezing process, for example.
The system consists of a PV unit equipped with PCM on the back of the solar modules; a wind turbine; a battery; and a biogas plant. The PCM is used for both cooling the panels and storing the excess heat. “The heat storage capacity of the PCM depends upon the melting temperature of the PCM and its latent heat capacity,” the scientists emphasized. “Calcium chloride hexahydrate, with a melting point of around 30 degrees Celsius and a latent heat capacity of 191 kJ/kg, is used as the PCM.”
The battery serves as a secondary source when PV and wind generation do not cover all demand, and its capacity must be based on the power required for a day, the battery efficiency, and the energy demand. The wind turbine, PV system and the battery bank are connected to the DC bus and the biogas generator and the electric load are connected to the AC bus. A converter is required to convert AC to DC or vice versa.
The system design was tested at a hostel located in Chennai, India, where the climate is hot and humid. “The electric load profile is the main influencing factor in the design and optimization of integrated hybrid energy systems,” the British group stressed. “So, it is very important to know how load varies during weekdays and weekends in order for the hybrid system to achieve the maximum utilization of resources and minimum system costs.” The electric load of the building consists of computers, fans, lights, electronic devices and machinery.
A control algorithm was used to maximize wind and solar power production, lower battery use, and minimize biogas operations to reduce carbon emissions. The optimum configuration for the system was given by the combination of a 224 kW PV system equipped with PCM, a 206 kW wind turbine, a 420 kW biogas generator, a 633 Ah battery, and a 170 kW converter.
The net present cost of this configuration is $1.43 million and its levelized cost of energy (LCOE) was estimated by the research team at $0.094/kWh. These values were compared to those of the same system design without the PCM storage and were found to be significantly lower.
“For the PV-wind-biogas-generator-battery-based off-grid system, the integration of a phase change material with a PV panel results in a saving of $0.22 million in terms of net present cost, and reduces the cost of the energy of the system from $0.099/kWh to $0.094/kWh,” the researchers stated. “We’ve conducted this research in an area where there is no electricity grid, so our future research needs to investigate how it can be translated to areas with one.”
A full description of the system design can be found in the paper Optimization of a novel Hybrid Wind Bio Battery Solar Photovoltaic System Integrated with Phase Change Material, which was recently published in energies.

President Lazarus Chakwera flicked the switch at the 60 MWac Salima Solar Plant developed in the Kanzimbe neighborhood of Salima district, around 110km northeast of Lilongwe on the shore of Lake Malawi.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The InfraCo Africa Development Group backed by the governments of the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.K. reported the inauguration ceremony in a press release yesterday which also said the 20 MWac Golomoti solar park being planned in Dedza district would be the first utility scale solar, grid-connected photovoltaic plant in sub-Saharan Africa to feature a battery of the type intended.
The update appears to indicate a setback for the latter project, given Chinese inverter maker Sungrow announced in May the Golomoti facility would be operational this year. As reported by pv magazine, Sungrow said the 20 MW/10 MWh project would feature its MV solar-plus-storage technology with lithium-ion batteries making up the storage component.
The Salima project, which was yesterday named Utility Scale Project of the Year at the awards ceremony held by the Africa Solar Industry Association, was initially developed by InfraCo Africa, Toronto-based renewables company JCM Power Corp, and South African investor Matswani Private Capital. InfraCo said Matswani was replaced by Dutch overseas development bank the FMO (Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden) in the funding stage related to construction of the site.
Salima and Golomoti will both sell electricity to national utility Electricity Supply Corp of Malawi Ltd. Both power purchase agreements were signed in September 2018, with InfraCo specifying the Salima contract will run for 20 years.
JCM and InfraCo are also working on the Golomoti project, which appears to have assistance from a web of U.K. government bodies, with InfraCo describing the arrangement as receiving support “from Business Energy and Industrial Strategies [sic] International Climate Finance through Innovate UK’s Energy Catalyst and RINA.”

With the continent boasting rich potential to be a green hydrogen producer – thanks to the vast promise of affordable renewable energy – the argument has been made that green hydrogen could become a major source of export income as demand for the energy storage medium is set to rocket in Europe and other markets.
Pick up the November edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
However Sarushen Pillay, a senior representative of South African energy and chemicals company Sasol, said African nations should harness the green hydrogen they produce to manufacture value-added products such as sustainable steel, which could attract far more economic benefits than the simple gas itself.
Pillay was speaking at the energy event held in Cape Town last week at which Lars Greiner, an associate partner with Hamburg Port Consulting, stressed the potential for Africa to be a leading global producer of hydrogen. The port of Hamburg, in Germany, is already investing in hydrogen and, with Falk Bömeke, from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, stressing his government and the European Commission was ready to invest in African green hydrogen production, the appetite for the commodity outside Africa was clear.
To further emphasize the potential of a technology seen as key to the global energy transition – and which, as Pillay pointed out, could help power heavy vehicles in Africa's extensive mining operations – Fredrick Ndi-Obiosa, regional manager of U.S.-based science and technology business KBR, said the hydrogen market could be worth $2.5 trillion by mid century, roughly half the current value of the oil sector.
Keynote speaker Josef Abramowitz, president and CEO of Dutch-headquartered emerging market solar developer Gigawatt Global, told the event renewable energy is now cheaper than gas in Africa's emerging markets and said global investors had already committed to shift almost $40 trillion away from fossil fuels to renewables.
However, quoting the African Development Bank and United States overseas development body USAID, Abramowitz added: “The international community has failed to scale green energy to match the needs in Africa.”

Amorphous silicon (a-Si) deposition is the core process for HJT cells and the key to their electrical properties. The process completes the p-n junction through chemical vapor deposition of intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), p-type a-Si:H (around 5 nm), and n-type a-Si:H (around 5 nm).
Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is currently the mainstream process for a-Si:H layers, as it has higher stability and equipment maturity. To improve the short circuit current of HJT cells, manufacturers are testing deposition on microcrystalline silicon (uc-Si:H). Since uc-Si:H thin film grows rather slowly and has issues related to vertical evenness, very high-frequency chemical vapor deposition (VHF-CVD) might be adopted. Some manufacturers are also evaluating hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) for mass production, as it delivers high deposition efficiency and better passivation results.
The texturing process, which is conducted before cell deposition, includes the removal of saw damage and light-trapping structures, and the cleaning of the wafer surface, reducing recombination losses. There are three process routes: RCA cleaning (hydrogen peroxide + ammoniacal nitrogen), hydrogen peroxide-ozone cleaning, and pure ozone cleaning.
RCA cleaning performs better at removing particles and chemical impurities from the wafer surface. However, the method will be eliminated gradually due to the higher consumption of chemicals and higher costs of nitrogen deposition. Hydrogen peroxide-ozone treatment is currently the most widely adopted method, which can effectively reduce nitrogen emissions and costs. Import into China of ozone and domestic production of additives enables HJT texturing costs to be identical with PERC. Pure ozone treatment is not commonly used due to its lower ability to clean organic matter.
As the conductivity of the a-Si:H is poor, adding a 100 nm layer of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) film between the electrode and a-Si:H layer can increase charge carrier collection. TCO films can deliver high electrical conductivity, reduce reflection, and protect the a-Si:H layer. The most widely used TCO coating techniques are magnetron sputtering (PVD) and reactive plasma deposition (RPD).

Despite better photoelectric properties of indium tungsten oxide (IWO), fewer manufacturers adopt RPD due to patent and cost issues. S.C New Energy, a Chinese equipment supplier that uses this technique, claims that IWO film processed by RPD has 0.3% higher ITO efficiency. PVD, however, has no patent issues and has better stability and lower costs, meaning it is popular among equipment suppliers.
As the TCO process step continues to be optimized, consumption of ITO has reduced to around 20 mg/W. With indium recycling and the introduction of aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) on the rear side, ITO consumption is likely to drop further.

Bifacial HJT cells require two to three times the consumption of silver paste compared with PERC. Coupled with heavy dependence on imports into China of low-temperature paste, high costs induced by the metallization step have become the biggest barrier facing HJT.
The most widely discussed approaches to reduce metallization costs are silver-coated copper paste and copper electroplating. Silver-coated copper receives higher acceptance, as it can be done without modifying production lines. It is reported that 30% copper maintains cell efficiency, but is less competitive in terms of cost. If the percentage of copper could be brought to 45% or higher, metallization costs of HJT could reach the level of PERC or even lower. However, a higher percentage of copper will lead to a decrease of cell efficiency by 0.1% to 0.3%, and the big problem is the reliability of copper exposure.
Manufacturers are investigating electroplating techniques, but for now, it remains in the research stage. While copper electroplating itself only costs CNY 0.03-0.05 ($0.0047-0.0078/W), if including costs of the PVD seed, photomask preparation, and texturing, the cost of metallization is estimated at CNY 0.15/W, which is not cost-competitive, but there is much room for improvement.
HJT has drawn plenty of market attention already. Recently, Tongwei’s 1 GW-HJT project was completed, Huasun’s 1.2 GW project commenced construction, JA Solar announced plans to install pilot lines, and Akcome expanded gigawatt-scale production capacity. Meanwhile, Ming Yang Smart Energy Group, HaiTai New Energy, and China Resources Power will engage in HJT as well. Statistics show more than 80 GW of HJT production capacity has been planned thus far, and we expect to see 10 GW come online in 2022.
HJT cell efficiencies have passed the 24% mark. There are still various process routes to push this higher, such as gettering process and the substitution of a-Si:H for uc-Si. Despite higher dependence on equipment for improving efficiencies, equipment suppliers and manufacturers both claim that they will achieve better than 25% efficiency in mass production in 2022, as equipment and costs continue to be optimized. HJT technology saw no yield rate issues, with manufacturers claiming 97% and beyond of yield rates, close to that of PERC cells.
Fewer process steps, better yield rates, and high cell efficiency give HJT technology a bright outlook. But subject to higher manufacturing costs and the inability to widen its lead in efficiency over p-type PERC and n-type TOPCon cells, HJT production and capacity will not grow significantly in the short term.
HJT manufacturers are actively adapting to the trend for larger wafers, accommodating newly added and modified production lines with the M10 and G12 formats. HJT capacity and production output will continue to grow in one to two years, but the pace hinges on cost reductions, with metallization being the pivotal segment. After technologies of silver-coated copper pastes and copper electroplating reach maturity, HJT technology will see more and more gigawatt-scale capacity expansions. It’s expected that mass production will not take place until after 2024, as it requires one to two years to optimize costs.

“GE Energy Financial Services supported UKEF to agree the deal, with the U.K.’s export credit agency set to guarantee a GBP 217 million buyer credit facility,” the UK government said in a statement. “This will enable GE to deploy its first Flexinverter solar technology outside the US, supporting Turkey’s clean energy goals and facilitating trade for UK suppliers.”
GE Energy Financial Services is the investment unit of General Electric, which made the central inverters that will be used in the Karapinar project. The Flexinverter inverters have already been deployed on the solar plant's first 227 MW section, which is now operational. The full project is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year.
“UKEF’s guarantee will help support over 100 British jobs as the integration of the solar technology and the assembly of the solar power station will occur in the U.K.,” the British government said, in an apparent reference to the assembly of the inverter stations.
The solar modules for the PV project must be produced in Turkey. The project, which was originally set to have a capacity of 500 MW, was tendered by the Turkish authorities on the condition that a vertically integrated solar panel factory had to be built as part of the development of the solar park.
Kalyon Enerji said in November 2020 that it planned to increase the capacity of its ingot-to-module solar factory in Ankara from 500 MW to 1 GW. Kalyon signed an EPC contract with Chinese state-owned conglomerate China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) for the construction of the factory in October 2019.
The overall project was tendered through the Turkish government's YEKA program in 2017. A consortium formed by Kalyon Enerji and Hanhwa Q Cells was the winner, but the South Korean solar manufacturer ended up walking away from the deal a few months later. CECT replaced Hanhwa Q Cells as a new project partner in October 2019.
The Turkish government decided to subsidize the facility in September 2019 with a TRL 1.99 billion ($333 million) “super incentive.”

Five of China’s largest module manufacturers – namely, Longi, JinkoSolar, Trina Solar, JA Solar and Risen – recently issued a joint statement apologizing for supply chain disruptions, as well as delays and other negative impacts on customers. In the statement they invoke force majeure; that is, external circumstances not under their control, such as government regulations or natural disasters. This was likely done as a precautionary measure to justify and pave the way for gradual adjustments to existing supply contracts. This is of little help to an EPC provider or distributor. The rest of the value chain is in turn dependent on them – from planners to installers to end customers. In most cases, commitments to these downstream stakeholders cannot simply be tossed out the window.

In the statement they invoke force majeure; that is, external circumstances not under their control, such as government regulations or natural disasters. This was likely done as a precautionary measure to justify and pave the way for gradual adjustments to existing supply contracts. This is of little help to an EPC provider or distributor. The rest of the value chain is in turn dependent on them – from planners to installers to end customers. In most cases, commitments to these downstream stakeholders cannot simply be tossed out the window.
If delivery dates and purchasing conditions that were presumed to be the secure start to waver, it will push many PV projects to the brink. In the event of a cancellation, contractors could find themselves between the bleak alternatives of taking a loss – in the worst case, a contractual penalty – or postponing the installation date indefinitely and possibly having to reapply for grid access and plant certification. Recalculation and renegotiation with the client is not always possible or reasonable. But how long can plant builders wait?
In the letters invoking force majeure, the manufacturers list measures taken by China’s central government in response to the impending energy shortage this winter, which is expected to lead to production cuts of up to 90%, depending on the sector. This means that for some suppliers, these requirements – and in the case of module producers, the added woe of raw materials that are either unavailable or overpriced – could soon bring production to a complete standstill, putting additional pressure on overall capacities still available. With such an outlook, the laws of the market immediately kick in. Only those who are prepared to pay a premium will still be supplied.
In addition, global shipping prices are still through the roof and the problem won’t be solved anytime soon. The current shortage of truck drivers in the U.K. and elsewhere further exacerbates the situation. Empty containers – and no small number of full ones – are sitting in temporary storage facilities and can neither be unloaded nor sent on their way; and are thus effectively removed from the international logistics chain.
In this precarious situation, module producers are going all in to minimize impending losses and renegotiate older supply contracts. They do not want to find themselves in a predicament similar to the one they faced at the beginning of the year, when there was an unexpected increase in the price of raw materials and a shortage of shipping capacity so that conditions negotiated last year could only be maintained this spring by eating their entire sales margin. This fall, all contracts signed before March or April 2021 will apparently be up for review. Small to medium-volume customers are generally going to be the ones holding the short end of the stick. Larger, strategically important customers will probably be spared for the time being.
Once again, this is a case where good advice is expensive. First of all, the installer or EPC should talk to the client again and determine whether a price adjustment is possible for the project. Of course, the financier or investor should also be involved so as not to jeopardize the release of funds. Sometimes there is a buffer in the budget that can be tapped without crushing profitability or sacrificing the company’s own earnings. After all, prices on the electricity exchange have also crept up a bit, increasing the value of a solar-generated kilowatt-hour accordingly.
The second option – namely, to wait until prices fall again – requires something of a gambler’s mentality. Certainly, at the end of the fourth quarter, there will again be the odd remaining lot of existing modules, which will be offered at special prices. However, whether it is suitable for the project at hand, and whether the interested party is fast enough, is largely left to chance. Unfortunately, a steady price decline for crystalline modules is nowhere in the foreseeable future.

The move is intended at securing low-carbon photovoltaic materials amid growing demand for renewable energy in the United States, Hanwha Solutions said in a statement. In the United States, REC Silicon owns and operates a 20,000 MT polysilicon factory in Moses Lake, Washington, and a 2,000 MT facility in Butte, Montana.
“The Transactions are expected to strengthen REC Silicon’s financial position and ensure that the Company has the necessary resources to reopen its FBR facility in Moses Lake, Washington, and enable valuable investment opportunities in Butte, Montana,” REC Silicon said in its own press release. “A US value chain for solar PV manufacturing will result in the creation of demand for solar grade polysilicon, which the Company expects will result in the restart of the manufacture of high quality, low-cost solar grade granular polysilicon in Moses Lake, Washington during 2023.”
Hanwha Solution stated it will further invest in the United States, where it already operates a 1.7 GW solar module factory, as it want to anticipate further significant policy support when the US Congress passes the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) before year’s end. “Most US-based polysilicon manufacturers have halted their production for solar-grade polysilicon, including REC Silicon at Moses Lake. Signing SEMA into law and leveraging smart trade and other federal policies will boost solar manufacturing in the United States,” the company said. “Capitalizing on our expertise in polysilicon production, we will reopen the Moses Lake facility and jumpstart REC Silicon production in the US.”
In its latest financial report published in mid-October, the polysilicon manufacturer said its solar sales during 2021 represented small sales volumes from remaining granular polysilicon inventories. “REC Silicon has undertaken project execution activities which will maintain the ability to restart the Moses Lake facility near the beginning of 2023,” it also stated at the time.
*The article was updated on November 18 to add that Hanhwa Solutions wants to further invest in the US market.

In the third quarter of the year, more than 894 MW of solar was deployed in the eastern European country.
Poland had reached 3.9 GW of cumulative solar capacity by the end of 2020, 1.3 GW at the end of 2019, and just 486 MW at the end of 2018. The exponential growth recorded last year was mainly due to the growing number of grid-connected solar parks.
The Eastern European country is expected to add around 2 GW per year over the next five years, according to Polish research institute Instytut Energetyki Odnawialnej. By the end of 2025, its cumulative installed PV capacity should reach 14.93 GW.
Poland is currently supporting solar through an auction scheme and incentives for rooftop PV.

Indian state-owned power producer NTPC Ltd. and Indian Oil have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate in the field of renewable energy and mutually explore opportunities for the supply of round-the-clock captive renewable power.
NTPC and Indian Oil will work on the generation and storage of renewable energy or other forms of energy, including gas-based power, primarily to cater to Indian Oil refineries or other installations. This partnership will support the country’s commitment to achieve renewable energy targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“NTPC is taking various steps to make its energy portfolio greener by adding significant capacity of renewable energy sources so that our non-fossil fuel-based capacity will become equal or greater than our thermal portfolio by 2032,” said Gurdeep Singh, NTPC chairman and managing director. “Through this MoU, the strengths of both the organizations can be leveraged to achieve the aim of the country to meet its net-zero commitments.”
NTPC, India’s largest integrated energy company, has an installed capacity of 67,657.5 MW (including 13,425 MW through ventures and subsidiaries) comprising 47 NTPC stations (23 coal-based stations, seven gas-based stations, one hydro station, one small hydro, 14 solar PV and one wind-based station) and 26 joint venture stations (nine coal-based, four gas-based, eight hydro, one small hydro, two wind and two solar PV).

Energy storage installations throughout the world are forecast to reach 358 GW/1,028 GWh by the end of 2030, more than 20 times greater than the 17 GW/34 GWh online at the end of 2020, according to the latest forecast from BloombergNEF (BNEF).
This projected growth in stationary energy storage will require more than $262 billion of investment, BNEF said in its 2021 Global Energy Storage Outlook.
“This is the energy storage decade. We’ve been anticipating significant scale-up for many years and the industry is now more than ready to deliver,” said Yayoi Sekine, the company's head of decentralized energy.
Growth markets
The outlook estimated that 345 GW/999 GWh of new energy storage capacity will be added globally between 2021 and 2030. The United States and China are expected to be the two largest markets, representing more than half of the global storage installations by 2030. Clean power ambitions of state governments and utilities propel storage deployment in the United States, the outlook said. In China, the installation target of 30 GW of cumulative build by 2025 and stricter renewable integration rules boost expected storage installations.
Other top markets according to BNEF include India, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Supportive policies, ambitious climate commitments, and the growing need for flexible resources are common drivers. The forecast said that although Asia-Pacific will lead the storage build on a megawatt basis by 2030, the Americas will build more on a megawatt-hour basis. BNEF said that is because storage plants in the United States usually have more hours of storage.
Europe, Middle East and Africa currently lags behind its counterparts due to a lack of targeted storage policies and incentives. Growth in the region could accelerate, however, as renewables penetration surges, more fossil-fuel generators close, and the battery supply chain becomes more localized.
Flexible resource
BNEF said that falling battery costs and “surging” renewables penetration make energy storage a “compelling flexible resource in many power systems.” Energy storage projects are growing in scale, increasing in dispatch duration, and are increasingly paired with renewables, it said.
BNEF’s forecast suggests that 55% of energy storage build by 2030 will be to provide energy shifting. Co-located renewable-plus-storage projects, solar+storage in particular, are becoming commonplace globally.
Customer-sited batteries, both residential and commercial and industrial ones, will also grow at a steady pace, BNEF said. Germany and Japan are currently leading markets, with sizeable markets in Australia and California.
BNEF said it expects energy storage located at homes and businesses to make up about one quarter of global storage installations by 2030. The desire of electricity consumers to use more self-generated solar power and appetite for back-up power are major drivers.
Other applications, such as using energy storage to defer grid investment, may remain marginal in most markets to 2030. Build could pick up, the outlook said, if regulatory barriers are removed and incentives are aligned for network owners to consider storage as an alternative to traditional infrastructure investment.
Battery chemistries
Rapidly evolving battery technology is driving the energy storage market. The report found that the industry is adopting multiple lithium-ion battery chemistries. It said that in 2021, lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) will be used more than nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistries for stationary storage for the first time.
LFP is poised to become the major lithium-ion battery chemistry choice in the energy storage sector until at least 2030, driven by its dominant role in China and increasing penetration in the rest of the world. BNEF also updated its technology outlook to include sodium-ion batteries, a lithium-ion battery contender, which it said could play a “meaningful role” by 2030.
Besides batteries, many non-battery technologies are under development, such as compressed air and thermal energy storage. The report said that many of these can provide longer dispatch duration compared to batteries, looking to supply during prolonged periods of low renewable energy generation in future net-zero power systems.
However, BNEF said it expects batteries to dominate the market at least until the 2030s, in large part due to their price competitiveness, established supply chain, and track record. If new technologies successfully outcompete lithium-ion, then total uptake may well be larger.
