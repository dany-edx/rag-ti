The company is working on increased temperature and pressure within fuel cell stacks. “Increased temperature and pressure allows for air cooling, reduces cooling drag, simplifies the system, and ultimately enables much more demanding applications.” According to ZeroAvia, this next generation of fuel cells could also be sufficient to enable electric propulsion systems for aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.
Universal Hydrogen, Sojitz Corporation, Mitsubishi HC Capital, and an undisclosed third Japanese partner teamed up to build a hydrogen infrastructure solution for aviation in Japan. The companies will collectively identify, evaluate, and qualify local hydrogen suppliers and partners for hydrogen production, module filling and delivery, and more. “Component manufacturers and suppliers will also be liaised with via this partnership, alongside Japanese government agencies and potential customers,” the companies said.
First Hydrogen, together with Ballard Power, launched the test drive of its first-generation zero-emission light commercial vehicle (LCV) in Basildon, United Kingdom. The two Generation I vehicles use a combination of Ballard’s LCS fuel cell stack and First Hydrogen’s proprietary technology. “One of the UK’s largest fleet operators will start the test drive process imminently. A total of 15 major fleet operators have registered to participate as part of the UK Aggregated Hydrogen Freight Consortium,” said the Canadian company. The aim of the test is to compare different technologies in a range of sectors, including grocery, express delivery, utilities, and roadside assistance. 
Thyssenkrupp nucera and Unigel have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to increase the capacity of the green hydrogen plant that Unigel is developing in Bahia, Brazil, from 60 MW to 240 MW. Unigel's facility will be the first industrial-scale green hydrogen plant in Brazil. It is planned to be delivered at the end of the year. In the first phase, the plant will have a production capacity of 10,000 tons/year of green hydrogen and 60,000 tons/year of green ammonia. The MoU was signed by a German industrial engineering conglomerate and Brazil’s largest producer of nitrogen fertilizers during the visit of the German Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck.
Orlen Group launched Czech Republic’s first hydrogen refueling station in Prague. The group plans to establish a total of 28 stations in the Czech Republic by 2030, and another 72 between Poland and Slovakia. “The station features two dispensers that come equipped with specially designed gun noses that offer a pressure of 700 bar for cars and 350 bar for larger vehicles,” said the Polish fossil fuels company. The next two stations will be opened in Poland this year.
East Coast Hydrogen (ECH2) has awarded Worley the contract to deliver the pre-FEED (Front End Engineering Design) and technical survey for the East Coast Hydrogen Pipeline (ECHP) project, which will connect 10 GW of hydrogen production from Humber and Teesside industrial hubs to the gas network.

In August 2022, Ocean Sun commenced legal proceedings in Norway against Inseanergy, claiming the latter’s floating solar solution infringed upon its patent rights. Inseanergy disputed the infringement claim and filed a counterclaim to revoke Ocean Sun's patent. In addition, Inseanergy filed in a notice of opposition to the European Patent Office against the validity of Ocean Sun's European Patent.
The lawsuit was scheduled to be heard by Oslo District Court from March 13 to March 16. However, according to a statement from Ocean Sun, “the parties have now reached a settlement agreement, following which the parties have entered into a license agreement on commercial terms.”
The agreement reportedly concerns the patent in dispute as well as other related patents and patent applications. Ocean Sun said the agreement covers all jurisdictions where the patents are in force or where an application has been submitted.
“Inseanergy thus acknowledges Ocean Sun's patent rights, while the agreement also ensures Inseanergy full freedom to operate,” the statement reads.
Inseanergy reportedly also agreed to withdraw the notice of opposition to the European Patent Office as part of the agreement.
“Ocean Sun and Inseanergy are pleased to have resolved this matter with a positive result for both parties and look forward to continuing their respective efforts to promote floating solar power,” the companies said.
Ocean Sun’s technology has been deployed in various floating solar projects, including Albania’s largest floating solar installation, which has recently been upgraded from 500 kW to 2 MW.
Inseanergy’s portfolio includes two aquaculture projects with a combined capacity of 450 kW, deploying what the company then called its SUB Solar system.

The project is financed by the World Bank, which approved an International Development Association (IDA) credit of $150 million to fund the project back in 2017.
The solar minigrids will electrify 567 public facilities, including secondary schools, health facilities, and administrative offices. They will also power water pumps for 380 boreholes. The project will give access to electricity to approximately 277,000 households, or 1.5 million people.
“Kenya has deployed minigrids to serve communities that are not connected to the main grid,” says Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary Ministry of Energy Davis Chirchir. “Currently, we have about 62 minigrids that are fully operational and 28 which are under construction. We hope to deploy more minigrids to close the energy access gap and ensure universal access to electricity by 2030.”
The locations of the 137 minigrids were published in the official gazette in April 2022. Land acquisition is reportedly ongoing, under the guidance of the National Land Commission.
According to KOSAP, some of the challenges that disrupted the rollout of the projects since funding was due to the high cost of products, the low purchasing power of residents, and companies being apprehensive to work in rural areas.
“While Africa remains the least electrified continent, it also has the biggest potential for solar minigrid deployment,” said Gabriela Elizondo Azuela, manager of the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).
“Solar minigrids can reach populations today that would otherwise wait years to be reached by the grid. They have the potential to transform the power sector in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through World Bank operations and advice to governments, ESMAP is helping take minigrids from a niche to a mainstream solution.”

Mexican solar module manufacturer Solarever has commissioned a new 500 MW solar module production line at its factory in Tecomán, southwestern Mexico.
“The interesting thing about this new production is that it is designed to work with all types of cells that exist on the market,” said Carlos Gutiérrez, deputy director of manufacturing at Solarever. “Our first production line was designed to manufacture modules with cells of 156, 158, and up to 166 millimeters. This second line is designed to work with cells of 166, 182, and up to 210 millimeters. These numbers translated into panels mean moving from an output of up to 470 W to 660 W.”
The company said that the production equipment was provided by unspecified Chinese suppliers, with the factory design being provided by Mexican experts.
Tecomán factory is Solarever's third panel manufacturing plant in Mexico. Solarever has two more factories in Tepei del Río, in the state of Hidalgo, where the company is based, and in Irapuato, in the state of Guanajuato.
The new production equipment has reportedly raised the annual capacity of the manufacturing facility to 1.1 GW.

Japan is estimated to have had a 6.5 GW solar market in 2022, supported by the Ministry of the Environment’s (MoE) feed-in tariff (FIT) and feed-in premium (FIP) programs, which expired at the start of 2022. This capacity is comparable to the volume of solar generation capacity that was deployed in 2021.
With power purchase agreements (PPAs) – for the sale of clean energy to corporate consumers and electricity suppliers – the new approach for renewables developers, the Japanese market is very much in a transition period.
The Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association estimates that the nation shipped 3,536 MW of solar modules from January to September 2022, with 3,520 MW of them shipped to Japanese customers. As the figures do not include Chinese-made imports, it is assumed that installation levels were similar to those recorded in 2021, with imports expected to have dominated the total number of solar panels added in the country.
Japanese companies are stepping up panel recycling and battery reuse, particularly with regards to electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Toyota and power company Jera are developing stationary storage featuring used EV batteries, while Tesla Motors is about to enter Japan’s grid-scale energy storage market.
Solar is expected to supply 14% to 16% of Japan’s energy mix in fiscal year 2030, with a target PV generation capacity of 117.6 GW (AC). Japan introduced its Sixth Strategic Energy Plan and the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures in 2022, with prime minister Fumio Kishida chairing the GX (Green Transformation) Implementation Council. The energy policy emphasis will be on renewables and nuclear with the former to make up 36% to 38% of the power mix in 2030.
Municipalities are setting their own renewables targets, allocating clean energy sites, installing panels on public buildings, and offering subsidies. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) is set to mandate solar on newly built houses from fiscal year 2025 and Kawasaki, in Kanagawa prefecture, plans to follow suit.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI); the MoE; and fellow public body the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization are installing PV demonstration projects. METI is also demonstrating solar-plus-storage for grid balancing purposes.
In 2021, some 50 companies, including electric utilities and virtual power plant operators, demonstrated clean power aggregation as part of three projects. The two government departments are working on net-zero-energy buildings and the MoE’s solar reuse and recycling program includes a demo project to collect residential solar panels in Saitama prefecture, which has the second-largest installed capacity of systems in Japan.
While most PV systems installed in Japan have previously been supported by the FIT program, new business models and services have been launched. A third-party ownership model is being operated by electric utilities, which install residential panels and energy storage systems for no upfront cost. Efforts to promote net-zero-energy housing are also progressing.
Solar arrays are being installed on the roofs of factories and logistics facilities under the PPA business model for commercial customers and public bodies. Solar carports at stores are also gaining a foothold in the nation.
Businesses motivated by environmental, social, and corporate governance policies are driving deployment of off-site, PPA-backed renewables sites, chiefly among members of the international RE100 clean energy initiative.
As in other major markets, conventional energy companies are making large scale investments in clean energy. Power prices have risen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and nonprofit industry body the Japan Electric Power Information Center reports the average, pre-surcharge electricity FIT has risen from JPY 15.80 ($0.12)/kWh in January 2021 to JPY 24.19/kWh in October 2022. Solar is a popular solution for companies seeking to avoid further price rises and volatility, whether consumed on-site or procured via corporate PPA.
With PPA-backed solar sites on the rise, new business models are also emerging between the clean energy developers – including engineering, procurement, and construction services providers – who used to bank FITs, and the power utilities and electricity trading companies. As the backlog of FIT-backed renewables plants winds down, developers are looking for new ways to operate.
METI is set to launch a new FIT and FIP program to bolster the deployment of rooftop solar in the new fiscal year. The new prices, which are already applicable, will pay more per kilowatt-hour than ground-mounted projects.

“The desalination system operates by using a saltwater flow battery cycle, which involves the movement of ions between two electrodes to store or discharge electricity without a membrane, which is typical with Vanadium or Bromine flow batteries,” Salgenx’s CEO Greg Giese told pv magazine. “In this case, the process is used to remove salt from brine or seawater. The system can use a renewable energy source, such as solar power or a large wind turbine, to charge the battery, making it both environmentally friendly and cost-effective.”
The new desalination system is currently being developed in a lab setting and will be trialed in a real-world environment for both stationary and marine vessel applications, according to Giese.
The technology can purportedly be used by cruise and cargo ships, as well as advanced base military operations, where desalination is a better response than transporting in freshwater, or using expensive reverse osmosis systems, according to Giese.
“This is a game-changer for the desalination industry,” said Giese. “Our system provides a sustainable and cost-effective way of producing fresh water from seawater, which is essential in areas where water scarcity is a major issue. We are excited to be at the forefront of this technology and look forward to working with partners to bring this solution to communities around the world.”
The battery manufacturer said its saltwater redox flow battery has an energy density of 125.7 Wh/L. The company claims material costs of $5/kWh, $257kWh for system infrastructure, and a total system cost of $500,000, or $166/kW for the 3,000 kWh battery.

“Our swelling process is not violent and controllable,” said Wang Dong, the research's lead author. “It doesn't break the solar cells and ensures high-efficiency recycling rate of the cells and precious metals. Furthermore, it has a very low toxicity and the swelling agent can be recycled.”
In the paper “Recycling of solar cells from photovoltaic modules via an environmentally friendly and controllable swelling process by using dibasic ester,” published in Clean Technologies and Environmental Policies, the scientists explained that the process uses a dibasic ester (DBE), which is an ester of a dicarboxylic acid commonly used as lubricant, spin finish, and additive.
“DBE is a promising green solvent widely used in the coating industry that is a mixed ester composed of dimethyl succinate, dimethyl glutarate, and dimethyl adipate,” they said. “In addition, DBE has a boiling range of 196 C to 225 C and can dissolve most resins.”
The DBE is claimed to penetrate into the glass-EVA gap effectively while preventing moisture in the air from entering the separation system to hydrolyze DBE. In the next step, an ultrasonic field is used to promote the separation of glass-EVA.
“Then the separation system can be filtered to obtain a glass and (solar cell + EVA) composite. Finally, the mixture is sieved to obtain (solar cell + EVA), and the EVA can be eliminated by pyrolysis to sufficiently recover the solar cells,” the researchers continued. “In contrast to the direct thermal process, no fluoride is released during the EVA pyrolysis due to the prior removal of the backsheet.”
The group tested the novel technique on a Jinko 535 W solar module measuring 1,956 mm × 992 mm and weighing 22.5 kg, with the junction box and aluminum frame being removed in advance. It performed the glass-EVA separation in a glass reactor at a bottom diameter of 120 mm × 12.5 mm and a height of 195 mm × 20 mm.
Through these measurements, the scientists found that the low swelling of DBE resulted in fewer cracks compared to a swelling process based on commonly used O-dichlorobenzene. They also noted that the price of O-dichlorobenzene is between CNY 16,000 ($2.316) and CNY 18,000 per ton, while the cost of DBE is lower at between CNY 9,500 and CNY 10,600 per ton.
“In conclusion, using DBE to separate glass-EVA can keep the relative integrity of EVA to make resource recovery more manageable, and using DBE as a separation reagent has the advantages of low cost and green environmental protection,” Dong emphasized. “The detailed cost accounting, however, will be finalized this year after the scale-up test.”

“Through our work we want to define a simplified approach to produce 2T perovskite-silicon tandem solar products,” TNO Researcher Gianluca Coletti told pv magazine. “The monolithic tandem cell technology we are developing utilizes commercial PERC crystalline silicon cells with planar front side, which avoids complexity in dealing with silicon surface texture.”
The module will have a bifacial design and glass-glass encapsulation, which the consortium said is ideal for protecting the perovskite cells against moisture. The new product may have a power output of over 300 W/m2, which compares to around 200 W/m2 in conventional PERC panels.
The consortium, which also comprises South Korea-based solar panel manufacturer Qcells, initially intends to develop best practices for the production of the proposed module technology. “We want to develop tandem modules with a competitive levelized cost of energy and industry-leading reliability and performance,” said Jorg Muller, head of cell R&D at Qcells. “Qcells will supply its silicon cell expertise to the project, with our Benelux team overseeing field-testing to measure real world energy performance and yield.”
Other members of the consortium are Dutch production equipment manufacturer Levitech NL, Netherlands-based PV equipment production provider MIT Thermal Solutions NL, machine manufacturer Tempress, and Dutch supplier of extrudable tie-layer resins Yparex NL.
The TNO is currently developing a four-junction (4T) semi-transparent perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell in partnership with the Solliance consortium including the Delft University of Technology, the Eindhoven University of Technology, and Belgian research institute Imec. This device achieved in September a 30.1% power conversion efficiency.
Q Cells and German research institute Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) announced in March they achieved an efficiency of 28.7% for a two-terminal perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.
The device is based on a silicon bottom cell relying on Hanwha Q Cells' monocrystalline Q.antum half-cell technology and a perovskite-based top cell.

Agrivoltaics, the combination of farming practices with energy produced by solar photovoltaics (PV), is forecast to become a $9.3 billion marketplace by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1% in that timeframe from $3.6 billion a year ago, according to a research note by India-based market research company Allied Analytics.
Experts believe agrivoltaics can minimize barriers to food security and the transition to clean energy, Allied Analytics said. While the agrivoltaics market is still in the growth stages, it is expected to grow as the solar market continues to boom, owing to demand for clean energy and sustainability.
The agrivoltaics sub-sector market has seen progress as the industry learning curve grows around best use cases in recent years, with the global installed output of agrivoltaics rising from 5 MW in 2012 to around 2.9 GW in 2020, according to Allied Analytics.
To promote a healthy growth environment, subsidies from governing authorities will be required. The implementation of agrivoltaic solutions will require joint ventures, lease agreements, reduced loan rates, and risk exposures, said the market research note. In addition, since there is a significant reduction in crop yield, regulations regarding solar installations need to be enforced for minimizing land exploitation.
Based on climate change and increasing drought and extreme weather events, agrivoltaics offers key advantages such as zero-emission solar power coupled with food production and the protection of crops from drought and damage caused by hail or heavy rain.
To date, the world’s largest agrivoltaics installation has been built on the edge of the Gobi Desert in China, where berries are cultivated underneath solar modules, with total output of 700 MW, set to increase to 1 GW.
According to Allied Analytics, major agrivoltaic market developers include BayWa, Insolight SA, JA Solar, Enel Green Power, Sunseed APV, Mirai Solar, Namaste Solar, Ombrea, Sun’Agri and Next2Sun.

Alamo 2 began operating in March 2014, and was originally built with a complex tracker system that moved by way of hydraulic pumps.  As mechanical failures become a steady occurrence at both its Alamo 1 and Alamo 2 plants, it was time to upgrade. OCI Solar Power, a utility-scale solar developer based in Texas, United States, served as the EPC to upgrade its 4.4 MW (AC) Alamo 2 solar farm.
The company reached out to Array Technologies, and with some brainstorming, they came up with a plan to remove the old tracker, which was a combination of single- and dual-axis trackers, and replace it with a state-of-the-art system. In 2019 they finished upgrading the 39.2 MW (AC) Alamo 1 plant, and the trick to completing it while keeping the plant energized was to swap out the tracker in sections.
Because they were only upgrading the tracker system and keeping the solar panels and electrical balance of system (EBOS), Sabah Bayatli, VP of project development, EPC and Operations, told pv magazine that they first removed the panels and EBOS from just one section and stored them until the old tracker was replaced with the new system. Then the panels and EBOS were remounted, and the team moved on to the next section. Working on one section at a time enabled OCI to keep the plant partially energized so that it could continue providing power to CPS Energy, the nation’s largest public power, natural gas, and electric company.
OCI Solar Power is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, and develops, constructs, finances, owns, and operates solar PV facilities, specializing in utility and distributed generation solar projects. The company reports that it developed, designed, procured, and constructed 500 MW in Texas, all of which are operating in the ERCOT market. In 2016 the company completed the 106 MW (AC) Texas Solar 7 project, the seventh project in the deal that jump-started large-scale solar in Texas.
