“Through surveys and customer feedback, we found that, due to long-term power outages, users have higher requirements for battery capacity to cope with the predicament of unstable power supply or even being unable to connect to the grid,” the company said in a statement. “In order to meet the needs of these customers, MeritSun launched the Powerwall 15KWH lithium battery.”
The battery measures 600 mm x 1100 mm x 230 mm and weighs 165 kg. The device has a storage capacity of 15 kWh, a rated capacity of 300 Ah, and a voltage of 48 V. It also features a depth-of-discharge (DoD) of 95% and can purportedly operate for more than 8,000 cycles. The lithium-ion system uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has an ambient operating temperature range of -15 C to 55 C.
The Guangzhou-based manufacturer offers a 12-year warranty and says the storage system can be stacked in series to reach larger capacities. The battery also features a patented built-in battery management system.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/07/hydraulic-robotic-cleaning-solutions-for-ground-mounted-solar-plants/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,FRANCE,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",Hydraulic robotic cleaning solutions for ground-mounted solar plants,"AX Solar Robot, a French PV cleaning specialist, is offering two new hydraulic-powered solutions for ground-mounted solar installations.
“The technology behind them is 100% mechanical and hydraulic. You have to pressurize the water with a pump, which allows our customers to stay in operation all day long without interchanging the batteries, as you have to do with the other robotic solutions offered on the market,” Grégoire Demeestere, responsible for development at AX Solar Robot, told pv magazine. “Because it is a 100% mechanical solution, the maintenance and support are clearly facilitated.”
The WetSlider, which was first launched at Intersolar Europe in October 2021, is a 1P tracker dedicated cleaner. With a tilt capacity of +/- 50 degrees, the company claims there is no need to interrupt the tracking during cleaning. Its traction wheels can be manually adjusted to the exact dimension of the solar modules’ frames, fitting modules with total height from 1.570 mm to 2,130 mm.
The robot measures 2,610 mm x 725 mm x 335 mm for a 2150 mm brush, and weighs in at 51 kg. Its hydraulic motor works at a minimum 60 bar pressure and consumes 0.25 liters of water per square meter at a standard cleaning speed of 18.85 meters per minute.
“An efficient cleaning can be provided on rows up to 450 m length, and with two robots working in parallel on the same pump,” the company said. “This represents a cleaning capacity of up to 3 MW per day, with no battery limitation, allowing around-the-clock operations.”
The WetSlider XL completes the offering range of the company, as it allows for the cleaning of tables with lengths of up to 6.5 meters. Its patent-pending architecture brings a vertical translation capability for the brush system along the tables. The product will be available in the market by the end of 2022, according to the company.
“This solution brings more flexibility thanks to a unique double adaptation,” said Demeestere. “You can adapt the robot to the size of the panel, and you can adapt a second sliding frame to the size of the table. So, one single tool can be used to serve multiple PV operations with the same brush size, while avoiding terrain degradation and simplifying he logistics considerations compared to vehicle-mounted systems.”
Both versions of the robot are manufactured by the company in Lille, France, and are distributed throughout the world. AX Solar Robot is also the sole distributor in France of the new hyCLEANER solarROBOT, which was developed by Germany's TG hyLIFT. The battery-powered modular cleaning solution comes with an auto-drive function and a steering assist system. It is suitable for rooftop, carport, ground mounted, and floating installations.
The robot measures 575 mm x 685 mm x 270 mm. It can be used on slopes of 0 degrees to 45 degrees. The solution has a cleaning capacity of 1.100 square meters per hour to 2.400 square meters per hour, and is powered by a 36 V ion battery, to a maximum of 42 V.

The increase in the share of solar was due to three factors: a higher number of PV installations that went online during the year, falling electricity demand, and an exceptional number of sunny hours. According to Energieopwek.nl, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) registered 289 sunny hours in August, which compares to an average of 205. August was the second-sunniest month in recorded history. 

Solar was the second-largest electricity source in August after the “conventional sources” category, which covered 51.9% of demand. The third-largest source was biomass with a 12.3% share, followed by onshore wind with 5.6%, and offshore wind with 4.5%. Hydropower had a minimal share of just 0.1%.
Lumped together, renewables achieved a share of 48%, which compares to 42% in August 2021. The country's Climate Agreement (Klimaatakkoord) aims for 70% by 2030.
The Netherlands reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 14.3 GW at the end of 2021, according to the Dutch Central Agency for Statistics. A recent report from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) stated that the country could reach up to 132 GW of PV by 2050.

“All key manufacturing stages of solar panels such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules are predominantly based in Asia, with an 80% share for China alone,” the joint statement reads. “For the European energy transition strategy to take place, bolstered reshoring is required – particularly as solar remains the fastest growing renewable energy source. Norwegian Crystals produces ingots at its Glomfjord headquarters, with a carbon footprint that is one–third of those manufactured in Asia, due to their proximity to renewable energy sources for production and reduced logistics related emissions.”
Norwegian Crystals said it secured all relevant permits for the new manufacturing facility and noted that construction should begin by the end of this year. The factory should have an initial capacity of 3.6 GW by 2026 and is expected to reach 6 GW at a later stage.
In 2022, the company introduced gallium–doped p–type ingots in response to customer demand. It said it tested N–type in anticipation of future market developments.

The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 is law, and with it is the expectation of a new era of unprecedented growth in the solar industry. Inside the massive energy, climate, and tax bill is $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is focused on supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience. The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on ultra-wealthy Americans and corporations. 
The IRA mandates a reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030. The bill is “long overdue and a necessary step to ensure the United States takes decisive action on the climate crisis that helps our economy and provides leadership for the world by example,” said former Vice President Al Gore. 
One of the most significant provisions in the IRA was something the industry had been calling for all year: a long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit. The bill mandates a 10-year extension of the tax credit at 30% of the cost of the installed equipment, which will then step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. The 30% credit will be retroactively applied to anyone who installed their system since the beginning of 2022. 
Informational site SolarReviews, home of the residential Solar Calculator, surveyed more than 3,000 installer partners about the impact on their businesses following the passage of the IRA, and 95% of respondents said they anticipate their companies to grow now that the historic package is law. 
Residential solar installation companies alone are likely to add an additional 340,400 workers over the next five years, said SolarReviews. This is an estimated 148% increase among installation companies alone in just five years. 
The IRA may also be accelerating at-home electric vehicle (EV) charging goals. About 86% of respondents said they already offer EV charging solutions, and after the passage of the IRA, 46% of respondents who do not currently offer EV charging now plan to in the future. 
More than 95% of the respondents said the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit was the most beneficial part of the bill to their business. This was followed by the energy storage tax credit and EV tax credits as the biggest boon to installers. 
When asked to select the biggest challenges facing their business today, 58% said acquiring new customers was a key challenge. This was followed by hiring installation labor (40%), acquiring stock (28%), cashflow issues (21%), and hiring a salesforce (11%).
Mary Powell, the CEO of Sunrun, issued a statement on the passage of the IRA:
“What an historic moment for our country. Sunrun applauds everyone in Congress and the Biden Administration who helped accomplish this major step forward for humanity. The Inflation Reduction Act will combat inflation, lower energy prices and help our country meet its climate goals. It will boost US manufacturing, create millions of good-paying jobs, expand access and equity for those who need it most, and improve grid stability and resilience. The need for families to take control of their energy and for broader US energy independence has never been clearer. All of us at Sunrun are focused on scaling as fast as humanly possible to provide customers with a more affordable, clean and resilient way to power their homes and lives.”

They cover a total surface area of more than 100 square kilometers.
The agency said most of the sites are currently inactive. Only 2% of the region's waste is being brought to such locations.
“These must be analyzed for soil risks and remediated if necessary,” said OVAM. “The space can be reused for nature, recreation, and business. Currently, old landfill sites are ‘re-used' as industrial estates, recreational zones, solar energy parks, or as a forest and nature reserve.”
OVAM has invited all entities that are interested in the further development of such sites to submit project proposals.
The development of ground-mounted PV installations has always been difficult in Flanders, due to strict regulations forbidding solar on agricultural land. To date, only a few small-sized solar parks are operational in the region. And only one giant facility – a 100 MW solar plant built by French energy company Engie in 2019 – is currently providing power to the Belgian grid.
Most of the region's PV capacity is represented by residential and commercial rooftop PV arrays.

Reliance Industries has revealed plans to acquire 79.4% of California-based SenseHawk for $32 million by the end of this year.
SenseHawk develops software-based tools for solar asset management. It accelerates solar projects from planning to production by helping companies to streamline processes and use automation. Reliance Industries, which recorded a net profit of $9 billion in fiscal 2021-22, said the investment will support SenseHawk’s future growth and R&D.
“In collaboration with SenseHawk, we will drive down costs, enhance productivity and improve on-time performance to deliver the lowest [levelized cost of electricity] for solar projects globally, and make solar energy the go-to source of power in lockstep with our vision for solar energy,” said Mukesh D. Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries.
SenseHawk has helped more than 140 customers in 15 countries to adopt new technology at more than 600 sites, with total assets surpassing 100 GW. Its Solar Digital Platform offers end-to-end management of the solar asset lifecycle.  
“This partnership will open new use cases, help our nascent markets, and offer higher value to customers across the solar lifecycle,” said Rahul Sankhe, the president and co-founder of SenseHawk. “We are on a mission to improve the solar energy ecosystem, acquiring 50% of the market by 2025.”
Covington & Burling LLP and Khaitan & Co. are acting as legal advisers on the deal. Deloitte is serving as the accounting and tax adviser to Reliance Industries on the transaction.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/07/pv-driven-rechargeable-control-module-for-cyborg-cockroaches/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",PV-driven rechargeable control module for ‘cyborg cockroaches’,"Researchers from the Cluster for Pioneering Research (CPR) – a unit of Japanese research center Riken – have built a rechargeable control module that is entirely powered by an organic solar cell and a small battery. It can be mounted on real insects to inspect hazardous areas or monitor urban environments.
“The current system doesn't have any geolocation device, but if we include such devices we know where the insects are after the mission and we could remove the modules,” researcher Kenjiro Fukuda told pv magazine. “The modules adhere onto the body with adhesion, so they can be removed physically or if needed with a releasing agent.”
The ultra-soft PV device and the ultra-thin electronics placed on the curved abdomen of the insect, according to the scientists, do not affect the insect’s ability to move and provide for remarkable recharging wireless locomotion control.
“The backpack was designed using a precise 3D model, and 3D printed with an elastic polymer,” they said. “The columnar structure at the bottom matches the curved surface shape.”
The solar cell has a power conversion efficiency of 7.96%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.98 V, a short-circuit current of 28.3 mA, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.564. The solar cell module attached to the 3D-printed curved surface model exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 1.92 V, a short-circuit current of 22.8 mA, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.394.
“The decrease in fill factor is related to the decrease in the shunt resistance because of the increase in the leakage current during the attachment process,” the academics explained, noting that the cell output is more than 50 times larger than the power output of current energy harvesting devices on living insects. “Handlers must be able to control them remotely for long periods of time. This requires wireless control of their leg segments, powered by a tiny rechargeable battery … While it’s possible to build docking stations for recharging the battery, the need to return and recharge could disrupt time-sensitive missions. Therefore, the best solution is to include an onboard solar cell that can continuously ensure that the battery stays charged.”
The wireless control technology should be placed on the insect's leg segments and be powered by a tiny rechargeable lithium-polymer battery.
“The ultra-thin organic solar cell module confirmed the effectiveness of the strategy by charging the battery on living movable insects,” the Japanese group said. “The separated functions of components on both the thorax and abdomen enabled sustained untethered usage of cyborg insects.”
The scientists described the control module in “Integration of body-mounted ultrasoft organic solar cell on cyborg insects with intact mobility,” which was recently published in Flexible Electronics.
“Considering the deformation of the thorax and abdomen during basic locomotion, a hybrid electronic system of rigid and flexible elements in the thorax and ultrasoft devices in the abdomen appears to be an effective design for cyborg cockroaches,” said Fukuda. “Since abdominal deformation is not unique to cockroaches, our strategy can be adapted to other insects like beetles, or perhaps even flying insects like cicadas in the future.”
In 2017, another Riken research group developed an ultra-thin photovoltaics wrapped in stretchable and waterproof films that continues to generate solar electricity even after being soaked in water or being exposed to mechanical stress, such as cleaning in a washing machine. The efficiency of double-side-coated devices decreases only by 5.4% after immersion in water for 120 minutes. Furthermore, the efficiency of the devices remains at 80% of the initial value even after 52% mechanical compression for 20 cycles with 100 minutes of water exposure, according to research findings published in Nature Energy.

Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) has started accepting bids to supply 2.25 GW of round-the-clock (RTC) power from renewable energy projects, complemented with power from other sources or storage. The prospective developers will develop the projects and connect them with the inter-state transmission network (ISTS) on a build-own-operate basis.
SECI will sign 25-year power purchase agreements (PPA) with the successful developers. Power procured by SECI has been provisioned to be sold to MPSEZ Utilities Ltd.
“Already commissioned RE projects cannot be considered under this RfS. RE projects under construction or projects which are not yet commissioned will, however, be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other central or state schemes. Enhancement of, or adding extra capacity to already commissioned projects, irrespective of their capacities, will not be considered as eligible projects,” states the tender document.
The projects can be located anywhere in India. For a single project, the renewable generation components and the energy storage system installed, if any, may either be co-located or located at different locations. The different components of RTC power (solar, wind and any other source or storage) can be connected to the ISTS network at different ISTS substations.
A single developer must bid for a minimum of 250 MW. The maximum capacity allocated to a developer will be up to 2.25 GW.

Local utility DEWA said this week that it had received bids from four international companies seeking the consultancy contract for the sixth phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The project is intended to have 5 GW of solar and concentrating solar power (CSP) capacity upon completion in 2030.
The DEWA announcement, made on the utility's website, did not say whether the next phase of the project would consist of solar panels, CSP, or a mix of the two. No further details of phase six were specified.
The power company said the park has 1,627 MW of installed generation capacity – consisting of the 13 MW first phase, the 200 MW second stage, and the 800 MW third phase, plus sections of the fourth and fifth slices of the project, which are still under development.
On the latter two project sections, DEWA said a further 1,233 MW of generation capacity is on the way, including 700 MW of delayed CSP. That would leave 2,140 MW of generation capacity to be added by 2030, of which 900 MW will form part of phase six.
Those pre-phase six solar capacities would mean the emirate of Dubai would be generating 11.5% of its energy mix from clean power, according to DEWA CEO Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, who added that the percentage is expected to rise to 14% this year.

Greg Clark, a local government secretary, last week asked Essex County Council to take over the financial functions of unitary authority Thurrock, in Essex, after the latter council borrowed more than GBP 1 billion in short-term loans from neighboring authorities – investing the majority of it in solar finance.
In July, the Local Government Chronicle reported that Thurrock had invested GBP 655 million over four years into bonds issued by the now-dissolved Rockfire Investment Finance, and connected companies. The bonds were used to buy solar parks such as the 60.9 MW project near Swindon, England acquired by Rockfire Capital from WeLink Energy in September 2016. Reporting on that sale at the time, pv magazine said the “clean-tech bonds” which had financed the deal had attracted cash from Thurrock and fellow English local councils in Warrington and Newham.
Rockfire Capital founder Liam Kavanagh, a shareholder in the Toucan Group, said in September 2016 that the investments offered 6% returns. In July, the news outlet reported that the bonds Thurrock Council bought were used to buy 53 solar farms and added £12.5 million due to the local authority since February – in interest linked to the investments – had not been paid by that point.
The same media outlet reported in August that London-based Camdor Global Advisors, which specializes in advising councils on investment, had assessed the solar farms as worth up to GBP 200 million – less than the value ascribed to them in connection with sale of the bonds.
“The interest on the council’s investment is paid out of the income generated by the solar farms. The income generated by the solar farms is also a key factor in the ability to repay any bonds,” Kavanagh told the LGC in July. The solar farms, as confirmed by Toucan, continue to perform exceptionally well and the bonds are not due for repayment for another four years.”
The website of London-based Toucan Energy says that the company owns more than 500 MW of renewables assets.
