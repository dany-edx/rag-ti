“The output capacity of these projects, in addition to the projects of Sakaka and Dumat Al-Jandal, will amount to more than 3,600 MW,” he said in a statement, adding that one of the projects – the 600 MW Al Shuaiba PV IP project – will sell power at a world record low price of $0.0104/kWh. The project was selected by the Ministry of Energy in Round 2 of the procurement scheme that is being held under the umbrella of the country's National Renewable Energy Program (NREP).
The 3.6 GW of capacity refers to the cumulative installed power that was assigned through the first two rounds of the scheme, including the Sakaka solar plant, which was connected to the grid in November 2019, and the 1.5 GW Sudair project, which is being developed in direct negotiations with the Saudi authorities.
“More renewable energy projects will follow across the Kingdom, which we will announce when the time comes,” the crown prince stated, without providing further details on the results of Round 2.
The second round of the program initially drew 250 bidders. In July, REPDO said the number of bidders it had narrowed the bidders down to 60 companies, including 28 that were based in Saudi Arabia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/08/nickel-salen-for-a-battery-that-charges-in-10-seconds/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,RUSSIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 8, 2021",Nickel-salen for a battery that charges in 10 seconds,"For researchers, there is no shortage of promising materials for new energy storage applications. Narrowing down this list of possibilities, to find combinations of materials that overcomes problems with today’s battery technologies without creating new ones, is where it gets difficult.
Since 2016, a group of scientists at Russia’s St. Petersburg University has investigated a group of materials known as redox-active nitroxyl-containing polymers. These materials are known to have high energy density and a fast redox potential – bringing the potential for fast-charging batteries. They are held back, however, by low conductivity.
As a way to overcome this, the group set out to synthesize a polymer from a nickel-salen complex, which acts as a molecular wire to which nitroxyl “pendants” are attached. “We came up with the concept of this material in 2016. When studying the charge transport mechanism in this class of compounds, we discovered that there are two key directions of development,” explained Oleg Levin, professor of electrochemistry at St. Petersburg University. “Firstly, these compounds can be used as a protective layer to cover the main conductor cable of the battery, which would be otherwise made of traditional lithium-ion battery materials. And secondly, they can be used as an active component of electrochemical energy storage materials,”
The group first simulated the characteristics of different materials in the group, to understand the best combinations. Then they began to synthesize the compounds, eventually finding one that was stable and efficient enough to work with, and began testing its storage capabilities. Results of this testing are found in the paper The Fast and the Capacious: A [Ni(Salen)]‐TEMPO Redox‐Conducting Polymer for Organic Batteries, published in Batteries and Supercaps.
“NiSalen simultaneously serves as a charge collector for nitroxyl pendants and supports the redox capacity of the material,” states the group in the paper. “This novel polymer exhibits a specific capacity of up to 91.5 mAh g−1, retaining 87 % of its theoretical capacity at 800 C and more than 30 % at as high as 3000 C (66 % capacity retention after 2000 cycles).”
Levin further notes that batteries incorporating the polymer can charge up to ten times faster than today’s lithium-ion batteries, and overcome many more of the problems with this technology. The next step for the researchers is to work on improving the capacity, which they estimate is currently 30 to 40% below commercial lithium-ion.
“The new battery is capable of operating at low temperatures and will be an excellent option where fast charging is crucial. It is safe to use – there is nothing that may pose a combustion hazard, unlike the cobalt-based batteries that are widespread today,” states Levin. “It also contains significantly less metals that can cause environmental harm. Nickel is present in our polymer in a small amount, but there is much less of it than in lithium-ion batteries.”

In addition, the consumer electronics industry is starting to show warning signs across smartphones, TVs, and laptops.
However, in a sign of supply chain strength, the solar and energy storage market, which requires chipsets for smart componentry, is not currently facing stresses, notes IHS Markit, in a response to written questions from pv magazine.
Major chip fabs, including TSMC, Samsung Foundry, UMC and GlobalFoundries, are currently unable to satisfy demand, with one JP Morgan analyst suggesting shipping is between 10% to 30% below current demand levels.
While the most significant shortages are on the highest-spec, 5nm and 7nm process chipsets used in new gaming consoles, smartphones, and graphics cards, the effects are being felt at all chip process fabrication levels. And with no respite predicted until late 2021, the supply issue may not be resolved soon.
Still, Cormac Gilligan, an associate director at IHS Markit, explained that while the semiconductor chip shortage is currently a global challenge for all industries, solar and energy storage manufacturers are less affected.
“In general, the solar and energy storage industries have learned lessons from being impacted by semiconductor components, for example, transistors, capacitors [and] resistors in prior years, which are key to manufacturing power electronics, including power conversion components such as solar inverters and energy storage inverters,” said Gilligan.
“In recent quarters, PV inverter and PCS [power conversion system] companies have retained high inventory levels of certain critical components and are in constant dialogue with component suppliers to give visibility into future demand.”
With many players, such as Huawei, also active in the wider electronics industry, chip supply chains are closely monitored for changes in lead times, or supply and demand shifts. And unlike the automotive industry, which experienced severe stop-start demand during the earliest phases of the Covid-19 pandemic, IHS Markit noted that the global solar and energy storage market still managed growth in 2020, noting suppliers remained in close contact with supply chains.
“These actions have negated the impact of these challenges in procurement and delivery lead times,” said Gilligan. “IHS Markit has not noted any significant impact on the production of finished components such as solar and energy storage inverters at present.”

With business news service Bloomberg having reported 39 defaults related to almost $30 billion of bonds in 2020, Solargiga wrote, in its annual report a week ago: “The default in the domestic bond market has caused the credit ratings of some large scale state-owned enterprises … to be downgraded, and the overall market credit risk has increased compared to previous years.”
The solar ingot, wafer and module manufacturer–which has written off RMB68.6 million ($10.5 million) after shuttering its aging cell lines last year–presented an annual update which amounted to a huge ‘what if?'
The board said a string of “not reasonably forseeable” events in 2020 were the only reason it had posted an annual loss of RMB216 million, and pointed to significant production tech advances and rising shipment levels and revenue.
Solargiga raised its annual module production capacity to 3.7 GW with the opening of a new, rented, fab in Yancheng, Jiangsu province on April 1. The company pointed to advances including machinery which reduces the closing time of silicon ingots 70%; an ingot growth rate which rose from 1.25mm/min to 2mm/min thanks to better water cooling; and a long life crucible developed with partners which can draw nine ingots from a single pot.
The 3.45 GW-annual-capacity ingot division of the business posted a 2020 profit of RMB64.4 million, following a RMB325 million ($49.6 million) loss a year earlier, but that upstream operation was the only part of Solargiga which turned a profit in 2020. With cell production wound down to a RMB85.9 million deficit, the module division shed RMB166 million, the losses widening from a RMB21.4 million ($3.27 million) hit in 2019. The less important solar project arm at least narrowed its losses, from the RMB11.9 million posted in 2019 to RMB9.31 million last year.
If the company might be justified in complaining about polysilicon shortages and price rises caused by flooding and factory explosions among suppliers, citing the closure of its small scale, inefficient cell operation as one of those “not reasonably forseeable” events appears to be stretching credibility, as previously highlighted by pv magazine. The same could be said for the gripe about rising shipping and other sales costs “as a result of the outbreak of Covid-19,” given China was already witnessing the epidemic in late 2019. Whatever the reason, that cost-of-sales hit rose from RMB84.6 million to RMB136 million.
If the explanation for the disappointing result–on the back of a 37% rise in revenue to RMB6.05 billion and 65% rise in total shipments to 6,811 MW–is less than convincing, there is little arguing with Solargiga's plans to expand production capacity.
The company said it intends to more than double ingot capacity to 8.55 GW this year, and a thumping 20.05 GW next year in a move explained by the board's belief the “oligopoly market trend” in the ingot business “will continue.”
Module capacity is slated to rise to 8.86 GW this year and 14.46 GW next year and wafer output is also set to balloon, from the current 2.5 GW to 4.6 GW this year and 14.6 GW in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/08/work-begins-on-green-hydrogen-storage-cavern-in-sweden/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 8, 2021",Work begins on green hydrogen storage cavern in Sweden,"Vattenfall, Sweden-based steel company SSAB, and Swedish state-owned miner LKAB have started building a rock cavern storage facility for green hydrogen near Luleå, in northern Sweden.
The three companies will jointly invest SEK 250 million ($29 million) in the project, which has the support of the Swedish Energy Agency. The 100-cubic-meter “Hybrit” facility will be built approximately 30 meters below ground. It is expected to begin operations in 2022 and will reach full capacity in 2024.
The cavern is being built via the so-called lined rock cavern (LRC) approach, which involves covering the walls of the cavern with a selected material as a sealing layer.
“LKAB will need to become Sweden's and perhaps Europe’s biggest hydrogen producer in the future, and this pilot project provides additional valuable knowledge for the continued work in creating the world’s first fossil-free value chain for the iron and steel industry,” said Lars Ydreskog, director of strategic projects at LKAB.
A recent study by the Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-3) showed that salt caverns offer a flexible, efficient option for hydrogen storage. The research group estimates that Europe has the technical potential to store 84.8 PWh of hydrogen in bedded salt deposits and salt domes.
The IEK-3 researchers said the proximity of the caverns to the coast will be helpful, as brine disposal remains economical up to 50 km from sea.

However, the use of p-type wafers could make it easier to integrate the production of these cells into existing PERC cell lines without having to introduce too many changes into current production processes.
With this in mind, researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have sought to improve the production process for high‐efficiency p‐type TOPCon cells. They have identified the best metallization pastes to help reduce contact resistivity and contact recombination by developing a process sequence for the fabrication of such cells.
The scientists started by testing a group of 11 silver (Ag) or silver-aluminum (Ag/Al) metallization pastes. After identifying the most suitable ones, they integrated them into the production process.
“Overall, we observe that for effective contacting, mainly dedicated TOPCon pastes should be used, and some of the pastes which are being promoted for n‐doped TOPCon layers also work quite well for p‐doped TOPCon layers,” the academics explained.
The manufacturing process includes the formation of the p‐type rear contacts through low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of an in-situ boron-doped polysilicon layer. The process sequence further includes high-temperature annealing and the application of a silicon nitride (SiNx) layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) onto both sides of the cell. They said that a 0.2% increase in efficiency via the implementation of a sacrificial SiNx layer for hydrogenation purposes can result in better surface passivation quality of the passivating contact structure.
“Currently, the extra hydrogenation step does indeed add additional cost as another PECVD tool has to be used for depositing the rear silicon nitride (SiNx) layer twice,” researcher Sebastian Mack told pv magazine. “We have not put any effort at all into getting the initial SiNx layer on the rear side high temperature stable, so achieving this would allow for keeping that layer in place and thus lowering cost.”
For the solar cell, the German group used boron‐doped Cz−Si wafers with M2 size.
“We have shown that the best overall results have been achieved for a polysilicon layer thickness of 240 nm,” they said, adding that they achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.2% under this configuration.
Despite the remarkable efficiency, Mack believes there is much room for improvement.
“Currently, recombination is very much dominated by recombination on the front side and here our process falls somewhat short, and we did not implement a selective emitter here nor apply our best process for front side passivation, which we developed after the experiment,” he said. “In addition, we recently developed a method to reduce the series resistance notably, which by itself should boost efficiency by at least 0.3%.”
Mack said that manufacturer Tempress supplied the polysilicon layers. At the time of the study, there was no way to adapt the polysilicon layer to the requirements of the process sequence.
“And last but not least, the results were from late 2019, but until now, I had no time to write the paper,” he concluded.
The researchers presented their findings in “Progress in p‐type Tunnel Oxide‐Passivated Contact Solar Cells with Screen‐Printed Contacts,” which was recently published in Solar RRL.

French renewable energy company Qair has started construction on two solar plants with a combined capacity of 30 MW in Chad.
Qair had secured the 20-year PPAs for the two projects from the country's utility, Société Nationale d’Électricité (SNE), in September.
The company plans to invest around €30 million in the two projects, which are planned to be grid-connected in 2022.
The plants will be deployed at two sites, of 40ha and 100ha, to the north and southeast, respectively, of N’Djamena, in the districts of Lamadji and Gassi.
The construction of these two power plants meets the government's sustainable development goals (SDGs) aimed at significantly increasing the share of renewable energies in the Chadian energy mix and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 18.2% by 2030, compared to a 2010 baseline.
“We are part of a desire for partnership and support for the government's energy policy and will do everything possible to actively involve local communities in the development of our projects,” said Marc Galinier, director of sub-Saharan Africa activities at Qair group. “The environmental impact is an essential factor for us and we seek first to integrate and work with the inhabitants of Gassi and Lamadji.”

EDF Renouvelables, the renewable energy arm of French power utility EDF, will supply SNCF Energie, a unit of SNCF Voyageurs that is itself part of French railway operator SNCF, with the electricity produced by a 20 MW photovoltaic plant located in the municipalities of Lachapelle-Auzac and Souillac, in the Lot department, under a 20-year power purchase agreement.
Construction of the solar power plant will begin this year, with commissioning scheduled for 2023, specified a joint statement from the two companies.
The plant's annual production is expected to amount to 25 GWh, which corresponds to about half of the electricity consumption required for the movement of TGVs between Paris and Lille each year, EDF said.
SNCF Voyageurs said the project is in line with its ambition to reach 40% to 50% of renewable energy in its mix of electricity consumption for train traction by 2025. To achieve this, SNCF Energie is engaged in negotiations with various developers and producers of renewable energy. The objective is to develop PPAs covering up to 20% of electricity consumption for train traction.
EDF said the 20 MW solar plant will contribute to its solar plan, which aims to make the group one of the solar leaders in France, with a target of 30% market share by 2035. “We are very happy to sign, with the SNCF group, our first corporate PPA in France for a new asset,” the company's CEO, Jean-Bernard Lévy, said. “This success once again demonstrates our ability to offer competitive and innovative solutions to our customers in terms of [the] energy transition.” The project is in line with the CAP 2030 strategy, which aims to more than double the renewable capacity of the EDF group, from 28 GW to 60 GW, between 2015 and 2030.
“This signature by SNCF Energie is part of the desire of the entire SNCF group and the railway workers to make the train the ultimate sustainable mobility solution,” Jean-Pierre Farandou, CEO of the SNCF group stated. “We are proud to contribute, through this contract signed with the EDF group, to the creation of additional solar photovoltaic capacities in France, which will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in France and in Europe.”

The AU$200 million (US$153 million), 48-storey, mixed-use building in Melbourne’s CBD is due to be completed later this month but already Beulah is claiming the 42 kW solar PV system installed on the tower’s core walls is the largest and most efficient vertical solar facility in Australia, declaring it will outperform buildings with similar vertical solar power plants.
The installation comprises 128 Trina Solar HoneyBlack DD06M.05(II) 325 W modules. The modules have been installed on the core walls of the tower and cover 158m².
Melbourne-based essential services provider b.energy was responsible for the design and construction and operations and maintenance of the system and opted for what is labelled a ‘verticality renewables strategy,’ as a way to overcome limited space on the roof of the tower
B.Energy chairman James Dunstan said the 42kW system outperforms similar developments in terms of emission reduction, cost reduction and green energy sustainability.
“The combination of a painted lift core and stylish HoneyBlack modules has not only markedly complemented the building design aesthetics but will assist in reducing common property electricity costs,” he said.
“Whilst electricity production would generally be closer to circa 56 MWh [per year] for flat or degree-mounted systems, generating circa 30 MWh far exceeds the renewables that could otherwise be achieved on the constrained rooftop.”
While b.energy has used traditional modules for the Paragon install, the project adds weight to a report released by the Australian PV Institute (APVI) which declared the business case for building-integrated PV (BIPV) is stronger than ever, identifying it as one of five key avenues for increased market penetration of PV.
BIPV is yet to enjoy the same widespread deployment as roof-mounted solar modules that adorn more than 2.56 million homes across Australia, but the APVI believes the versatility of BIPV means it has enormous potential for growth.
The business-case recommendations are detailed in the International Energy Agency (IEA) report on BIPV which was released late last year and which highlights that “building-integrated PV offers huge potential to exploit roofs and facades as a local energy source.”
Beulah executive director Adelene Teh said the inclusion of the solar PV power plant as part of the Paragon project was important in ensuring the company continues its journey towards sustainable developments with reduced carbon footprints.
The company said the utilization of the tower’s vacant space is not only innovative but is also an attractive value-add that differentiates the tower’s embedded renewables offering which, in turn, is an enticing cost-saving to prospective residents and the developer.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/08/hail-insurance-is-about-risk-management-for-pv-developers/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 8, 2021",Hail insurance is about risk management for PV developers,"From pv magazine USA
The destructive potential of hail on solar arrays has only been fully realized in the last two years. In this series, pv magazine talks with experts in storm modeling, risk insurance, and damage mitigation to learn how solar arrays can survive nature’s wrath. Read Part 1 here.
The generally accepted consensus around hail damage mitigation for solar projects is that it’s a recently developed area of focus. Only recently have projects come on-line in hail-prone areas, so when disaster struck at Midway, the industry and adjacent risk management industries were entirely caught off guard.
But after talking to Michael Kolodner, U.S. power and renewables industry practice leader for insurance broker Marsh, that consensus doesn’t tell the full story. To understand what has happened to the solar insurance market since Midway, you have to understand insurance’s role in risk management.
Midway, of course, refers to the 178 MW Midway Solar Project that sprawls across 1,500 acres near Midland, Texas. In May 2019, a monster hailstorm ripped through, damaging or destroying more than 400,000 of the plant’s 685,000 Hanwha Q cell modules. The insurance losses totaled $70 million.
Kolodner said that in Texas and the plains states, big hail events are neither unforeseen nor unexpected. Yet, as new and surprising as Midway was to many in the solar industry, it was equally surprising to many on the underwriting side. This is partially due to underwriting being such a highly specialized and segmented part of the solar sector.
However, for all of the parties that were caught off guard by that May storm, Kolodner also said that there were plenty in the risk and insurance spaces who were well aware of hail’s hazardous nature when it comes to solar. The issue ultimately came down to the maturity of renewable developers when it comes to risk management.
“Insurance often serves as the language for risk management,” said Kolodner, adding that the full spectrum of risk management is much broader.
And then it did come down on Midway.
Two years after the storm, the market has hardened and insuring projects against hail damage has become more expensive but also less of a catch-all solution. In turn, the risk management aspect of project development has been forced to rapidly mature.
Developers looking to build projects in potential problem areas now include risk assessment as part of their pre-construction process. They also are using hardware and engineering techniques that allow them to better mitigate the potential effects of a catastrophic event. One example is trackers that have a safe-stow function to protect panels in the event of hail.
Kolodner said this sort of diligence has paved the way for a healthier and more diverse insurance market, one that is itself more mature and resilient than a few years ago when insurance was seen as a cover-all solution.
“If you’re taking a more mature approach and the market is not naive or underpricing the risk, now you have a broader spectrum of supply that’s available,” said Kolodner.
Underwriters now offer a more diverse  supply of products to support solar energy projects because price points have been adjusted and developers are more sensitive to the risk.
“They’re managing it better and they present a more attractive risk profile” to an insurer, Kolodner said.
The goal, he added, is not to insure as much as possible. Rather, the objective is to assess and mitigate risk enough to allow insurance to cover the perils that will always be present. That means that developers working in hail-prone regions can take a number of steps to decrease how much damage hail can inflict on their project, but they can’t eliminate the risk entirely. And it’s just that enduring sliver of risk where insurance fits in.

This new research also undercuts BloombergNEF’s previous 2030 forecast by 13% and its 2050 forecast by 17%. The key force behind the accelerating cost decline of green hydrogen is the continuously falling cost of solar PV. BloombergNEF forecasts that solar electricity will be 40% cheaper in 2050 than what it thought just two years ago. 
The continuous cost decline on the solar front is being driven by automated manufacturing, less silicon and silver consumption, the higher photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells, and the greater yields provided by bifacial panels. 
BloombergNEF modeled 28 major markets and found that green hydrogen would be cheaper than natural gas (on an energy-equivalent basis) by 2050 in 15 of them. But if those markets were using natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS), then green hydrogen would out-compete gas across the board. 
“Such low renewable hydrogen costs could completely rewrite the energy map,” said Martin Tengler, lead hydrogen analyst at BloombergNEF. “It shows that in future, at least 33% of the world economy could be powered by clean energy for not a cent more than it pays for fossil fuels. But the technology will require continued government support to get there – we are at the high part of the cost curve now, and policy-supported investment is needed to get to the low part.”

BloombergNEF is forecasting that green hydrogen will undercut natural gas, but also blue hydrogen (generated from fossil fuels with CCS), as well as straight gray hydrogen produced from fossil fuels without CCS. 
Tengler said that by 2030, it won't make economic sense to build blue hydrogen production facilities in most countries, unless space constraints are an issue for renewables.
“Companies currently banking on producing hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCS will have at most 10 years before they feel the pinch,” he said. “Eventually those assets will be undercut, like what is happening with coal in the power sector today.”
Of course, that green energy and therefore green hydrogen is getting cheaper is not surprising, but the rate at which costs are declining certainly is.
“Every year it gets cheaper, faster than anyone expects,” said Tengler. “The key driver is falling cost of solar PV electricity. We now think solar PV power will be 40% cheaper by 2050 than what we had thought just two years ago.” 
Reductions in electrolyzer-related costs are the other major contributor to the accelerating price decline of green hydrogen.
