By leveraging borrowing in dollars and euros, the country aims to reduce risks and costs, with export-oriented projects forming a key component of its hydrogen strategy.
In other words, German partners play a crucial role in reducing investment costs and enabling the launch of new projects, while India's domestic market provides the necessary long-term assurances for the sector. Panelists at a conference organized by the Embassy of India in Berlin, Thyssenkrupp, and the World Energy Council highlighted India's position as the third-largest producer of grey hydrogen, following Russia and China, and the world's leading importer of ammonia.
“India has the largest electricity grid,” said Indian Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, adding that the pandemic and a year of war in Europe showed the need to restructure Europe's industries. “But markets need to remain open.”
The two countries will collaborate not only in the financial sector but also in technology, providing significant benefits to various German companies, including major ones.
Thyssenkrupp, with its vertically integrated companies in Germany and India, holds a strategic advantage. The group possesses expertise in demand, supply, and infrastructure, making it well-positioned. In other words, the company requires hydrogen, has the capability to produce it through Nucera, an electrolyzer company, and already operates hydrogen infrastructures via Uhde. The CEO of Uhde said that the company will soon announce a demo plant for hydrogen cracking.
Representatives from Germany's MAN Energy&Solutions and RWE Supply & Trading, along with Indian companies Greenko Group, Avaada Group, and ACME Group, actively participated in the conference. High-profile executives from these companies highlighted the enduring engineering collaboration between Germany and India.
Diversified strategies
Greenko Group, in collaboration with Belgium's John Cockerill, aims to double its OEM electrolyzer production capacity within a few months, according to the company's founder. They express confidence in the Indian market and production capacity.
“We don't need subsidies. In India, the cost of green hydrogen without subsidies is already below $3/kg,” said Greenko Group's founder, Mahesh Kolli.
India and Germany aim to diversify their investments and import/export strategy. Indian hydrogen companies are actively involved in projects in Oman and Egypt. Meanwhile, the German government is developing its hydrogen strategy, focusing on tenders and auctions with various schemes. Currently, Germany sees South America, Australia, Canada, Namibia, and Mauritania as its ideal hydrogen partners.
“India will be part of Germany's hydrogen national strategy. I am quite sure, yes,” said Till Mansmann, innovation commissioner for green hydrogen in the German Ministry of Education.
Trained physicist Mansmann highlighted Germany's prolonged delay in investment decisions, but emphasized that the country's experience with LNG terminals will inform the forthcoming Hydrogen acceleration law.
Panelists emphasized that top officials from the German government actively travel to shape this strategy, suggesting that one should examine the trips of Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck to comprehend the future hydrogen strategy of the country.
“We will import 70% of hydrogen needs in 2030, and the situation will not change till 2045,” said Mansmann.
The conference did not highlight any diverging interests between Germany and India in the hydrogen sector. However, India aims to sell energy carriers and low-carbon products at a premium price, expanding its presence in higher value-added markets, which have historically been a German specialty. Additionally, some participants proposed the idea of large German conglomerates establishing or utilizing subsidiaries in India.

Brazil has surpassed 29 GW of installed solar capacity, with 8,624 MW from centralized generation plants and another 20,580 MW attributed to mini and micro generation plants of up to 5 MW each, according to data from the National Agency of Electric Energy (Aneel). This year alone, at least 1,437 MW of distributed generation and at least 1,153 MW of centralized generation were added.
Residential systems account for more than a third of the current generation capacity, or 10,400 MW, of which 10,123 MW is attributed to systems of a maximum of 80 kW.
In centralized generation, there are more than 104.4 GW of awarded projects still under construction or under development, Aneel reports. Larger projects are expected to support the growth of the free market and supply power for the energy-intensive production of green hydrogen.
As for distributed generation, just for projects with connection requests made up to Jan. 1, there were more than 30 GW as of February. The distributed generation continues to grow, although at a slower pace.
Distribution and transmission networks remain a barrier
Both in centralized and distributed generation, the availability of grid connections remain a barrier to the realization of all projects. The end of discounts on tariffs that remunerate networks was one of the factors that encouraged the rush of orders for solar generation connection in recent years.
The 50% discount on the tariff for the use of the transmission system (TUST) for centralized projects ended for projects that requested the grant after March 2, 2022. Projects that requested grants before that deadline can still receive the discounts provided they start operating within 48 months of Aneel's authorization, which continues to authorize new projects that are entitled to the discount.
In distributed generation, projects that requested connections after Jan. 7, 2023, will gradually pay the tariff for the use of the distribution system, starting at 15% in the case of systems of up to 500 kW and installed at the point of consumption. For larger systems that are of remote self-consumption or shared generation, the tariff will be paid in full for orders placed after Jan. 7.

“The Italian company joins the ranks of the world's top photovoltaic cell manufacturers,” said FuturaSun.
The project involves the construction of a 266,000-square-meter gigafactory.
“The investment will initially amount to €150 million ($163.66 million) and will be carried out in two phases. In a 3-year span, once finalized and operational, the plant will have an annual production capacity of 10 GW of state-of-the-art, high-efficiency N-type solar cells based on TOPCon technology,” said the Italian company.
Production activities at the facility will start in the spring of 2024. The resulting solar cells will become a part of FuturaSun's modules, catering to both its Italian and Chinese gigafactories.
“This is an extraordinary and unprecedented project in which our Italian Group sets the goal of entering an arena that has so far been dominated by Chinese big players,” said Alessandro Barin, the CEO and co-founder of FuturaSun.
The signing ceremony, held this week, was attended by “high-level officials from both China and Italy.” 
For the production of its PV modules, FuturaSun established its first gigafactory in Taizhou in 2020. It is currently developing a second gigafactory in Suzhou, Jiangsu province.
“In recent months, FuturaSun has also been pursuing an ambitious plan for the re-industrialization of the photovoltaic supply chain in Europe, with a project for the establishment of a gigafactory in Cittadella (Italy), where the company's historic European headquarters is located,” said FuturaSun.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/12/fraunhofer-ise-opens-new-outdoor-solar-technology-test-field-in-germany/,"INSURANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE,GERMANY,WESTERN EUROPE",EDGAR MEZA,"MAY 12, 2023",Fraunhofer ISE opens new outdoor solar technology test field in Germany,"At a newly constructed, three-hectare test field in near Freiburg, Germany, researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems are planning to conduct faster and more accurate testing of PV modules, systems and other solar technologies.
Rigorous tests on PV systems, solar thermal collectors and other solar technologies are usually carried out in indoor laboratory environments, with additional long-term testing under real weather conditions lasting several years. Research at the site, which Fraunhofer ISE officially opened on Friday in the Baden-Württemberg municipality of Merdingen, will combine results from both test approaches.
Fraunhofer ISE says PV modules in particular will be able to be evaluated faster and more accurately by combining and comparing indoor laboratory measurement results with those from the test field.
“The new Outdoor Performance Test Field in Merdingen provides us with the needed space to perform outdoor tests on a wide variety of solar technologies with state-of-the-art measurement technology,” said Andreas Bett, institute director at Fraunhofer ISE. “The test results will enable us to gain important knowledge which can be used to further improve module performance and reliability.”
The new location complements Fraunhofer ISE's test fields on Gran Canaria and in the Negev desert in Israel, where researchers test prototypes and innovative products in various climates under extreme temperature fluctuations or exposure to salt air.
Predicting reliability and degradation of PV modules
“We can now compare results from PV modules exposed to maritime, arid and our temperate Central European climate with measurements from our accredited indoor PV Module and Solar Thermal TestLabs,” said Christian Reise, project manager of the Merdingen test field.
By combining simulations based on solar irradiance data, PV modules can be assessed much faster than was previously the case when using a year’s worth of outdoor measurements, Fraunhofer ISE stated.
In the joint research MiMoRisk project, funded by the economy and climate protection ministry, Fraunhofer ISE is developing procedures to minimize module-related yield risks in future PV power plants and to identify early on technological and design-specific degradation risks.
The analyses from the research project assist the PV industry, especially module manufacturers and project planners of large ground-mounted systems, and also provide valuable insights for insurers on risk assessment, said Simone Steinbach, a member of insurance group Munich RE's Green Tech Solutions team.
Investigating PV noise barriers and agrivoltaic systems
Other projects taking place at the test field include the PVwins project, which measures electricity yield and noise protection performance of different types of PV noise barriers erected on the site. This allows planned projects to be tested on a small scale before actual construction begins.
In addition, construction of various height-adjustable agrivoltaic systems will soon be under way for the the VAckerPower project, which will allow researchers to investigate the suitability of elevated agrivoltaic systems and non-elevated, vertical agrivoltaic systems as well as the suitability of different PV modules for arable farming.

The proposed solution is a closed-cycle system with a 600 MW CHP unit and a carbon dioxide energy storage (CCES) facility. It utilizes heat from the heat network backwater and operates through two stages of compression and expansion using water and carbon dioxide as working fluids, without exchanging mass with the external environment.
“During off-peak periods, the s-CO2 released from the low-pressure tank (LPT) is compressed in the compressor driven by the surplus generation capacity of the CHP,” the scientists explained.
The compressed CO2 then goes through an intercooler to store the compression heat in the water exiting the cold-water tank (CWT).
“After the two stages of compression, s-CO2 is stored in the high-pressure tank (HPT), and the cooling water is pressurized by the pump to be stored in the hot-water tank (HWT),” the scientists said. “The cooling water in the improved system absorbs additional heat from the mid-extraction steam before entering the HWT.”
During peak periods, the HPT releases sCO2, which is then conveyed through the reheater to recover heat from the HWT. It proceeds to the turbine to generate electricity. After this, the sCO2 is stored in the LPT, passing through the heat exchanger, while the water returns to the CWT.
The Chinese group used thermodynamic models to perform a thermodynamic and parametric analysis of the system and found that a system configuration adopting an unequal compression and expansion ratio distribution offered the best system performance. The researchers said that the best system configuration achieved a total exergy efficiency (TEE) of 35.96% and an energy storage density (ESD) of 1.54 kWh/m3.
The scientists presented the system in “Thermodynamic analysis and optimization of a compressed carbon dioxide energy storage system coupled with a combined heating and power unit,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.
“The performance and thermoelectric coupling characteristics of the  proposed combined system under variable operating conditions must be analyzed in the future to investigate its ability to consume renewable energy,” they said.

The US solar module maker will initially pay around $38 million, but it might later pay an additional $42 million, subject to certain technical milestones being achieved in the future.
First Solar said in a statement on Friday that the acquisition will accelerate the development of next generation PV technology, including high efficiency tandem devices. It aims to integrate Evolar’s know-how with its existing research and development streams, intellectual property portfolio, and expertise in developing and commercially scaling thin-film PV.
“This acquisition supplements our existing R&D streams with expertise in thin film semiconductors that complement CadTel. We expect that it will accelerate our efforts to develop tandem technology that continues our commitment to ultra-low carbon, responsibly produced solar,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer of First Solar.
Evolar, which was founded in 2019 by now-insolvent CIGS thin-film manufacturer Solibro, focuses on developing solutions, including manufacturing equipment, to commercialize tandem solar technology with perovskite thin films.
The company says that its unique evaporation technology enables it to apply a thin-film layer of perovskite, known as “PV Power Booster” technology, to increase cell energy yield by 25% at a minimal cost. It is currently in the process of commercializing its turnkey production line for perovskite cells, which can be seamlessly integrated into silicon production lines to upgrade tandem cell production.
Last year, Evolar put its encapsulated, semitransparent standalone perovskite modules through a series of industry-standard accelerated reliability tests. The results suggested that the cells could stand up to 25 years if deployed outdoors.
Evolar holds the current world record for CIGS research solar cells with an efficiency of 23.6%. The company collaborates closely with Uppsala University and has established a research laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden. This marks First Solar's first R&D facility in Europe, although the terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
After the transaction closes, around 30 of Evolar's R&D staff will join First Solar and collaborate with the company's team of approximately 60 scientists at its research technology center in Santa Clara, California, and development teams in Perrysburg, Ohio.
The Perrysburg facility, representing an investment of up to $370 million announced in October 2022, is believed to be the first of its scale in the Western hemisphere. It is expected to accelerate the development and production of advanced thin film PV and tandem PV modules and is scheduled to be completed in 2024.

Positive departures from normal April irradiation benefitted solar producers from California, Baja California and Sonora right across the continent to Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maine. The anomaly reached as high as 25% above normal over the Midwest, with larger areas seeing irradiation 5 to 10% above normal.
In contrast, most of Canada had less irradiation than normal during April due to a focus of cloud-bearing, low-pressure systems from the Pacific extending through Canada to Newfoundland. This northward focus of the low-pressure systems was driven in part by the “blocking” effect of high-pressure systems off the coast of California, diverting low-pressure systems further north. As a result, this trans-Canadian region, which also extended over some northern US states, saw irradiation departures as much as 30% below the April normal through northern parts of British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.
The Gulf Coast region was a secondary focus of low-pressure systems, causing moist oceanic tradewinds to bring increased cloud cover, especially during the second week of April. As a result, irradiation was down 10 to 15% on April normals from Florida, through Louisiana and southern Texas, and into Coahuila, Mexico.
West and southwest regions still topped irradiation totals for April
Despite these regional departures from April normals, the drier and sunnier western and southwestern regions still topped the list for the total irradiation received during April. These regions, being both further south and having drier conditions, typically experience the highest average daily insolation due to longer days with less cloud.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1 to 2 km resolution globally using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

Terabase is launching Terafab, an automated utility-scale solar installation system. It describes the service as an automated “field factory” that can double installation productivity. 
The installation system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7. 
The company also announced the grand opening of a Woodland, California manufacturing facility; “a factory to make factories.” The facility is currently manufacturing the first gigawatt Terafab assembly line with capacity to make more than 10 GW of Terafabs per year.  
Terabase said its system will double labor productivity when compared to traditional utility-scale installation methods. The system offers high-throughput, 24/7 operation, and modularity to enable rapid ramp-ups and higher solar field construction speeds, significantly reducing project schedules. 
“We successfully field-tested Terafab last year, building 10 MW of a 400 MW site in Texas. Today’s launch is the next step forward to rapid commercial scale-up,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer and co-founder of Terabase. 
Terabase has partnered with developer Intersect Power, engineering, procurement and construction firm Signal Energy, tracking hardware provider NEXtracker, and solar panel manufacturer First Solar to develop the Terafab facility. 
“Not only does our partnership with Terabase bring advanced installation technology to our next-generation Series 7 solar module, but it also enables a closed-loop packaging recycling system consistent with our vision of responsible solar,” said Nick Strevel, vice president of product, First Solar. “The Terafab system is another example of how homegrown American innovation can help accelerate the deployment of solar, enabling our country’s decarbonization ambitions.” 
Terafab is pegged for commercial deployment starting in the third quarter. The company said that the automated installation system reduces the levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar projects. It is also scalable, built on a modular design that can be replicated and deployed quickly. 
Terafab reduces the physical safety risk of construction workers by eliminating the need to lift heavy solar panels and steel structures, often in harsh weather conditions, by using automation on a climate-controlled assembly line.

Powering energy-intensive sectors of the US economy with renewable energy would go a long way toward achieving the Biden Administration’s climate goals of reducing emissions by at least 50% from a 2005 baseline by 2030 and achieving net-zero pollution by 2050.
A recent study conducted at Northeastern University looked at how solar could power US manufacturing. It found that solar mounted on industrial rooftops could meet the electricity demand of 35% of manufacturers.
According to the researchers, the industrial sector accounts for 38% of global energy consumption and 37% of greenhouse gas emissions. And with on-site sources of renewable energy currently supplying less than 0.1% of industrial electricity demand in the United States, the opportunities for carbon reduction are great.
The study, Environmental Research: Sustainability and Infrastructure, published in IOP Publishing’s journal, looks at the feasibility of meeting these electricity demands through on-site rooftop solar installations for different regions and manufacturing sectors across the United States.
Using the US Department of Energy Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey from the Energy Information Administration, the researchers compared the potential electricity generation of rooftop solar arrays against the electricity demand per unit of floor space for the average manufacturing building.
Monthly solar generation potential per unit area was calculated using the system advisor model (SAM) for on-site roof-mounted panels for the capital of each US state. SAM is a techno-economic analysis and energy simulation model, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories.
The model used 476 W (DC) SunPower solar modules with a 22% nominal efficiency on a fixed-mount solar system. The modeled ABB inverter has a  97.5% California Energy Commission weighted efficiency, maximum power of 20,000 W (AC) and maximum power point tracking of 800 V (DC), with an actual DC to AC ratio of 1.20. They ran the performance model based on hourly timestep simulations to calculate each system’s output by month, and they assumed that 90% of the rooftops were available for solar modules. They also conducted an alternative analysis on with modules that have a 16% nominal efficiency with only 80% of the roof covered with solar.
The researchers compared supply and demand on a net annual basis, under the assumption that facilities will make use of net metering.
The results show that rooftop solar arrays could fulfil the electricity requirement of 5% to 35% of US manufacturing sectors, depending on the season. They found that manufacturers of furniture, textiles, and apparels set to benefit most, representing 2% of US manufacturing electricity use and 6% of floorspace.
 
“Currently, less than 0.1% of the electricity required by the manufacturing sector in the US is generated through renewable, on-site sources,” said Dr. Matthew Eckelman, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University. “This must change if we are going to meet decarbonization goals, and in many cases rooftop solar panels are now a feasible option for supplying low-carbon energy.”
The alternative rooftop array design model was found to substantially shrink the range of supply intensities, from a high of 411 kWh m−2 yr−1 for the base case to just over 300 kWh m−2 yr−1, which is just within the range of demand intensities for the least electricity-intensive sector of furniture and related products. The researchers determined that the alternative model is not tenable for all of the other sectors in any US location.
The study found that light manufacturing sectors such as furniture and apparel can cover their average net annual electricity demand with rooftop solar on their locations across the country. Other more intensive manufacturing industries can achieve electricity self-sufficiency, but in a smaller subset of US locations.
An added benefit to pursuing on-site PV installations is that it enables manufacturers to maintain limited operations during periods of grid disruption, especially when coupled with on-site energy storage. Seasonally, manufacturing facilities with rooftop solar could fulfill their electrical needs in in nearly 40% of US locations could in the spring and summer..
“Greater policy attention on the feasibility and potential benefits of rooftop solar panel arrays will help industries to achieve renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions goals,” said Eckelman. “Our research provides an indication of the locations and sectors for which rooftop solar arrays could significantly help manufacturing firms to reach these goals.”

The fundamentals of scant deals and limited availability continue to govern the market. A source who had concluded a recent transaction confirmed that it had no transactions into China at the moment with demand only coming from outside of China.

The situation of the hung global market clashes starkly with the domestic China polysilicon market. Average polysilicon prices there, assessed by OPIS as China Mono Grade, plummeted a steep 8.81% to CNY158.83 ($22.86)/kg this week. Sustained across eleven consecutive weeks, the drop highlights how China’s producers are under significant pressure, facing challenges of their own as they sit on surplus material that is tricky to clear.
A “price war” for polysilicon, according to one source, has already begun. Manufacturers are promoting second-grade polysilicon which is more difficult to sell, offering their product at lower prices because this part of their inventories has been accumulating since the third quarter of 2022.
Wafer output in May is expected to hit around 49-50 gigawatts (GW), according to one source. There is a widespread consensus in the market that wafer prices still have room to decrease because current wafer manufacturing output is sufficient and polysilicon prices upstream have continued to slip.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
