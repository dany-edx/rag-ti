The price for G12 (210mm) wafers was raised by RMB0.60 to RMB7.23 per piece. The M6 (166mm) and G1 (158.75mm) wafers were priced at RMB4.50 and RMB4.31, respectively, both with an increase of RMB0.30. This price increase represents the largest growth registered in recent months.
Chinese president Xi Jinping has urged all regional governments, including provincial, city and county authorities, to speed up formulation of roadmaps for reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030, and becoming carbon neutral by 2060. Major central government departments including the China Ministry of Finance, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), National Energy Administration, and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, will work with provincial governments on the plans. Major state owned energy enterprises including the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), China Huadian Group, China Huaneng Group, and national grids including the State Grid Corp of China and the China Southern Power Grid, will cooperate and support government on the roadmaps. In response, the NDRC office of Henan province released a plan to promote renewables with a major focus on solar and wind over the next five years. The document said the province will install at least 20 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2025 and its cumulative renewables capacity will reach 50 GW.
Manufacturer China Glass on Friday said its planned RMB666 million (US$104 million) purchase of glassmaker Fujian Longtai Jiahao Investment Co Ltd could lead to new-energy glass production lines in future, at an industrial park the latter is developing which fired up construction glass facilities this month and is planning an auto glass line this year. The proposed acquisition of a 55% controlling stake in Fujian Longtai, by China Glass subsidiary CNG Investment, will be subject to a shareholder vote, with further details promised by May 28.

This project, in Chile, will be one of the first to commercialize green ammonia. It will be based on a 2 GW wind farm.
A team of researchers at the Research Center for Energy Networks and Energy Storage (FENES) of the East Bavarian Technical University (OTH) Regensburg, led by Professor Michael Sterner, is developing a hydrogen atlas for Germany. The interactive, continuously updated database will show which power-to-X plants are installed, indicating also related regional value chains. The project will be built gradually. The final version should be available in 2023. “The hydrogen atlas offers users the opportunity to assess potential, consumption, costs and emission reductions on a regional level,” Sterner explains. “This provides them with a comprehensive tool that facilitates entry into concrete technical planning.”
Canadian integrated energy company Suncor and Canadian holding company ATCO are looking into a potential “world scale clean hydrogen project” in Alberta. The decision follows support messages from the government of Canada and the government of Alberta, both in favor of emission-reduction projects. “Approximately 20% of the produced clean hydrogen could be used in the Alberta natural gas grid to further reduce emissions,” read a note released on Tuesday, adding that the majority would be used in refining processes and co-generation of steam and electricity at the Suncor Edmonton Refinery. The project should produce more than 300,000 tonnes per year of clean hydrogen.
Japanese petroleum company Eneos and Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer Toyota Motor are exploring hydrogen applications at Woven City, a prototype city in Susono City, Shizuoka prefecture. Eneos should establish a hydrogen refueling station and produce green hydrogen. The two companies are also interested in conducting joint advanced research on hydrogen supply. “At Woven City, they intend to promote carbon neutrality in everyday mobility, people's lives, and within the infrastructure of the city itself,” read a statement released on Monday.
Japanese transport company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) and Mitsui E&S Machinery are carrying out a joint study to introduce hydrogen fuel port cargo handling machinery. As part of the agreement, MOL signed a “contract for a new, near-zero emission, rubber-tired gantry container yard crane, and decided to introduce it at the MOL-operated Kobe International Container Terminal.”
Professor Kondo-Francois Aguey-Zinsou, who leads the Hydrogen Energy Research Centre (HERC) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), said that Australia is at the cutting edge of the hydrogen revolution and will increasingly collaborate with other countries. The comment came at the launch of a new hydrogen advisory firm called H2Potential, which will act as an incubator and an accelerator of hydrogen businesses. In collaboration with LAVO, Aguey-Zinsou helped produce the world’s first residential/commercial hydrogen battery, which stores 40 kWh of energy. That’s almost three times the capacity of a Tesla Powerwall 2, which offers 13.5 kWh.
An international alliance of 45 companies, knowledge institutes and port authorities, headed by the Port of Rotterdam Authority, has been awarded nearly €25 million in EU funding, wrote the Port of Rotterdam on Tuesday. “The consortium will be using this grant to execute ten pilot projects and demonstration projects that focus on sustainable and smart logistics in port operations,” read the note, adding that many details are not yet clear. Anyhow, the Port of Rotterdam explicitly mentioned green hydrogen among the potential renewable fuels and energy carriers.
Germany confirmed its interest in funding hydrogen, with both Länder and the federal state looking into projects that could allow the country to become a “global technology supplier.” An example is the hydrogen hub planned in Huntorf by Oldenburg-based energy, telecommunications and information technology company EWE and Dusseldorf-headquartered energy company Uniper. “Green hydrogen is an indispensable building block for the energy transition. That's why we are funding five innovative research projects across Lower Saxony with a total of €6 million. Here in Huntorf, the DLR Institute for Networked Energy Systems and Clausthal University of Technology are now using the compressed air storage power plant to investigate the potential of using green hydrogen in thermal processes,” Lower Saxony's minister for science and culture, Björn Thümler, commented in a note released on Monday.
Poland-based Solaris Bus & Coach has sold 13 hydrogen vehicles to Frankfurt. The buses are to be deployed on target routes in 2022. “The technology used in the Urbino hydrogen [bus] makes for absolutely environmentally friendly transport, thanks to the use of energy supplied by a fuel cell (of 70 kW),” read a note released last week. Earlier this year, the company signed deals for hydrogen buses with companies based in Germany, Italy, Austria and the Netherlands.

“Exeger is at the beginning of its commercial breakthrough and now builds a second factory in Sweden, in order to ramp up production and bring its solar cell technology to consumers all around the world,” the company said in a statement, adding that the manufacturing facility will be located in Stockholm.
The company is currently producing its Powerfoyle products with a pilot line located at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). “Exeger has applied for, and expects to obtain, permits from the relevant authorities before the end of the year,” the manufacturer said, referring to the new factory.
Swiss conglomerate ABB will provide the production equipment for the facility, which will make extensive use of automation, internet-of-things applications and machine learning, as well as robotics.
Exeger also announced, last month, that its cells were used in €199 solar headphones developed by Stockholm-based start-up Urbanista. “The Powerfoyle is located on top of the headband,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
 
The Urbanista Los Angeles headphones are equipped with Exeger's solar cells.The two companies claim that an hour on a sunny day is sufficient for the headphones to generate three hours of play time. “The headphones even charge in ambient light; wearing them indoors in a well-lit room or office will keep the headphones charging,” the spokesperson further explained.

Compared to conventional dye-sensitized solar cells, that use a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer which is not very conductive, Exeger's cells are relying on its proprietary material. “Our conductive layer is 1,000 times more conductive than what is normally used,” CEO Giovanni Fili told pv magazine in 2019. “That ensures higher conversion efficiency, ensuring the dye-sensitized-inspired device is commercially viable.”
Exeger's modification of the conductive layer is claimed to allow it to make bigger structural modifications to the material design. Exeger’s device can be integrated into products including Bluetooth speakers and tablet computers, substantially reducing the need for battery power.
Japan’s Softbank Group invested $20 million in Exeger across two funding rounds.

Eurostat, the number-crunching directorate-general of the European Commission revealed energy and fuel-related CO2 emissions fell in all its member states, with Greece blazing a trail with an 18.7% reduction, compared to 2019.
The organization noted its figures do not include emissions caused by the burning of non-recyclable waste in incinerators, and also exclude data from Sweden, which are being revised. Nevertheless, Greece's performance was impressive and almost matched by Estonia, where energy-use emissions were 18.1% lower, year-on-year; and micro state Luxembourg, which posted a 17.9% fall. Spain‘s energy use led to the emission of 16.2% less carbon than in 2019 and Denmark‘s 14.8%.
At the other end of the scale, Malta saw just a 1% fall in its energy-related emissions, Hungary 1.7%, and Ireland and Lithuania 2.6% each.
Eurostat said coal and oil combustion fell in all EU member states last year, at the same time as solar, wind and hydro generated more than 80 TWh more than it did in the previous year.
Natural gas usage was less clear cut, with 15 member states using a lower volume in 2020 while 12 either used the same amount or more.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/11/italian-pv-sector-cautious-about-covid-19-recovery-package/,"MARKETS,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 11, 2021",Italian PV sector cautious about Covid-19 recovery package,"“Hydrogen seems to have too much of a role. We promote it, clear, but we see the risk it could turn out to be a way to postpone the fossil exit,” Paolo Rocco Viscontini, president of the Italia Solare association, recently told pv magazine.
Gianluca Biscotti, founder of engineering consultancy BFP, echoed his sentiments.
“Although the National Recovery and Resilience Plan has allocated significant resources to the hydrogen sector (about €3.2 billion), it remains to be seen whether the €2 billion allocated for the decarbonization of the hard-to-abate sector will also end up in blue hydrogen, which would be a real failure for a plan aimed at green energy transition,” Biscotti told pv magazine.
According to Mauro Moroni, the founder of Moroni & Partners, the plan is not clear about carbon capture and storage (CCS), either.
“It appears there is no reference to CCS systems, but we should pay attention. 0.68 billion were allocated for 200 MW of innovative plants, so much resembling a single large plant perhaps offshore,” he told pv magazine.
If the color of hydrogen is still a question mark, Italy’s marginal position in the electrochemical cells sector seems to remain unquestioned.
“Let’s face it: With the available budget, Italy will not be a leader or innovator in the battery sector,” said Moroni.
Italia Solare’s Viscontini offers a more measured view. “We appreciate some references to storage, but we fear it’s not enough considered its immediate potentialities,” he said.
Funding remains a first step toward creating a stronger renewables sector in Italy.
“This is a better start than the one envisaged until some years ago. Investments in renewables in the plan will amount to 5.9 billion and will be mainly focused on solar energy, energy communities, self-consumption, innovative plants, including offshore, and biomethane,” Moroni said.
The Italian government remains positive about its 2030 objectives. The Italian PV world appears to partly share this optimism.
“The 2030 aim is to have 72% of electricity produced from RES. This will mean having to increase RES power by 70 GW in 10 years, or 7 GW a year. Renewable energy associations consider financial allocations inadequate,” said Biscotti, reminding that only 0.8 GW of new renewables capacity was installed in 2020.
On the other hand, Moroni sees huge potential ahead.
“If the bureaucratic situation breaks through as we all hope, I think there will be no problems in achieving 5 GW or 6 GW per year, given the enormous amount of authorization developments that are taking place in Italy,” he said
Viscontini said that “there are shadows, but also light.” He is positive in his assessment of the continuation of the 110% tax break program – the so-called “Superbonus” He is even more enthusiastic about the support for agrivoltaics and the declared intention to simplify permitting.
“It seems that for the first time a governmental document is considering agri-pv as a real solution, opening to the chance to install PV over agricultural land, that is a very important result, after so much resistance from many parties,” said Viscontini, adding that the focus of agrivoltaics will be on “advanced and well-monitored” solutions.
Similarly, Biscotti sees the changes in a positive light, noting the €1.1 billion for the support to agrivoltaics (a 2 GWp objective) and the additional €1.5 billion devoted to “agrisolar park” project. This includes “the installation of 4.3 million square meters of photovoltaic, for about 0.43 GW, on roofs of buildings in the agricultural, zootechnical and agro-industrial sectors,” he said.
At some sites, agrivoltaics could be coupled with biomethane, noted Moroni.
“Perhaps the European Union or Italian authorities further discussing the issue at a national level will be able to increase, balance, or otherwise change the amount of funding dedicated to this technology,” he said, adding that the 2 GW should remain a minimum, as “the power eligible for incentives could be significantly higher if used in competitive auctions such as FER1.”
As said, the issue does not just boil down to money. The simplification of authorization processes is also of fundamental importance, for example. The industry is mostly asking for fixed timings and simplified procedures. This is more important, given that the entire process should be completed within the current legislature. The next Italian general elections will be held no later than June 2023.

They have tested the performance of the cell for more than three years on a satellite in low earth orbit, in cooperation with the U.K. and Algerian space agencies.
“The cell may also be used for terrestrial applications,” researcher Dan Lamb told pv magazine. “For our technique of manufacturing the CdTe onto ultra-thin glass, the solar cell could be used where light weight and flexibility are key, as for example, in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and unmanned aerial vehicles.”
Lamb said that CdTe cells offer the potential for significant cost savings over well-established multi-junction space cells. For terrestrial use, where CdTe PV is already highly cost-competitive, additional savings could be achieved through reduced transportation costs of the lightweight technology.

The experimental cell for the space mission was built by depositing the CdTe material through metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) onto a radiation hard glass, with a thickness of just 100 micron. The glass is a cerium-doped aluminosilicate product supplied by U.K.-based Qioptiq Space Technology. To achieve a robust structure and allow for electrical measurements, the solar cell was then laminated to a printed circuit board.
The cell is based on a number of semiconducting thin films. The first layer deposited onto the ultra-thin glass substrate is a transparent conducting electrode (TCE) made of aluminum-doped zinc oxide. Then, the scientists used a layer of zinc oxide to reduce micro shunts, followed by a cadmium zinc sulfide n‐type layer, and finally, an arsenic‐doped CdTe p‐type layer. The researchers used four cells measuring 4 cm × 1 cm2 for the solar cell space experiment. The “Thin Film Solar Cell (TFSC) Payload” was initially designed to be in orbit for just one year.

“The real innovation is to use the radiation hard glass as the substrate to make the solar cell directly on it,” Lamb explained. “Usually, this glass is stuck onto most solar cells intended for space use and protects them from radiation but adds weight to the already complete solar cell. Our way reduces weight by incorporating the radiation hard glass from the outset.”
Throughout the three years of the experiment, the module showed no signs of delamination, and no deterioration in short circuit current or series resistance. The performance of the aluminum-doped zinc oxide TCE performance was purportedly not affected after three years in space. Their measurements showed that the CdTe solar cell was subject to temperature variations between -3.8 C and 51 C.
The device exhibited a power conversion efficiency of around 12%. A reduction in fill factor due to decreasing shunt resistance was attributed to diffusion, to the p/n junction, of the gold back contact. The research team is currently working on an alternative and more stable back contact metal.
“But maintenance of the high short-circuit current value indicates good intrinsic robustness of the CdTe device,” the academics said.
The device's temperature coefficient was found to be -0.19%.
“However, this conclusion should be treated with care as it was not possible to delineate the data for cell temperature only, due to the surveys being conducted under a range of solar fluxes, potentially different light soaking durations and where the open-circuit voltage is also observed to reduce over the three-year time frame,” the academics said.
They described the cell in “Thin film cadmium telluride solar cells on ultra‐thin glass in low earth orbit – three years of performance data on the AlSat‐1N CubeSat mission,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

France‘s Ministry of the Ecological Transition has reported results from the fifth round of the 282 MW solar tender for non-interconnected zones (ZNI) launched in 2019, which is open to PV projects – including those with a storage element – ranging in size from 100 kW to 5 MW.
In the round, 33 projects totaling 29 MW were selected in Mayotte and Guiana. Of the allocated capacity, 6.5 MW were assigned to installations with a capacity of between 100 kW and 500 kW on buildings or car park shades, while another 7.5 MW were awarded to projects of the same kind with capacities from 500 kW to 1.5 MW.
Furthermore, 15 MW was assigned in the category for ground-mounted PV plants with a power rating of 500 kW to 5 MW.
The French energy regulator – the CRE – had originally planned to allocate 27 MW in the procurement exercise.
According to Finergreen, which analyzed the tender's result, among the ten developers identified, Akuo Energy is far ahead, with 10 MW of the power to be installed.
French developer Amarenco announced that it secured a total capacity of 7.4 MW. Finally, Voltalia completed the winners' podium, with 5 MW.
Next in the ranking were Sunzil (2 MW), Corex Solar (1.9 MW), Total (1.5 MW), and Albioma (1.2 MW).

However, they will likely not be able to fully decarbonize the global economy, due to lack of capacity and too-high prices.
This conclusion was drawn in research conducted by scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Germany, and the Paul Scherrer Institute, in Switzerland, in which they stated that the use of hydrogen-based fuels should be prioritized in sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as long-distance aviation, feedstocks in chemical production, steel production and high-temperature industrial processes.
The scientists cite short-term scarcity and long-term uncertainty as a major obstacle for hydrogen to reach sectors that are easier to electrify, such as transport and heating, although hydrogen fuels will probably not be completely excluded from applications of this kind. “There will likely be small-scale niche applications and also regional-specific responses to this question,” researcher Falko Ueckerdt told pv magazine.
“If we use hydrogen-based fuels instead of direct electrification alternatives, two to 14 times the amount of electricity generation is needed, depending on the application and the respective technologies,” explained research co-author Romain Sacchi. “Efficiency losses happen both on the supply side, in the production process of the hydrogen-based fuels, and on the demand side – a combustion engine wastes a lot more energy than an electrical one.”
The academics defined the current race for green or blue hydrogen and e-fuels as a “potential distraction” from the task of electrifying the global economy, which they claim is more urgent as well as cheaper and easier to achieve. E-fuel costs, on the other hand, may become competitive only if carbon prices will rise significantly before the end of this decade – a scenario that the German-Swiss group described as rather unlikely.
“Even if assuming 100% renewable electricity, the costs of avoiding one ton of CO2 emissions by using hydrogen-based fuels would currently be €800 for liquid and €1,200 for gaseous fuels,” the research team explained. “This is much higher than current CO2 prices, for instance in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which currently are below €50 per ton.”
According to its calculations, hydrogen-based fuels may be cost-competitive, eventually, by 2040, but this would be too late for relying on hydrogen as a climate solution. Direct electrification alternatives already exist, it further explained, and these must be applied if climate change needs to be tackled.
Considering that carbon prices may need more than a decade to reach sufficient levels to better support a hydrogen economy, public policies will be necessary to support research and the market introduction of hydrogen-based fuels, the researchers went on to say. Government strategies should support innovation and initial scale-up, including direct electrification and enacting energy tax reforms to create a level-playing field for all technologies.
“Fuels based on hydrogen as a universal climate solution might be a bit of false promise,” Ueckerdt concluded. “While they’re wonderfully versatile, it should not be expected that they broadly replace fossil fuels.”
The paper Potential and risks of hydrogen-based e-fuels in climate change mitigation was recently published in Nature Climate Change.

Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) has opened a tender to procure 500 MW of wind-solar hybrid power from grid-connected inter-state and intra-state projects. The projects will be awarded through competitive bidding, followed by a reverse auction.
The bidders selected by MSEDCL will set up wind-solar hybrid power projects and supply power under 25-year PPAs to MSEDCL.
“The inter/intra-state wind-solar hybrid projects already commissioned but do not have any long-term PPA with any agency can/may be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other central or state schemes and do not have any obligations towards existing buyers,” MSEDCL said in the tender document.
For intra-state projects, the minimum size of a single hybrid power project will be 25 MW, with at least 10 MW at one site, to be interconnected at a single delivery point. The minimum size for inter-state projects will be 50 MW at one site. 
The rated project capacity of one resource (wind or solar) in the wind-solar hybrid power project will be at least 33% of the total contracted capacity. For example, if the total contracted capacity comprises 200 MW, the minimum rated project capacity of wind or solar will be at least 66 MW.

GlobalData says in a new report that solar installations in Australia could grow by a factor of four by 2030. It estimates that the country will reach a solar capacity of 80.22 GW in 2030, from 17.99 GW in 2020. 
The report also forecasts a significant decline in the dominance of thermal power in Australia’s energy mix, seeing it decline from a 58.6% share in the 2000-20 period to only 27.8% in 2030. 

“Australia plans to compensate the decline in thermal and hydropower capacity with renewable power capacity growth,” said GlobalData power analyst Aditya Sharma. “By 2030, the share of renewable power capacity is set to reach 69.9%, driven mostly by solar PV installations.”
GlobalData points to Australia’s various federal, state and local regulatory regimes as one of the primary drivers for its already world-leading solar deployment. The rate of rooftop solar adoption in the country well exceeds the global average. 
According to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), more than 260 GW of renewable energy was added throughout the world in 2020, surpassing 2019’s previous net increase record by almost 50%. Australia’s pace of growth was almost double the global average, coming in at 18.4%.
“The growth of solar PV in Australia is driven by frequent renewable energy auctions and offering of feed-in tariffs,” continued Sharma. “In addition to the federal initiatives, all eight provinces offer their own schemes supporting growth of solar PV. For instance, in Australian Capital Territory, in addition to solar PV auctions, the provincial government also offers interest-free loans for rooftop solar.”
