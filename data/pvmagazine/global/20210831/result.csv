The gas would be used in trucks and other heavy land transport. According to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the new PtX facility will be Europe’s largest. The ministry said offshore wind farms in the North Sea grant access to the green electricity essential for the production of green hydrogen. “While this major investment is the great news of today, only a few months ago it was announced that Europe’s largest green ammonia plant is going to be built near Esbjerg as well,” wrote the ministry on Monday. Another selling point is the export opportunity to large industrial areas of Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe. “To build a GW-sized green hydrogen production site fits into the PtX strategy of Denmark and we are looking forward to being part of this strategy by setting up the green ecosystem in Denmark,” said Clifford zur Nieden, director at H2 Energy Europe. “There are different hurdles to overcome to make the transition to hydrogen trucking, including the accelerated construction of hydrogen pipelines, but in close cooperation with the Danish government we believe that this is feasible.” The energy company already produces green hydrogen in Switzerland and has almost 50 hydrogen trucks in operation. It expects a further 1,600 hydrogen trucks to be delivered in the next few years.
That was not the only recent hydrogen development in Denmark. Last week, Danish green hydrogen infrastructure company Everfuel signed a deal with Trelleborg municipality – a first contract in its ambitious plan of rolling out hydrogen refueling stations in Sweden. “The agreement is the first of eight potential stations in the Nordic Hydrogen Corridor project, which is co-financed by the European Union’s CEF-program,” read a note released on Thursday. Trelleborg has committed “to a daily off-take increasing to 120kg per day,” said the press release. “The partners have a joint ambition to make Everfuel’s hydrogen the preferred zero-emission solution in Trelleborg and together grow the market to 500kg per day within five years of operation.” Everfuel followed up today by signing a strategic cooperation agreement with Norwegian maritime tech company TECO 2030 to deliver green hydrogen to fuel the latter’s fuel cells and fuel cell-based power generators in remote areas. “The cooperation between Everfuel and TECO 2030 will enable construction sites with no available grid connection to lower their climate footprint and reduce their emissions by switching from diesel generators to zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell generators,” read a press release about the agreement. The Danish government this week presented its Finance Bill for 2022, and included higher climate finance provision and climate-focused foreign aid. For instance, the Scandinavian country will allocate 60% of climate financial aid to adaptation measures.
Chinese energy company Sinopec has reported progress with its hydrogen plans. The company said a hydrogen refueling station in Zhejiang province is increasing output. In a separate note last week, Sinopec said it wants to become a hydrogen leader. With the power company reporting an oil and gas discovery in Xinjiang, and 13.7% growth in refinery throughput, analysts have questioned what ‘color' of hydrogen will be involved. A conference call held yesterday, and reported by Reuters, saw Sinopec chairman Ma Yongsheng commit to a five-year investment of $4.6 billion (€3.9 billion) to set up 1,000 hydrogen refueling stations with 200,000 tonnes of annual refueling capacity. Ma added: “Sinopec will expand forcefully into making hydrogen from renewable energy … and using green hydrogen for refining.”
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has said hydrogen production, alongside electrification, could emerge as the main driver for “very quick” growth in electricity demand which could further accelerate after 2030. “Beyond the next decade, the potential growth due to electrification, hydrogen production and associated zero-emissions industry, is forecast to be even more significant, with [Australian] NEM [National Electricity Market] consumption potentially doubling by 2050,” read the press release issued today. In its NEM Electricity Statement of Opportunities report, AEMO said “the timing and scale of sectors seeking to increase energy efficiency, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce costs by fuel-switching to electricity [and, later in the report, hydrogen] is a major source of uncertainty.” AEMO included consideration of green hydrogen in its modeling within its yearly report for the first time, as momentum is building and the hydrogen economy represents “a new export opportunity.” The report considers several scenarios, including one dubbed ‘hydrogen superpower.' Under that energy future, AEMO wrote, “by 2030, the growth of new hydrogen industries (green steel and export) is projected to account for around 17% of total electricity consumption, slightly more than the forecast influence of electrification. The additional electricity energy consumption for hydrogen production is largely for export as ammonia, although the potential for domestic hydrogen use and a large green steel industry is a growing long-term opportunity.” The regulator highlighted more than 10 projects 100 MW-plus scale hydrogen projects being developed across Australia, with many more at a smaller scale. “Government funding initiatives and strategies continue to show strong interest in, and support for, developing Australia’s hydrogen potential,” read the report.
South Korea’s industry ministry and the Korea Gas Safety Corporation (KOGAS) have launched a hydrogen refueling station safety monitoring system. “The system transmits, in real time, the operating status of the charging station’s safety devices, such as gas leak detectors and compressors and core facilities of the charging station, through a dedicated program installed at each charging station, to the Korea Gas Safety Corporation situation room,” read the note today. According to the South Korean government, the charging stations and Korea Gas Safety Corporation can take immediate responses.
Canadian energy company Imperial Oil has said it wants to produce around 20,000 barrels – 3 million liters – of renewable diesel per day in 2024 at its Strathcona refinery near Edmonton, Alberta. ExxonMobil has a 69.6% stake in the company. Imperial Oil intends to produce blue hydrogen but has not explained where the carbon storage facility would be located. “Renewable diesel production will source blue hydrogen [hydrogen produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage] to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional hydrogen production. Approximately 500,000 tons of CO2 are expected to be captured annually. The blue hydrogen and biofeedstock will be combined with a proprietary catalyst to produce premium low-carbon diesel fuel,” read the note released on Wednesday. The hydrogen would primarily be used for transport. Imperial Oil is in partnership discussions with the governments of Alberta and British Columbia.
U.K.-based Powerhouse Energy Group has signed a binding exclusivity agreement to deploy its clean energy technology in continental Europe. “The agreement with Hydrogen Utopia International plc (HUI) grants the company an exclusive, non-transferable licence for the application of the technology, which recycles plastic and waste into valuable clean energy products, across Poland, Greece and Hungary,” read the note today. Powerhouse has already received €125,000. Under the agreement, HUI will pay Powerhouse a further €325,000 this year and €300,000 next year. “HUI will use its local networks and relationships in the countries licensed to it to help secure project approvals, finance and technical expertise to facilitate the deployment of DMG technology,” said Aleksandra Binkowska, chief executive of U.K.-based HUI. The technology converts plastic, end-of-life tires and other waste streams into syngas. According to the company, the process can generate up to 2 tons of road-fuel quality hydrogen and more than 58 MWh of exportable electricity per day.

Net profit for the first six months of the year was RMB5 billion (US$773 million), up 21.3% from the first half of the previous year. The manufacturer shipped 17 GW of modules during the period, of which 410 MW were for its own projects. Wafer shipments totaled 38.3 GW, of which 15.6 GW were for its own module production. The gross profit margin for the first half of the year was 22.73%, up 29% from a year earlier.
The polysilicon shortage which drove up prices at the start of the year helped TBEA-owned Xinte Energy’s poly division raise profits from the RMB114 million (US$17.6 million) banked in the first six months of last year to RMB1.23 billion (US$190 million) this time. Overall operating profits, including from solar plant construction and operation, rose from RMB261 million (US$40.3 million) to RMB1.96 billion (US$303 million) by the same comparison, Xinte reported on Friday. That meant gross profit of RMB2.47 billion, up from RMB626 million (US$96.7 million) in the first half of last year, and net profits of RMB1.23 billion, up from just RMB1.74 million (US$269,000) a year earlier.
PV manufacturer Solargiga said its “painful period” of retiring ageing cell manufacturing kit is behind it as it reported its first-half financials on Friday. Revenue rose from RMB2.6 billion (US$402 million) in January-to-June last year to RMB2.82 billion (US$436 million) this time. Without the cell-related RMB68.6 million (US$10.6 million) impairment booked in the first-half of last year, a RMB42.7 million (US$6.6 million) loss in 1H, 2020 became a RMB121 million profit. Solargiga’s ingot and wafer making arm generated a RMB172 million (US$26.6 million) first-half profit on revenue of RMB1.15 billion (US$178 million) but rising input costs meant module revenue of RMB1.63 billion (US$252 million) for the period translated into just RMB50.7 million (US$7.84 million) profit. The rump cell operation booked a first-half loss of RMB7.38 million (US$1.14 million) on revenue of RMB1.15 million (US$178,000) but the group’s solar business generated revenue of RMB32.7 million (US$5.05 million) for a RMB6.41 million (US$991,000) profit. Solargiga shipped 2.24 GW of ingots and wafers in the first six months of the year, up from 1.65 GW a year earlier, and plans to raise ingot production capacity from 6.05 GW to 8.55 GW this year, and 18.55 GW next year. Wafer output of 2.9 GW is due to hit 4.6 GW this year and 14.6 GW in 2022. First-half module shipments fell from 1.19 GW in January-to-June last year, to 1.09 GW, with the firm’s 4 GW annual output capacity set to reach 8.2 GW this year and 12.5 GW next year because, as Solargiga stated in reference to the price of coal-fired power in China: “Market demand will inevitably explode after reaching grid parity.”
State-owned solar panel glassmaker Irico New Energy reported big first-half figures on Thursday, with six-month revenue rising from RMB1 billion (US$155 million) in the “previous period” to RMB1.18 billion (US$182 million) in January to June. That added up to a rise in total profits from RMB35.4 million (US$5.47 million), to RMB224 million (US$34.6 million) this time round, for the China Electronics Corp-controlled business. With operating costs falling from RMB1 billion last time, to RMB962 million (US$149 million), the net profit for shareholders from the first half rose to RMB215 million (US$33.2 million), up from RMB41.6 million (US$6.42 million).
Footwear and graphene manufacturer Golden Solar yesterday revealed more details of its move into flexible, heterojunction (HJT), cast-mono PV manufacturing as it reported a first-half net loss of RMB3.84 million (US$593,000) from its more conventional operations. The nascent HJT wafer, cell and module operation generated revenue of RMB529,000 (US$81,750) in the first six months of the year for a profit of RMB80,000 (US$12,360) after Golden Solar secured its first customer – a new energy vehicle charging point demonstrator project. The company, formerly Baofeng Modern International – paid RMB7.6 million for consultancy services and RMB3.3 million in extra staffing costs associated with its move into solar and intends to devote RMB135 million (US$20.9 million) into the development of the new operation out of a HK$307 million (US$39.4 million) shares issuance in April which has already paid RMB37.5 million owed for casting silicon furnaces. The manufacturer – which said it is undertaking certification to back the claim its solar products offer a conversion efficiency of 24%-plus – stated it has orders in place for up to 400 million pieces of its cast mono wafers from Jiangsu Runergy New Energy Technology, Taoistic Solar Technology (Changzhou), and Panda PV Tech, and intends to enter commercial mass production of its solar products this year.
State-owned manufacturer Luoyang Glass will pay RMB300 million (US$46.4 million) to acquire a 60% stake in solar module glass maker Zigong New Energy from its state-owned parent Jinma Investment, it was announced on Friday.

That was one of the details that emerged yesterday from Shunfeng's first-half update, which again spelled out the creditors the developer is trying to keep patient as it dealt with a current assets-to-liabilities deficit of RMB2.67 billion (US$413 million) at the end of June. The group equity attributable to the owners of the company at that point was in deficit to the tune of RMB1.59 billion (US$246 million), Shunfeng confirmed.
The bind the solar developer finds itself in was spelled out by the fact the only profitable part of its operations in the January-to-June period was the Lattice Power LED manufacturing business Shunfeng has sold off for RMB670 million (US$104 million), which generated an RMB80.5 million (US$12.4 million) uplift in the period concerned.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
Revenue from the sale of electricity generated by Shunfeng's ever-diminishing solar portfolio came in at RMB364 million (US$56.3 million) in the first half, for a divisional loss of RMB119 million (US$18.4 million), which at least came in substantially from a RMB525 million (US$81.1 million) reverse 12 months earlier. The LED sales buffed a total first-half loss of RMB38.9 million for Shunfeng, down from a RMB469 million (US$72.5 million) hit a year earlier.
Lender China Minsheng Banking Corp, which at the end of last year agreed to accept HK$75 million (US$9.63 million) every quarter as Shunfeng bid to settle an overdue HK$780 million (US$100 million) was left unsatisfied in the first half but has held off again on the understanding it will be paid from the sale receipts of Lattice Power, which Shunfeng said it expects to bank next month.
Holders of one overdue convertible bond, who were awaiting four HK$87.5 million (US$11.2 million) installments, starting on May 31, also received nothing and have agreed to accept settlement “with the proceeds received from the disposal of solar power plants held by the group.” To compound that uncertainty, Shunfeng said its hoped-for further future project sales “may include the discount arising from the lack of marketability.”
Another creditor, Chongqing International, will be paid out of the sale of equity stakes in various projects which were pledged to it as security for an overdue RMB666 million (US$103 million) loan, Shunfeng added, and a further RMB105 million (US$16.2 million) of commitments was overdue as of the end of June.
At the halfway point, Shunfeng said, it had cash and equivalents of RMB16 million (US$2.47 million) in its accounts.

The LEPA system combines a conventional redox flow battery (RFB) with two catalytic reactors that are able to produce green hydrogen by utilizing the fluid that runs through the battery. Unlike conventional redox flow batteries, the dual-flow battery, once it is fully charged, can discharge its fluid into the catalytic reactors, thus creating more storage space. “The dual-circuit RFB has the advantage of offering two discharging modes, and to store energy beyond the energy capacity of the electrolytes in the form of renewable hydrogen energy storage,” the Swiss group stated.
“This system is distinct from the conventional RFB in that the former includes a secondary energy platform in which electrochemical energy can be converted into renewable hydrogen by water-splitting using redox electrocatalysis,” the researchers explained. This new kind of hydrogen production from water relies on the use of a redox mediator on solid electrocatalyst particles in a reactor and offers several advantages over conventional electrolysis in terms of safety, membrane degradation, purity and flexibility.
Redox mediators, which are chemicals with an electrochemical activity that are able to exchange electrons with fuels or oxidants, are a crucial component for the device's hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) – which is the cathodic reaction in electrochemical water splitting – and have to be chosen carefully, as they have to ensure the reversibility, solubility, and stability of its performance.
According to the scientists, the battery exhibited great stability over 50 cycles, with an average energy efficiency of 68% at a current density of 50 mA ⋅ cm-2 and a water-splitting voltage efficiency of 64.1%. “The hydrogen produced by the LEPA system is pure and only needs to be dried and compressed for optimal storage,” they went on to say. “That system is also safer than conventional ones because it generates the oxygen and hydrogen separately, rather than simultaneously, so there is less risk of an explosion.”
The research team believes the system is particularly interesting for transportation applications.
All the details on the battery can be found in the paper Combined hydrogen production and electricity storage using a vanadium-manganese redox dual-flow battery, published in Cell Reports Physical Science.

In plainer English, that reads as selling off vast chunks of its solar project portfolio to satisfy creditors and GCL said it had disposed of another 2 GW of generation capacity in the January-to-June period, to raise more than RMB4.9 billion (US$757 million) and, therefore, reduce debts by RMB10.3 billion (US$1.59 billion).
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they are changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
The latest project sales were of four project companies with 271 MW of generation capacity announced yesterday, with state-controlled Ningxia Hanguang New Energy Co Ltd the buyer for RMB301 million (US$46.5 million). That deal will represent a book profit of RMB20.8 million (US$3.21 million) and net the seller RMB1.2 billion (US$185 million) while reducing company liabilities by a further RMB1.04 billion (US$161 million). There was a wrinkle, however, with GCL warning the project companies may have to be repurchased if the solar parks in Shenmu are demolished because of “overlying of mineral resources” or “non-compliance of the relevant government notice in relation to the occupation and use of forest land.” The fourth project business concerned – Xixian New District GCL – may have to be repurchased if it fails to be listed for government subsidy this year.
GCL added, the project companies also carry “rectification costs” of RMB3.33 million (US$515,000), with that figure deducted from the purchase price.
Nevertheless, the solar project business was able to report an assets-to-liabilities balance of RMB2.93 billion (US$453 million) at the end of June, compared to a RMB9.23 billion (US$1.43 billion) shortfall a year earlier.
The company did, however, reveal two more missed debt repayments yesterday. Relating to a loan of US$100 million from an unnamed source, GCL said it had now paid US$48 million which had gone unsatisfied on June 23, and had agreed an extension of payment date for the US$52 million balance, until the end of next month. That second tranche of cash had originally been due 11 days ago.
GCL New Energy will continue to sell off its projects, it announced, with state-owned buyers in its sights, and will attempt to refocus on a planned hydrogen operation which will initially hinge on blue hydrogen generated by a sister entity's natural gas input.
Parent company GCL-Poly, whose shares have been suspended from trading on the Hong Kong exchange since April 1 – pending overdue publication of its 2020 figures – this morning said it expects to post a net profit of RMB2.3 billion (US$355 million) from the first six months of the year thanks to soaring polysilicon prices.
The poly maker, which cannot officially state the figures until its 2020 numbers are signed off, said it also brought another 10,000 metric tons of polysilicon manufacturing capacity online in the first half.

The IBC AeroFix G3 mounting system, according to the manufacturer, has a wide range of mounting options and offers the possibility to combine wide and narrow base rails to ensure high flexibility and cost-effectiveness. “This means that lower ballasted modules or more stable roof areas can be covered with the more cost-effective, narrow rail,” IBC Solar said in a statement. “This not only ensures maximum flexibility but also reduces the material costs and the overall costs of the system. At the same time, the system ensures that the roof is safely covered.”
Modules of different sizes can be accommodated in the structure via an integrated tilt joint which can ensure a “tension-free” module alignment.
With a range of available module sizes wider than ever before, the PV industry cannot afford a one-size-fits-all approach. For mounting systems manufacturers, the demand is high for systems that flexibly adapt to different modules’ dimensions whilst minimizing the risk of cell damage. With the launch of its new roof mounting system, the IBC AeroFix G3, IBC Solar is promising to meet this demand. Join the discussion on September 23! More information and free registration.
The company specified that the system offers six different installation options, with an elevation of 8, 10 or 15 degrees for both south and east-west oriented PV installations. It also comes with floor rails with pre-mounted construction protection mats and integrated cable ducts for up to 28 6mm² cables. “The floor rails offer a large contact surface and thus ensure low surface pressure and even distribution of loads over the entire roof,” the manufacturer explained.
The system is also claimed to have good aerodynamic properties and to comply with the standards of the Wind Technology Society. It can be deployed on all kinds of flat roofs, including foil, bitumen, gravel, concrete, or green roofs, according to the company.

A group of scientists led by Stanford University has demonstrated a new battery chemistry that reached 1,200 milliamp-hours per gram of positive electrode material – around six times higher than today’s commercially available lithium-ion batteries. With further work to scale up the batteries and improve on cycle life, the group is convinced that the new sodium or lithium chloride batteries could be used to power sensors and satellites, and in other situations where regular charging is not practical.
The group was actually working on thionyl-chloride, commonly used for single-use batteries, when it first made the discovery of a reversible reaction involving chlorine and sodium chloride. They have since spent several years experimenting with different materials to improve the efficiency of this reaction, and have now seen encouraging results thanks to an electrode made of a porous carbon material, developed at the National Chung Cheng University of Taiwan.
The battery is described in the paper Rechargeable Na/Cl2 and Li/Cl2 batteries, published in Nature. The group worked with an aluminum chloride electrolyte with fluoride additives, and either sodium or lithium as the negative electrode. The battery works via redox reactions at either side. “The chlorine molecule is being trapped and protected in the tiny pores of the carbon nanospheres when the battery is charged,” explained Stanford scientist Guanzhou Zhu. “Then, when the battery needs to be drained or discharged, we can discharge the battery and convert chlorine to make NaCl – table salt – and repeat this process over many cycles. We can cycle up to 200 times currently and there’s still room for improvement.”
The group says that the prototype developed for the paper might already be suitable for use in small devices such as hearing aids, and that they envision the battery one day being used to power sensors or satellites – applications where frequent recharging is impossible or impractical.
They acknowledge, however, that turning the promising discovery of a reversible reaction for chemical energy storage into an actual practical battery will be a lengthy and challenging process. “For consumer electronics or electrical vehicles, much more work remains to engineer the battery structure, increase the energy density, scale up the batteries and increase the number of cycles,” they conclude.

Germany saw the addition of 434.9 MW of new PV capacity in July, according to the latest figures from federal network agency the Bundesnetzagentur.
This compares to 428.5 MW in June this year and 447 MW in July 2020. In the first seven months of 2021, developers connected 3.2 GW of solar to the grid compared to 2.8 GW in the same period a year earlier. The country's cumulative solar capacity topped 555.7 GW at the end of July.
Most of last month's additions come from 308.7 MW of rooftop PV systems built under the country's feed-in tariff scheme and 10.2 MW of solar parks with a capacity of up to 750 kW deployed outside the tender scheme for large scale PV. Another 126 MW is attributable to ground-mounted projects selected under the tender scheme and 1.9 MW comes from the tenants’ solar power supply mechanism.
The Bundesnetzagentur also published new compensation rates which will begin in September. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4% while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0725/kWh and €0.0551/kWh, depending on size.

The rebates will cover up to 50% of the costs for installing and deploying a PV system and are intended at supporting homeowners and businesses to take advantage of the recently introduced net metering regime, which will allow them to sell excess power to the Serbian state-owned power utility, Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS).
Mihajlovic said the procedures to install a rooftop system have also been simplified and that EPS is compelled to connect a PV system within five days after its owner has secured connection approval.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Serbia had an installed PV capacity of 29 MW at the end of 2020. Last year, only 6 MW of new PV systems were deployed in the country. Around 10 MW of this installed power comes from an expired FIT scheme, which granted rates ranging from €0.124 to €0.146/kWh for rooftop PV arrays, depending on system size, and €0.09/kWh for ground-mounted installations, all under 12-year power purchase agreements.
According to the Serbian government’s energy strategy, the nation's cumulative PV capacity is expected to increase by 100 MW in 2025, and 200 MW in 2030.

The Ohio Power Siting Board in just the past month has announced public hearings for six proposed solar projects, totaling more than 1.1 GW of potential capacity.
The projects, while not all guaranteed to advance, represent a new level of developer interest in the state. Some of the proposed capacities would rival the largest projects being constructed in the country’s sunniest areas.
The six potential installations include the 300 MW Birch Solar project, proposed by Lightsource bp, and the 300 MW Yellow Wood Solar array, which would be developed by Invenergy.
The Birch Solar project would be constructed in Allen and Auglaize counties, southwest of Toledo. Lightsource bp said that it intends to use 590 W monocrystalline modules from Trina Solar, Power Electronics’ PE 3350 inverters, and Array Technologies' DuraTrack HZv3 trackers. The hardware specifics could change as the project advances, however.
The Yellow Wood Solar Project would be constructed by Invenergy in Clinton county, midway between Cincinnati and Columbus. For this project, the developer said it would use modules from Longi, inverters from TMEIC, trackers from NEXTracker, Soltec, or Array Technologies. Specific models were not disclosed, and the application outlined potential module and inverter substitutions.
The remaining four projects are still of considerable size:
The 100 MW Marion County Solar Project, set to be developed by Savion Energy, would include a 20 MW energy storage system. The project, planned for Marion county, just north of Columbus, would use Tier 1 solar modules, with applicants identifying Risen, Jinko, Trina, Longi as possible suppliers. Inverter mounting system specifics were not disclosed.
The 120 MW Tymochtee Solar project would be developed by Apex Clean Energy in Wyandot county, also north of Columbus. Hardware details were not available, other than it will use bifacial solar modules mounted on single-axis trackers.
The 117 MW Dodson Creek Solar project would be developed by National Grid Renewables in Highland County, east of Cincinnati.  National Grid is considering Solar Ware, SMA, and SunGrow inverters. It will likely choose between First Solar Series 6, Longi LR5, Vertex TSM-DEG 201C.20, Canadian Solar BiHiKu6 Mono, and JA Solar Deep Blue 3.0 modules, and Soltec, FTC Solar and NEXTracker trackers.
The 175 MW Kingswood Solar project would be developed by Vesper Energy in Xenia, Cedarville, and Miami townships, near Dayton. Hardware specifics have not been finalized, with the developer stating only that it would use Tier 1 solar modules. The inverter supplier and mounting system of choice have not been decided.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/31/novel-approach-for-thermophotovoltaics-promises-higher-efficiencies/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 31, 2021",Novel approach for thermophotovoltaics promises higher efficiencies,"Solar thermophotovoltaics (STPV) is a power generation technology that utilizes thermal radiation to generate electricity in a photovoltaic cell. An STPV system consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 degrees Celsius, and a photovoltaic diode cell that is able to absorb the photons coming from this heat source. This technology has raised a strong interest among scientists in the past decades, as it is able to capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. The efficiencies reported so far, however, are still too low to make it commercially mature, as STPV devices still suffer from a series of optical and thermal losses.
With this in mind, a group of researchers from the University of Michigan and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory has proposed a new approach for STPV consisting of reducing the separation between the emitter and the photovoltaic cell to a nanoscale. The researchers call their approach ‘near-field thermophotovoltaics' and claim it is able to achieve high power density and high power conversion efficiencies.
The scientists created an STPV device with an emitter that can reach temperatures as high as 1,270 Kelvin, and a thin-film photovoltaic cell based on indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) which is said to be capable of absorbing above-band-gap (ABG) thermal radiation while minimizing absorption of sub-band-gap (SBG) photons. “The photons above the band-gap of the cell are efficiently absorbed in the micron-thick semiconductor while those below the band-gap are reflected back to the silicon emitter and recycled,” explained Stephen Forrest, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Michigan.
The solar cell was grown on thick semiconductor substrates and the thin semiconductor, active region of the cell was then peeled off and transferred to a silicon substrate. A nanopositioning platform in a high-vacuum environment was used to parallelize, and gauge the distance between, the emitter and the PV cell. The emitter and PV cell were initially separated by only 7µm and the cell was then placed closer to the emitter using a feedback-controlled piezoelectric actuator, which is a tool able to convert an electrical signal into a controlled physical displacement.
According to the researchers, the STPV device exhibited record power densities of around 5 kW/m2 at an efficiency of 6.8%, which they stated is an order of magnitude larger than systems previously reported in the literature. The reported efficiency defines the ratio of electricity output of the PV cell to the radiative heat transfer from the emitter.
“This current demonstration meets theoretical predictions of radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale, and directly shows the potential for developing future near-field TPV devices for army applications in power and energy, communication and sensors,” said researcher Pani Varanasi.
The novel approach is described in the paper Near-field thermophotovoltaics for efficient heat to electricity conversion at high power density, published in nature communications.

Australian utility Origin Energy and Japanese energy giant Eneos have revealed that they will jointly explore the feasibility of producing green hydrogen made with wind and solar energy in the Australian state of Queensland. They will also look at establishing a supply chain, including the possibility of exporting green hydrogen from Australia to Japan.
The study will examine the potential for the stable supply of green hydrogen produced from renewable energy in Queensland. It will also explore the feasibility of converting it to methylcyclohexane (MCH), which fixes hydrogen with toluene and remains in a liquid form at normal temperature and pressure for storage and transportation.
The study will examine what existing infrastructure and transport options can be used and what gaps need to be filled along the supply chain to establish a large-scale green hydrogen business in Queensland.
Origin Energy will focus on the use of renewable energy supply and electrolysis for hydrogen production. Eneos, which said earlier this year that it would develop a 204 MW solar farm in western Queensland with fellow Japanese company Sojitz, will be responsible for more efficient production of MCH and the transporting of it from Australia to Japan.
Eneos, which controls about 50% of the gasoline sales market in Japan, already owns petroleum tankers, storage tanks and refineries used for export, which are expected to be used as the hydrogen supply chain develops.

Eneos, which recently announced plans to conduct a study with France's Neoen into the potential construction of a green hydrogen supply chain from South Australia, said it chose Queensland for its latest venture due to the state’s proactive government policy on hydrogen, abundant renewable resources, and well-established infrastructure.
“Queensland is well advanced in the development of renewable energy sources, particularly solar power,” the company said in a statement. “The state government is promoting hydrogen industry development leveraging these renewable energy sources. In addition, existing infrastructure such as storage tanks, shipping and port facilities currently used for coal and natural gas can be utilized for hydrogen export.”
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk welcomed the announcement, saying that the state is in a prime position to take advantage of Australia’s nascent green hydrogen industry, which is expected to contribute at least AUD 11 billion ($8 billion) to the national economy and generate around 7,600 jobs by 2050.
“This is an exciting development for Queensland as we are working hard to develop our sustainable hydrogen industry and leverage the solar resources already developed and to be developed in the future,” she said.
The announcement of the Eneos partnership comes just weeks after Origin Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with global shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) to investigate opportunities to develop the supply chain to support export-scale green ammonia in Australia. Origin Energy and MOL will explore how Australian green ammonia projects could supply key downstream markets from 2026, with a joint feasibility study to be completed by December 2021.
Tracey Boyes, Origin Energy’s general manager of future fuels, said the utility is now progressing a number of export-scale green hydrogen opportunities across Australia to meet overseas and domestic demand for lower carbon fuels. For example, it is exploring the potential for a 500 MW electrolyzer at Bell Bay, Tasmania, saying its $3.2 million feasibility study into green ammonia production is well progressed.
“Many nations have committed to ambitious carbon targets,” Boyes said. “With our abundance of renewable resources and proximity to Asian markets, Australia is in the box seat to develop a world-leading hydrogen sector, exporting low emissions energy all over the world to meet demand for clean energy from our major trading partners. Origin is in a strong position to leverage our expertise in LNG export and delivering complex major projects.”
