The request for a hearing on the matter follows the publication of an article published by Dutch financial newspaper Financieele Dagblad (FD), in which the forced labor issue was addressed.
pv magazine’s UP Initiative is looking at what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to the workers, often far removed, involved in the production of their products and services. Topics include: Impacts on global polysilicon supply for solar manufacturers; supply chain audits and transparency in PV; and relevant policy directives in the United States and Europe. Keep up-to-date on our coverage as we go through Q2 2021.
In their 21 questions, the MPs urged the government to explain if it is aware that solar modules imported from China, and used in the Dutch PV market, may contain raw materials from the Xinjiang region, in which the large-scale extraction of polysilicon allegedly involves forced labor.
They also called on the government to check if solar products related to the Xinjiang region may have been used in projects receiving public subsidies and invited the minister to explain the possible consequences for Dutch and European renewable energy markets if the imports of modules linked to the Xinjiang region may be stopped or suspended temporarily.
Moreover, the minister was asked to explain what it is being done at the national and EU level for the regional diversification of the global PV industry and to what extent it is possible for Dutch companies, which claim they are only aware of what is happening at the factory level where wafers, cells and modules are produced, to control what is happening in raw material production.
The MPs also urged the government to verify the trustworthiness of consulting firm Horizon Advisory, which published a report in January where it claimed that forced labor is being used in the Chinese PV supply chain. Since its publication, a discussion about the matter has begun in western countries and the existence and extent of the alleged forced labor in Xinjiang have been examined. However, to date, there are still many unknowns about the matter.
Going back to the Netherlands, it is interesting to note that the CDA division of North Holland, in a separate development, has urged the government of the region – an area with strong development of solar parks – to consider the possibility of introducing legislation for ethical purchasing in the PV sector.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/14/european-pv-organization-requests-e20bn-to-support-manufacturing/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"APRIL 14, 2021",European PV organization requests €20bn to support manufacturing,"From pv magazine Germany
Europe was once the heart of the solar industry, but those times are long gone. Asian countries, particularly China, have since pulled ahead with gigawatt-scale production of PV products. The European solar industry has survived, thanks to small manufacturers, but there are also plans afoot for large-scale production on the continent.
The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) has determined that in 2019, only about 11% of silicon, 1% of ingots and wafers, 0.4% of solar cells, and 4% of solar modules were manufactured in Europe, accounting for 15% of global PV demand. Many solar modules must be imported and demand is currently rising in many European countries.
With this in mind, ESMC is now insisting that €20 billion ($23.9 billion) from the €700 billion EU Recovery and Resilience Facility should be used to support the growth of PV production in Europe. Around 37% of the funds are to be spent on clean-tech and EU member states will share their views on how the money should be used by the end of this month.
“The European photovoltaic industry suffers from a lack of strategic political priorities,” the ESMC said. Eicke Weber, the chairman of the organization, added that a strong PV manufacturing industry will ensure resiliency. “By energetically reversing the situation and giving the PV industry the opportunity to supply the European market, Europe can regain control of its energy transition,” said Weber.
The pandemic has shown that Europe should not remain overly dependent on material imports. It is of strategic importance for countries to have regional and local PV value chains. The ESMC has stated that at least 75% of PV demand in Europe should be covered by domestic production. Two-thirds of PV products produced in Europe should be exported, it said.
This would mean building up 60 GW of manufacturing capacity in Europe by 2026. The current trade deficit of €10.5 billion in solar cells and modules could be converted into around €50 billion of PV production on the continent. This would also create around 178,000 new jobs in Europe.
“Based on the current market situation, there is an excellent time window of two to four years to rebuild a competitive photovoltaic production chain, as a global technological change from PERC cells to other technologies such as heterojunction or TOPCon cells is taking place,” the ESMC said.
The organization said that the proposed EU Reconstruction Fund support should focus on three main pillars: PV manufacturing plants and infrastructure, R&D and new product launches, and dedicated financial funds. It is hoped that the €20 billion will help to facilitate a genuine breakthrough for the European PV manufacturing industry, the ESMC said.

The London-based development lender announced the move yesterday in a press release which suggested it would top up the “up to $1.5 million” of concessional-rate loans being offered to the country by the UN's Green Climate Fund.
The private-sector loan package will be distributed by Armenian lender Inecobank, in which the EBRD holds a 22.7% stake.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has estimated there was just 95 MW of grid-connected solar generation capacity in Armenia at the turn of the year.
The EBRD yesterday said it had invested more than €1.5 billion in 187 projects in Armenia to date.

Swiss heterojunction module manufacturer Meyer Burger is currently working to set up production in Germany.
In the future, the Swiss company wants to manufacture its heterojunction solar cells in Bitterfeld, in Saxony-Anhalt, and its modules in Freiberg, Saxony.
The first product launch in Switzerland is planned for April 27. For this purpose, a first official sales partnership has now been concluded with the largest Swiss photovoltaic dealer, Solarmarkt. From the end of April, installers from Switzerland will be able to order the heterojunction Smartwire solar modules from Meyer Burger.
From July, delivery of the modules is expected to begin with “the first significant volumes.” The production capacities in the factories in Germany will initially be 400 megawatts per year but will be expanded. “We see a very positive market development in Switzerland and believe that we will gain significant market shares with our product,” said Moritz Borgmann, managing director of Meyer Burger (Industries) GmbH. Meyer Burger intends to announce further sales partners for its modules in other European target markets, as well as the USA, in the coming weeks.
According to the company, it has worked for around 12 years to bring its solar modules from the laboratory to mass production. By combining heterojunction and smartwire technology, these panels should have around 20% higher energy yield on the same area as today's standard modules. “The solar modules from the new premium brand, Meyer Burger, fill a clear gap in the Swiss market and have great potential,” said Rafael Stadelmann, managing director of Solarmarkt, on the occasion of the sales partnership.

A group of Chinese scientists has recently utilized three types of noise to characterize different parts and types of defects in solar cells through a technique which they described as non-destructive and able to connect directly to the microscopic and medium scale defects in the solar cell materials.
The researchers said that three types of noise were thus far identified in solar cells by previous research: the 1/f noise, which is also known as pink noise and is frequent in electronic devices as a low-frequency phenomenon and in PV devices originates from the diffusion mechanism and recombination mechanism of minority carriers; the so-called microplasma noise in p-n junctions; and the g-r noise caused by the fluctuation of the generation and recombination of electrons in semiconductor-based photon detectors.
“In solar cells, 1/f noise stems mainly from defects on the surface or interface, such as incomplete lattices, unsaturated dangling bonds, or transmission center capture,” the Chinese group explained. “Microplasma noise reflects from the metal impurities and micro-defect clusters in the area of electric charges in the p-n junction space. G-r noise arises mainly from the scattering effect of impurities at deep energy levels inside semiconducting materials on carriers, reflecting defects such as heavy metal contamination precipitation, dislocations, or split levels in the base region or emission-region materials.”
The academics conducted high-temperature stress and radiation stress tests at room temperature on a monocrystalline cell. The tests led them to the conclusion the proposed technique is “superior” to others due to its high sensitivity and non-destructiveness. “In addition, noise can distinguish defects of different types at different parts of the cell, which is conducive to improving the production process and guiding the type selection of products,” they concluded. “Finally, noise can also function as a monitor of the reliability of some components and the encapsulation in a cell panel.”
Their experiment is presented in the paper Noise-based analysis of the reliability of silicon solar cells, published in AIP Advances.

The Quarterly Report on European Electricity Markets for the final three months of last year noted the number of periods of negative electricity pricing doubled from 2019, to almost 1,600 such events.
Having experienced just three negative price events in 2019, the Netherlands recorded almost 100 last year “amid a dramatic increase in solar PV capacity,” in the nation, according to the report.
Whilst stressing the exceptional nature of the Covid-19 pandemic on power consumption patterns, the quarterly update also noted a shift in the hours during which negative electric pricing occurred in renewables poster child Germany. Previously such events were most common at night, during periods of high wind speed and low demand, but 2020 saw a switch to afternoon negative pricing. “Thus,” stated the report, “solar PV became the main driver behind prices falling into negative territory in the German market in 2020 and also put afternoon prices under pressure generally.”
The report also highlighted two instances of scarce electricity–in mid September and on December 9–as evidence of the problems associated with accommodating a rising proportion of intermittent clean energy capacity into the grid, and called for more joined-up cross-border power networks.
Rising solar generation–along with higher gas output, year on year–also helped the Netherlands generate a net surplus of electricity last year, after being a net importer “for many years.” The EU report also noted a beneficial effect of rising solar generation capacity on Hungary‘s national electricity account, and cited a solar “boom” in that country and Poland.
With Covid-19 falls in demand helping renewables generate more of Europe's electricity (39%) than fossil fuels (36%) for the first time, the market report observed the 5% of the bloc's power produced from solar closed in on the 6% accounted for by hard coal. In the final three months of the year, European solar output rose 12%, year on year, to 18 TWh and “the increase was almost single-handedly driven by Spain,” the study added.
With coal and lignite-fired power plunging 22% last year across the bloc, it is estimated the European power sector reduced its carbon footprint 14% although the quarterly report warned cold weather, lower wind speeds and rising gas prices in the opening months of this year are likely to see carbon emissions rebound.
There was good news on the transport front, though, with the report stating the scale of the European “electrically-charged vehicle” fleet doubled in 2020, to 2 million, with almost half a million of the new registrations arriving in the final months of the year. That meant cars with plug sockets accounted for a remarkable 17% of new purchases in Q4, twice the proportion seen in China and a slice of the pie six times bigger than such products claimed in the U.S.

Chile's cumulative PV installations reached 4.6 GW at the end of March, according to the latest figures from ACERA, the Chilean renewable energy association.
The numbers also show that solar plants covered around 12.9% of Chile's total electricity demand in March. All renewable sources combined accounted for 23.6% of total national demand. Overall, total renewable energy capacity in Chile stands at roughly 8.2 GW, accounting for 16.5% of the country's total generating capacity.
Utility-scale PV plants account for most of the country's installed solar capacity, while rooftop PV accounts for 167 MW of the total. Small solar parks with capacities of up to 9 MW – developed under the Pequeños Medios de Generación Distribuida, a program to support distributed generation – account for 1.35 GW of the total.
In February of this year, 7,454 installations accounted for 78.3 MW of capacity under the nation's net-metering scheme. In March, under-construction storage capacity hit 5.1 GW. Solar PV projects accounted for 62% of this capacity, with wind farms accounting for 31%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/14/fraunhofer-ise-develops-front-back-solar-cell-with-26-0-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 14, 2021",Fraunhofer ISE develops front/back solar cell with 26.0% efficiency,"Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) have demonstrated a p-type back junction (BJ) front/back‐contacted (FBC) crystalline silicon solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.0% and a fill factor (FF) of 84.3%.
Presented in the study Design rules for high-efficiency both-sides-contacted silicon solar cells with balanced charge carrier transport and recombination losses, recently published in nature energy, the device demonstrates the high performance of the reported back junction solar cell design with a full-area p-n-junction at the back surface, according to the scientists. “Currently, we are working on commercial production technologies to realize such cells at low cost,” research co-author, Armin Richter, told pv magazine.
The cell was built with a full-area passivating contact based on Fraunhofer ISE's TOPCon technology at the back surface and a highly transparent front surface based on dielectric passivation layers. Compared to conventional industrial cells with a front side p–n junction, the cell features a p–n junction at the back surface in the form of a full-area polycrystalline silicon-based passivating contact.
“The very high FF (84.3%) of this cell, achieved without any full-area conductive layers at the front surface, proves the very effective charge carrier transport in the c-Si bulk to the local front-side contacts,” the paper notes. The cell also showed open-circuit voltage values of up to 732 mV.
The BJ approach, the researchers went on to say, was key to avoid the use of a conductive front surface layer. On the other hand, they also explained, the lateral current transport to the local front contacts is ensured by the crystalline silicon wafer, as it is a majority carrier transport with its inherent high conductivity.
The German group conducted a power-loss analysis which highlighted that the cell is able to balance electron and hole transport losses as well as transport and recombination losses, and concluded that the device exhibited some of the highest performance figures reported for FBC c-Si solar cells to date. “This study demonstrates the potential of these BJ solar cells as a candidate for future c-Si solar cells with efficiencies in the range of 27%, which are expected to play an important role in the next decade,” the researchers stated.

Vanadium redox flow batteries are still not major technologies in the Australian energy storage market, even though they were first developed on Australian soil almost 40 years ago. But this week, in a strange synchronicity, two Australian vanadium producers announced new strategic plans.
TNG Limited, anAustralian mining technology company that owns the Mount Peake vanadium-titanium-iron project, said this week that it has agreed to set up a joint venture with Singapore-based vanadium redox flow battery manufacturer V-Flow Tech. They will collaborate on the development and delivery of new energy power systems, underpinned by vanadium redox flow batteries. V-Flow will supply the battery systems, while TNG will supply high-purity vanadium electrolyte to operate them.
The vanadium electrolyte will be produced at TNG’s Mount Peake project, 230 km north of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. The site is set to produce around 6,000 tons of vanadium pentoxide for vanadium redox flow batteries. TNG said the joint venture represents a major step toward in achieving its vision of becoming a commercial supplier of vanadium redox flow battery systems in Australia.
Australian Vanadium, meanwhile, also announced plans this week to become a commercial supplier of vanadium flow batteries in Australia. It is now developing a new strategy under its VSUN unit. Australian Vanadium is also following in TNG’s footsteps, as it has filed a patent application for its vanadium processing route.
