They found that PV technology could turn the continent's entire energy system into a “solar-to-X economy.”
“Energetic sovereignty is possible for Europe and finally a societal choice,” Christian Breyer, professor of solar economy at LUT, told pv magazine. “100% renewable energy supply for Europe around 2040 is possible.”
Breyer emphasized the importance of PV as the main pillar of an energy system in which electricity is used on a large scale by the heat and mobility sectors.
“The characteristic term for the arising energy system is ‘power-to-X economy’ as direct and indirect electrification is the key element of a sustainable and affordable energy system,” he explained. ‘Hydrogen Economy’ is a misleading view, as hydrogen is not the characteristic element of the arising energy system, but an important intermediate energy carrier in power-to-hydrogen-to-X applications.”
The research group presented the two scenarios in “Reflecting the energy transition from a European perspective and in the global context—Relevance of solar photovoltaics benchmarking two ambitious scenarios,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The researchers aimed to describe the role of solar for the European energy transition within a global context. They used the LUT Energy System Transition Model, which considers heat and electricity demand for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors, as well as transport sector energy demand. In addition, they looked at energy-related CO2 emissions.
“The cost-optimized modeling was conducted in five-year steps, with each modeled year in hourly resolution to ensure the supply–demand balance at each hour,” said the group.
They showed that pre-pandemic-level energy system costs could be reached under both scenarios, with the 2050 scenario presenting an 8.5% lower pathway costs in reaching zero CO2 emissions.
“The largest source of energy is solar PV with 54% to 56% of total primary energy demand and 61% to 63% of total electricity generation in 2050,” they said.
Breyer said that past research had pointed to a share of between 50% and 60% for solar in the overall energy mix by 2050.
“We find slightly more than 60% and this slightly higher PV share is also a consequence of more detailed PV modelling, such as single-axis tracking and diversified PV prosumers, but also a high degree of sector coupling with low-cost batteries and low-cost electrolyzers that support a higher PV share,” he explained.
They concluded that the success of the proposed scenarios will likely depend on the strong interplay between solar, wind, battery storage, electrolyzers, and heat pumps.
“The nature of the arising future energy system can be best termed as a power-to-X economy, as the dominating majority of primary energy is electricity that is used across the energy system in direct applications, such as power-to-heat, power-to-mobility or power-to-water in dry regions, whereas indirect electricity use mainly follows the route of power-to-hydrogen-to-X, with final energy carriers in the form of liquids, methane, ammonia and methanol,” the scientists concluded.

The Portuguese government has unveiled a set of measures (Ley de las Grandes Opciones) to launch new auction schemes for offshore wind and renewable gas, with a particular focus on hydrogen and its derivatives, including ammonia, green methanol, and synthetic fuels. The first green hydrogen tender will be launched this year, according to the document.
The authorities said they want to award 10-year contracts for 3,000 tons of green hydrogen and 10,000 tons of renewable methane.
The reference price for green hydrogen will be €127 ($134.7)/MWh and that for renewable methane will be €62/MWh.
“The bases of the first tender in Portugal for the centralized purchase of biomethane, synthetic methane and green hydrogen have been defined, which will help to start decarbonizing gas consumption in the country,” said Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, the CEO of Hydrogen Europe.
“Congratulations to Joao Galamba, vice minister and secretary of state for energy. He is, without a doubt, the leader of the EU,” Chatzimarkakis said. “This is an important pilot project for the adoption of domestic H2 production in Europe.”
In mid-December, Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa launched the Simplex Ambientales program, which is a package of measures to change the environmental rules for the development of hydrogen and renewable energy projects.
In 2021, the Portuguese government launched a call for hydrogen projects, and it attracted €16 billion ($16.9 billion) of proposed investments. The €40 million that Lisbon is providing to support this initiative is part of the national hydrogen strategy.
*The article was updated on Jan. 4 to add the reference prices for both green hydrogen and renewable methane. It was also amended to specify that the Portuguese government provided €40 million for the initiative and not €40 billion as previously reported.

It said the split-phase inverters have PV input power ratings of up to 7.5 kW, with a maximum PV input current of 15 A and up to 16 modules connected in parallel.
“It is divided into two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs, with a PV input voltage range of 150 V to 500V, enabling PV overloads of up to 150%,” a Bslbatt spokesperson told pv magazine. “The inverters are compatible with most 48 V lithium-iron solar batteries in the market.”
There are three versions of the inverters, with nominal power ratings of 3.6 kW, 4.6 kW, and 5 kW. They have an efficiency rating of 98.0%, and a European efficiency of 97.0%. They measure 580 mm x 350 mm x 230 mm and weigh in at 23.5 kg. The MPPT voltage range is between 120 V and 430 V.
“Two MPPT trackers essentially allow the inverter to treat the PV as two separate systems, ensuring that [the] solar power system works efficiently under any conditions,” Bslbatt said in a statement.
The inverters can be used in projects at altitudes of up to 2,000 meters, in temperatures ranging from -25 C to 60 C. They feature natural cooling mode, IP65 protection rating, and a 10-year warranty.
The new line includes lithium batteries with voltages ranging from 41.6 V to 58.5 V, and a maximum charge/discharge current of 100 A for the 5 kW and 4.6 kW hybrid inverters. That drops to 85 A for the 3.6 kW devices, according to the company.
The maximum off-grid output power ranges between 3.6 kW and 4.5 kW. The output voltage is 230 V and the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) switch is less than 20 milliseconds.
Bslbatt said the line will be available in the European and African markets.

The global popularity of energy storage systems has been reflected in a lithium price which rose from $10,000 in the summer to $80,000 in the autumn.
The deployment of battery storage with solar in all project sizes, and the popularity of electric vehicles, is stoking demand. Consider, for example, the €1 million ($1.06 million*) budget allocated by the Lithuanian government last year for a program to help people buy residential batteries which was swallowed up on day one by almost 300 applications worth an average €4,200 each. With electricity companies increasingly turning away from paying fixed fees for excess solar energy fed into their grids by households, in favor of selling such energy on the wholesale market at rock-bottom prices, and demand for storage systems is being stoked even further.
Inverters play an increasingly important role in residential solar-plus-storage systems. Traditional inverters converting power from a battery into the alternating current required by grids operate on factual data, such as electricity meter readings and the operation of a solar array, which can mean battery charge cycles are not conserved.
Solar households increasingly want their inverters to be a more efficient “brain” of their solar-plus-storage systems by using artificial intelligence (AI) to manage the battery storage cycles, for example by taking expected future usage patterns into account.
It is widely known that more-intelligent inverters maximize the potential of solar households to save money, including by harnessing time-of-use electricity tariffs so batteries are charged when prices are low and the energy is released when grid prices peak.
What may not be appreciated yet is just how much money-saving punch smart inverters can pack and it is worth considering a few examples to illustrate the point.
Consider a 10 kWp solar array which generates 39 kWh of solar energy daily. The system generates 19 kWh more per day than is consumed by the household. Without a battery, that excess electricity – 49% of the power produced – is exported to the grid.
Graphics: Inion Software
In this case, a 19 kWh lithium battery would not be enough to store all the surplus energy. Lithium-ion batteries should never be fully charged or discharged. To maximize battery life, the minimum and maximum state of charge should be limited to 10% and 90%, respectively. Effective battery capacity is, therefore, 80% of the nominal figure, so a 24 kWh device is more appropriate to store 19 kWh of excess energy.

At the start of each day, the battery charge level should be 10% of nominal device capacity and excess energy will be stored throughout the day and drawn down as required, for instance each morning as energy demand rises and solar production is not sufficient. Choosing the largest battery – 24 kWh, in our example – may not be the best strategy, however, due to the high lithium, and therefore battery costs already mentioned. Plus, in autumn and winter, the solar panels will generate less power, meaning less excess energy to manage. Just as with choosing solar array size, household electricity consumption must be considered.
To illustrate the factors to take into account when sizing a battery, consider the purely theoretical scenario of a household which consumes 46 kWh daily, all of which comes from the grid. Assuming one hour per day of absolute minimum electricity price, unlimited ability to draw down electricity from the grid during that hour, and unlimited battery charging capacity, the ideal lithium battery would have a nominal capacity of 58 kWh, that could be charged during an hour and then offer the electricity to be drawn down for the rest of the day.
Remember also that lithium batteries have a limited lifetime so there is a cost to storing energy in a battery above the initial purchase price. A lithium battery life cycle is considered over once a device can only charge to 80% of its nominal capacity. Knowing a battery's capacity, price, and number of cycles, enables the calculation of the average cost of storing 1 kWh of energy. The calculation becomes more accurate if the battery's depth of discharge is known, as that affects the device's number of cycles.
Considering another example, of a solar array with a 10 kWh lithium battery, indicates just how “smart,” inverters can be. In conventional cost-minimization mode, the battery charges between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. daily, when the electricity price is lowest and the solar panels are not generating sufficient energy, for release during the day. A non-AI enabled inverter, however, does not include the cost of storing each kilowatt-hour of electricity, based on battery capability. If that ongoing cost of storing energy was 0.06 currency units, as in the diagram below, it would not make sense to charge the battery at that point, when the purchase price of the system is thrown in. A smart inverter, however, can take such nuances into account and switch battery management modes accordingly.
Research by Inion Software has indicated an ability to turn almost any inverter into a smart device. All that is required is a “logger” which gives the inverter more options for battery management. The logger should enable an inverter to manage a battery under five scenarios: cost-minimization; energy self-consumption; “peak shaving” (evening out energy consumption); electricity self-sufficiency; and curtailment of excess energy.
Our studies show numerous inverters feature parameters which can be adjusted, making it easier to connect a logger.
Not all devices are so malleable, however. We tested one inverter which gives a command to charge the battery to a certain level but then switches the storage system to self-consumption mode. A smart logger, reacting to the situation most favorable for the customer in real time, can instead switch the battery to cost-minimization mode but the inverter we tested in this case did not “listen” to the logger.
Inverter makers can address this problem by modifying their device operating program sufficiently to enable third-party companies to control the charging and discharging capacity of batteries after connection to an inverter. This would enable inverters to manage batteries intelligently and learn how customers use household electricity.

The new panels are based on its HItouch 5N series, but they feature larger 210 mm wafers instead of 182 mm wafers.
“The modules are suitable for ground-mounted plants,” a Hanersun spokesperson told pv magazine.
The company said its TOPCon cells are based on a new surface passivation technology and metal contact system for perfect optical matching and maximum light absorption. It is offering 10 different versions of the Hitouch6N panels, with power outputs ranging from 605 W to 695 W. The power conversion efficiencies range from 21.38% to 22.37%.
The higher-output modules have open-circuit voltages between 47.2 V and 48 V, and short-circuit current between 18.14 A and 18.30 A. The panels can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and operating temperatures of -40 C to 85 C.
They measure 2,384 mm x 1,1303 mm x 35 mm, feature a waterproof junction box with an IP68 rating, and a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy. The panels have a temperature coefficient of 0.31%.
The HItouch 6N modules are available in both monofacial and bifacial formats. The monofacial panels weigh 34.4 kg, while the bifacial weigh 38.7 kg. Both sides of the bifacial modules are covered with 2.0 mm glass. Its bifaciality can reportedly reach up to 85%.
For the bifacial modules, the degradation rate in the first year is purportedly 1%, with 30-year end power output guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the total nominal output power. For the monofacial modules, 25 years of power output are guaranteed to be no less than 89.4% of the nominal output power, with 1% degradation in the first year.

“By mid-2022, 1.92 million PV installations were connected to the grid in the country, the majority of which can be found on homes,” Dutch solar analyst Peter Segaar told pv magazine. “The provisional figures also indicate that one-fifth of the total number of homes in the Netherlands already had a PV system on the roof at the end of 2021.”
Segaar said the newly installed capacity for the first six months of 2022 was in line with the growth of the previous two years. 
“But we already see a lot of problems in the field, in particular with connecting the many large rooftop and ground-mounted projects,” he added. “There are many delays, and the problems will not be easily solved in the short run.”
Growth in the residential segment could partly compensate for such delays.
“It is very hard to predict how long the yearly volumes will remain high, even in the light of still very large remaining allocated SDE++ portfolios,” Segaar said, in reference to capacity allocated through the scheme for large-scale renewables.
“In 2023, I expect a rather large grid-connected delivery of solar plants, and large rooftops, so maybe we will see another record year,” he said. “But we will know for sure only in a very late time frame.”
Cumulative installed PV capacity in the Netherlands reached 16.85 GW at the end of June 2022. CBS, which adjusts its figures on a regular basis, said the nation installed 3,803 MW in 2021 and 3,882 MW in 2022.
