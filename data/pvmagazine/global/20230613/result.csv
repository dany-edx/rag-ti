The selection of a winning bidder is scheduled for the middle of August. The government has planned two bidding rounds this year, with a total volume of 1,300 GWh, and the first round aims to allocate half of this volume. South Korea has described the initiative as “the world's first hydrogen power generation bidding market.” In recent weeks, South Korea has engaged in energy collaboration discussions with several countries, including Azerbaijan, France, Japan, and Oman. Seoul is focusing on hydrogen production as it shifts away from nuclear power.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released a report on Oman's potential as a competitive low-emissions hydrogen supplier. It notes Oman's solar and wind resources, as well as its expansive land area, as key factors. Oman aims to produce at least 1 million tons of renewable hydrogen per year by 2030, with targets of up to 3.75 million tons by 2040 and 8.5 million tons by 2050 – surpassing current hydrogen demand in Europe. “The 2040 hydrogen target would represent 80% of Oman's current LNG exports in energy-equivalent terms, while achieving the 2050 target would almost double them,” said the IEA.
The Queensland government has approved funding for major water projects. The Australian state will offer AUD 8 million ($5.4 million) over a period of two years for a detailed assessment of the water requirements for the hydrogen industry in the city of Gladstone.
Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development have closed a $504.4 million loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy's (DoE) Loan Programs Office to develop the world's largest industrial green hydrogen facility in central Utah. Michael Ducker, the vice president for Mitsubishi Power Americas, said that the loan will create a path to accelerate the long-term hydrogen market across the United States.
Lhyfe and Capital Energy have signed a collaboration agreement to jointly develop offshore renewable hydrogen projects in Spain and Portugal. “Under the agreement, the two companies will work together to create hydrogen production sites at some of the offshore wind farm sites currently being developed by Capital Energy,” said Lhyfe. “The Spanish energy company already has a development pipeline of more than 7.5 gigawatts (GW) in both countries.”
Thyssenkrupp has announced plans to list Thyssenrupp nucera's shares on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The initial public offering of ThyssenKrupp nucera's shares will likely be completed “before the summer break, subject to capital market conditions,” said the two companies.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/13/reducing-solar-module-temperature-with-acrylic-sheets/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JORDAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 13, 2023",Reducing solar module temperature with acrylic sheets,"Scientists at the Mutah University in Jordan have sought the reduce the operating temperature of photovoltaic panels by placing clear acrylic sheets in various slops over the modules at a distance of approximately 30 cm.
The researchers said that 3 mm acrylic sheets can reflect and absorb 10% of solar radiation with wavelengths below 1.1 μm, which is insufficient for exciting electrons in PV power generation. They believe this unused radiation contributes to increased panel temperature and reduced performance.
“All of these wasted solar radiations will just heat the PV panel and increase the surface temperature,” the researchers stated.
For their experiments, the researchers used three 30-degree tilted monocrystalline solar panels, each with a power of 50 W, dimensions of 630 mm x 540 mm x 18 mm, and weighing 3.3 kg.
They used one panel as a reference without the acrylic sheet, while the second panel had a sheet installed at a 30 mm distance with variable slopes of 15, 30, and 45 degrees. The third panel had a parallel-mounted sheet at the same distance.
Through analysis and tests, the scientists found that the panel with slopes of 30 and 45 degrees experienced the highest temperature reduction at 14.5%, while the panel with the parallel-mounted sheet achieved a decrease of around 10%.
“The reduction in PV surface temperature led to an increase in PV electrical efficiency and output power of about 2% each,” they explained. “The results of all experiments demonstrated that installing a clear acrylic sheet will reduce the PV surface temperatures, enhance the performance, increase the electrical energy production, and extend the cell life.”
They introduced the new tech in “Installing clear acrylic sheet to reduce unwanted sunlight waves that photovoltaic panels receive,” which was recently published in Results in Engineering.

The European Electricity Review 2023, published by clean energy think tank Ember, says EU solar electricity generation grew by 24% to 203 TWh last year, from 164 TWh in 2021. That increase brought the share of solar in the EU electricity mix to 7.3%. The European Union increased solar generation capacity from 103 GW in 2018 to 209 GW in 2022. Capacity could rise 54 GW this year, in a medium scenario, or up to 68 GW.
Ukrainian PV mirrors the European trend, albeit slower. In 2019, pre-pandemic and before the latest invasion, Ukraine was in the top five fastest growing European solar markets, with 4 GW of solar added annually. Utility projects almost halted last year, with the onset of war, but rooftop solar is growing.
The chart below does not accurately demonstrate the reality facing Ukraine’s solar industry. A Secretariat of the Energy Charter study estimates at least 15% of Ukrainian solar plants – around 1 GW of capacity – are damaged, destroyed, or occupied. Some projects have been affected by theft.

There have also been cases of targeted missile attacks on solar power plants and mines laid at solar projects in recently liberated Ukrainian territory.
Attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have caused more than $10 billion worth of damage and left more than 12 million people without, or with limited access to, electricity – as well as disrupting water and heating systems. This was the finding delivered by the comprehensive energy damage assessment conducted by the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank.
With regular blackouts across the whole country, renewable energy often becomes the only local source of electricity for municipalities and residents. Significant growth in the residential sector is evident with autonomous or hybrid PV, the latter combined with residential battery storage systems. Ukrainian businesses also follow the trend and are installing solar rooftops to have their own electricity production for consumption.
Ukraine benefits from the advantages of the renewable energy technology in the country’s darkest hour. And the Ukrainian government recently initiated the introduction of a net billing support scheme for solar – instead of feed-in tariffs – for prosumers.
At the same time, the process of rebuilding Ukraine has already begun and energy has a central place in these early endeavors. Affected solar power plants have already been reconstructed in the Kherson and Kharkiv regions. Some have been fully renovated and have started to supply electricity again. It is very important to have more distributed energy sources for the Ukrainian electricity system as it has suffered from power shortages since October 2022. Conventional power generation facilities damaged by Russian strikes can be replaced by renewable energy.
The prime minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, says the government intends to actively tap the potential of renewable energy including solar, wind, hydro, and green hydrogen technology. Shmyhal says the Russian attacks are pushing Ukraine towards radical reform by driving a decentralized energy system.
“Then it will be less vulnerable to enemy attacks,” says the PM. “We are talking about the creation of mini power plants and small generation facilities implemented in the existing energy system.”
The Solar Energy Association of Ukraine estimates that, under its “energy transition” scenario, the nation’s installed capacity of PV should reach at least 17 GW by 2030. The plans are to reach up to 20 GW of installed solar capacity for residential buildings and communal buildings by the end of the decade.
Ukraine has very favorable conditions for the development of PV plants and potential for the production of green hydrogen. The country has already started commercial electricity exports to European countries after synchronization with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity last year.
One of the most important directions of the future development of Ukraine is the deployment of self-sufficient microgrids. Power outages caused by numerous missile attacks and the resultant blackouts in the fall of 2022 have raised the topic of microgrids based on renewables up the agenda. Microgrids can include solar power plants, small wind power facilities, bio- and small hydropower plants, and storage systems.
Microgrids are almost impossible to eliminate with missiles if there are several thousand of them in a country of the size of Ukraine. The technology has huge potential for local and foreign investment as part of the reconstruction of Ukraine.
Despite the war, Ukrainian solar companies are helping the nations of the EU to achieve energy independence. Ukraine is also a participant in the European solar industry, for instance in the production of mounting systems. Ukrainian engineering, procurement, and construction services companies have significant experience in the installation of solar energy facilities, having built more than 5 GW of generation capacity in Ukraine, the Baltic region, and elsewhere in Europe.

H2C said the Goondiwindi Hydrogen project is moving to the procurement and construction phase, following the announcement of a financial investment decision and the formal execution of a 20-year agreement with the Goondiwindi Regional Council.
H2C said the new hydrogen production facility will use the power generated from a 2.5 MW solar array and wastewater from the Goondiwindi wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to produce green hydrogen via electrolysis with early estimates indicating the facility could produce up to 1,350 tons of renewable hydrogen per year.
While most of the initial output has been earmarked for local customers including agricultural users and heavy industry, H2C, which will manage the production and sale of the project’s hydrogen, said it is now in a position to confirm supply arrangements for other businesses, governments and project consortia requiring green hydrogen.
“Given that the majority of green hydrogen projects currently in development are not supplying the domestic retail market, H2C is in a unique position to discuss viable supply solutions with businesses and projects situated along the eastern seaboard of Australia,” said the company. “While the majority of supply for the initial stages of the project has been secured for locals in Goondiwindi, H2C has the capability to rapidly increase green hydrogen production to meet additional requirements. Pending volume requirements, this supply can commence in the first quarter of 2024.”
H2C said construction of the Goondiwindi Hydrogen project will commence within the next month. It is planned to be operational before the end of the year.
Brisbane-based H2C said coupling a green hydrogen production facility alongside a wastewater treatment plant helped overcome issues relating to securing water supply. About nine liters of water are needed to produce 1kg of green hydrogen via electrolysis, with 8 kg of oxygen as a byproduct.

Pexapark, a Swiss consultancy, said in its April monthly report that electricity markets are now recovering, following a series of uncontrollable events that have affected the European energy industry.
On the price front, the Pexa Euro Composite Index fell by 2.5% month-on-month due to declining electricity and raw material prices. The Netherlands experienced the largest decline of 9.5% to €56.72/MWh, while Spain and Portugal saw drops of 6.4% and 6.2% respectively, reaching €40.90/MWh and €39.60/MWh.
However, prices in the United Kingdom rose by 3.5% to €82.29/MWh in April, and Scandinavian countries increased by 1% to €50/MWh, while Italy saw a 0.7% increase to €75.60/MWh.
After a strong first quarter of 2023, PPA activity slowed down in April, with 16 announcements totaling approximately 922 MW, a 55% decrease compared to March. This represents the lowest monthly capacity since last September, with eight fewer agreements registered, reflecting a decrease of 33%.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
The notable deal this month involved Statkraft's acquisition of NextEnergy's 210 MW Portuguese solar portfolio, resulting in a purchase of 341 GWh per year.

The propane L series is “ideal for retrofit applications when renovating a home with existing radiators,” Panasonic said in a statement. It noted that the series K is designed for new build applications. The propane heat pumps have a heating capacity of 5 kW to 8 kW, measure 996 mm x 980 mm x 430 mm, and weigh 98 kg.
They have a coefficient of performance (COP) of up to 5, according to the company's datasheet. The air source temperature can range from -25 to 35 C for heat, and from 10 C to 43 C for cooling. The heat pumps can purportedly produce hot water up to 75 C.
Their seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) for heating water to 35 C in an “average climate” varies between 5.06 and 4.84, while the SCOP for 35 C applications in “cold climates” varies from 4.25 to 4.31. For 55 C applications, the SCOP is up to 3.67 and 3.33, respectively. The heat pumps are also “smart grid ready” for PV, according to Panasonic.
“The new Aquarea K and L generations benefit from a reduced sound level, up to 8dB(A) less than the previous models,” the manufacturer said. “This advantage makes the installation more flexible by offering more placement possibilities.”
The two models share the same design, with an outdoor unit in anthracite gray and a white indoor unit. The Aquarea K and L series became available in the spring.

It says the world installed 239 GW of new solar capacity in 2022, equivalent to a 45% annual growth rate – the highest since 2016. It was another record year for solar, driven once again by China, with almost 100 GW added in a single year and a 72% growth rate. The United States held onto second place, despite a 6.9% drop in installations to 21.9 GW, followed by India with 17.4 GW, and Brazil with 10.9 GW. Spain is also becoming Europe’s largest PV market with 8.4 GW, according to SolarPower Europe. The figures differ slightly from other research firms. BloombergNEF, for example, said that global capacity additions hit 268 GW in 2022.
Overall, 26 countries added more than 1 GW of solar in 2022. These countries include China, the United States, India, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Japan, Poland, The Netherlands, Australia, South Korea, Italy, France, Taiwan, Chile, Denmark, Turkey, Greece, South Africa, Austria, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Hungary, Pakistan, Israel, and Switzerland.
The rooftop segment grew by 50% last year, with installations reaching 118 GW from 79 GW in 2021. Utility-scale solar grew by 41% to hit 121 GW, despite high module prices in 2021 and 2022.
“Large-scale systems remained the main contributor to the total capacity, but the shares of utility and rooftop solar have not been this close to each in three years; utility-scale contributed to 50.5% of total installations and rooftop contributed to 49.5%,” said SolarPower Europe.
Among the top 20 solar markets, Australia, South Korea, and Japan installed less rooftop solar compared to the previous year, with reductions of 2.3 GW, 1.1 GW, and 0.5 GW, respectively. However, all other top 20 markets posted growth in the rooftop segment.
“The most impressive progress could be witnessed in Brazil, which added an additional 5.3 GW. This giant 193% growth rate from 2021 was pushed by the rush of installations that sought to benefit [from] the generous conditions of the net-metering scheme before the rule changes in 2023,” said SolarPower Europe.
Italy and Spain posted rooftop market growth rates of 127% and 105%, respectively, driven by residential installations in Italy and self-consumption in Spain. Denmark, India, Austria, China, Greece, and South Africa all experienced rooftop growth rates exceeding 50%. China led the market with 51.1 GW of installed systems, accounting for 54% of its total installations in 2022.
SolarPower Europe predicts a 35% growth in the rooftop segment in 2023, with an anticipated addition of 159 GW. The figure could rise to 183 GW by 2024 and potentially reach 268 GW by 2027, according to the medium scenario. The growth will be more consistent compared to 2022, as it will be driven by energy prices returning to lower levels.
On a global scale, the utility-scale segment is expected to reach 182 GW in 2023, marking a 51% growth from the previous year. The forecast for 2024 is 218 GW, with further growth projected to reach 349 GW by 2027.
“The forecast is bright – between 341 and 402 GW of solar will be installed worldwide in 2023. From a total TW solar fleet today, the world could be installing 1 TW of solar annually by the end of the decade – hitting up to 800 GW per year already in 2027,” concluded SolarPower Europe.

In the historic Riotinto open-pit copper mine, energy consumption accounts for 70% of the carbon footprint resulting from operations. Consequently, Atalaya Mining decided to drastically cut this figure: for the environment, for the efficiency of the mine, and for the high Health, safety, environment, and quality (HSEQ) standards the company has set in the 21st century.
Atalaya has always been keen on the path Riotinto should follow to ensure the extraction and supply of strategically important raw materials for the continent, while remaining committed to the environment. The company seeks to combine sustainable self-production of energy with supply safety and a reduction in energy costs.
The largest photovoltaic plant at a Spanish mine
The partnership between Enel and Atalaya will result in the largest photovoltaic plant ever built in a mine in Spain. The Riotinto Mine project will cover an area of over 234,000 square meters with 75,765 photovoltaic panels, boasting a total capacity of 50 MW. The solar project will feature a dedicated substation to carry out the electrical transformation from 132 to 30 kV (from high to low voltage).
The plant will cover 25% of Riotinto's energy needs, delivering major economic savings on energy costs, while the mine will see a reduction of 40,000 tonnes in CO2 emissions, equivalent to 173,000 oil barrels. That's the same amount consumed by 20,000 Spaniards in one year.
Atalaya's €300 million investment will extend well beyond the mine's lifespan. The joint project with Enel X Global Retail will generate permanent employment in the area, which is a significant added value. And this is just the beginning: the two companies are already looking ahead, with a new project in the starting blocks at Galicia’s Touro mine.
Enel X Global Retail, a unit of Enel S.p.A., aims to provide an integrated ecosystem of energy supply and value-added solutions across all sectors, even the most challenging ones. By developing economically and environmentally sustainable projects that anticipate future needs and empower industrial players to take control of their energy, Enel works to prove that cost-effectiveness, innovation, and sustainability can actually coexist.

The system will be used to help balance Belgian Elia's electricity grid as more renewables come online.
Eneco said last week that it has obtained permits, ordered the battery, and initiated preparatory study works to make the project operational by the end of 2024. The four-hour battery power plant in Ville-sur-Haine, Wallonia, will be comprised of 53 Tesla Megapacks and could become one of the largest battery projects by capacity in Belgium. However, French energy company Engie recently sought permits to deploy three battery plants with a cumulative power of 380 MW/1.52 GWh, which could outshine Eneco's plant, if delivered.
The Dutch utility has already deployed 128 onshore wind turbines, as part of Belgium's two largest offshore wind farms and nearly 400,000 solar panels in the country, and is now looking to further strengthen its green energy credentials.
“We are strengthening our renewable energy activities in order to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. In this regard, energy storage is very important to absorb the fluctuations of renewable energy. This project is an important step for us towards a CO2-neutral energy system in 2035,” said Tine Deheegher, manager of renewable energy solutions at Eneco.
Eneco, which is controlled by Japan’s Mitsubishi, has used the project announcement to urge the Dutch government to encourage energy storage deployment on its home turf.
“With this project, Eneco is taking a new step towards a fully sustainable energy system in Belgium and fulfilling the One Planet Plan with the ambition of being fully climate neutral by 2035,” the utility said, adding that the Netherlands needs 10 GW of battery storage by 2030, but presently has only 300 MW installed. “We call on the Dutch government to learn from policies in Belgium and Germany so that the Netherlands can actually achieve a climate-neutral electricity supply by 2035.”

The packaging solutions manufacturer claims a minimal gain for plant configurations with modules mounted on fixed driven piles, with 0.8 meters clearance between module rows and an inclination of 20 degrees. It also claims bifacial gains of up to 40%, which can vary depending on the configuration of the solar plant.
The Helios Reflect System (HRS) “combines a weed suppression layer to control weed flora and preserve the benefits of using bifacial modules with an albedo enhancement layer that maximizes the solar irradiation received by the rear side of the PV modules,” George Papagiannis, sales and marketing manager in the plastics division of Thrace Group, told pv magazine.
The top layer is made of polypropylene resins, giving it flame-retardant properties, while the permeable membrane preserves soil biodiversity and moisture content, allowing for complete land restoration once removed. The material is durable, reusable, and recyclable at the end of its service life, with the top layer lasting over five years and the bottom layer lasting about 10, according to Papagiannis.
Thrace Group installed the solution in two 1 MW bifacial PV plants in Xanthi, Northern Greece, and compared the measurements with a control 1 MW installation in the same area over a year.
The HRS installations showed a 69% increase in albedo reflectance and a bifacial gain increase from 12% to 17%. The electricity production attributed to the rear side of the bifacial modules increased by at least 42%, resulting in a total energy yield rise of at least 4.5%, according to Thrace Group.
“It is up to the stakeholders of a PV project to determine which plant’s features need to be optimized so that AC capacity does not limit the project’s potential in maximizing the benefits of the albedo enhancement,” said Papagiannis.
Thrace Group estimates that approximately 2,000 square meters of HRS can be installed per working day with a team of at least three workers. The installation cost for the product is €0.014 ($0.015)/W, including materials, labor, and accessories. The company will showcase the HRS solution at Intersolar Europe in Munich, Germany.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/13/solaredge-unveils-power-optimizers-for-residential-commercial-pv/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ISRAEL,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 13, 2023","SolarEdge unveils power optimizers for residential, commercial PV","Israeli inverter manufacturer SolarEdge is unveiling two new power optimizers for residential and commercial PV systems at Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany.
“In the residential segment, the company is introducing the S500A power optimizer for short strings,” said SolarEdge. “This new product allows for a cost-efficient design of smaller rooftop systems with higher power modules. Following a growing demand for higher power modules across the markets in Europe, the S500A can be used on systems with as few as six modules using the SolarEdge home short string three phase inverter and the SolarEdge home single phase wave/hub inverter, or 10 modules using any SolarEdge residential three phase inverter.”
The S500A has a rated input DC power of 500 W with a maximum efficiency of 99.5% and a weighted efficiency of 98.6%. The dimensions of the S500A are 129 mm x 165 mm x 45 mm, and it weighs 790 g.
“For the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, the company is introducing the 2:1 S1400 power optimizer for high-input, bifacial, and high-power 700W modules, including G12 modules,” SolarEdge said. “The increased output current allows the PV system to be designed with fewer, yet more powerful strings, resulting in a typical around 30% reduction in DC balance of system costs.”
The S1400 has a rated input DC power of 1.4 kW with a maximum efficiency of 99.5% and a weighted efficiency of 98.8%. The dimensions of the S1400 are 129 mm x 155 mm x 52 mm, and it weighs 1.087 kg. The device is designed to connect to two PV modules in series and includes a 25-year warranty. The optimizers come with an IP68 enclosure and support a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V.
“Both new power optimizers include SolarEdge’s multi-layered suite of safety features,” the manufacturer stated. “The SafeDC feature allows the PV systems’ DC voltage to be automatically reduced to touch-safe levels (1V DC per module), in grid failures or when the inverter is shut down. The Rapid Shutdown feature enables installers to activate SafeDC at the flip of a switch, discharging the conductors to safe voltage levels within just 30 seconds.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/13/potential-benefits-and-challenges-of-pv-powered-vehicles/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"JUNE 13, 2023",Potential benefits and challenges of PV-powered vehicles,"The market for PV-powered vehicles is in its early stages. PV-powered vehicles offer benefits in terms of a further reduction of CO2 emissions in electric vehicles. However, there are some challenges still to be overcome before PV-powered vehicles can become ubiquitous. The Task 17 team of the International Energy Agency's Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS Task 17) published a report based on preliminary results in 2021 (State-of-the-Art and Expected Benefits of PV-Powered Vehicles) aiming to clarify the potential of PV in transport and proposed ways to realize these concepts.
To a certain extent, PV-powered vehicles replace grid or charging station electricity with on-board PV generated electricity. This offers benefits for users in terms of reduction of CO2 emissions (in most countries), cost savings, and reduction in the frequency of grid charging, as well as “cool” benefits in terms of autonomy and independence.
The vast majority in the development of PV-powered vehicles are passenger car-based projects, especially short driving range commuter vehicles, ultra-light weight vehicles, and high efficiency vehicles with silicon-based cells being the most common technology used. PV-power can, however, also be considered for auxiliary components including air conditioning systems, refrigerators, and heating systems in heavier commercial vehicles, such as truck trailers, delivery vehicles, and buses. For these latter applications, PV power often helps reduce fuel consumption, which seems a compelling proposition from a financial point of view.
The environmental impact
Case studies on the reduction of CO2 emissions in PV-powered passenger vehicles have been conducted in Japan and the Netherlands, and these have shown that benefits of PV-powered vehicles depend on variables such as driving patterns, available solar irradiance on the vehicle, vehicle efficiency, battery size, PV capacity installed, and the utilization of the PV resource. For longer driving distances in particular, a reduction of emissions of approximately 220 kg CO2-eq/year has been observed in Japan; however, the reduction of CO2 emissions depends on the carbon intensity of the local grid and varies from one country to another. To highlight these differences, the expected environmental benefits of PV-powered vehicles have been estimated for various cities by scientists of the IEA PVPS Task 17 (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1: Comparison of CO2 emissions for each location with and without PV
In most cases, CO2 emissions are reduced during the operation of the vehicle by the on-board PV. However, in countries with low carbon grid energy (see Bern (Switzerland) and Paris (France) in Fig. 1), the embedded CO2 based on the manufacturing of the PV modules might lead to slightly higher lifetime emissions. State-of-the-art well-integrated PV technologies such as curved, flexible, and lightweight PV modules, in addition to higher efficiency PV technologies and longer PV component lifetimes, will contribute to increased PV electricity generation and to lower embedded emissions. Expected future higher PV efficiencies will allow for even better performing PV-powered vehicles.
The total and relative reduction in charging frequency for the different locations is directly related to the amount of PV energy generated (see Fig. 2).

Fig. 2: Comparison of total charging frequency for the long-range vehicle (left axis) and the relative reduction in charging frequency (right axis), for the simple 15 km commute profile
As shown in Figure 2, without PV, the charging frequency is very similar in all cities. With PV, the locations with higher irradiance – Canberra, Madrid and Rabat – see the largest reduction in charging frequency as PV contributes more to the driving energy needed.
Current issues for realizing PV-powered vehicles
PV modules integrated into vehicles will be tested and rated by two standards: as a PV system and as an electric exterior component of the vehicle. In comparison to standard home PV systems, which are installed in such a way as to avoid shades on the installation, PV modules on the roof of a car will often be shaded and are not oriented to optimize for the utilization of solar energy.
PV-powered vehicles can be optimized by taking into account solar irradiation, vehicle efficiency, battery capacity, and the efficiency of the PV power system. Any surplus electricity produced could be fed into the grid or used in connected buildings.
In order to realize the market potential of PV-powered vehicles, expected benefits should be further validated and evaluated on energy and environmental aspects, as well as the perspective of users. The results will form a solid basis for discussions with stakeholders such as automotive companies and policymakers.

Wavelabs developed its Sinus-3000 Pro line for manufacturers who want a “fast, cost-efficient” module characterization tool. It can be configured as an “all-in-one system” to perform power measurements, bypass diode testing, insulation testing, visual inspection, and electroluminescence measurements. Suitable for high-efficiency cell technologies, such as heterojunction (HJT) and tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology, it can be outfitted with a rear-side flasher to test bifacial modules.
The Sinus-3000 Pro will be marketed in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, the Americas Asia Pacific, and India, according to the company.
The research laboratory-oriented tool, Sinus-3000 Advanced, was developed to test perovskite-silicon tandem, multi-junction and other new material cells. It has up to forty-five LED modules with twenty-six individually controllable LED channels in its basic configuration and provides continuous illumination, spectra selection, and shifting light intensity.
The Sinus-3000 Advanced emerged from a collaboration between UK-based tandem solar cell pioneer, Oxford PV, the German Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), and Wavelabs. “It is important to provide highly precise and reproducible measurements for emerging technologies like perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells as soon as possible so that there can be objective competition,” said Prof. Stefan Glunz, Division Director for Photovoltaic Technologies, Fraunhofer ISE, in a statement.
Wavelabs will be demonstrating the equipment at Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany

Form Energy, a Massachusetts-based grid-scale energy storage developer, announced a definitive agreement with Georgia Power, a Southern Company utility, to deploy a 15 MW / 1.5 GWh iron-air battery into the utility’s Georgia grid, providing a 100-hour dispatch long-duration energy storage (LDES) system.
The multi-day LDES project is part of Georgia Power’s integrated plan to deploy additional cost-effective clean energy systems for grid reliability and resiliency. Subject to regulatory approval, the battery project is projected to enter commercial operations in 2026.
“Our customers, including many businesses and commercial accounts, are increasingly interested in the use of new technologies such as multi-day energy storage to help grow renewable energy and enhance reliability, especially as they relocate or grow their operations in Georgia,” said Kim Greene, president and chief executive officer of Georgia Power. “Form Energy’s technology is cutting edge and we’re excited to continue to work with them to serve our customers.”
Form Energy and the utility are collaborating to fully evaluate and demonstrate the 100-hour iron-air battery project will strengthen the local grid against normal daily, weekly and seasonal weather variability, in addition to extreme weather events, the developer said. This includes analysis modeled by Georgia Power and input from Formware, Form Energy’s investment and operational modeling software tool for power grids.
“We are pleased to strengthen our relationship through this partnership with Georgia Power and look forward to delivering an innovative multi-day energy storage system that will provide grid reliability and resiliency in their service territory for years to come,” said Mateo Jaramillo, chief executive officer and co-founder of Form Energy.
Georgia Power provides electricity to 2.7 million customers in all but four Georgia counties. In 2022, regulator Georgia Public Service Commission approved the utility’s long-term integrated resource plan (IRP). The utility has already deployed a large grid storage project, the 265 MW McGrau Ford battery facility, a lithium-ion battery project in Cherokee County, Ga., and an additional 500 MW of storage assets.
Besides the Form Energy project, the utility has a 65 MW project under development in Talbot County and a 13 MW project deployment for the U.S. Army located at Fort Stewart, near Savannah, Ga.
Form Energy was founded in 2017 by energy storage veterans who shared a unified mission to reshape the global electric system by creating a new class of low-cost multi-day energy storage systems.
The company began construction of its Weirton, West Virginia battery factory in May and plans to start manufacturing iron-air battery systems in 2024 for commercialization. The Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that the state was able to structure a unique financial incentive package worth up to $290 million in asset-based, performance financing to support their decision to locate in Weirton.
The company has raised over $820 million in growth equity funding to date, with a most recent $450 million Series E round completed in October 2022 from TPG Rise Fund, GIC and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Prior investors include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Capricorn Investment Group, Energy Impact Partners, ArcelorMittal, MIT’s The Engine, Prelude Ventures and VamosVentures, among others.
