In the weeks ahead, engineers will install the hydrogen electrolyzer modules in a pilot plant and then integrate them into Emsland's infrastructure. RWE said that Linde will deliver a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer for pilot plant “in the near future.” The German energy producer, which plans to start operating the pilot plant in the fall, said it will use renewables to generate up to 290 kg of green hydrogen per hour.
INNIO has ordered two electrolyzers with a total capacity of 2 MW from H-TEC Systems for its plants in Jenbach, Austria. The gas engine manufacturer said the entire Jenbacher engine product line will likely be ready for 100% hydrogen operation by 2025. The 2 MW system, which will be built in a containerized design, will produce up to 900 kg of green hydrogen per day, with a system efficiency of 74%.
Fusion Fuel has signed a 10-year offtake contract with European developer Hydrogen Ventures for 30 tons of green hydrogen per year. It said the first orders will likely be delivered in the fourth quarter. The hydrogen will be produced at Fusion Fuel’s projects in Evora, Portugal, where it aims to expand its production capacity to roughly 50 tons per annum by the end of the year. Hydrogen Ventures wants to use hydrogen for mobility applications in Portugal.
Chart Industries and Nikola Corp. have signed a strategic collaboration agreement that includes liquid hydrogen storage tanks and the development of mobile, modular hydrogen refueling stations for quick deployment. The agreement includes additional plans to collaborate on the advancement of hydrogen technology for infrastructure and onboard truck fuel systems. “Chart is providing first-of-kind, fully integrated mobile and modular hydrogen fueling stations for heavy-duty vehicles providing a quickly deployable fueling solution with lower capital requirements,” said the US heavy-duty commercial vehicle manufacturer. “This transportable fuel station lowers the barrier to entry and is an ideal solution for smaller fleets or any immediate and interim fueling needs. The dense liquid hydrogen storage and efficient liquid high-pressure dispense pump also lowers station operating costs.”
The European Parliament, the European Council, and the European Commission have reached a final agreement on the review of the renewable energy directive (RED3). “The provisional agreement provides that industry would increase their use of renewable energy annually by 1.6%,” said the European Council. “They agreed that 42% of the hydrogen used in industry should come from renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) by 2030 and 60% by 2035.” Countries that can achieve a fossil-free hydrogen mix of at least 77% by 2030 can see that target reduced by 20%.

The energy modeling, conducted by German-based consultancy Energy Brainpool, considers three different scenarios. It reviewed a “fossil dumping” scenario, under which global gas demand falls dramatically, leading to low fossil fuel prices. It looked at a “new normal” scenario, under which gas prices remain at current levels. And it also looked at a “return to crisis” scenario, under which gas prices return to the high prices of fall 2021. The residential PV systems were assumed to have capacities of 8 kW in Germany and 7 kW in Spain and Italy.
The model indicates PV payback times of around 18 years in Germany, 19 in Spain, and 14 in Italy, under the “new normal” scenario. The “fossil dumping” scenario shows payback times of 20 years, 25 years, and 17 years, respectively. Rooftop solar has the lowest payback time under the “return to crisis” scenario, at 17 years in Germany, 12 years in Italy, and 11 years in Spain.
“We were surprised by the results for payback times, as we often hear that payback time is lower than 10 years,” Christophe Lits, market analyst for SolarPower Europe, told pv magazine. “The model takes everything into account as of 2022: the capex price, electricity price, interest rates, feed-in tariffs, rebate schemes … there’s no magic science as to how we computed the payback time, we looked at how much you paid for the [PV system and its] installation, and how much electricity from the grid you didn’t have to buy. Then we just looked at how many years of those savings it would take to equal the total capex price.”
Three major factors played into the high payback times for PV in 2022, according to Liets: high capex, assumed at €1,600 ($1,742)/kW excluding value-added tax, lower electricity prices in years following 2022, and high interest rates for those using loans to purchase the PV system.
“When we talk to installers about payback times, they aren’t really looking at all the differences in subsidies or increase in capex prices, they’re basically looking at how much electricity you save by installing PV – when you look in more detail, the results are more precise,” said Lits, in reference to the stark difference between the often suggested 10 years payback time and the analysis results.
After publishing the report, SolarPower Europe and Energy Brainpool also conducted a sensitivity analysis of payback times with varying capex values.
“For capex values seen four to two years ago, in the range of €1,200/kW or even €1,000/kW in Spain, the payback times return to around 10 years in Germany and seven in Spain,” said Lits.
The report concludes that capex support is crucial to reduce payback times “in an inflationary environment with high interest rates and high labor costs.” It proposes several ways for member states to provide capex support, noting that a 30% in capex support reduces payback times for PV and heat pumps by six to eight years in Germany, Italy, and Spain.

With the help of an undisclosed company, it is drilling 120 wells into the ground to install 36 kilometers of pipes that will feed geothermal energy into heat pumps for a district heating heat system.
The individual geothermal heat pumps will provide heating, cooling, and domestic hot water to residents of the Boevrie residential project, which is located in the UNESCO-protected historic center of Bruges. The development will span 11,700 square meters and will include 102 apartments, 25 single-family homes, eight stacked homes, and office space, as well as basements and underground garages.
The geothermal heat pumps were considered an alternative to solar panels in order to reduce electricity bills for residents, as UNESCO rules strictly limit the use of rooftop solar.
“We are doing everything we can to ensure that this residential project fits perfectly within the UNESCO area, with maximum attention to sustainability,” said Steven Langenaken, project manager for Steenoven. “Due to the shape of Boevrie – a large underground parking garage with compact buildings on top – geothermal energy is the most appropriate and most efficient way to provide sustainable heating.”
The geothermal heat pumps will have an average source temperature of 10 C to 12 C, according to Steenoven. Their heating output will be 40 C for underfloor heating and 60 C for domestic hot water.
“In the summer, the pipe network of the underfloor heating ensures that cool water circulates and the apartments and houses are passively cooled,” said Steenoven.
Digging the borehole thermal energy storage field requires a “high investment,” Steenoven said. It added that the project’s payback period has shrunk to about 10 years since electricity prices skyrocketed due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Drilling works started in the second half of February and are expected to take two months. The first residents are expected to start making use of the geothermal heat pumps by the end of 2026.

The engineering consultancy said that from 2023 to 2024, TOPCon prices will remain higher than PERC.
“As many new cell lines are ramping up that will need to calibrate, limiting the growth in TOPCon availability,” said CEA.
However, it added that it expects the price difference between the two technologies to narrow down from 2024, “as TOPCon becomes the default utility-scale module.” Nevertheless, the firm noted that it expects some price gap to remain between TOPCon and PERC, “as growing TOPCon adoption will cause PERC to be offered at an increasingly discounted rate until it is retired.”
The corresponding graph from the report shows that by the first quarter of 2025, monofacial, backsheet TOPCon modules will cost the same as bifacial double-glass PERC modules with 210 mm cells. Between the first quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, module prices in China will drop by an average of 6%, according to the report.
Global PV manufacturing capacity across the supply chain will experience rapid growth from 2022 to 2027, according to CEA, with capacities doubling in the ingot/wafer stages and potentially quadrupling for polysilicon. This capacity will remain heavily concentrated in China, said CEA.
Equipment oversupply, as measured by nominal industry production capacity compared to new facilities, is expected to increase from 25% in 2022 to 100% in 2027. That is, the industry as a whole will be able to produce twice as much as demand, according to projections.
By 2023, global module production capacity are set to exceed 800 GW per year, while global installations will likely stay above 300 GW. By 2027, module production capacity could exceed 1,000 GW per year, while installations should be near 500 GW.
The most immediate impact of the capacity increase on the market is a tripling of polysilicon capacity from 2022 to 2024, based on new capacity under construction or already in the start-up and ramp-up phases.
CEA’s projections are the result of a specially developed modeling system to provide independent market intelligence on changes in global supply chains and accurate forecasts for supply price scenarios based on technologies, materials, manufacturing regions, and target markets, as well as supply and demand forecasts.

The turnkey system features a plug-in connection that makes it suitable for balconies.
“SolarUnit is like a PV module with an alternating current output, ready to be connected to the electrical grid,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “The bus is formed by a trunk cable supplied by DAH Solar. The trunk cable has spaced tap connectors to allow sequential connection and electrical parallelism of multiple SolarUnits.”
The system can be used with up to six special panels manufactured by DAH Solar itself. The “Full-Screen PV Modules” are available with power outputs of 460 W and 550 W and a power conversion efficiency rating of up to 21.3%. They feature 3.2 mm anti-reflective glass and an IP68 enclosure, with a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius. The operational temperature of the panels ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
It also uses micro-inverters with an efficiency of up to 97.2% and a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency of 99.95%. The device measures 412 mm × 97 mm × 42.5mm and weighs 1.8 kg. The kits can reach a maximum size of 2,279 mm × 1,134 mm × 32mm and a maximum weight of up to 59.8 kg.
“The Full-Screen PV Module and microinverter are integrated when they leave the factory,” the spokesperson said. “SolarUnit could achieve great flexibility for projects because it makes the possibility to install PV modules in different orientations and with different angles of inclination, following the designs of the roofs.”
DAH Solar also offers an energy communication unit (ECU) unit with the system. It communicates with the microinverters through the power line communication (PLC) system. It uses the power cable itself to exchange information.
“The ECU unit allows remote monitoring of the PV system, in addition to allowing the PV system to be turned off with remote control by your electrical devices such as smartphones and PCs,” said the spokesperson.
DAH Solar is based in Hefei, China's Anhui province. It currently operates a 5 GW solar panel factory.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/31/blade-coated-flexible-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-14-08-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 31, 2023",Blade-coated flexible perovskite solar cell achieves 14.08% efficiency,"Scientists at the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Italy have fabricated a flexible perovskite solar module by depositing all layers via blade coating in ambient air.
“All the layers have been produced in ambient conditions with a relative humidity of around 30-40%, so the manufacturing process does not require clean rooms and controlled environments,” researcher Farshad Zafarzadeh told pv magazine. “In addition, the usage of highly toxic solvents has been avoided which is a step towards the sustainability of perovskite solar cells.”
In the paper “All-Blade-Coated Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells & Modules Processed in Air from a Sustainable Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-based Solvent System,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy & Fuels, Zafarzadeh and his colleagues described blade coating as a high-throughput deposition method that requires simple equipment and is transferrable to roll-to-roll fabrication, with slight modifications.
“Blade coating of the perovskite layer in ambient environments is only possible by means of hot casting, gas quenching, vacuum extraction, or a combination of these methods to prevent moisture spreading over the perovskite phase,” they said. 
In the manufacturing process, the scientists used dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is a toxic solvent commonly used in perovskite deposition, only for the first step, while for the second step they used isopropyl alcohol (IPA). In this way, DMSO does not remain trapped in the perovskite layer once the deposition is finalized.
They built the cell with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, a perovskite absorber, and a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA).
“Solar cells are blade coated on large substrates (5×7 cm2) but measured on small scale with 0.09 cm2 active area, and the champion device achieved 14.08% power conversion efficiency,” they said. 
The Italian group also fabricated small solar modules based on this cell technology and achieved an efficiency of up to 6.58%.
“We demonstrated that this method is upscalable on 13 cm2 × 13 cm2 sizes on flexible substrates. We are now working on the improvement of the modules' performance and further upscaling of devices,” Zafarzadeh stated. “Although the cost analysis is not in the scope of this work, we know that blade coating is a low-cost technique due to its simplicity and small material wastage”
He also claims that the fabrication process can be transferred to roll-to-roll production which enables high-speed, low-cost, and large-scale production. “Not to mention that using flexible substrates substantially reduces the total weight of solar modules which reduces the transportation and maintenance cost,” he said.
In March 2021, the University of Rome Tor Vergata presented a perovskite solar module with a total active area of 42.8 cm2 and aperture area of 50 cm2. The panel was built with 20%-efficient perovskite cells connected in 14 series. It was able to retain 90% of the initial efficiency after 800 hours of thermal stress at 85 C.
Three months later, it unveiled a perovskite solar module with cells based on triple-cation cesium methylammonium formamidinium (CsMAFA). And in April 2022, it presented a perovskite solar panel with a total substrate size of 20 cm × 20 cm and a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 11.9%.

The Australian federal government’s AUD 15 billion National Reconstruction Fund (NRF) – designed to boost investment in onshore manufacturing, including the production of solar panels, batteries, and hydrogen electrolyzers – will be established in law, as the bill passed through the Senate and lower house earlier this week.
Federal Industry Minister Ed Husic said the fund is “one of the largest peacetime investments in Australian manufacturing capability.” He claimed the legislation paves the way for Australia to ramp up high-value manufacturing and jobs.
“The most successful modern economies are built on strong, advanced manufacturing capability,” he said. “The NRF will help deliver this for Australia. We want Australia to be a country that makes things, a nation that has faith in its know-how and ability to get the job done.”
The NRF will deliver co-investments in projects across a range of strategic industries, including renewables and low-emissions technologies, resources value adding, agriculture, transport, defence capability, and critical technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics.
The fund will be administered by an independent board which will make independent investment decisions, modelled on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s (CEFC) “co-investment” model with government planning to partner with businesses and superannuation funds to unlock further potential private investment of more than AUD 30 billion through the fund.
An initial AUD 5 billion will be provided to the fund by the federal government with a further AUD 10 billion made available in mid-2029. The government has earmarked up to AUD 3 billion of the NRF’s initial AUD 15 billion to support the manufacture of renewables and low-emission technologies.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the NRF will revitalize industries that have been allowed to lag and provide a welcome boost for Australian renewable energy technology and know-how.
“Australia has all the resources that go into solar panels, batteries and other finished products,” he said. “We should be making them here. And that’s what this investment is all about. It will mean more secure jobs and more world-class products made in Australia.”
While the legislation has been widely welcomed, Glen Ryan, co-founder of Perth-based solar innovator Sunovate, said more needs to be done to provide surety for companies looking to develop clean energy technology in Australia.
Ryan, who is also behind Western Australian ocean energy company Bombora Wave Power which was moved offshore in search of financial backing and support, said government needs to establish hard targets to underpin the clean energy industry or risk loss of jobs, export potential and technology options.
“I have had to watch too many cleantech ideas including my own having to leave our shores to get a foot up,” Ryan said in a LinkedIn post. “We need hard targets to guarantee sustained project revenue opportunity and investable projects. We need hard targets to drive investments in the technology platforms to service the projects. Only then will we have the basis to consider local manufacturing opportunities.”
Melbourne-based company Wave Swell Energy recently said that it will probably not set up its tech in Australia, despite a successful trial, due to a lack of political and financial support. Ryan said this is a perfect example of the challenges facing clean energy companies.
“Here we go again,” Ryan said. “Another Australian innovative wave energy device looking overseas for ongoing support.”
Wave Swell Energy Chief Executive Paul Geason told the ABC that he was pleased with the results of a 12-month trial of its technology off the coast of Tasmania’s King Island. He said he believed that the technology would become an important part of future global electricity production.
Geason said the company is now aiming to scale up its operations but despite the success of the pilot, which was granted AUD 4.03 million in federal government funding, the company will be setting its sights on the overseas market due to a lack of incentive from both state and national governments.
“We are an Australian, a Tasmanian invention. Australia’s an important market for us … we’d dearly love to set up here,” he said. “Ideally, Australia would become home to a world-leading manufacturing capability for these wave energy converters. But right now … there are other markets in the world that are further advanced. Frankly, it would be irresponsible for us not to participate in those opportunities.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/31/tesla-misses-own-expectations-for-solar-roof-deployments/,"INSURANCE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 31, 2023",Tesla misses own expectations for Solar Roof deployments,"From pv magazine USA
Tesla announced its Solar Roof product to much fanfare back in 2016, and three years ago the company stated that it had a goal of 1,000 installations per week. Yet, only about 3,000 Solar Roof systems have been installed to date, according to data from Wood Mackenzie, with a total capacity of nearly 30 MW (DC).
Wood Mackenzie, for the first time, has identified Tesla Solar Roof installations using its proprietary project-level data sets and summarized the key findings in a report titled, “Five Years In: Tesla Solar Roof deployments miss expectations.”
“The Tesla Solar Roof, an innovative roofing system made of glass tiles with embedded photovoltaic cells, attracted considerable attention after its initial launch several years ago,” said Max Issokson, research analyst and lead author of the report. “But granular installation data has always been elusive, making it challenging to analyze the product’s growth – until now.”
Despite Tesla’s 2020 stated goal to install 1,000 systems per week, Wood Mackenzie analysis shows that average Solar Roof installations per week were just 21 in 2022, and the largest quarter for installations was the first quarter of 2022, which saw 32 systems installed per week.

Looking at the entire roofing market in the United States, which installs an estimated 5 million roofs built per year, Tesla held less than 0.03% of the total roofing market in 2022, according to the report.
“As the residential solar industry continues to grow, solar roofing solutions will play an important role in offering customers flexibility and alternatives to conventional modules,” Issokson concluded. “The future potential of Tesla’s Solar Roof will rely on the company’s ability to simplify and streamline installations and tap into a broader customer base.”
Tesla is not alone in the building-integrated solar roofing market. GAF Energy, CertainTeed, SunStyle, Suntegra Solar, Forward and Luma Solar are other manufacturers who have gotten in on the game. Today GAF Energy, a prominent residential roofing company, is a market leader in the sub-sector with its Timberline Solar product. Its nailable solar shingle was announced at CES 2022, where it won the Best of Innovation award. What sets the Timberline apart from Tesla’s Solar Roof is that the roof system directly integrates solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials, according to Wood Mackenzie.
“GAF Energy’s Timberline Solar roofing system is better positioned to achieve widespread adoption,” said Issokson. “The product is faster and easier to install, and the company captures customers when they are considering roof replacements.”
Tesla has had a tough time in the residential solar installation market as well. Wood Mackenzie noted in its 2022 solar installer Leaderboard that Freedom Forever had overtaken Tesla in the top three residential market spot for the first time, securing 4% of the US market the previous year. Sunrun and Titan Solar Energy held the top two spots, respectively.

Canada’s federal government has outlined a new, six-year investment tax credit that puts a 30% tax credit in place for solar, wind and energy storage projects deployed through March 2034. The Clean Technology ITC was included as part of the Canadian government’s 2023 Budget Day fiscal priorities on March 28, with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland releasing the government’s 2023 federal budget.
The Canadian government is prioritizing a clean energy economy as one of the three main pillars of its multi-year budget plan. The federal government has a goal of making its electric grid net zero by 2035 through tax incentives for clean energy projects over the next six years.
Canada’s Budget 2023 mirrors the IRA and includes two new ITCs targeting clean energy and technology manufacturing. In the government’s remarks this week, it said the new plan allows Canada to remain competitive with its southern neighbor.
In the government’s 2022 Fall Economic Statement, it proposed a 30% refundable Clean Technologies ITC, available to eligible properties that are acquired or become available for use on or after March 28, 2023. In Budget 2023, the government expanded this ITC to apply to geothermal energy projects, in addition to solar, wind and energy storage. The term of the ITC was also extended from phasing out in 2032, as was intended under the 2022 proposal, and will remain at 30% through December 2033, stepping down to 15% in 2034 before phasing out altogether after 2034.
A new incentive that the Canadian government is providing is a refundable 15% investment tax credit on the capital costs made by non-taxable entities. These include indigenous or tribal communities, municipal utilities and Crown-corporations that make investments in renewable energy, energy storage, interprovincial power transmission and other clean energy infrastructure projects.
The ITC also applies to new hydroelectric, wave/tidal projects, nuclear (including small modular reactors), and abated natural gas-fired generation.
The Clean Hydrogen ITC was announced as part of the government’s 2022 proposals. New details of the basic design elements of the hydrogen ITC include a volumetric ITC credit based on carbon intensity of the project, measured by kilograms of carbon emissions produced per kilogram of hydrogen, and meeting prescribed labor conditions.

As detailed in the above chart, green hydrogen produced using the least carbon emissions and produced with claimable trained labor can see an ITC of up to 40%, while grey or blue hydrogen as its called using lesser carbon recovery can see a 5% to 25% ITC, depending on labor conditions.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/31/new-software-modeling-tool-for-agrivoltaics/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 31, 2023",New software modeling tool for agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine USA
Agrivoltaics, the integration of food production and solar energy, is an emerging technology that makes better use of limited land and soil resources. Because the industry is young, there’s not yet a snappy web-based application like Aurora or Helioscope to help solar developers to quickly lay out designs, taking the crops underneath into account.
Sandbox Solar, a solar contractor, has been developing such a tool, called Spade. Spade aims to help solar developers to determine the best crop types and solar panel layouts for their projects. The tool made it into the fifth and final round of the Department of Energy’s “American Made” solar innovation program. Spade’s early Beta Version is available now, and it has already been used to develop solar power projects paired with potatoes, hemp, hops and other crops.
The software generates several key numerical outputs: irradiance, as well as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), which are two types of light measurements that are less familiar to the solar trade.
PAR refers to the range of wavelengths that are useful for photosynthesis, while PPFD measures the density of photons within that range that reaches a specific surface area. Not all wavelengths of light are equally effective for photosynthesis; plants generally use blue (400 nm to 500 nm) and red (600 nm to 700 nm) light more efficiently than green (500 nm to 600 nm) light. PAR and PPFD are both crucial for understanding and optimizing light conditions for plant growth and photosynthesis.

The information is displayed both visually via charts, and numerically, as watts per square meter and PAR/PPFD values. Again, PAR is the quantity of useful light that will reach the plants growing among the solar panels. Most agrivoltaic-compatible crops actually benefit from the reduced irradiance offered by the shade of solar panels.
Spade’s team told us that the fundamental approach to optimizing agrivoltaic projects involves addressing the three C’s: configuration, climate and crops. By carefully considering these factors, a developer can refine their strategies by spacing out and elevating solar panels to maximize land use, ensuring the best possible balance between energy generation and agriculture.
The graphic below captures Spade designer Tom Hickey’s changing inputs on solar designs, which then outputs various potential outcomes of solar designs that meet project requirements. Hickey has been with Sandbox for more than five years, and is currently working part-time with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. He uses Spade directly in design work for customers and Sandbox’s agrivoltaic projects.
“Spade has revolutionized what I have been able to do in-house,” said Hickey.
In a recent conversation with pv magazine USA, Alexis Pascaris – a lead in the development of the Spade software – noted the Massachusetts agrivoltaic program and the unique incentives found in the state’s SMART solar program. With Hickey and Pascaris  running the processes, Spade has collaborated with developers as a subcontracted professional who liaises with the Department of Agriculture to move projects through the SMART application process. Pascaris suggested that Spade’s shade analysis tools are more accurate than the tools Massachusetts currently mandates.
Ian Skor, founder of Sandbox Solar, said he believes that the current iteration of the tool is sufficiently robust to meet the immediate needs of both the company and its consulting clients. However, he acknowledges that there is room for growth in developing the software’s frontend to facilitate improved online interactions and refine its overall functionality.
