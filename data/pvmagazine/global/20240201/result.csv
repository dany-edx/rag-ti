Previously, VAT relief was only available for domestic BESS if installed together with a new solar energy system. As of Feb. 1, a VAT zero rate will also apply to retrofitted residential BESS.
The VAT relief also applies to BESS when installed in charitable buildings.
Extending zero-rating VAT relief to cover retrofitted BESS follows significant solar industry campaigning. In response, the UK government announced in December that it would expand its VAT relief for energy-saving materials (ESMs) to include all domestic BESS.
Water-sourced heat pumps and smart diverters were also zero rated as part of the change.
“The cut in VAT is exceedingly welcome and we have every expectation that it will increase demand for home battery energy storage,” said Chris Hewett, chief executive of trade association Solar Energy UK. “By allowing solar power to be used after dark, it can double the savings offered by home solar power systems. There has never been a better time to upgrade than today.”
The United Kingdom has already exempted a raft of energy and heat related technology from VAT, including solar panels, wind turbines, air-sourced heat pumps, insulation, draft stripping, central heating and hot water controls, micro combined heat and power units, and wood-fueled boilers.
The VAT zero rating for energy-saving materials is scheduled to run until March 31, 2027.
Announcing the changes to VAT relief in December, Nigel Huddleston MP, financial secretary to the Treasury, said zero-rating energy-saving materials “will allow more households to install ESMs, improve the energy efficiency of their homes, and thereby reduce their energy bills.”

1,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/01/energy-vault-signs-gravity-storage-deal-covering-southern-africa/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-02-01,Energy Vault signs gravity storage deal covering southern Africa,"Gravity storage system supplier Energy Vault has signed a licensing and royalty agreement with GESSOL, which is expected to facilitate multi-gigawatt hours of long-duration storage in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.  
GESSOL is a consortium focused on energy storage deployments in southern Africa that includes project engineering group iX Engineers, renewable energy specialist Sizana Solutions, and construction contractor WBHO. Under the terms of the 10-year agreement, the group has the exclusive rights to deploy Energy Vault's gravity storage technology throughout the SADC region.
This includes Switzerland-based Energy Vault's gravity energy storage system (GESS) and VaultOS energy management system, as well as its short-duration battery and ultra-long-duration green hydrogen hybrid systems.
The agreement, which was executed in the final quarter of 2023, will serve energy storage use cases within the public utility, mining, IPP/micro-grid and broader industrial sectors.
The work is expected to contribute to the SADC region’s energy storage needs, which are estimated to surpass 125 GWh by 2035, and accelerate the area's clean energy transition.
According to the SADC, an electricity shortage has strained the region since 2007. Only 50% of residents have access to electricity, a figure which falls to 32% in rural areas. Meanwhile, coal currently supplies 62% of power generation in southern Africa.
“We conducted extensive due diligence to bring the most economical, efficient, flexible and sustainable long duration energy storage solution to the SADC region and Energy Vault’s gravity storage technology is the clear choice,” said GESSOL Director Les Lange.
Lange noted that southern Africa is a rapidly developing region with increasing energy demand, which historically has been met with coal-fired plants.
“Economic development in the SADC region is critical for improving quality of life, but we need to rapidly wean the region off of coal to simultaneously reduce carbon emissions and grow our economy,” he said.
It is hoped the deployment will also help resolve grid issues that have plagued South Africa, with 2023 the worst year on record for frequent scheduled power cuts in the country, also known as load shedding. In November, the country’s public utility Eskom switched on its largest battery storage project to date to mitigate the challenge of load shedding, as part of a wider battery storage rollout.
Robert Piconi, Energy Vault's chairman and CEO, said the rapid scale-up of the company’s product line in the SADC region will “increase renewable energy capacity, smooth out load shedding, optimise grid performance through our software applications and provide a necessary complement to intermittent renewable generation to firm grid resiliency.”
Piconi said that the company has provided GESSOL with its complete energy storage range, tailored to meet various storage duration requirements and customer scenarios, in order to expedite deployments across the SADC region. The objective is to contribute significantly to emissions reduction in the region, in line with climate targets, while fostering sustainable economic growth.
Energy Vault’s expansion into southern Africa follows developments in China, where the company has a 3.3 GWh pipeline of projects. It completed a 25 MW/100 MWh project, its first commercial-scale gravity-based storage facility, in Shanghai in August.

The company’s hybrid inverters have thus far only been available as single-phase models. There are now four new three-phase hybrid inverters, with 10 kW, 15 kW, 20 kW and 30 kW variants. All of them feature two photovoltaic MPPTs.
According to the manufacturer, the main advantage of these hybrid inverters is that  a battery system and two different PV arrays, in the case of rooftops with different orientations, can be connected to a single inverter. All of the devices integrate with the energy management system (EMS) as standard.
The three-phase inverter family has a maximum DC voltage of 1,100 V and MMPT voltage range of 160-1,000 V. With maximum efficiency of 98%, the inverters come with a maximum PV input current of up to 30A / 45A / 60A, as seen in the data sheet for 10 kW, 15 kW and 20 kW devices.
Operating within a temperature range of -25 C to 60 C, the inverters have IP66-rated protection and are suitable for indoor and outdoor installation. The products are C5-rated for corrosion resistance.
The new inverter series can supply critical loads in the event of a power outage. The products feature DC and AC type II surge arresters, DC switch, anti-islanding protection, AC overcurrent and short-circuit protection, DC reverse connection and leakage current protection. The EMS support wi-fi and ethernet-based communications.
The 10-kW model, which will be the first to be available on the market, can be ordered through Ingeteam's official distributors at the end of February. The first units will be available in June 2024.

However, they have not yet challenged inorganic cathodes due to their poor conductivity, low practical storage capacity, and poor cyclability.
Now, a group of MIT researchers has developed a layered organic electrode material which can compete with cobalt-based cathodes. The new material has shown high electrical conductivity, high storage capacity, and virtual insolubility in common battery electrolytes.
The new cathode delivers an energy density of 765 Wh/kg higher than most cobalt-based cathodes, and can charge-discharge in as little as six minutes. Its specific capacity stands at 306 mAh/g.
“These results demonstrate the operational competitiveness of sustainable organic electrode materials in practical batteries,” the researchers wrote in ACS Central Science.
The new cathode material consists of many layers of TAQ (bis-tetraaminobenzoquinone), an organic small molecule that contains three fused hexagonal rings.
Within the molecules are chemical groups called quinones, which are the electron reservoirs, and amines, which help the material to form strong hydrogen bonds. Those bonds make the material highly stable and also very insoluble, thereby extending its lifetime.
“One of the main methods of degradation for organic materials is that they simply dissolve into the battery electrolyte and cross over to the other side of the battery, essentially creating a short circuit,” said Mircea Dincă, the W.M. Keck Professor of Energy at MIT. “If you make the material completely insoluble, that process doesn’t happen, so we can go to over 2,000 charge cycles with minimal degradation.”
With quinones and amines as precursors, the primary materials needed to manufacture this type of cathode are already commercially available and produced in large quantities as commodity chemicals.
The researchers estimate that the cost of organic cathode-based batteries could be about one-third to one-half the cost of cobalt containing devices.
Italian luxury carmaker Lamborghini has funded the research project and licensed the patent on the technology.

The lion’s share of the funds will go toward a recently approved 225 kV electricity interconnection linking Mauritania to Mali as part of the Desert to Power Initiative. It is being financed by a $272 million loan from the African Development Bank, alongside a $1.5 million grant from the Green Climate Fund.
The second project, Rural Areas Sustainable Development for Productive and Energy Investments (RIMDIR), has received a $16 million grant from the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA). RIMDIR will improve access to electricity in 40 localities across southeastern Mauritania through the installation of hybrid mini PV plants and the construction of connecting lines to link the power plants to the villages.
“There can be no sustainable, diversified economic growth without high-quality, reliable electricity that is accessible to all,” said Abdelssalam Mohamed Saleh, Mauritania's minister of economy and sustainable development. “Within this framework, the government has drawn up ambitious programs seeking to guarantee access to electricity for all citizens by 2030, and this requires the optimal exploitation of the energy sources available in the country, to which this financing from the African Development Bank will contribute.”
Malinne Blomberg, the deputy director general for North Africa at the African Development Bank, said the two initiatives will improve people's daily lives by introducing new opportunities for environmentally friendly development, sustainable investments, and jobs.
“They attest to the excellence of our relations with Mauritania, which they help to strengthen,” added Blomberg.
In November, Denmark's GreenGo launched the Megaton Moon project in Mauritania, a 60 GW solar-wind power installation combined with 35 GW of green hydrogen production. It will be built in several stages, with the first pilot phase being expected to be finalized in 2028.

The Sölden ski lift company has deployed several vertical PV systems on the Tiefenbach glacier in the Ötztal Valley, Austria, at an altitude of 2,850 meters. The systems are based on cross structures. The modules are installed on them vertically, with total system output hitting 7.2 kW.
The developer, Austria-based startup Helioplant, said this design allows the system to remain free of snow, even after intense winter precipitation.
“During the period when we need electricity the most as ski area operators, there is generally a lot of snow on the roofs, which greatly limits the effectiveness of rooftop PV,” said Eberhard Schultes, project manager for Sölden. “In addition, it consumes less surface area and fits better into the landscape.”
The company said the structures host bifacial PV modules, which benefit highly from snow reflection. It has not reveal any additional technical details.
The ski lift company did say that it plans to “significantly” expand the project if the vertical arrays reduce reliance on grid electricity compared to rooftop PV systems deployed in the valley.
The intelligent cross structure keeps itself free of snow due to wind turbulence. It is weather-resistant and low-maintenance, enabling stable energy generation, even in high mountain settings in the winter.
When there is snow, a scour ring forms around the PV element, which ensures energy production in winter. In addition, a gap in the ground – adapted to respective terrain conditions – allows for a thin layer of snow to increase reflection, according to Helioplant.

Relectrify, an Australian battery technology company, said the installation of the ReVolve battery energy storage solution had allowed Sydney-based paint manufacturer Colormaker to realize a “step-change improvement” in energy self-sufficiency and further reduce its energy costs.
Having already made a significant reduction in their use of grid electricity since installing 100 kW of rooftop solar, Colormaker integrated the ReVolve battery energy storage system with the existing solar energy infrastructure to gain further financial benefits from the asset.
Relectrify said key success metrics for the project include optimised solar self-consumption, reduced purchase of grid-supplied energy, and reduced demand.
Melbourne-based Relectrify said early data indicates that both power and associated costs are poised to decrease to single-digit percentages compared to pre-battery installation levels.
The ReVolve battery energy storage product uses second-life Nissan Leaf electric vehicle (EV) battery packs coupled with patented cell-level control technology that combines an integrated battery management system (BMS) and inverter hardware solution.
The hybrid system replaces conventional BMS and inverters with a single electronic solution that allows for control of individual cells to generate grid-compliant alternating current (AC) directly from a battery pack.
Colormaker Managing Director David Stuart said the installation of the battery has marked a pivotal step in the company’s journey to achieving a net-zero operation, noting that the battery “gives us the opportunity to store the solar energy we’ve generated during the day and utilize it to meet our energy needs around the clock.”
Relectrify Vice President of Partnerships Juergen Barth said the Colormaker project demonstrates how battery storage products featuring CellSwitch technology can revolutionise the way companies manage and store electricity by both using second-life cells and eliminating the need for inverters.

The CVO algorithm mimics the behavior of persons who try to stay healthy and slow down the spread of COVID-19 by observing the containment protocols. It is implemented in three steps – social distancing, quarantine, and isolation.
“The most remarkable aspect of the CVO method is that it is capable of terminating at any time without using any parameter,” the researchers stressed. “This condition arises due to recovering and dead individuals continuing to expand over time, and the newly infected individual is unable to infect new people. At a specific number of iterations, infected persons are predicted to rise. Furthermore, because dead and recovered individuals are in large numbers, unhealthy people decrease over time. So, the newly infected individuals would be smaller compared with the current size from a specific iteration onward.”
The algorithm considers uniform irradiance (UI), partial shading (PS), and complex partial shading (CPS) conditions. A mathematical model is implemented to distinguish the UI, PS, and especially CPS conditions in PV installations. “To evaluate performance from the perspective of efficiency, Global Maxima (GM) searching time, and steady-state response, statistical analysis is used,” they explained, noting that the output power of an array is the objective function that must be optimized.
The group compared the performance of the CVO algorithm with that of seven well-known algorithms used for MPPT: Perturb and Observe (P&O); Incremental Conductance (InC); Dragonfly Optimization (DFO); Cuckoo Search (CS); Fruit Fly Optimization (FFO); Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).
The analysis showed that the proposed algorithm offers better performance than that of all other algorithms. “Results show that the CVO algorithm has zero oscillation with the lowest settling and convergence time of 0.49 s and 0.51 s respectively,” the group emphasized, noting that it can be easily applied on a low-cost microcontroller. “The proposed CVO algorithm has the highest efficiencies of 99.99%, 99.98%, 99.97%, and 99.98 for UI, PS1, PS2, and CPS accordingly among all techniques that are under-considered.”
The scientists introduced the algorithm in the study “A Coronavirus Optimization (CVO) algorithm to harvest maximum power from PV systems under partial and complex partial shading conditions,” published in Energy Reports. “The proposed algorithm is also much needed to extend its execution for decentralized as well as distributed PV energy systems,” they concluded.

Germany's Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has allocated 1,611 MW of PV capacity in the nation's latest tender for utility-scale solar.
It assigned the capacity across 124 bids. The new allocations slightly exceed the capacity that the Bundesnetzagentur initially planned to hand out. The tender was significantly oversubscribed, with 574 project proposals totaling 5.48 GW.
The agency had set a ceiling price of €0.0737/kWh for the auction. The average price came in at €0.0517/kWh, with final prices ranging from €0.0444/kWh to €0.0547/kWh.
From a regional perspective, the largest volume awarded was in Bavaria (604 MW), followed by Brandenburg (197 MW) and Saxony-Anhalt (167 MW).
Broken down by category, the Bundesnetzagentur mostly selected projects that are planned on the edges of motorways or railways (828 MW). It assigned another 530 MW to arable land or grassland areas. The remaining capacity was distributed among agrivoltaic plants and projects on drained moorlands.
In the last auction, held in June, the Bundesnetzagentur allocated 1,673 MW. Final prices ranged from €0.0539/kWh to €0.0665/kWh, with the average price coming in at €0.0647/kWh.
The next auction will be held on March 1.

“The primary objective of anti-reflective coatings is to minimize the reflection loss, so enhancing the absorption properties by the semiconductor material, often silicon, and facilitating its conversion into electrical energy,” the academic explained. “This is essential for increasing solar cell efficiency.”
In addition, they have also tested the effect of a mixed SiO2-ZrO2 coating, with a ratio of 1:1, on the cell performances.
For their research, the group purchased polycrystalline Si solar cells measuring 5.0 cm × 4.0 cm with an efficiency of 14.4%. Then, they coated them with either SiO2, ZrO2, or SiO2-ZrO2 using the radiofrequency (RF) sputter coating technique. “To ensure a nearly uniform distribution, the mixture underwent mechanical grinding with a mortar and pestle for approximately 120 minutes,” they highlighted.
The RF sputter coating technique utilizes radiofrequency energy to generate plasma and sputter material from a target onto a substrate. In the process described in this study, argon gas was ionized to form a plasma during the sputtering process. The coating process lasted 45 m at room temperature.
Following the coating of the three cells, the academics assessed light absorption and transmittance and compared their performance with that of uncoated reference cells.
Based on the results of an I–V measurement, the uncoated cell's power conversion efficiency was 14.4%, while that of the SiO2-ZrO2 sample was 17.6%. The SiO2-only sample had an efficiency of 15.6%, and the ZrO2 had 16.7%.
“The Root Mean Square (RMS) values of roughness for SiO2, ZrO2, and SiO2–ZrO2 blend coated solar cells were measured at 35.42 nm, 47.47 nm, and 62.36 nm respectively,” the researchers added. “The increased surface roughness may also serve to reduce the reflection loss potentially and enhance optical transmittance.”
The anti-reflective coating was presented in the paper “Surface engineering of Sio2-Zro2 films for augmenting power conversion efficiency performance of silicon solar cells,” published in the Journal of Materials Research and Technology.
The research was conducted by scientists from Saudi Arabia's Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, and Qassim University, as well as from India's Kongu Engineering College and Velalar College of Engineering and Technology. Furthermore, the group comprised researchers from Thailand's King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok and Egypt's National Research Centre.

The project will cost XOF 39.5 billion ($65 million) and will be entirely financed by Ferké Solar, a subsidiary of PFO Africa, which will also build and operate the plant.
Construction will begin in the second quarter of 2024, with commissioning scheduled for the third quarter of 2025. According to Ivorian Energy Minister Mamadou Sangafowa Coulibaly, the project will create 150 jobs during construction and 15 permanent jobs during operation.
The minister said that contracts are currently under review for the construction of other solar power plants, with a cumulative capacity of 600 MW. Commissioning of these projects will take place in 2025 and 2026. 
Coulibaly said the Ivory Coast’s installed solar capacity currently stands at 2,907 MW. The country is now working toward deployment targets of 3,500 MW in 2025, 5,200 MW by 2030 and 8,600 by 2040. 
Ivory Coast’s first solar power plant, located in the northern town of Boundiali, was commissioned in 2022. It currently has a capacity of 37.5 MW, but Coulibaly says this is set to expand to 80 MW, with financing for the expansion already approved by the Council of Ministers.
The Ivory Coast has vowed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 32% and increase the share of renewable energy in its energy mix to more than 40% by 2030. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Ivory Coast had 13 MW of cumulative solar capacity in 2021.

“Transitioning from laboratory-scale cells to larger modules poses a notable efficiency loss,” the research's lead author, Yi Yang, told pv magazine. “The highest certified stabilized aperture-area efficiency for perovskite solar modules exceeding 30 cm2 in area has recently been observed to plateau at approximately 19.5%. This comes in part from defects that arise during solution processing.”
Additives used in prior research tended to aggregate within the perovskite film during co-precipitation in the course of solvent evaporation, according to Yang. “This led us to formulate a hypothesis: exploring alternative processing methods beyond the commonly used evaporative precipitation and crystallization could potentially decrease defects and the presence of insulating inclusions,” said Yang.
The academics utilized thermotropic liquid crystals to avoid the evaporative precipitation of conventional additives and the typical interface accumulation to enable uniform passivation of the large-area perovskite films. “The approach achieved a fast scan efficiency of 21.8% and stabilized efficiency of 21.1% for 30 cm2 perovskite mini modules with enhanced stability,” said Yang.
Specifically, the team worked with thermotropic liquid crystals, such as 3,4,5-trifluoro-4′-(trans-4-propylcyclohexyl)biphenyl (TFPCBP), embedding the material into the large-area perovskite films.
The cells were fabricated in an n–i–p configuration, employing a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on a buckminsterfullerene (C60) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), a perovskite absorber, a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The perovskite solar modules consisted of six and nine sub-cells connected in series on 5 cm × 5 cm and 6.5 cm × 7 cm substrates, respectively.
The team selected thermotropic liquid crystals because of their “characteristic mesomorphic phase transition from a solid to an isotropic liquid phase when heated.” They remain in the liquid phase while the perovskite solidifies. “The efficient diffusion within a mixed liquid-solid system enabled TFPCBP molecules to distribute uniformly throughout the film for a homogenous passivation of defects,” said Yang.
The academics conducted several standards-based stability tests of the treated cells and modules, including reverse bias tests, and found superior stability results. For example, the damp-heat stability of encapsulated modules was tested using the ISOS-D-3 procedure, subjecting them to 85% RH at 85 C. “The TFPCBP-based modules retained 86% of their initial efficiency after 1,200 h, compared with 51% retention for the control,” noted the researchers, adding that it “represents the longest-lived damp-heat stability in literature among n–i–p perovskite solar modules.”
The team sees the potential to transfer the technology to slot-die coating processes to fabricate larger-area perovskite sub-modules. In addition, Yang sees opportunities for further exploration of the functionality and phase structure of liquid crystal molecules to improve passivation effects and device stability.
Their findings are available in the study “A thermotropic liquid crystal enables efficient and stable perovskite solar modules,” published in Nature Energy.  The scientists came from Northwestern University, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, North China Electric Power University, the University of Toronto, and the US Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory.

An agreement between the US government, the US states of Washington and Oregon, and four Native American tribes will facilitate the buildout of at least 1 GW to 3 GW of tribally sponsored clean energy capacity, according to the administration of US President Joe Biden.
The agreement, proposed to the Biden administration by four tribes and two states, could receive more than $1 billion of federal funding. The agreement encompasses the original proposal, known as the Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative, and has the ultimate goal of restoring salmon, steelhead and other native fish populations in the river basin.
A key feature of the agreement is the goal of breaching four dams on the lower Snake River, whose locations, all in southeastern Washington, are shown in the image below from Trout Unlimited.

Salmon populations in the river system have been dwindling due to the presence of hydroelectric dams, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reported. Salmon and steelhead populations on the lower Snake River are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

14,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/01/photovoltaics-can-reduce-economic-poverty-by-4-5-in-china/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",BERNADETTE GEYER,2024-02-01,Photovoltaics can reduce economic poverty by 4.5% in China,"Researchers from the University of Zurich and Wuhan University have assessed how solar energy resources affect social and economic development to reduce poverty in China, using empirical data from the country’s Photovoltaic Poverty Alleviation Project (PPAP).
Through PPAP, the government provides monetary and material assistance for the installation of PV systems, which then enables poor households to earn an income by selling electricity to grid companies. “An increasing number of studies have shown that integrating PV with issues such as poverty reduction or environmental protection has made significant contributions to global sustainable development in recent years,” the scientists noted. “Exploring the comprehensive effectiveness of projects based on PV may play a good role in promoting poverty reduction and energy sustainability in other countries.”
The team found that the PPAP program could reduce the “multidimensional poverty” – which encompasses multiple aspects of personal and societal well-being – level by 3.0%. It noted that previous studies have focused on solar projects’ effects on energy poverty or the economic benefits on communities. This study also observed that while PPAP can reduce economic poverty by 4.5%, it can also “contribute 3.4% and 3.2% to poverty reduction in the two dimensions of social and human capital, respectively.”
For their assessment, the researchers identified five poverty dimensions and 11 indicators based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, as well as a comprehensive multidimensional poverty index. The research team constructed a four-year data set based on figures from the 1,402 counties in mainland China. The 71 pilot counties of the PPAP were designated as the treatment group, while the rest of the counties were set as the control group. The research team used the propensity score matching and difference-in-difference (PSM-DID) method of modeling to determine the net contribution the PPAP had on multidimensional poverty reduction.
“We selected control counties that matched the treated counties on key variables,” the academics explained. “The matching variables include a county’s per capita GDP, the proportion of the educated population, the agricultural land area, and the county’s development level, because these variables are closely related to the county’s poverty level and control the county’s macroeconomic development, education level, and land investment.”
The team also found that the extent of poverty alleviation varied strongly depending on the region of China in which a PV project was installed.  For example, the poverty reduction effect was strongest in the Northwest at 4.3%, while it was weakest in the Southwest at 1.9%. The researchers speculated that the difference in PV power station types supported by PPAP could also have played a role. For example, the northern regions primarily rely on large-scale, centralized facilities, which can help more households.
Their findings are available in the study “The effect of large scale photovoltaic-based projects on poverty reduction: Empirical evidence from China,” published in Renewable Energy. “These results imply that policymakers can plan PV deployments taking into account the heterogeneity of project implementation to maximize its benefits and avoid one-size-fits-all policies across the whole country,” they concluded.

“The first of its kind to be made in India, the Havells Heat Pump Water Heater delivers three times more efficient heating with every shower,” the company said in a statement. “Transferring the heat from the air to the water, the Micro Channel Heat Exchanger saves 75% more energy. Perfect for large households, the heat pump water heater delivers hot water at multiple usage points, requires minimal maintenance and has a low operating cost.”
The 3.5 kW HP30 White Silver (300 L) system measures 1,555 mm x 630 mm, with a rated power input of 940 W. It has a rated voltage of 230 V at 50 Hz AC frequency.
The floor-mounted system includes a safety valve, a PT valve, an outer thread adaptor, and a wired digital controller. It features a cold rolled steel tank for high-pressure applications and high-density polyurethane foam (PUF) insulation. It also uses a magnesium anode rod for corrosion protection.
Havells India offers a two-year comprehensive warranty for the product. It also provides an additional seven-year warranty for the compressor and a five-year warranty for the inner container.
“Think of it as a reverse refrigerator. It is a water heater that transfers heat from one place to another, instead of generating heat directly,” the manufacturer said. “Therefore, it is two to three times more energy efficient than conventional electric resistance water heaters.”

Enphase Energy, Inc. has started shipping its new IQ8 Microinverters, IQ8HC and IQ8X in North America. With peak output AC power of 384 W, the new microinverters are designed to pair with a full range of solar modules up to 540 W.
IQ8HC Microinverters can manage a continuous DC current of 14 A, supporting high-power solar modules through increased energy harvesting. The IQ8X Microinverters are available in the U.S. and support solar modules with higher output DC voltage and cell counts, such as 96-cells, 80 half-cut cells and 88 half-cut cells.
The new IQ8 Microinverters build on the previous models’ ability to keep the power running during a grid blackout. The device is designed to react to real-time usage in the home and adjust accordingly. The system will feed as much electricity as it has access to based on sunlight available and solar power capacity, and it, reportedly, will adjust on the fly. When the house is using more energy than provided by the solar setup, the Enphase system is designed to shut down and instantly restart when the excess load is removed.
The company offers a 25-year warranty for all IQ8 Microinverters activated in the United States and Canada, and a 12-year warranty for products activated in Mexico.
“Enphase is staying ahead of the industry by developing products that can handle the ever-increasing power density of new solar modules,” said Tom Chentnik, owner of Independent Green Technologies of Texas, an installer of Enphase products.
Enphase Energy Systems in North America reports that the IQ8 Microinverters can also be paired with IQ Batteries for an all-in-one solution. The IQ Combiners consolidate interconnection equipment into a single enclosure and provide a pre-wired solution that includes an IQ Gateway, cell modem, current transformers (CTs), and more.
Enphase has shipped approximately 72 million microinverters, and more than 3.8 million Enphase-based systems have been deployed in over 145 countries. However, in October pv magazine USA reported that Enphase had had a difficult year, with its performance struggling in-line with other residential solar market leaders, which have seen high interest rates, regulatory changes like California’s NEM 3.0, and stabilizing energy prices make a significant dent in rooftop solar installations.
Enphase attributed its pullback in sell-through in California to NEM 3.0. However, at the time, management said it is confident that solar-plus-battery systems will have a payback period under NEM 3.0 that approaches NEM 2.0 levels, and that sales should normalize in “a few more quarters.”
