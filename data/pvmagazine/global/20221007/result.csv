That compares to none in 2020 and six in 2019.
According to the latest annual edition of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, published by French nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider, three of the six reactors are located in China and the other three are located in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
“Last year was a bit better in terms of power generation and construction starts,” Schneider told pv magazine. “Six reactors came online in 2021 but the closure decision was taken for ten, two of which did not generate any power since 2018, so in our statistics, they are closed retroactively in 2018.”
He said this slight upward trend cannot be described as a global rebound.
“There were 10 construction starts in 2021, including six in China, and four built by Russia,which is double the five in 2020, including four in China and one by Russia. In the first half of 2022, there were three construction starts in the world, all in China,” he said. “So it looks as if China is increasing construction again. But it is much too early to call this a trend. And outside China, absolutely nothing is happening, except for the few Russian projects – and who knows what impact sanctions will have, even if the nuclear sector is so far excluded.”
Schneider acknowledged that there is huge pressure to extend lifetimes due to the current energy crisis. And there have been some results, like in Belgium and California, for example. But he also said this may not be enough to help the industry recover, with nominal net nuclear electricity generating capacity declining by more than 0.4 GW in the year leading up to 2021.
“Technology geriatrics cannot ensure nuclear power species’ survival,” he said.
In the report, Schneider and his team of experts revealed that there have been 98 startups and 105 closures of nuclear power plants over the past two decades.
“Of these, 50 startups were in China which did not close any reactors,” the team said. “Thus, outside China, there was a net decline by 57 units over the same period; net capacity dropped by 25 GW.”
Currently, there are 411 reactors operating across 33 countries. That's four units less than last year, seven less than in 1989, and 27 less than the 2002 peak of 438.
“Nuclear production increased by 3.9% in 2021, but remained just below the 2019 level,” the report said. “China produced more nuclear electricity than France for the second year in a row and remains in second place – behind the United States – for the top nuclear power generators.”
Comparing the 2021 trajectory of nuclear power with that of renewable energy, the authors of the report noted that investments in non-hydro renewables totaled $366 billion, which is 15 times more than the investments made for the construction of nuclear power plants, which reached 8.8 GW last year.
The analysts cited recent figures from US-based Lazard showing that between 2009 and 2021, the levelized cost of energy of large-scale solar and wind fell by 90% and 72%, respectively, while that of nuclear power rose by 36%.
“In 2021, wind and solar alone reached a 10.2% share of power generation, the first time, they provided more than 10% of global power and surpassed the contribution of nuclear energy that fell to 9.8%,” they said. “The nuclear share is below 10% for the first time in four decades.”
The report also presents data on individual countries, potential emerging countries, the decommissioning of existing plants, and the current status of the small modular reactor technology. It also includes a chapter on the difficult decommissioning of the Fukushima reactor in Japan and a new section on the vulnerabilities of nuclear reactors during wars.

Attaching a solar array to a home is a long-term commitment, with many considerations, and one that offers great potential for energy bill savings. A recent addition to the list of options is whether or not to attach a battery energy storage system.
A battery can often add $10,000 or more to the total cost of a residential solar system, according to EnergySage. But it comes with a range of benefits that vary depending on the home’s electricity needs and experience with the utility company. So, what are the benefits?
Backup power
Blackouts or power outages occur with varied frequency and for different reasons, depending on location. Some regions experience transmission issues on the grid, weather events can knock out power, and some regions like southern California have scheduled rolling blackouts during high energy-demand periods.
A SunPower-backed survey of 1,500 homeowners found that 40% of respondents worried about power outages on a monthly basis. And one-third of respondents said high-profile outages, like the ones caused by winter storms in Texas this past February, are the top reason for considering energy storage.
The next logical question might be: how much battery to install, and for how long should it provide backup?
Installers typically give the choice between whole-home backup, which often require the installation of multiple batteries, or a partial backup, which allows the homeowner to select specific circuits that are tied to desired appliances or outlets. When selecting specific breakers, homeowners often select the refrigerator, garage door opener, home office, or other kitchen appliances.
To understand a home’s power needs, and to evaluate what is most essential to back-up, homeowners can use the Department of Energy’s Energy Saver appliance energy calculator.
One of the most common home batteries is the Tesla Powerwall, which has a 13.5 kWh usable storage capacity. This means it can provide 13.5 kW for one hour, or 1 kW for 13.5 hours, said EnergySage. A second big energy storage brand is from LG Chem, which has  9.6 kWh and 16 kWh models.
Translated to appliances, EnergySage said 13.5 kWh is equivalent to running a 3,500 W air source heat pump for just under four hours, a 200 W refrigerator for 67.5 hours, or five 20 W light bulbs for 135 hours.
EnergySage said a PowerWall can typically back up essentials like WiFi, phone, refrigerator, and some lights for about 24 hours.
Simulations by the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of residential solar and storage systems operated for backup power purposes suggest that a system with a 7 kW pv array and 10 kWh of storage could support 60% to 80% of a customer’s average daily load over the course of a year, depending on the region.
Plus, if the sun is still shining, a battery-connected solar array will continue to produce and store electricity. Solar arrays without a battery must power down during an outage, for safety reasons. Without a battery to store the power, there is no safe place for the power to go, so the system must use a rapid shut down device (the grid is inaccessible as it’s being repaired).
Solar installers will typically work with a homeowner to determine backup needs, and will evaluate the readiness of the home’s main electrical panel to be integrated for backup. In some cases, the installer will call for a main panel upgrade to accommodate the battery, Doing this may come at an additional cost.
Smarter, more valuable  
Without a battery, a grid-tied home solar array will export any unused power directly to the grid in real-time. With a battery, electricity can be charged and discharged in ways that optimize energy bill savings.
Take demand charges, for instance. Some utilities, including providers in Massachusetts, Arizona, and Illinois, charge an additional fee based on the maximum amount of power required over a single hour, or 15-minute period, in a given month. A battery can be scheduled to discharge power during peak use times so that peak energy demand is smoothed, and demand charges are lower.
Utilities also use a billing design called time-of-use, which, similarly to demand charges, are intended to discourage power use during peak demand periods. For example, a utility may charge a lower rate of $0.15/kWh during off-peak hours, and then increase the rate to $0.32/kWh.
With a battery, the home is able to store energy during off-peak hours, which typically occur during the day when the solar array is producing the most. The battery can then export power to the home during on-peak hours, which are often in the evening as people return from work and run appliances and the array produces less power. Without a battery, homeowners are subject to whatever rate is being charged if the array is not actively producing.
A third benefit is the ability of the battery to provide value in utilities without net metering. Net metering is the process of exporting energy to the power grid in exchange for credits that can be used to offset utility bill costs.
Some utilities offer a one-to-one value, meaning each kWh of power sent out will cover one kWh of utility bill costs. Others have a decreased value for net metering. 
For example, power may be billed by the utility at $0.16/kWh, but the value of exported energy only offers a credit value of $0.08/kWh. Other utilities offer no net metering credit whatsoever, like in Hawaii, where battery attachment rates are much higher than the rest of the United States at 80%. Again, in the net metering scenario, batteries are able to store and provide power, limiting exposure to the value loss in poor net metering climates.
Cost factors
A lithium-ion home battery comes with a sizeable price tag, usually around $10,000. Currently, energy storage that is paired with a residential solar system is eligible for the 26% federal investment tax credit.
Certain states and utilities offer additional incentives for including batteries, and in some cases the value adder can make a dramatic difference. The SMART program in Massachusetts, the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) of California, and incentive programs in Maryland and Long Island provide up-front cost relief for batteries.
Programs like ConnectedSolutions of New England offer further savings to homeowners who opt-in to a “bring-your-own-battery” program, wherein an incentive is paid to homeowner who agree to allow their batteries to export power to the grid during times of extreme peak demand.
In addition to the ticket-price of the battery, there may be hardware costs associated, as well. Tesla estimates supporting hardware for the battery costs $1,100, and installation will range from $800 to $2,000. Electrical work like a main panel upgrade may drive costs higher, and some installers will require the customer to cover costs like permit fees or retailer/connection charges, said EnergySage.
Retrofit later?
Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance reports lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen 87% from 2010 to 2019. With global supply chains ramping up lithium production due to increased demand (also driven by electric vehicle adoption) it is possible that further price reductions may occur. But is it worth waiting for a cheaper battery?
The answer depends, but in the past, the cost of installing a battery after-the-fact, or “retrofitting”, is dependent on the inverters on the array, said EnergySage. Most home solar arrays are installed with AC-coupled inverters, which would then need to be re-converted by an additional inverter back to DC for use by the battery. This means a retrofitted battery would come with an additional cost of another inverter, plus installation costs.
A solar system with a battery included at initial install can include just one DC-coupled inverter, which reduces costs, and converts and stores energy more efficiently than AC-coupled solutions.
Now that the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is law, the 30% Investment Tax Credit applies not just to solar-paired batteries, but also to standalone storage. This has made retrofits and standalone installations more common among installers.
Inverter companies are actively working to make retrofits easier. For example, Enphase recently released a microinverter that the company said can be retrofit to any type of home energy storage battery without the need for recoupling.

It used a Nafion membrane and a high-performance, organic-inorganic halide perovskite as a panchromatic absorber. Instead of water, the team resorted to lignocellulosic (LC) biomass as an alternative source of electrons working at lower potentials. Water as a source of electrons is complicated, as water oxidation is the slowest process in solar hydrogen production, requiring a high potential. “LC biomass has been less explored, especially for solar hydrogen production, due to their low solubility and molecular complexity, which result in low conversion yields of LC biomass with poor selectivity,” the  team wrote in “Bias-free solar hydrogen production at 19.8 mA cm−2 using perovskite photocathode and lignocellulosic biomass.” Value-added chemicals such as vanillin and acetovanillone are produced via the selective depolymerization of lignin in lignocellulosic biomass. At the same time, cellulose remains close to intact for further utilization, the researchers reported in the article published in Nature Communications.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is building Takasago Hydrogen Park, the world's first center to validate hydrogen-related technologies. It will be dedicated to verifying hydrogen production, storage, power generation, and other next-generation technologies. “Hydrogen will be produced on-site using water electrolysis, and potentially also using other next-generation technologies such as methane pyrolysis to produce ‘turquoise' hydrogen with solid carbon as a by-product,” said the Japanese company. The facility is due for completion in the 2023 Japanese fiscal year. The group aims to help commercialize 30% hydrogen and natural gas co-firing for large-frame gas turbines by 2025, and 100% hydrogen firing for small and mid-sized gas turbines. Takasago Hydrogen Park is smaller than other hydrogen projects under development around the world. However, it is reportedly the first example of a verification project that could facilitate future investments in hydrogen.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has entered a strategic collaboration with Tree Energy Solutions (TES) to accelerate the development of a green energy import facility in Germany. FFI will invest €130 million ($127 million), while Netherlands Fortescue Future Industries Holdings B.V. will invest €30 million to become a shareholder in Tree Energy Solutions B.V., as well as €100 million in the construction of a TES terminal in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, said the company. It will also become a major shareholder with a 30% stake in Deutsche Grüngas und Energieversorgung GmbH, the project company that will build the TES Green Energy Hub in Wilhelmshaven, it added. The first delivery of green hydrogen into the terminal should occur in 2026. Initial collaboration projects will be focused on Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The European energy infrastructure developer, led by Marco Alverà, is also developing a portfolio of terminals throughout the world. FFI is also making investments in Australia. Together with Incitec Pivot Ltd., it is considering converting an existing ammonia manufacturing facility near Brisbane to run on locally produced green hydrogen.
Lhyfe said it will develop a 200 MW green hydrogen production plant in Delfzijl, the Netherlands. The local industrial and chemical industry is already a large consumer of hydrogen as a chemical feedstock. “Delfzijl is an ideal location for renewable green hydrogen production as it has direct access to renewable energies from its offshore wind power plants, which are situated off the coast,” said Luc Grare, head of Central and Eastern Europe at Lhyfe. The region around Groningen aims to become the leading hydrogen hub for northwestern Europe, with a value chain ranging from green hydrogen production to storage and transportation. “Lhyfe's Delfzijl plant will be able to supply green hydrogen throughout the Netherlands, as well as to potential off-takers in Germany and other bordering countries,” said Grare.
ZeroAvia said this week that it has acquired HyPoint in full. The company, which develops solutions for zero-emission commercial aviation, did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. The acquisition of HyPoint will combine the fuel cell stack company's advanced high-temperature fuel cell technology with ZeroAvia's expertise.
Fusion Fuel has entered into a technology sale agreement with Keme Energy to supply its solar-to-hydrogen system for a 1.22 MW green hydrogen project in Sines, Portugal. It expects to begin construction of the facility early next year and achieve commercial operation in the second half of 2023. The project, which is expected to produce an estimated 77 tons of green hydrogen per year, secured a €2.4 million grant from Portugal's Poseur program in late 2021.
Chemours and Advanced Performance Materials have announced a planned $200 million investment to increase capacity and advance technology for Chemours' Nafion ion exchange materials for the hydrogen economy. The proton exchange membranes are used in water electrolyzers, flow batteries and fuel cells. 
The UK government said that England's Tees Valley area will host a competition to determine how hydrogen can be used for cleaner, more efficient transport. “The competition will address challenges such as refueling on a large scale, ensuring buses and coaches can use hydrogen in public transport ecosystems and how to make the supply chain greener with hydrogen-fueled HGVs,” it said. 
The European Commission has approved a €1 billion German measure to help Salzgitter Flachstahl decarbonize its steel production processes by using hydrogen, including renewable hydrogen produced on site, thanks to a new production facility.

India's Statcon Energiaa has developed a plug-and-play outdoor inverter solution that provides uninterrupted power supplies to microgrid customers, with the option of combining renewable energy resources such as biomass, wind, hydro and solar. The “Microgrid Energy Corridor” also connects with other microgrids through AC coupling.
“The idea of a scalable microgrid business is at the core of this product’s design philosophy,” said the company.
The product eliminates the need for array junction boxes, AC distribution boxes, or other protections, as all of these features are built into the design. It supports almost all types of external storage technologies, including lead-acid, gel, lithium and flow batteries. It also has an in-built interface for a diesel generator to charge the batteries and cater to loads. The inverter is IOT-enabled and allows multilevel remote monitoring and control.
The product supports AC coupling and DC coupling, and AC-AC power transfer to connect multiple microgrids.
“It’s reliable and has inbuilt redundancy in design to ensure zero downtime. It is indigenously designed and developed with all its components like transformers, cabinets, power stack PCBs, and software designed in India,” said the company.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/07/portugals-first-solar-energy-community-yields-results/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,PORTUGAL",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 7, 2022",Portugal’s first solar energy community yields results,"Portugal’s first renewable energy community (REC) was inaugurated in August 2021 in Miranda do Douro, a northern small rural village close to the border with Spain. The project was implemented by Cleanwatts, a climate tech company offering clean energy services based in Coimbra, Portugal. The REC is part of Cleanwatt’s “100 Aldeias” project, which aims to fight energy poverty in the sparsely populated interior of Portugal.
At present, the consumers of the REC are buildings of Santa Casa da Misericórdia, a well-known charitable institution in Portugal, housing nursing homes, and a kindergarten, with more than 100 members in total. After the community’s one year anniversary, Cleanwatts is “now entering in the phase of attracting new members,” Michael Pinto, the company’s CEO, told pv magazine. “Our goal is to expand the work done with the anchor client to as many people in the community as possible.”
The PV panels installed in the community have a production capacity of 73.3 kW and provide electricity for air conditioning, computers, and other energy needs of the institution.
“The benefits in the first year of operation (August 2021 to August 2022) were undeniable,” Pinto said. “Based on the indexed electricity tariff for 2022, which is estimated at €0.35/kWh, Santa Casa da Misericórdia Miranda do Douro would have spent an additional €31,500 on grid electricity,” he added. The REC had an energy autonomy of 33% (90 MWh/year) and saved 19 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
Analyzing production, consumption
Portugal’s first REC uses eRedes, the distributor unit of national utility EDP, to analyze the production and consumption profiles of the community members, so it can distribute the energy produced accordingly. It also uses Cleanwatt’s energy markets platform Kiplo to aggregate small and medium energy loads, “including batteries, EV chargers, heaters, boilers, chillers and distributed generation systems,” according to the company. The platform works through the company’s virtual power plant, to support community managers and energy market operators.
As for data protection, Cleanwatts separates personal and consumption data and stores them in difference places. That way, “we can work the consumption data, statistically and analytically, safeguarding the personal data of each member,” said Pinto. “Data are stored in a database where each member has their repository properly coded to ensure data protection and privacy.”
The community does not currently use blockchain technology, but Cleanwatts said it has tested the technology in several of its other projects.
“We do intend to make energy transactions between community members possible, in a peer-to-peer logic so that they can exchange among themselves, foster the local economy, and strengthen the community spirit,” Pinto said. “And we want these transactions to be transparent, agile and secure, so we’ll use the necessary technology to ensure the best features for the community members.”
Next step
The goal of the “100 Aldeias” project was to create 100 RECs in Portugal by the end of 2022. By August, there were already 100 and Cleanwatts believes it will reach 200 villages by the end of the year. In total, the communities have over 17.5 MW of production capacity, and more than 1,500 members.
After the success of the REC projects in Portugal, Cleanwatts is expanding into other countries. In June, the company opened a second branch in Italy, where it is co-developing several RECs with partners in northern Italy, whilst assisting other partners to launch and manage their own communities through licensing agreements for the company’s operating system platform, Cleanwatts OS.
“Speed and scale of a member state’s transposal of the EU Renewable Energy Directive into national law is a critical driver for determining whether a market is strategic for Cleanwatts. Beyond Portugal and Italy, countries that we are now assessing include Spain and Austria precisely for this reason,” said Pinto.
In the United States, the company is involved in several community projects in New York and California. It is supporting the development of a small grid solution to enable the city of Ithaca, New York, to achieve its net zero goal. Cleanwatts also signed a partnership with the Indianapolis-based industrial Internet of Things (IoT) company, Blue Pillar, to activate community level demand response throughout the country.
In Japan, Cleanwatts is delivering behind the meter efficiency services to mid-market companies and blue-chip companies, through a partnership with Macnica, a distributor of semiconductors and other hardware and software products.
As for Portugal, the company is on track to deliver almost 20 MW in aggregated solar PV capacity by the end of 2022, and believes it is “in a strong position to triple this volume by rear end 2023,” Pinto concluded.

“The Zn-Ce flow battery has the advantages of moderate cost and high energy density, but suffers from low efficiency,” researcher Walid Daoud told pv magazine, noting that the devices usually have a lifespan of just a few cycles. “Thus, we proposed a new cell design to improve its efficiency and stability.”
The battery features two membranes to separate the incompatible ions of the two electrolytes. This configuration allows the scientists to custom-assign charge carriers to ions compatible with the electrolytes while separating incompatible species. In addition, the design enables the achievement of high and stable Coulumbic efficiency, while protecting the Zn half-cell from hydrogen ion poisoning.
“The Ce electrolyte is highly oxidative, which poses a challenge towards the stability of anion membrane,” Daoud said. “Thus, the stability and selectivity of anion membrane require further improvement.”
The device achieved a voltage plateau of 2.3 V at 20 mA cm−2, energy efficiency of 71.3% at 60 mA cm−2, and a record average Coulombic efficiency of 94% during cycling.
“It is concluded that the Zn electrolyte with highly reversible Zn plating/striping and suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction forms the foundation of the high Coulombic efficiency,” said the researchers. 
Daoud said that in the future, Zn-Ce RFBS could work efficiently in conjunction with PV power generation.
“The system design flexibility and safety advantages will lead to many opportunities. The battery can be easily scaled to meet the various storage demands of solar plants,” he said. “These storage systems are promising because of the low-cost and abundance of zinc. However, the involved metallic zinc deposition induces challenges, such as limited electrode space for zinc deposition compromising the practical energy density compared to the theoretical energy density, and zinc dendrites can potentially pierce the membrane.”
The research group presented the battery technology in “The Renaissance of the Zn-Ce Flow Battery: Dual-Membrane Configuration Enables Unprecedentedly High Efficiency,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.
“This work designs a dual-membrane Zn-Ce RFB to address the incompatibility issue, with which the cell demonstrates a stable and reproducible cycling performance, thus reviving the potential of Zn-Ce RFBs as promising high-power-density rechargeable batteries,” the scientists concluded.

The TSO for the state of Baden-Württemberg, in southwest Germany, said that the Netzbooster project, which will have an energy storage capacity of 250 MWh, will ease bottlenecks in the transmission of wind power from the north of the country to demand centers in the south. The battery, to be deployed by the Fluence Energy and Siemens, will have one-hour storage capacity, so it will be able to plug any failure in the transmission network within milliseconds.
Fluence Energy said in a press release this week that the project, to be installed at the grid network hub of Kupferzell, will also offer synthetic inertia and dynamic voltage control to TransnetBW's transmission network.
“We look forward to delivering this highly complex energy storage application at a scale required to support the country’s energy transition,” said Paul McCusker, senior vice president for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region at Fluence. “Given the current energy crisis impacting Europe and the focus on accelerating renewable build-out under the REPowerEU plans, the deployment of this project is more urgently needed than ever.”
Fluence Energy described the project as the “world's largest battery-based energy-storage-as-transmission project.” TransnetBW is part of publicly owned energy and telecoms business EnBW.

How would you describe market penetration at this point?
We have seen a great appetite for these systems especially in countries with difficulties in the grid such as Lebanon, Yemen and many parts of North Africa. We believe the [energy storage systems] will start replacing diesel generators as a first step of market penetration in this region, especially with the current oil prices that exceed $1/liter sometimes. In some countries, investments in solar-plus-storage can have an internal rate of return of over 25%, making it a tremendous move towards more reliable, greener, and cheaper source of energy.
Has JinkoSolar already supplied some of its storage products in the MENA region?
We have proudly supplied for some very interesting projects varying from 10 kWh all the way up to 10 MWh in between the Middle East and Africa. And we feel having a proof of concept on the ground will stimulate the market into increasing the adoption rate of such systems, especially with an obvious global energy crisis where such systems can not only provide a cheaper source of power, but also assure independence and continuity for the facility.
What segments are showing the most activity?
In the MENA region, we have seen that both residential and C&I segments are equally active. We also have noticed that some grid operators (transmission or distribution) are also considering such utility energy storage applications to stabilize the grid, especially if the solar penetration percentage is high, such as Jordan for example. We believe storage is going to be important for every single market in the region no matter what the purpose of adoption is.
How are homeowners reacting to the new opportunities offered by storage? Are they ready to make such investments?
In many countries, such systems are the only source of electricity for the homeowners. Without a solar module, battery, and an inverter, they won’t be able to accomplish their daily tasks. The next challenge in this segment is to show these homeowners that this investment can be a long term one, as batteries can live for over 15 years now with new technologies such as LFP, and it is time to ditch the temporary short term solutions that were popular in the previous five to 10 years to more efficient, reliable and sustainable ones.
What do you expect from the MENA storage market over the next five years?
I believe the energy storage implementation will reshape the solar market in the MENA. I believe whether the grid is suffering to perform, or it is challenged by high solar and wind adoption percentages and what is in-between, energy storage will be the answer to all the problems. Today Energy Storage have opened new horizons to expand the use and implementation of the cheap and green renewable energy in a very challenging time.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/07/ripple-effects-of-eu-revenue-cap-on-renewable-energy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 7, 2022",Ripple effects of EU revenue cap on renewable energy,"Since the approval of a revenue cap of €180 ($176)/MWh for electricity from generators with low marginal costs, including solar and wind, reactions from analysts and industry groups have been mixed. However, there is broad consensus that for developers, the ruling could open up a number of uncertainties if EU member states choose to enact different caps, consequently slowing down renewables rollout.
According to a survey by US-based LevelTen, 26% of respondents said that their PPA offer activity would fall if individual countries impose their own price caps. That is to say, different caps and rules could stall projects until that uncertainly is resolved.
“Different price setting mechanisms across the continent will have an unintended ripple effect on neighboring markets,” said Kristian Lande, senior director of European analytics for LevelTen Energy. “Without consensus among 27 countries on the timing and price level, there will be greater uncertainty, which will likely lead to less investment across the board.”
This echoes concerns voiced by SolarPower Europe about the possible “patchwork implementation” of the emergency energy measures agreed by the European Commission and European Council last week. Previously, the European solar industry trade body called for such measures to be applied uniformly, out of fear that less solar-friendly European member states would be ready to exploit any opportunity to penalize renewables more harshly than other “infra-marginal” generators, such as operators of lignite power plants or nuclear reactors.
PPA supply impact
In the survey of 19 developers with projects on the LevelTen Energy Marketplace, 42% said that a price cap of €180/MWh would not change their PPA offer activity. The same percentage said they will continue to submit some offers, but only for selected opportunities.
The cap is supposed to be temporary, so if a project is not expected to reach commercial operation until 2024, it might not be affected at all. On the other hand, projects that are nearing their commercial operation dates (COD) will be most affected, particularly if a portion of their capacity has been reserved for the spot market.
However, LevelTen said that even with the €180/MWh cap, the spot market remains an attractive option for developers who want to capture the full revenue potential of today’s market conditions. And finally, “there is hope that the incredibly high wholesale prices will attract a huge amount of investment, fueling development that will increase overall supply of renewable projects, and some of that capacity could be reserved for PPAs,” according to LevelTen.
Different types of PPAs will be affected in different ways. Most long-term contracts are not producing revenues above €180/MWh for generators, so the new regulations will not have an impact on them. According to Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, these fixed-rate contracts represent 60% of the total installed renewables capacity in the EU.
On the other hand, short-term PPAs – the prices of which are typically closely linked to actual market prices – are likely to be most affected and renegotiated if they are higher than €180/MWh. According to Rystad, the remaining 40% of renewable energy capacity falls into this category.
“While the revenue cap would apply to all renewable energy plants, only about 40% are benefiting from the current crisis,” the consultancy said in September. “Targeting all types of plants with such a non-tailored policy confuses the market and calls into question the effectiveness of the response.”
But overall, PPA prices are expected to continue to rise in the near term, due to a supply and demand imbalance. Even before the revenue cap proposal, supply was struggling to keep pace with demand, putting PPA prices on an upward trajectory.
According to Swiss consultancy Pexapark, 10-year PPAs for solar, onshore wind and offshore wind technology have doubled in price this year to an average of €107.80/MWh. In August alone, one-year electricity contracts in Germany and France surpassed €1,000 ($987)/MWh for the first time on record.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/07/waaree-energies-raises-122-4-million-to-expand-solar-manufacturing/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 7, 2022",Waaree Energies raises $122.4 million to expand solar manufacturing,"From pv magazine India
India's Waaree Energies said this week that it has raised around $122.4 million from various private investors.
The Mumbai-based company will use the proceeds to expand its solar module manufacturing capacity in India to 9 GW per year. It currently has 5 GW of operational PV module capacity and expects to commission the remaining 4 GW by January 2023. It also plans backward integration into the manufacturing of solar cells, with a capacity of 5.4 GW.
The company recently withdrew its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed with capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). It filed the draft papers in September 2021 as it sought to raise money for PV manufacturing expansion and other purposes.
Waaree Energies recently emerged as India’s largest exporter of solar panels. It is purportedly the only manufacturer in India on the government’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) for 650 Wp solar panels.
The ALMM list includes eligible models and manufacturers of solar modules that comply with the Bureau of Indian Standards. Only the models and manufacturers included on the ALMM list can qualify for use in government projects and projects set up under government schemes and programs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/07/re-source-2022-eu-revenue-cap-hamstrings-ppa-market-in-hour-of-need/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE,NETHERLANDS,WESTERN EUROPE",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"OCTOBER 7, 2022",RE-Source 2022: EU revenue cap hamstrings PPA market in hour of need,"There is universal consensus that corporate power purchase agreements, a key solution to Europe’s current energy crisis, will accelerate renewables deployment, but uptake is currently stalled due to a perfect storm of policy, permitting, and pricing. This was the clear message on the first day of RE-Source 2022, which brings together corporate offtakers and renewable project developers in Amsterdam this week.  
Emergency measures taken at the European level to cap the revenues of electricity generators is putting a break of the signing of corporate PPAs at a time when they are needed more than ever. The European Commission brought together the energy ministers of member countries on Sept. 30, where they agreed on a suggested revenue cap of €180 ($175)/MWh for electricity generators that do not use gas as fuel, in order  to protect European electricity consumers.
These “excess revenues” above €180/MWh are to be collected by governments. However, the outcome of the meeting was a recommendation of the revenue cap, among other measures, and European members states have been left to enact their own market interventions.  
The European Commission’s head of unit DG ENER, Paula Abreu Marques, noted that “important decisions regarding the energy crisis are being made on an almost daily basis.” The result of the decision of Sept. 30 is that corporate and industrial offtakers and renewable energy project developers and owners are balking at signing new PPAs, while chaos reigns.  
“The main issue is that it’s a European regulation, but not a uniform European law,” Dries Acke, policy director of SolarPower Europe, told pv magazine. “The [European] Commission came in with an EU revenue cap. But the members states demanded the flexibility to do other things, go below, above, or [introduce] technology specific [measures]. It is merely a guidance of what the EU would ideally like you [member states] to do, that’s where the uncertainty comes in.”

Variation on the EU member state level is already evident. In Belgium, discussions are underway to set a revenue cap of €130/MWh, below the European regulation.
“Members states feel very comfortable to do whatever they want,” said Acke, noting that the uncertainty is having a “chilling” effect on the European PPA market. “If you strike a PPA, and you don’t know exactly what level of revenue you will need to maintain, you are confronted with an uncertainty in your metric that is new.” 
At the RE-Source event, corporate offtakers lamented the situation. Google’s global head of data center energy, Amanda Peterson Corio, said that like other companies, the tech giant is still digesting the outcome of the Sept. 30 meeting. She noted that it is unclear how long the market intervention will last.  
“There were some suggested dates in the Friday guidance,” said Corio, speaking on the first day of RE-Source 2022. 
The European Commission has signposted June 30, 2023, as a potential date, but there are fears that the revenue cap will be extended.
“We need a better understanding of the timing, so we know how to price that in,” added Corio, noting that Google has contracted approximately 7 GW of clean energy throughout the world to supply its data centers.  
Philipp Pfefferle the director of BASF Renewable Energy, said the intervention should be as short-lived as possible. He noted that the company does not want to see an extension of the suggested end date of June 30, 2023. BASF, the world’s largest chemical company, uses 6 TWh of electricity per year at its facility in Ludwigshafen, Germany – enough to power 2 million European households.  
Frustratingly, while the PPA market is largely stalled, there is universal agreement at RE-Source that accelerating renewables adoption is the key solution to the current energy crisis, to address security of supply, cost, and sustainability. However, there is hope that the PPA market will persevere, despite the short-term challenges.  
“Price caps may be well intended they can have lots of unintended consequences,” said Macquarie Green Investment Group’s head of core renewables, Edward Northam. “But the foundations of the market are so sound that we are willing to work through that.”

Paris-based Voltalia said this week that it has secured a PPA from the titanium dioxide miner to take 300 GWh per year of clean electricity from a 148 MW solar project it plans to build in South Africa's Limpopo province.
The developer did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, but it said the electricity would be delivered through the grid under a wheeling arrangement. South Africa recently updated its electricity regulations to permit wheeling and to ease the process by which independent power producers can supply energy to corporate clients.
Richards Bay Minerals will use the clean electricity to power its smelting and processing facilities in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, said Voltalia. The French company said that around 700 construction jobs and about 50 permanent positions would be associated with the 148 MW solar project.
Voltalia added that it will locally source the solar panels and related services for the project. It described the planned installation as “the largest renewable energy site dedicated to a corporate client in South Africa.”
