The 7m-diameter parabolic dish concentrates sunlight into a 144 cm^2 reactor where water is pumped, achieving a solar-to-hydrogen device-level efficiency of greater than 20% at an H2 production rate of >2.0 kW. The scientists published their findings from the project, which is first system-level demonstration of solar hydrogen generation, in a recent edition of Nature Energy. Heat and oxygen are recovered and used, and an EPFL start-up, SoHHytec, is commercializing the system to scale up the technology.
Sapienza University of Rome scientists have collaborated with Sorbonne University, CNRS, and SISSA to create a phase diagram of hydrogen and deuterium at high pressures and low temperatures. They discovered that the atomic metallic hydrogen phase forms at 577(4) GPa, and the molecular hydrogen transforms from a metallic phase to another molecular structure (phase VI) at 410(20) GPa. The researchers said in a recent paper in Nature Physics that anharmonic vibrations of nuclei can make the metallic hydrogen phase stable at much larger pressures than previously estimated.
Plug Power has delivered three containerized electrolyzers to Hungary-based Ganzair for two projects. One is the Bukkabrany Solar PV Park project, which will generate 850 kg of hydrogen daily to be mixed with the local gas pipeline to heat homes and businesses. The other project, Aquamarine, will test the use of hydrogen for storage purposes. The New York-based company said that this will demonstrate the long-duration energy storage potential of green hydrogen. The 3 1 MW containerized electrolyzer systems will be installed later this year. These are Plug's first electrolyzer systems delivered in the EU and are expected to be the first in operation.
Glenfarne and Samsung Engineering have launched a collaboration agreement to complete feasibility studies for multiple green hydrogen and ammonia projects in Chile, as part of Glenfarne's recently announced Hydrogen Fuels Initiative. “Green Pegasus, the first project being developed as part of the agreement, will have up to two gigawatts of solar PV installed capacity and is estimated to produce 459 kilotons (kton) of green ammonia and 89 kton of green hydrogen annually. Green Pegasus will primarily focus on export to Asia, particularly South Korea, and Europe, where Glenfarne maintains several business and commercial partners,” said Glenfarne.

The market for interconnected home energy solutions is being stimulated by recent policy changes in US states such as California and North Carolina. These new policies are affecting the production value of residential solar energy and its application to distributed energy solutions like home storage and EV charging systems.
LG’s new residential storage system connects two 10-hour batteries or 16-hour Prime battery modules in parallel to offer a capacity of 19.2 kWh to 32 kWh, with a maximum output of 9.6kW from the inverter.
Prime+ launches across the U.S. beginning this week and represents LG’s first residential energy storage system that includes an inverter in the North American market under its own brand name.
The company reports that the storage system’s modular architecture and plug-and-play design of the inverter ensures easy installation and compatibility with any existing photovoltaic array.
“It takes less than 10 minutes for full inverter and battery commissioning, substantially lifting the time burden for the installers,” said Ryan Simpson, sales director of LGES ESS Team in North America.
Prime+ is designed as a retrofit option for partial or whole home backup due to its compatibility with the existing PV systems. The company said that the new solution is expected to benefit California residents, as the third iteration of net energy metering (NEM 3.0), which took effect in mid-April.

The researchers claim that the local climate impacts of the solar parks could be equivalent if not stronger than those caused by climate change.
The researchers quantitatively compared the climate effects of solar parks in the Gobi Deserts in China under various emission scenarios. This is the first such comparison between PV-induced climate effects and projected climate variability.
The team combined the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projection models for the simulations. WRF is a numerical weather prediction system suitable for various applications, such as weather forecasting and atmospheric research, while the CMIP6 is used for climate projections. The CMIP6 is commonly used to understand past, present and future climate changes arising from natural, unforced variability.
“In situ meteorological observations from two PV power plants, located in Xinjiang and Qinghai, China, were also included to validate this model,” the academics stated. “In this parameterization, each utility-scale PV plant is treated as a shortwave radiation sink and a sensible heat flux source, and the latent heat flux directly relates to evaporation through the latent heat of vaporization.”
To represent typical summer/winter climatology, the team analyzed 20 different five-year July and January periods from 2008 to 2062.
“These favorable changes in humidity, evaporation and wind speed, as predicted in this study, would contribute to improving ecological conditions, which are in line with the previous reports about the vigorously growth of vegetation in PV plants established in dry climates,” they said.
The study suggests that the spatial coverage of solar plants has a greater impact on climate than their intensity.
“Therefore, future work is needed to address this issue by conducting the long-term simulations under different scenarios, and the dependence of the PV-induced effects on climate and soil conditions should be also considered,” the scientists concluded.

With Decree n. 7189, published this week in the official gazette, the Turkish authorities have set a 10-year FIT of TRY 1.06/kWh for PV systems that installed between July 1, 2021, and Dec. 31, 2030. In addition, solar projects that use PV components produced in Turkey will receive an extra 5-year tariff of TRY0.2880 ($0.015)/kWh.
The government also set a 10-year FIT of TRY 1.25 for wind and solar projects that include battery storage, with an added bonus of TRY 0.3845/kWh for domestic content, lasting for 10 years. The FITs for onshore and offshore wind were set at TRY 1.06/kWh and TRY 1.44/kWh, respectively. For other renewable energy sources, including pumped hydro, geothermal power, biomass, and wave energy, the FITs range from TRY 1.06/kWh to TRY 2.02/kWh.
The government plans to subject all the FITs to a quarterly escalation mechanism based on the producer price index, consumer price index, US dollar purchase rates, and Euro purchase rates. According to Eren Engur, a board member for Turkish PV association Günder, the Turkish energy authority, EMRA, hopes to allocate around 20 GW of new PV capacity by 2030 through this scheme. The government has not yet disclosed whether there will be a size limit for PV installations eligible for the incentive scheme.
Turkey has previously supported large-scale solar projects via a YEKA PV tender scheme and an incentive program for unlicensed PV plants under 1 MW. However, the Turkish PV market is currently being driven by self-consumption and net-metered rooftop PV. Since net metering was introduced in May 2020, the market has started to shift away from megawatt-sized projects, which have traditionally dominated.
The Solar Energy Roadmap report, published by the Turkish PV association in 2019, predicted that the nation could install 38 GW of solar by 2030. A separate study, published by the Istanbul-based Shura Energy Transition Center in May 2018, had predicted solar could pass 20 GW by 2026.

Its RePower EU plan is designed to support faster uptake of residential and industrial heat pumps, with the Green Deal Industrial Plan pointing to heat pumps as one of the key technologies to meet EU climate-neutrality goals. The commission also wants to deploy an additional 30 million heat pumps by 2030 by phasing out standalone gas boilers.
The call for evidence opened on April 28 and runs until May 26. It asks for feedback on four strands of action that aim to accelerate the roll-out of heat pumps across the European Union.
The first action point is a partnership between the commission, member states, industry members, financial institutions, and research and innovation centers to scale manufacturing and create favorable conditions for heat pump deployment in Europe. These include a “favorable electricity/gas price ratio, and cross-cutting standardization and interoperability aspects,” according to a Commission’s communication.
The action plan also wants to facilitate access to all relevant EU funding programs. It will map financing possibilities for the roll-out of heat pumps at the individual level, and for heating networks supplied by large heat pumps at local and regional levels. The commission says its regional strategy will particularly focus on people affected by energy poverty.
The commission said it also plans to update its legislative rules on ecodesign and energy labeling “to ensure a sufficiently strong policy signal for the heat pump market.” It suggests recasting the emergency measures on renewable permitting, the electricity market design legislation, and the Net-Zero Industry Act. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), among others, may also be revised.
In addition, the European Commission wants to set up a dedicated heat pump skills partnership with a focus on improving communication and awareness about heat pump technology.
The call for feedback will be followed by a public consultation, planned for the second quarter of 2023. The commission expects to adopt the strategies by the fourth quarter of 2023.

The scientists said that the cell provides outstanding stability in the dark, as well as continuous heating conditions, according to “Stable and Efficient Large-Area 4T Si/perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics with Sputtered Transparent Contact,” which was recently published in Solar RRL.
“Lots of high-efficiency results coming from the industry do not reveal the device architecture and are not too useful for academic research progress,” researcher Dinesh Kabra told pv magazine. “Our report not only shows the complete device architecture but also explains the fabrication process as a typical practice of academic research. We have also provided the raw data related to dark and light I-V scan and EQE spectrum, as part of supplementary information for further development by simulation experts in the community to advance this field.”
The top perovskite cell incorporates a room-temperature sputtered transparent conducting electrode (TCE) as a rear electrode. It has an n–i–p structure and utilizes an anti-reflecting coating, an electron transport layer (ETL) made of tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), a perovskite layer, a molybdenum oxide (MoOx) layer, and a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL).
Th MoOx buffer layer protects the perovskite photo-absorber and charge transport layers from any sputter damage.
“The ambipolar property of the perovskite photo-absorber material and suitable band alignment with the ETL and HTL enables efficient charge transport toward the appropriate carrier selective contacts; hole transport to the HTL and electron transport to the ETL,” saod the academics.
This top cell technology has a power conversion efficiency of 16% in a large-area device, measuring 0.805 cm2, and 17.1% in a small–area device measuring 0.175 cm2. The cell was combined with a 23.0%-efficient monocrystalline PERC cell in a 4T silicon-perovskite tandem device and reached an overall efficiency of 26.03%.
“This was made possible through careful optimization of the TCE, busbar, perovskite photo absorber layer thickness, and implementation of ARC on both sides,” the scientists explained.
Kabra said the 4T tandem cell might be used as a replacement for glass panels of buildings or for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).

AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as New South Wales Consumer Trustee, said the four projects, worth AUD 2.5 billion ($1.66 billion) of investment, will deliver almost 1.4 GW of capacity, while the big battery will deliver at least eight hours of continuous discharge of stored electricity.
AEMO Services, an independent subsidiary of the Australian Energy Market Operator, has announced successful projects under the Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap. AC Energy's Australian unit is building the 720 MW New England Solar Farm and proposed 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm, while Goldwind Australia won with the 275 MW Coppabella Wind Farm in the southern Tablelands region.
Germany'S RWE Renewables has also secured support to build a long-duration lithium-ion battery energy storage system with at least eight hours of storage capacity. The 50 MW/400 MWh big battery is to be built beside the company’s existing 249 MW Limondale Solar Farm near Balranald in the state’s southwest.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said that together, the successful projects would deliver enough electricity to power 700,000 homes and represent more than $2.5 billion in total investment in New South Wales' renewable energy infrastructure.
Verschuer said the tender was due to support about 950 MW of new generation, with an output of about 2,500 GWh but the total was exceeded “due to the quality and value of the bids.”
In all, 1,395 MW of capacity will be supported under the tender, involving 4,009 GWh of generation, as well as the eight-hour battery.
“There is clearly a strong appetite for private sector investment in generation, storage and firming assets which capture the enormous economic opportunity of the energy transition, and we’re incentivising that investment through this tender process,” he said, adding that all the projects “have comprehensively demonstrated their financial value to [New South Wales] electricity consumers and benefits to their host communities.”
The successful projects have been awarded long-term energy service agreements (LTESAs) that will provide revenue certainty for the developers, helping to accelerate a new wave of new large-scale energy infrastructure as the NSW government looks to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
The Roadmap, launched in 2020, sets out a path to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage online by 2030 as the state prepares for the exit of its ageing coal-fired generators. Auctions are to be held twice a year until 2030 at least to ensure enough renewables capacity is built to support the transformation of the state’s energy system.
ACEN Australia Chief Executive Officer Anton Rohner said the LTESA’s will allow for greater investment certainty for businesses like ACEN.
“The LTESAs will help encourage investment in the renewables and storage capacity necessary to accelerate the transition to clean, reliable and more importantly, affordable power for Australians”, he said. “The LTESAs offer the rights to access a minimum price for generation projects over a 20-year timeframe, which protects investors like us from the risk of unexpectedly low wholesale electricity prices.”
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the new generation supported by this tender process meant NSW had now locked in 4.1 GW of its legislated 12 GW of renewables target by 2030, so was one-third of the way there.
“The transition to clean renewable energy in NSW is essential and underway,” she said. “These projects will fill the gap that will be left with the planned closures of coal-fired power stations in the coming decade.”
AEMO Services expects the selected projects to be operational and connected to the grid by as early as 2025.
AEMO Services said the projects remain subject to normal planning approval processes, including community consultation, but social licence criteria – including community benefit sharing, employment and workforce development, local supply chain development, and land use – formed part of the tender assessment.

The US House of Representatives has decided to repeal the two-year pause on solar import tariffs goods from four Southeast Asian countries responsible for about 80% of the US solar panel supply chain.
The moratorium on tariffs, passed in June 2022 by President Joe Biden, halted tariffs on goods shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia. Goods found to be in violation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws would be assessed with tariffs ranging between 50% to 250% of their shipped value.
The tariff exemption applies to modules that are imported before June 6, 2024, or modules that are installed on project sites before December 2024. Biden’s two-year moratorium is meant to act as a supply bridge while US domestic solar manufacturing ramps up.
Solar industry trade groups and major developers have voiced strong opposition to lifting the moratorium.
“The legislation will impose $1 billion in retroactive tariffs and cause 30,000 Americans to lose their jobs this year,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Ross Hopper added that the United States does not have enough production to meet demand, and the remaining 14 months of the moratorium are needed to “close the gap.”
The legislation was kicked off by a small bipartisan group in January via the Congressional Review Act.
“We cannot allow foreign solar manufacturers to violate trade law, especially when it comes at the expense of American workers and businesses,” said Congressman Dan Kildee (D-Michigan). “The Biden administration found in its own investigation that China is evading U.S. tariffs on solar imports, but has paused action on this matter, which is unacceptable.”
