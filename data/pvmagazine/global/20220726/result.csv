The company said the facility will be the country's first hydrogen plant and the world's largest integrated green hydrogen and ammonia plant. “Located in the Camaçari Industrial Complex (BA), the new plant will have an initial production capacity of 10,000 tons/year of green hydrogen and 60,000 tons/year of green ammonia,” the company said in a statement. The $120 million (€117.6) project should begin commercial operations by the end of 2023. The facility will rely on technology provided by Germany-based thyssenkrupp nucera. “By 2025, the company expects to increase fourfold the production capacity of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Unigel said. “In the first phase of the project, Unigel installs three 20 MW standard electrolyzers from thyssenkrupp nucera, adding up to a total capacity of 60 MW,” the German company stated in its own press release.
The Environment Minister of the German region of Lower Saxony, Olaf Lies, approved €2.3 million in funding for a hydrogen pilot project planned by German energy company Uniper at the Krummhoern natural gas storage site. “It has long been clear that the energy transition cannot be achieved with electrons alone. Hydrogen will be a central element for the success of the energy transition. We need it to become independent of fossil fuels and to decarbonize our energy sector and industry,” Lies said. Uniper will test the new salt cavern specifically built for hydrogen storage on a large scale and in a real-world environment at the natural gas storage facility in Krummhoern, Northern Germany, which has not been used since 2017. The company will also build a new cavern using an existing well. “The storage facility will be one of the first of its kind and is scheduled to start operating by 2024,” said Uniper. The storage capacity should reach up to 250,000 cubic meters.

A US-Belgian research team has developed a new type of catalyst for fuel cells, adding a molecule to the traditional nitrogen-coordinated iron catalyst. “Adding a fifth ligand – four nitrogens plus another one – can lead to a much more stable and robust electrocatalyst,” the researchers said. The team tested three options for the fifth ligand: azanide (NH2-); hydroxide (OH-); and sulfate (SO42-). According to the study, the fifth ligand also improves the durability of the catalyst. “It appears that this fifth ligand manages to keep the iron in the plane of the iron-nitrogen when oxygen is added into this structure.” The team used computational chemistry techniques to test the new catalysts, such as X-ray emission spectroscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The study “Identification of a Robust and Durable FeN4Cx Catalyst for ORR in PEM Fuel Cells and the Role of the Fifth Ligand” was published in ACS Catalysis. 
Solar energy and onshore wind are crucial to unlocking Africa’s hydrogen potential, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Africa Energy Outlook 2022. “With further cost declines, Africa has the potential to produce 5 000 megatonnes of hydrogen per year at less than $2 per kilogram,” reads the report. The continent has 60% of the world’s best solar resources, but only 1% of its operational solar generation capacity.
Serbia and Hungary signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on renewable hydrogen. “The signed memorandum is the basis for exchanging documents in this area and discussing potential joint projects,” said the Serbian government. 
Air Products announced it will also spend or commit at least $4 billion in additional new capital for the transition to clean energy over the next five years, bringing its total commitment to first-mover projects to $15 billion through 2027. “We continue to see significant opportunities for hydrogen and carbon capture technologies, and our industry-leading $15 billion capital commitment is further demonstration of sustainability being at the heart of our business and growth,” Seifi Ghasemi, Air Products Chairman, commented.

pv magazine attended the Renpower Kenya 2022 event at the Villa Rosa Kempinski hotel this month where it was announced wind and geothermal power will also no longer qualify for FiT payments.
The government will instead offer the fixed incentives to biomass, small hydro, and unspecified “other” renewables projects. To receive FiTs, projects must have a generation capacity no larger than 20 MW, the event was told.
No details of the auction program which will apply to solar were revealed.
George Aluru, chairperson of trade body the Electricity Sector Association of Kenya spoke about the need for Africa to deploy interconnectors to match clean power generation with demand.
Citing an estimate neighboring Ethiopia could have an 8 GW to 10 GW grid within a few years – and notably less demand – Aluru called on governments to step up efforts such as those being made to link up national grids under the eastern and southern African power pools. He also highlighted a need for more widespread deployment of utility scale batteries, to balance out supply from solar and wind generation.
Jemimah Kwakye-Fosu, senior investment officer at Nairobi-based SunFunder, called for other clean energy financiers to adopt models to reduce foreign exchange (forex) risk in Africa, where developers often seek local-currency-denominated backing but investors usually stump up dollars.
The representative from SunFunder – which was acquired by the Mirova business ultimately part of French banking giant Groupe BPCE, in June – explained how her company uses traders as third parties between investor and developer to reduce the forex risk to the other parties.
The event also heard about plans by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization to work with Japanese entity Technova to harness excess clean energy as hydrogen for use in fertilizers and transport, and for export.

With this tweet, South African president Cyril Rampahosa announced yesterday that the government is defining a new incentive scheme to help the country's households and businesses to resort to solar. “We call on all South Africans to use electricity sparingly as we work towards ending load shedding and getting more energy on the grid,” he stated.
Load shedding refers to a well-known concept among South Africans and occurs when troubled national utility Eskom reduces power supply because demand on the network is too much for it to handle. The measure is a last resort in emergencies after all attempts to balance supply and demand have failed and a solution is needed to prevent complete breakdown of the system.
The new scheme may also include unspecified tax incentives, Ramaphosa said without providing further details.
“We have spoken in the past about restructuring Eskom, which will result in three entities, namely an electricity generation entity, an electricity transmission entity and an electricity distribution entity.”

The company also revealed a 30,000-ton facility in Jiangsu started production on June 16. The news was enough to prompt chairman and major shareholder Zhu Gongshan to invest another HKD 35.5 million ($4.52 million) into acquiring 10 million more shares in the business.
Panel manufacturer Jolywood said it will expand its annual backsheet capacity by 250,000,000 square meters. The company plans to invest CNY 882 million ($130.4 million) in the new production. The funds will come from own capital and bank loans. According to Jolywood's latest financial results, the manufacturer shipped 58.000.000 square meters of backsheets in the first quarter of this year.
Wafer manufacturer Shuangliang Eco-Energy has agreed to sell 950,000,000 wafers to China-based power transmission and distribution equipment provider Chint Group. The purchase price will be negotiated on a monthly basis.
Tongwei has announced new solar cell prices, with increases for all of its monocrystalline PV products. The polysilicon supplier and solar cell maker priced its PERC 182 mm cells at CNY 1.30 ($0.19) per watt, up 3.17%, and its PERC 166 mm cells at CNY 1.28 per watt, up 3.23%. It also increased the price of its PERC 210 mm cells by 4.07% to CNY 1.28 per watt.
Manufacturer Solargiga this month released unaudited first-half figures showing revenue from its solar ingot, wafer and module sales and projects business was 12% higher than in the first six months of 2021, to reach CNY 3.1 billion ($459 million). Unspecified “other” revenue fell 18% year-on-year, to CNY 41.2 million. The company last week said details of a proposed CNY 460 million shares issue by subsidiary Qujing Yangguang would now not be ready until August 5.
Clean power developer Beijing Energy International last week stated it generated 2.14 GWh during April to June, from a portfolio of 82 solar plants and seven wind farms. Generation for the first half of the year was 3.32 GWh with Beijing Energy achieving grid connection for 329 MW of solar capacity during the second quarter.
New-entrant solar manufacturer IDG Energy Investment has completed its name change to Productive Technologies Co Ltd.
Real estate and logistics magnate Cheung Shun Lee appears to have finally given up his near-seven-year attempt to rehabilitate Hong Kong-based solar cell and module maker China Solar. The company this week stated it does not intend to seek a review of a decision by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to cancel its shares on August 8. “The restructure cannot proceed” China Solar said of a proposed rescue package launched by Lee in August 2019. As reported by pv magazine at that point, Lee had invested HKD 38 million ($4.84 million) in attempting to restart the company. Problems began for the company in October 2013 when executives were detained for “making a false representation” about a business unit which never started trading. Subsequent developments included a mass resignation of directors in June 2015 and suspension of trading in the stock;  the appointment of liquidators three months later; and the revelation, in August 2018, that China Solar’s only functioning business unit was processing dried fruit and leaves into powders. The latest stock market announcement indicated provisional liquidators have been appointed.

Md Nahiduzzaman, business development lead for the company, told pv magazine the solar system will be installed on a site which will produce fish as well as agricultural products including mushrooms, which will grow in the shade of the panels.
The grid-connected site in Bangladesh’s northern district of Mymensingh will cost around $22 million, according to the company, which is owned by Bangladeshi conglomerate Expo Group.
Nahiduzzaman said the company expects to start construction in January and complete the site in December 2023.
Joules Power has stated it expects funding support from the World Bank and other soft loan providers for the site.
The developer had backing from the World Bank-financed Investment Promotion and Financing Facility II for its first, 20 MW solar site in Bangladesh.
With lease agreements signed with landowners, Joules Power recently invited expressions of interest to complete a detailed feasibility study, design drawing, initial environmental examination, environmental impact assessment, and social impact assessment for the project. The tender deadline is August 21.
The plant will be connected to the national grid by a single circuit line of 33 kV from the plant site to the Muktagacha substation operated by the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board.
A separate tender, to install 82 MWp of floating, ground-mounted, and rooftop PV in an industrial zone, is set to close on July 27.
Government body the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority has tendered for solar across a 30,000-acre site at the nation's largest industrial zone, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Shilpa Nagar, in the Feni district.
Applicants for the tender must prepare a technical, financial, legal, environmental, and social feasibility report and recommend suitable land and a bankable public-private partnership contract structure.

Under the terms of the contest published by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) this month, GBP 1.25 million will be made available for projects related to the use of wireless power transmission, a cash pot of the same scale will finance high-concentration photovoltaics, and GBP 500,000 will be on offer for design and engineering projects to support those two types of hardware.
A further “up to” GBP 3 million will be available for the development of the “architecture” to back space-based solar, presumably for launch systems and the like.
The BEIS competition document stated more or less funding may be made available “depending upon budget availability.”
Earth-based applications of such innovations could include super-efficient, lightweight solar panels and electromagnetic power transmission which could transfer electricity from offshore wind farms to mainland demand centers.
The applications window opened last week and will close on September 23 with grants to be awarded in December.

The storage facility will be connected with the existing 716 MW Żarnowiec Pumped Storage Power Station, which is located about 7 km south of Żarnowiec and is Poland's largest hydroelectric power station. “The resulting innovative hybrid installation will have a capacity of at least 921 MW and a storage capacity of more than 4.6 GWh,” the company said in a statement released. “PGE has filed a subsidy request with the European Commission and is also looking for business partners to finance the project.”
The project is located 10 km from the Baltic Sea, where PGE is planning to build offshore wind farms with a total capacity of 3.5 GW. In the Żarnowiec area, PGE also operates a 100 MW wind power plant and is planning to build several large scale photovoltaic parks.
All these assets will be connected with the pumped-hydro station and the battery through a 400/110 kV substation located approximately 2 km from both facilities and a 400 kV substation built for the needs of offshore wind farms in the area.
“The potential of the planned hybrid installation will increase the energy security of Poland and the Baltic States,” PGE added. “It will also have an impact on the competitiveness of energy markets and the synchronization of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian energy systems with the continental Europe system through the Harmony Link project, which is an interconnection for the exchange of electricity between Lithuania and Poland.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/26/cooling-down-solar-modules-with-cotton-wicks-immersed-in-water/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,HUNGARY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 26, 2022",Cooling down solar modules with cotton wicks immersed in water,"Researchers from the University of Miskolc in Hungary have developed a passive cooling technique for photovoltaic modules which they claim is able to lower the panels' operating temperature by up to 22%.
The novel technique consists of attaching cotton wicks immersed in the water (CWIWs) to the backside of the photovoltaic module. The water is supplied to cotton wicks from top to bottom by gravity which the scientists said helps the effective absorption of cotton and reduces water consumption. “Exposure of the wetted cotton wicks to the surrounding air decreases dry air temperature and increases humidity, producing evaporating cooling that can exploit it to absorb the rising heat from the backside of the PV module,” they explained. “The technique contributes by creating a continuous cooling environment with less water consumption and better performance under hot conditions than in other studies.”
The CWs were arranged as serpentine forms avoiding any space between them. The scientists fixed them by using thermal silicon. They also placed two plastic bottles full of water at the top edge of the PV module. “The gravity-free flow of water helps transmit the water to the CWs without extra power,” they emphasized. “Thus, this method helps to distribute the water entirely from cotton wicks throughout the PV module.”
The performance of a polycrystalline solar module with a size of 0.65 m × 0.55 m and equipped with CWIWs was compared with that of a reference panel without the cooling system. They used a data logger with two voltage sensors and two current sensors. It recorded temperature, voltage, and current values every ten minutes during the experiment days. “The experiments were conducted according to climatic conditions of Basra City, Iraq, from 20 to 29 of August 2021,” the specified. “August is characterized by a sunny month with high temperatures and low humidity on most days with moderate winds.”
Through their measurements, the academics found that the PV module with CWIWs cooling showed thermal behavior closer to the ambient temperature throughout the experiment period due to evaporating cooling of CWs. “The highest temperature recorded of the PV module with the CWIWs was 46.2 C at 12:20 PM, while the ambient temperature was 43.8 C,” they stated.
Compared to the module without cooling, the CWs-equipped module had an operating temperature that was 22% lower. “The moist condition resulting from the cotton bristles immersed in water and exposed to the wind has provided appropriate cooling that enhances efficiency to 7.25% and the power yield increment about 16.3 W,” they further explained. “Using CWIWs decreases entropy generation by about 14% due to reducing the lost exergy of the PV module than the PV module without cooling.”
The Hungarian group presented the passive technique in the paper Effect of Evaporative Cooling on Photovoltaic Module Performance, which was recently published in Process Integration and Optimization for Sustainability. “The passive cooling applied in this work enhanced the performance of the PV module higher than in other similar studies, making it more reliable for application,” it concluded.

The Clean Energy Regulator, the Commonwealth government agency responsible for overseeing Australia’s rooftop solar schemes, will now permit installations to be completed by different installers, as long as each installer is accredited and the agency is notified.
From April 1, the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) began requiring installers to take “selfie photographs” to prove they were present at the beginning, middle and end of each job. This stepped up compliance regime was in response to a government review of the integrity of the rooftop solar sector in Australia published last year.
Whether the implications of this photo proof have led to today’s announcement isn’t clear but CER did note when it is “not reasonable” for the same Clean Energy Council (CEC) accredited installer to complete the job they began, it can ultimately be signed off by another accredited installer.
This change is accompanied by a set of conditions, outlined by CER:

CER has been ramping up its prosecutions of installers fraudulently creating Small-scale Technology Certificates, or STCs, which form the basis of what is effectively Australia’s rooftop solar subsidy.
Just last week, it announced Canberra installer B and J Finnigan Pty Ltd (trading as A1 Electrical) had been convicted and fined $9,000 after it was discovered its sole director, Bradley Finnigan, was overseas at the time he said he was supervising installations.
In May, CER also executed search warrants on three Perth addresses connected to a WA installation company. The search warrants were part of its investigation into whether the company had fabricated information about who installed almost 550 solar panel installations.
The crackdown is part of CER’s takeover as the sole regulator of the sector, bringing with it a new suite of oversight tools.
CER is also in the process of finding a new accreditation body for the solar industry. Before March 31, 2023, it will open up applications to decide who will take over responsibility for solar accreditation from CEC.

“The CAPSolar’s SM–550 solar module is capable of maximizing the capture of solar energy in a dynamic setting by reducing the impact of shading on its performance while being as robust and lightweight as possible when fitted on our structure which can fit any type of low-speed electric vehicle,” the company's CEO, Samy Benhamza, told pv magazine.
The module has a size of 2,100 mm x 1,320 mm x 25 mm and weighs in at 30 kg. It has a power conversion efficiency of 21.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 108.0 V, a short-circuit current of 6.4 A, and a fill factor of 76%. It can be operated with a maximum temperature of 45 C while driving and 55 C when the vehicle is parked.
The panel relies on 24%-efficient solar cells. It also features an IP67 enclosure and an MPPT buck controller. “The solar panel itself is fully flexible but when mounted on our structure, it conforms to the desired shape and becomes rigid. In its layout, strategically oriented solar cell series help in better managing different incidence angles and combined with multiple bypass diodes, we have an optimal shading management,” Benhamza said.
According to the manufacturer, the panel offers a 70% higher daily energy output at the same power rating as competitor products. The company tested the module in Montreal, Quebec, on a client’s vehicle and claims it achieved a 17% average range extension per day, with a peak of 26% on sunnier days.
“In collaboration with our European strategic partners in Belgium, we have developed a patent-pending, fully modular system that allows us to adapt our panels, just like LEGO, for each type of low-speed electric vehicle with no extra modification and custom work,” Benhamza explained.
Capsolar is currently collecting data to better determine the parameters that have the most impact on the performance of a vehicle–
integrated solar module. “We will then be able to feed this data to the charge controller we are designing and use artificial intelligence to optimize the operating parameters of the MPP–tracking algorithm,” Benhamza concluded.

University of Michigan researchers announced in a Joule magazine post that they have achieved a new technique for manufacturing efficient semitransparent solar cells. The cells are intended to be built inside panes of window glass, turning passive buildings into active energy producers.
Organic solar cells can be transparent, unlike their opaque counterparts in traditional silicon-based solar cells. Silicon cells are widely used for their durability and efficiency advantages, but recent advances from the Michigan lab have achieved efficiencies of around 10% and estimated lifetimes of up to 30 years in organic solar cells.
The team set forth to make the semitransparent cells manufacturable at scale. A key hurdle was creating the micron-scale electrical connections between individual cells that comprise a solar module. Conventional methods use lasers for this patterning process, but the laser would cause damage to organic light absorbers.
The solution the Michigan team arrived at is a multi-step peel-off patterning method that achieves micron-scale resolution. Thin films of plastic are deposited and patterned in extremely thin strips. Then the organic material and metals are layered in. Finally, the researchers peel off the strips, creating very fine electrical interconnection layers between the cells.
In the process, eight semitransparent solar cells were connected, each 4 cm x 0.4 cm and separated by 200µm-wide interconnections, to create a single 13 cm squared module. The achieved module achieved an efficiency of 7.3%, about 10% less than the individual cells. This material is 50% transparent, making it a good fit for commercial windows. Higher transparency is likely needed for the residential market, though the researchers said that is easy to achieve with organic solar cell material.
The team said its goal is to develop a 50% transparent cell with 10% to 15% efficiency, which Michigan professor Stephen Forrest said will likely be achieved within a few years. “The research we are doing is derisking the technology so that manufacturers can make the investments needed to enter large scale production,” he said. “In principle, we can now scale semitransparent organic solar cells to two meters by two meters, which brings our windows much closer to reality.”
Buildings account for about 40% of global carbon emissions. Buildings-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) like this technology under development are an effective way to bring energy production closer to the point of demand, mitigating the amount of grid infrastructure that needs to be built to support the building’s needs.
The University of Michigan has applied for patent protection and is seeking partners to bring the technology to market. The research was supported primarily by the US Department of Energy, as well as by Universal Display Corporation.
