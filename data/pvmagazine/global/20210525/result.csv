Cummins’ new €50 million PEM electrolyzer plant, for the production of green hydrogen, will be in Castilla-La Mancha. The two companies defined it as one of the world’s largest hydrogen plants. “We continue to make progress in our ambitious plan to put Spain and Europe at the global forefront of this technology,” Ignacio Galán, chairman and CEO of Iberdrola, said on Monday. The plant will house system assembly and testing “for approximately 500 MW/year and will be scalable to more than 1 GW/year. The facility, which will initially be 22,000 square meters, is anticipated to open in 2023.”
Denmark-based green hydrogen infrastructure company Everfuel has launched its H2 station roll-out plan for Denmark, targeting up to 19 fueling sites by the end of 2023. “The plan is the third and final section of … Everfuel’s Scandinavian green hydrogen fueling strategy for trucks, buses and cars, connecting the main traffic corridors in Sweden, Norway and Denmark,” wrote the company on Tuesday. The company is set to invest a total of €1.5 billion. It wants to reach €1 billion of revenues from the sale of hydrogen fuel to buses, trucks, and cars before 2030. “Based on these plans, we are now accelerating dialogues with all relevant stakeholders to commercialize hydrogen at scale and decarbonize transport in Scandinavia,” commented Jacob Krogsgaard, CEO and founder of Everfuel, in a note.
South Korean automotive manufacturer Hyundai Motor has said it would begin production of the world’s first mass-produced, heavy-duty truck powered by hydrogen, in August this year. “Seven large hydrogen tanks offer a combined storage capacity of around 31kg of fuel, while three 72 kWh high voltage batteries provide an additional source of power. The maximum driving range of [the] 2021 XCIENT Fuel Cell is set to be around 400km. Refueling a full tank of hydrogen takes about eight to 20 minutes, depending on the ambient temperature,” wrote the Seoul-based company on Tuesday. Hyundai will ship 140 units of the new XCIENT Fuel Cell to Switzerland by the end of this year. It is also looking for other markets. “There is a lot of interest for the truck outside Switzerland as well. We are very confident that we will see XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks on the road in other European countries next year,” commented Mark Freymueller, CEO of Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility.
German chemical company BASF and German energy company RWE have presented a project for a new offshore wind farm with a capacity of 2 GW, to provide the Ludwigshafen chemical site with green electricity and enable the CO2-free production of hydrogen. The two companies signed a letter of intent to decrease BASF’s reliance on fossil fuels for the production of chemicals. “Coupling a new offshore wind farm [which is] already in the planning stage to an industrial customer such as BASF, who will convert its production to green electricity and hydrogen on this basis, would be a first for Germany,” commented Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE, in a note released on Friday.
Norway start-up Gen2 Energy has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Scottish Port of Cromarty Firth to create a commercial pathway to export green hydrogen from Norway into the U.K. energy market. “The firth will become the U.K. transshipment hub for Gen2 Energy’s hydrogen, produced from Norway’s surplus renewable energy, which will be shipped across the North Sea to the port. Hydrogen would then be distributed to customers across the U.K. by road, rail and sea,” wrote Gen2 Energy in a note released on Tuesday. Scotland aims to generate 5 GW of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen by 2030.
U.K.-based Clean Power Hydrogen (CPH2) has won an order from Octopus Hydrogen, part of the U.K.-based retail electricity and gas supplier Octopus Energy, for the supply of a 1 MW electrolyzer. The 1 MW membrane-free electrolyser is due for delivery to Octopus Hydrogen’s site in late 2021. “Producing up to 451kg [of] H2 [hydrogen] per day, the system incorporates cryogenic separation technology to generate hydrogen with a purity of up to 99.999%, and oxygen of up to 99.5% which is suitable for medical use,” read a note released on Tuesday.
German energy company Siemens Energy and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) have signed a partnership agreement aimed at advancing the global energy transition based on renewable energy, with a focus on “regions presently lacking access to modern energy, developing the business case for green hydrogen.” Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA, praised the public-private initiative and the “joint commitment to meaningful action.” Last week, Siemens Energy officials met with the CEO of the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA). The United Arab Emirates-headquartered company inaugurated the Green Hydrogen project, meant to produce hydrogen using solar energy produced by the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park: “the largest single-site solar park in the world, with a planned capacity of 5,000 MW by 2030.” The Green Hydrogen project was implemented in cooperation with Expo 2020 Dubai, and Siemens Energy.
The French Senate has thrown criticism at the EU's hydrogen plans, instead advocating a central role for nuclear. “Covering the current needs of industry worldwide (70 million tons of renewable hydrogen, or 420 GW) would lead to the commissioning of more than one million new wind turbines or 56 million hectares of photovoltaic panels. The alternative path, of low-carbon hydrogen from nuclear electricity would represent 400 new 1 GW nuclear reactors,” wrote the French parliamentary office for the evaluation of scientific and technological choices, adding that a full-on nuclear option is not a viable solution either. In other words, the French Senate has asked for a nuanced European hydrogen strategy with regional differences. “A significant increase in our low-carbon electricity production capacity could lead to the relaunch of the nuclear industry but the future of hydrogen will depend on a coherent, realistic and responsible energy policy. This ambition cannot just be a slogan otherwise hydrogen, which has long been a technology of the future, will remain so,” read a technical note released in April and presented last week.

With specially-formed developer Helios Industry stating on its website it is at a “very advanced stage of developing their commercial scale production facility to produce green hydrogen,” English language Emirati newspaper The National this afternoon sketched out more details about the proposed fab.
Helios describes itself as “a privately-owned special project vehicle company (SPV), established in Abu Dhabi, [in the] United Arab Emirates, to design, develop, finance, construct, own and operate a green hydrogen and green ammonia production facility project at Khalifa Industrial Zone [in] Abu Dhabi.”
While the Abu Dhabi-based company provides few further technical details about the plan, The National, which is owned by United Arab Emirates deputy PM and Manchester City Football Club boss Sheikh Mansour, said the facility would be powered by clean electricity from an 800 MW solar field at the Khalifa Industrial Zone, which is a port.
The newspaper, which also reported the $1 billion investment figure, said the planned project would be able to generate 40,000 tons of green hydrogen which, in turn, would be used to produce 200,000 tons of green ammonia.
No details have yet emerged about when the project can be expected to take shape.

A study has estimated around 2.95 billion tons of solar power material could enter India’s electronic-waste stream between by 2047, based on an expectation the nation will have deployed 347.5 GW of solar panels this decade. Researchers said around 30% of the waste would come from balance-of-system solar array components.
The study was carried out by Ayush Gautam and Ravi Shankar, from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, and Prem Vrat, from The NorthCap University, in Gurgaon. Their findings have been published in the journal Sustainable Production and Consumption.
According to the authors of the paper, the 2.95 billion tons of PV system waste would include critical metals worth around $645 trillion, of which around 70% – $452 trillion worth – could be recycled.
The academics said gold would account for 44% of that $645 trillion figure, with aluminum supplying 26%, copper 16%, and silver 10%. Metals including gallium, magnesium, indium, and tellurium would also contribute to the estimated value of the anticipated solar waste mountain, according to the paper.
pv magazine’s UP initiative has examined PV module recycling. Coverage included: An overview of current recycling processes in operation; the economics of recycling from the perspective of analyst Bloomberg NEF; future recycling scenarios; and an update of the EU and U.S. policy landscape. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The study pointed out the volume of waste – and its potential value – expected from the solar industry was higher than that expected from any other end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment during the same period. The academics stressed the importance of establishing recycling facilities and managing end-of-life PV waste. Encouraging a circular economy approach to its solar supply chain would enable India to reduce its dependence on imports of precious metals including gold, silver, and copper, they added.
The waste estimate was based on an assumption India will have deployed 347.5 GW of solar generation capacity by 2030.
The researchers included estimates of premature panel failure as well as the anticipated standard solar module lifetime when calculating how much waste would be generated by 2047. They used the Weibull reliability function, which is used to estimate the ability of equipment to function without failure.
India has already been experiencing end-of-life solar panel waste since early 2019, with the volume rising exponentially.
The May edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big insight into the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT, co-location for green hydrogen production, price trends amid the polysilicon shortage, and the factors informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Three PV technologies were considered in the study: silicon panels, cadmium telluride (CdTe), and copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CiGs), with the researchers using the market shares held by each panel type last year, rounded to 89%, 5.2%, and 5.2%, respectively.
The paper considered inverters, cables and mounting systems as integral parts of PV arrays and also took into consideration transformers and batteries as external contributors to balance-of-system components.
The average life of modules was considered as 25 years up to 2014, and 30 years thereafter, with inverters expected to last an average ten years and other balance-of-system components 25 years.

Speaking at the signing ceremony for a planned 100 MW solar farm in Feni district, junior power minister Nasrul Hamid said the government was aware of the need to participate in the energy transition but added: “Technology needs to be invented which can help generate higher solar power [returns] using [less] land.”
Hamid added, however, it was time for Dhaka to consider the potential of rooftop solar, as well as hydrogen and wind and wave power, and the politician said funding would be available to conduct research into those technologies.

Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movement amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The minister made the remarks at a ceremony organized to mark the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Japan's Marubeni Corporation and state-owned utility the Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh (EGCB).
The partners plan to develop a near-$120 million, 100 MW solar plant on a 350-acre fallow land site in the Sonagazi sub-district of Feni. The location is part of 1,000 acres of fallow land acquired by the electric company as a planned solar project hub.
The Bangladeshi utility is already developing a World Bank-funded 50 MW project at the site and aims to install a further 100 MW of solar generation capacity nearby, in addition to the Marubeni facility, which will be owned by a 50-50 joint venture between the partners.
EGCB managing director Arun Kumar Saha told pv magazine provision of the site would form part of the utility's contribution to half of the project costs.
Saha said the electric company had fielded enquiries from 20 foreign developers interested in the 100 MW project after the utility had invited expressions of interest in 2018. He said Marubeni was selected after a thorough examination of the proposals submitted. The Japanese company claims to operate 12 GW of power plants in 19 countries.
Under the terms of the expression-of-interest call referred to, Marubeni would be responsible for the selection of an engineering, procurement and construction contractor, via competitive bidding; for land and infrastructure development; power evacuation planning; electricity generation; operation and maintenance of the project; and the sale of electricity.
The project is scheduled to be online by 2023 and Saha said Marubeni will conduct its own feasibility study on the site even though the electric company has already carried one out.
Bangladesh has around 496 MW of solar generation capacity as part of a 730 MW renewables fleet.

With the details of a deal to sell 183 MW of solar capacity to two state-owned entities for a projected RMB660 million ($103 million) windfall having already been announced, polysilicon manufacturer GCL yesterday outlined details of a plan to sell five more projects to a different public body.
The company had already published details of a sale of five solar farms with a total generation capacity of 183 MW to Guangdong Jinyuan New Energy Co Ltd and State Power Investment Corp Guizhou Jinyuan Weining Energy Co Ltd. That deal, which will book a RMB50 million ($7.8 million) gain if approved by shareholders, will also reduce the company's liabilities by RMB1.63 billion.
Yesterday, GCL said its previous deals to sell projects to Three Gorges Asset Management Co Ltd would now be expanded by the transfer, if approved on June 15, of a further five projects, with a total capacity of 469 MW, to the state-owned hydropower company.
Although the proposed transaction would generate RMB1.39 billion ($217 million) for the seller – and remove RMB4.25 billion ($664 million) from GCL's books – the company announced up to RMB10.4 million ($1.62 million) might be withheld by the purchaser to remedy “certain compliance deficiencies;” RMB855,000 ($134,000) might come off the purchase price to “rectify certain quality matters of the engineering and equipment;” and one of the projects – Yulin Longyuan – would have to pay a settlement agreed with an independent contractor following a dispute over construction fees.
GCL – which is attempting to restructure its debts this month after failing to settle US$500 million worth of senior notes which matured at the end of January, triggering a cross-default – yesterday revealed it must settle RMB16.9 billion of financial commitments this year, including RMB12.4 billion ($1.94 billion) of bank borrowings.

The Sellingen solar park, which is expected to be both the largest in Europe and the biggest outside China, is relying on 72,000 solar modules provided by an unnamed manufacturer which are mounted with a west-east orientation. “I believe the east-west approach makes the most sense from a yield and stability point of view and we have used this system from day one,” Willem Biesheuvel, project manager for floating PV at Groenleven, told pv magazine. “For maintenance, cable management, stability, anchoring and ecological perspective, we think this is the best approach and we do not use different orientations for other projects.”

Biesheuvel explained that this approach also allows to better deal with wind and wave impact. The solar boats are set up with four big floats and include a steel roof-like frame that holds the 16 PV modules – eight east facing and eight west facing. “This way, the wind can’t get hold of the system,” he stated, adding that the plant required a surface of only 24ha. “On land – where south facing is more common, a project with this size would require a lot more land space.”
Additional advantages, according to him, would be the need for only one medium-voltage cable from the floating system to land and a more even distribution of the electricity generated by the facility into the grid. Dutch energy provider Blauwvinger Energie will sell the power to local residents and businesses.
Baywa re sold the plant to a consortium consisting of provincial energy transition fund Energiefonds Overijssel, Blauwvinger Energie itself, and an unnamed private investor in July. Construction on the facility began in February 2020.
Groenleven has already built a 14.5 MW floating array near Zwolle, a 2 MW facility in Weperpolder and an 8 MW floating plant in Tynaarlo, all in the Netherlands. The nation has enormous floating PV potential because of its 52,000ha of shallow inland water.

The scientists explained that the same cell had achieved an efficiency of 20.2% for a cell with a size of 11cm2 based on a rigid glass substrate and that the cell technology was transposed onto a flexible substrate by adapting the thickness of the active layer to the optical specificities of the substrate made of indium tin oxide (ITO) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
The flexible single-junction solar cell has an area of 0.33cm² and is built with a double layer of cesium and formamidinium, which the researchers said offers promising stability results compared to technologies using a methylammonium type cation, which is more thermally unstable.
The cell was tested through a damp heat test, which is an accelerated environmental aging test that determines the ability of a PV device to withstand long-term exposure to high temperature and penetration of humidity. It showed that the perovskite cell can retain around 90% of its initial efficiency after 800 hours.
The scientists specified that the achieved conversion efficiency is not the highest for this perovskite cell technology, which in previous research has reached up to 21%, although with smaller cell surfaces, but they stated it is the first time a very strong performance has been obtained with a low-cost substrate such as PET. “Our technology combines simplicity and performance,” they affirmed.
The cell is being developed under the EU-funded Apolo research project. CEA-INES and other partners are working on advanced materials, from cell to encapsulant, to develop flexible, fully printable perovskite cells with an efficiency of at least 22% and 80% of initial performance after relevant accelerated-test standards.

RESS is set to connect into TransGrid’s network at the Darlington Point Substation, where it will work to add flexibility to the NSW electricity market and aid the growing presence of renewable energy projects in the region.
The agreement will see the battery partitioned, with 60 MW / 120 MWh operational rights going to Shell Energy. Shell Energy CEO Greg Joiner said: “Shell Energy recognizes that batteries have an important role to play in transitioning to and managing risk in a lower carbon energy future.”
“This long-term services agreement is a model for how large energy users can access dispatchable power like battery storage, which complements renewables” continued Joiner, “while contributing to a cleaner and more resilient power system. Shell Energy was pleased to select Edify as its battery energy storage partner in this collaborative approach to meeting the NSW Government’s need for an innovative power solution.”
Of course, innovative power solutions are key for emissions reduction targets at both the state and federal level. Edify Chief Executive, John Cole, noted that large-scale batteries like the RESS are integral to energy firming “in our brave new world of renewables”.
“Energy storage is fast becoming a valued capacity solution for the NEM,” Cole added, “given its fast and precise response. The uncertainties in this growing technology class are reducing and with it the barriers to acceptance from market and network participants. We are proud to be leading the advancement of batteries to shore up the renewable energy market and to increase the availability of clean, green, low-cost, dispatchable electricity.”
The RESS is another addition to the growing line of big batteries in the pipeline for the NEM, and that number is only going to increase with the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) proposing a new rule in April to bring new, ultra-fast frequency services into the NEM, services that will come largely from batteries.

Bengaluru-headquartered Aegeus Technologies has introduced the Shreem cleaning bot exclusively designed for rooftop solar installations. The robot is fully autonomous and weighs only 5 kg (with batteries), portable enough to carry in a backpack. 
Shreem can be operated through a web-based app from any remote location, and overcomes the problem of accessibility for dangerous or difficult-to-reach rooftop installations. The bot, being Bluetooth-enabled, can also be operated manually using a mobile app or through an RF remote-operated controller. It can be preset to start at a desired time of the day automatically.
Shreem uses airwash technology to clean the panels, requiring no water or any harmful chemicals. It consists of two sets of wiping brushes (axial and radial) made of microfibre cloth. Controlled airflow blows the dust off the panels efficiently. The radial brush ensures any leftover dust on the edges is also blown off.
The bot uses an intelligent algorithm and sensors to detect edges and move in a straight path covering the entire area. It aligns automatically to account for undulations or uneven surfaces. Further, it is intelligent to differentiate between the end of the table and gaps between tables. The bot uses a computational neural network to train itself about the number of rows, columns, modules, inclination angle, path planning, and direction for effective operation.
Shreem comes with a solar-powered docking station, which keeps monitoring weather parameters like the rain, wind speed, etc. The bot will return to or continue to be in the docking station if the weather is unsafe for its operation.
Shreem can clean around 200 panels an hour. It is powered by a 10Ah lithium-ion battery pack with a life of around 2000 cycles.

The first batch of Trina Solar 210mm cells and Vertex modules for the North American market have been produced at the company’s Vietnam production facility.
Trina Solar broke ground on its Thai Nguyen plant in December, and completed construction in five months. The factory has a capacity for 3 GW of cells and 4.5 GW of 210 modules. On May 15, the facility manufactured the first batch of 210mm Vertex 550W modules. Plans for Vertex 400W and 670W module production are now in the works for the plant, which can boost the annual capacity to an equivalent of 3.5 GW of 210 cells and 5 GW of 210 modules, respectively.
The fully automated plant represents one of the first overseas factories that manufacture 210 cells and 550 W modules.
Currently, Trina Solar runs multiple 210 Vertex cell and module factories in China and Vietnam. Altogether, they are expected to produce more than 50 GW of modules by the end of 2021.
