Swell Energy has revealed that it has raised $120 million to further expand its VPP programs. The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Greenbacker Development Opportunities Fund I, LP, with participation from the Ares Management Infrastructure Opportunities Fund.
California-based Swell Energy is developing 350 MWh of VPPs that leverage 16,000 battery storage systems in homes and businesses.  The company provide a range of grid service capabilities in territories such as Hawaii, California, and New York.
The company said that venture capital funding will support existing VPP development and the deployment of an additional 200 MWh of contracted capacity through approximately 10,000 energy storage systems that will integrate into new VPPs across the United States.
Swell Energy creates VPPs by linking utilities, customers, and third-party service providers together and aggregating distributed energy resources. In particular, working with utilities to compensate customers for operating their batteries for savings and security helps to create a cohesive network of solar-powered batteries that supports overall grid reliability, stability and sustainability.
As explained in a recent article by Jigar Shah, the director of the US Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, a VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar, energy storage, electric vehicles chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). VPPs offer grid operators a large-scale, utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. Shah said that by deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of DERs lowers the cost of power for everybody – especially VPP participants.
VPPs are relatively new in the United States, having been established in 2020 under FERC Order 2222, which opened the door for VPPs in the United States. Shah said widespread deployment is needed at the national scale to unlock the true potential of VPPs.
“Swell’s business model is an innovative application of existing technology directly solving two large issues plaguing the grid and renewable energy adoption: transmission and load shifting,” said Ben Baker, the managing director and principal of Greenbacker Development Opportunities Fund. “We couldn’t be more pleased to partner with Swell, its impressive management team, and the existing investor base. The company’s three business verticals – grid services, finance, development – are mutually beneficial, and together will swiftly expand the proliferation of renewable resiliency, providing value to both customers and utilities.”
Swell Energy is working with multiple California utilities to help expand residential participation in capacity bidding programs. Through a VPP, homeowners with solar and energy storage systems support the reliability of their local grids while reserving battery power for personal emergency use. The efforts are part of the California Public Utility Commission’s goals to reduce the state’s load during California Independent System Operator emergency power events.
Formed in 2014, Swell Energy has raised $582 million in funding to date and counts CIT Group, For Good Ventures, Aligned Climate Capital and Third Sphere as investors in its VPP business.

It said it will develop 3.6 GW of electrolyzers in three phases over the next 12 years, powered by up to 9 GW of solar and wind. The first-phase pilot project will produce green ammonia from hydrogen, mainly for export to Asia and Europe, said the London-based company. Egypt signed several framework agreements at COP27 for hydrogen projects in the Suez Canal Economic Zone.
Air Liquide will build and operate a hydrogen production unit at TotalEnergies‘ Normandy platform in France, with an investment of more than €130 million ($133.6 million) under a long-term contract. The unit will recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, with a capacity of more than 20,000 tons a year. The companies will also launch development studies to deploy a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. “Most of the unit's renewable, low-carbon hydrogen will be used by the biorefinery itself, to produce sustainable aviation fuel,” said TotalEnergies.
Doosan Fuel Cell will export a 105 MW of hydrogen fuel cells to China by 2026. It said it will also set up a joint venture with China's ZKRG to develop the local hydrogen fuel cell power generation market, starting with a hospital pilot project in Guangdong province. The venture said it aims to export 50 MW of finished products by 2024 and 55 MW of parts by 2026.  
Babcock & Wilcox has signed an agreement with NRG Korea to study the applicability of its technology for a hydrogen generation facility using biomass in South Korea. The US company said its chemical looping technology, which produces hydrogen or syngas, is ready for commercial scale-up.
Lhyfe has signed a partnership agreement to develop offshore renewable hydrogen at the Saint Nazaire Port near Nantes, France. The port authority said in a press release that it aims to make “Nantes ‒ Saint Nazaire the first major port facility for hydrogen on France's Atlantic Seaboard.”
Steag has signed a memorandum of understanding with Saarbahn to start selling hydrogen in 2026 from a facility in Völklingen-Fenne, Germany. “With an annual production of up to 8,700 metric tons of hydrogen, Steag can then provide important support for the gradual decarbonization of public transport in the Saarbrücken metropolitan region,” said the German power company.

Spanish energy company Intergia is helping a group of pig farmers in Spain add floating PV to reduce the ammonia emissions of a slurry pond of a pig farm in Tauste, in the Spanish northern region of Aragón.
In the proposed plant configuration, the floating array is expected to cover the liquid surface of the pond completely, with air spaces left between the floats being filled with waterproof hexagonal plastic elements that are reportedly able to reduce ammonia emissions by up to 40%.
These elements, when left on the liquid surface of the pond, are placed together in the form of a honeycomb and function as a floating cover, which prevents the escape of gasses.
The PV system will rely on a floating solution called HDPE provided by Spanish specialist Isigenere. These floaters work as a support for the photovoltaic panels, in addition to other floating elements for perimeter corridors of the system, with the aim of facilitating maintenance.
“The project is scheduled for completion in October 2023, and during this time we are going to study the ammonia levels, as well as the degradation of the materials and the operation of the panels,” a spokesperson from Intergia told pv magazine. “The pilot installed in the pond will remain there until the end of its useful life. In normal facilities it is usually about 25 years, now we have to see if it degrades sooner with the ammonia-rich environment.”
The 20.7 kW prototype will consist of 46 photovoltaic modules. The surface covered by the floating system is 142.7 m2, which represents a percentage of 23.8% of the pool. The system plus the hexagons will cover 34.7% of the raft and will supply approximately 38% of the farm's annual electricity consumption.
In intensive livestock areas, excess nutrients such as nitrates are retained in slurry, which is moved into collection pods to avoid pollutants impacting the local soils and water table. Spanish legislation sets limits on the application of manure per hectare – and to the water, if it filters into the aquifers and streams. Through the accumulation of slurry in ponds, large amounts of ammonia are also emitted into the atmosphere. It has been observed via satellite that there is a high concentration of this gas in areas with intensive pig farming, such as Aragon and Catalonia.

If the prediction pans out, the country will become a gigawatt market for the first time.
“In 2022 we expect a further increase, significantly more than 1 GW, maybe 1.1 GW, 1.2 GW, or more,” TPPV Chair Hubert Fechner told pv magazine. “We see a dynamic of the PV market which is extraordinary right now. This is true, like last year, in both the residential and ground-mounted sectors. This development comes quite close to the numbers we would need in order to fulfill our national targets.”
Fechner predicts Austria will install between 1.2 GW to 1.5 GW in 2023 and every year up to 2030. The country may reach 4 GW of cumulative solar capacity in 2022, up from 2.78 GW in 2021. At the predicted growth rate, Austria could reach its goal of 13 GW of solar capacity by 2030.
Last year, Austria added 739.7 MW of solar, with decentralized PV contributing 655.7 MW and centralized PV 83.5 MW. Fechner is the author of a recent report on PV applications in Austria in 2021, published by the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA-PVPS)’s Task 1.
Centralized projects took a larger market share in Austria for the first time in 2021, according to Fechner. The trend is expected to continue in 2022 and beyond.
“This was the start of a period for a market that is much more diversified,” he said, noting that he expects ground-mounted projects to account for roughly one-quarter of the installed capacity in 2022.
Fechner said one of the main challenges for solar’s continuous growth is public acceptance of grounded-mounted systems, which does not yet match the high acceptance of PV installations in existing structures. Other challenges include improving the permitting process and grid stability.

In a report published in Renewable Energy, the researchers expressed the yearly optimal tilt as a function of local latitude minus a climate correction coefficient. This coefficient was calculated based on local climate conditions inferred from monthly insolation data from the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS).
The team first identified a set of best inclination angles for south-facing PV installations in these cities. They used a goal-seek function to maximize the collectible energy of a PV surface tilted at varying angles. The academics then used the same procedure to calculate the optimum angles for PV installations oriented with azimuth angles from 0 degrees to 90 degrees – that is, orientations from south to east.
Taking the south-facing configuration as a reference, results show that optimized tilt angles range from 28.5 degrees in Messina, Italy, to 40.2 degrees in Bolzano, Italy, in the Tyrol region. The correction coefficients varied between 3.8 degrees in Valence, France, and 16.8 degrees in Charleville, France. “It should be noted that, as expected, the highest correction coefficients are associated [with] typically cloudy and/or foggy locations, while the optimal tilt is closer to latitude for southern and island cities,” the authors wrote.
Having determined the optimum tilt angles, the academics then tried to quantify energy losses from non-optimal configurations of the PV systems. They compared the energy collection of the optimal scenarios against quoted commonly used “rules of thumb.” In particular, they first set the yearly optimum tilt to the latitude of each location, then applied correction coefficients of 5 degrees and 10 degrees.
Results show that rule-of-thumb criteria for yearly tilt determination can lead to a 0.6% or less reduction in collectible energy in PV systems with azimuth orientation angles lower than 30 degrees. However, for a 60-degree orientation “the energy available at the collecting surface is reduced on average by 1.28% if the tilt angle is equal to altitude, 2.94% if a correction factor equal to 5 degrees is assumed and 2.89% if it is doubled to 10 degrees,” the authors said. Using the optimum tilt angles could result in an increase in collectible energy as high as 4%, they argued.
The formulas reportedly show more than 90% accuracy with an approximation error lower than 3 degrees in the limit case of an east- or west-facing installation. According to the academics, this value drops below 1 degree when the reference south-facing configuration is considered.
The report adds that the same approach could be applied in other locations, after calculating a climate correction coefficient for a given region based on latitude and weather conditions.
The scientists published their findings in “Maximum energy yield of PV surfaces in France and Italy from climate based equations for optimum tilt at different azimuth angles,” in Renewable Energy.

Australia-founded renewables developer Sun Cable will work with Indonesia to develop an “inter-island grid connectivity policy and technical program” that will allow the government to maximize opportunities in “green industry” growth in a nation that comprises more than 17,500 islands.
The collaboration was formalised at the G-20 summit in Bali where Sun Cable CEO David Griffin signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM). The deal will see them advance a technical program for grid connectivity in the archipelago.
The deal between Sun Cable and the ESDM will include working through the key potential areas for renewable energy generation, defining the resources available, identifying the key energy intensive locations and industries, and then building a plan to unlock these opportunities.
Indonesian Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif said linking the archipelago through subsea transmission corridors will play a critical role in enabling the nation to unlock its green industry opportunity, by matching renewable potential with industrial demand centres.
“Energy infrastructure is very important to connect the centres of great energy production to centres of high energy consumption,” he said.
Indonesia plans to build a “super grid” to overcome the nation’s geographical mismatch between renewable resources and high-demand areas, as well as ensuring a stable and secure system.
The preliminary findings of a joint study conducted by Sun Cable and the ESDM identifies five key “green industries” that have the potential to underpin green growth and add an estimated AUD 170 billion to Indonesia’s gross domestic product by 2035. The five industries are mining and minerals processing, energy and fuels, transport manufacturing (including the production of electric vehicles), food processing and agriculture, and IT infrastructure.
The study highlights Indonesia’s access to critical mineral resources, and strategic location at the heart of ASEAN growth and says the nation “has some of the best renewable energy resources in Asia and many of the core capabilities to become a green industry powerhouse.”
The ESDM said unlocking the Indonesia’s green economic potential will require rapid acceleration of new generation with a 25-fold increase in renewable capacity required to supply zero-carbon demand.
The agreement with Sun Cable, which is seeking to develop the giant Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink), which would export solar power from the Australian outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link through Indonesian waters, positions grid interconnectedness at the centre of the Indonesian policy agenda.
Griffin said the next steps will focus on evaluating specific transmission corridors and investment required, with the joint study to be completed in early 2023.
“We are looking to share Sun Cable’s expertise in solar energy generation and long-distance transmission with Indonesia as it shapes its policy and technical approach to inter-island connectivity,” he said.
Sun Cable has an established relationship with Indonesia, having already secured government approvals for the submarine transmission cable route for its ambitious $30 billion-plus AAPowerLink project.
The project, which comprises up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage to be built on a 12,000-hectare site in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region, would supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,500-kilometer high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750-km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800-km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore.
Construction on the project is expected to commence in 2024, with first supply of electricity to Darwin in 2027, and capacity expected by the end of 2029.

“Degradation curves in photovoltaic modules are frequently non-linear and this technical knowledge is often neglected by the financial world,” Alessandro Virtuani, co-founder of oSole and a senior researcher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), told pv magazine
Virtuani noted that non-linearities in a project's early operation stages can have a significant economic impact, especially at sites with lower solar resources.
“We observe that having prudent estimates of the performance loss rate (PLR) is increasingly important with higher bank interest rates and when larger portions of debt are used,” he said.
The scientists said that plant degradation is often related to the degradation of solar modules. This approach is a frequently used approximation, but it does not take into account that a plant’s overall degradation could be related to the degradation of other components such as inverters, or reversible-failure modes such as soiling or shading.
The group also suggested that business plans are regularly stress-tested using three kinds of degradation curves. There is a linear one with a constant PLR of -0.5%, which they called a “reference” case. There is a two-step curve based on the optimistic assumption that there is no degradation in first 20 years of operation, followed by a PLR of around 1.8% per year. And there is also a logarithmic curve based on pessimistic assumptions.
“This is similar to what is regularly done using P50 and P90 metrics to assess the potential of solar resources in the siting phase,” explained Virtuani.
The team simulated the unleveraged interest return rate (IRR) for three merchant PV projects located across the different regions in Italy under two different scenarios, which they dubbed REP 1 and REP 2. They assumed the project structure costs were the same for all locations.
“The focus was on merchant utility-scale projects because the project structure is generally more detailed, all the electricity is sold on the wholesale market or with  power purchase agreements margins of suppliers all over the value-chain are compressed, and the impact of unexpected degradation trajectories may be much larger rather than, for example, in residential or C&I plants,” Virtuani said.
In the first scenario, a project was expected to have a PLR of around 2% per year and 20% after 10 years, followed by full module replacement. In the second scenario, projects were assumed to show logarithmic degradation of around 40% after 10 years.
“Costs of modules in ten years from now was modeled assuming market growth with CAGR of 30% and historical learning rate for module costs of 22.8%,” the scientists said.
Virtuani said the scientists wanted to show that they are able to model any given scenario.
“These are only two examples with simulated degradation curves, which may resemble the appearance of a catastrophic module failure, such as serious potential-induced degradation (PID or backsheet cracking, appearing in the early operational lifetime of the plant, which are both phenomena observed on the field over the last decade,” he said.
They found that full substitution of the modules after 10 years would be fully justified if the PLR was higher than 1% per year. According to their findings. the economical viability of a utility-scale solar project should be modeled to determine whether revamping interventions are fully justified or not.
“What is important to emphasize here is that a serious revamping intervention such as a full substitution of the modules can and should be modeled by a financial perspective to judge, whether these interventions are justified or not from an economical standpoint,” Virtuani said. “To oversimplify, it is likely that catastrophic failures appearing toward the end of life would not justify such an expensive intervention. Viceversa, it would be fully justified if appearing during the early life of the plant.”
The group presented its findings in “Profitability of Solar Photovoltaic Projects: A Sensitivity Analysis of Performance Loss Curves and Operation and Maintenance Expenses,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.
