The Gothenburg-based company has already started vehicle testing. The fuel cell electric trucks will have an operational range of up to 1,000 km and a refueling time of less than 15 minutes. The fuel cells will be supplied by cellcentric, a joint venture between the Volvo Group and Daimler Truck. 
Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea has developed a technology to enhance the efficiency of hydrogen generation by flattening platinum (Pt) over the surface of double hydroxide (LDH) layered with nickel and iron (NiFe). “Platinum combines well with hydrogen and is often regarded as the best catalyst for hydrogen generation. However, because the water decomposition ability of platinum is poor, research has been conducted to improve this ability by combining platinum with iron and nickel hydroxide,” the team said in “Crystal Facet-Manipulated 2D Pt Nanodendrites to Achieve an Intimate Heterointerface for Hydrogen Evolution Reactions,” which was recently published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), a national research and development agency in Japan, has selected a group of companies, including Mitsubishi and Toshiba, to conduct feasibility studies on the production and use of hydrogen at New Chitose Airport in the city of Sapporo. The companies will study demand for hydrogen in mobility and heating at the airport, as well as the possibility of local hydrogen production. The study period will end in March 2023.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the African continent has the potential to produce 5,000 megatons of hydrogen per year at less than USD 2 per kilogram by 2030. “Global declines in the cost of hydrogen production could allow Africa to deliver renewables-produced hydrogen to Northern Europe at internationally competitive price points by 2030,” the Paris-based organization wrote in its “Africa Energy Outlook 2022” report.  A number of low-carbon hydrogen projects are underway or under discussion in Egypt, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia and South Africa. 
Uruguay has presented its new hydrogen strategy, under which it targets 20 GW of renewables, 10 GW of electrolyzers, and a turnover of approximately $2,000 million per year by 2040. According to a study conducted by the government, in collaboration with McKinsey & Co, hydrogen production costs at scale could reach $1.20 to $1.40/kg by 2030. Experts from the South American country are currently holding talks with their German counterparts.
LG Chem has announced plans to set up a plant in Daesan, South Korea, with the capacity to produce 50,000 tons of hydrogen per year by the second quarter of 2024. Hydrogen will be made from methane off-gases generated by the naphtha cracking center (NCC). 
The European Union and Egypt have agreed to ramp up cooperation on energy. “The cooperation will have a particular focus on renewable energy sources, hydrogen, and energy efficiency,” said the commission. 
Juniper Research has published a new study showing that the number of hydrogen vehicles in service throughout the world will exceed 1 million units in 2027, from just over 60,000 cars in 2022 (+1,500%).

The industrial park will host a facility producing 300,000 metric tons (MT) of silicon metal, as well as a 150,000 MT polysilicon facility and a 10 GW factory integrating the production of wafers, solar cells and modules. The project will be implemented in two phases and is expected to be finalized by the end of 2025.
Sofar Solar said its initial public offering (IPO) application has been accepted by China Chinext, paving the way for a listing on China’s domestic stock market. The Shenzhen-based inverter manufacturer said it aims to raise CNY 1.5 billion ($223.9 million) in the IPO.
IDG Energy Investment has warned shareholders that it expects a net loss of HKD 404 million ($51.5 million) for the fiscal year to March 31, from a loss of HKD 387 million a year earlier. The expected loss is mainly due to a HKD 362 million loss from an “unconventional” shale oil and gas deposits in the Eagle Ford Shale region of Texas.
Beijing Enterprises Clean Energy said it generated around 301 GWh of clean power from its PV sites in May to reach 1.18 TWh for the first five months of the year.

They have found that there is a deep mismatch between theoretical and empirical solar business models.
“BMs are used in this context to describe and understand the phenomenon of technology diffusion and acceptance, rather than to describe how a specific firm creates and captures value,” the research group said. “We claim that the way these BMs are used and described in the literature does not mirror the logic used empirically by solar firms when designing or communicating around their BMs.”
The scientists analyzed the BMs of 241 companies in active sales, project development, and installation of PV systems and identified six main BM types which they defined as Consulting BM, Technology Provision BM, Turnkey BM, Leasing BM, EPC BM, and PPA BM.
“The Turnkey BM is the most recurrent BM on the Swedish solar market, followed by the Technology Provision BM, and the Consulting BM. Leasing-, EPC- and PPA BMs are in contrast somewhat rare among solar firms active on the Swedish market,” they said.
At this point, there are not many companies in the large-scale PV segment or the solar community business, they noted.
“Swedish policy instruments have favored small-scale systems where the person who consumes the solar energy is the same one who buys and owns the system,” said researcher Amanda Bankel. “Hence, it is not surprising that we see many firms offering these solutions and only a few that are aimed at people who do not want, or have the opportunity, to invest in their own system.”
The study also noted the importance of a correlation between public policies and the diffusion of certain business models. They showed that solar companies are currently designing and communicating their BMs with customers in focus, which is a very different approach to that described by past research.
“To exemplify, solar BM literature view farmers, apartment building owners, commercial property owners, and municipalities as one cohesive group of investors that can be targeted using a commercial application BM, whereas solar firm acknowledge the specific needs of these customer segments and design their BMs to offer targeted solutions, such as individual billing for apartments or impartial support during tendering for municipalities,” said the researcher.
The researchers presented their findings in “Solar business models from a firm perspective – an empirical study of the Swedish market,” which was recently published in Energy Policy.
“If Sweden is to achieve its goal of 100% renewable electricity production by 2040, policymakers should ensure that more people have access to solar photovoltaics by promoting different types of solutions,” said Bankel.
Sweden’s operational PV capacity hit 1.59 GW at the end of December, up from 1.09 GW a year earlier, according to provisional figures from the Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten)
The figures show that 2021 was the country’s best for solar deployment yet, with around 500 MW of new capacity added to the grid. The nation installed 400 MW in 2020, 287 MW in 2019, and 180 MW in 2018. Sweden now boasts around 92,360 PV arrays, with about 26,500 added last year. In 2020, newly deployed installations stood at around 22,000.

The state-run agency said PV projects with a combined capacity of 153.7 MW were selected in the procurement exercise. It was Japan's 12th auction scheme for utility-scale solar. It was also the first exercise to award either fixed feed-in tariffs or feed-in premium tariffs.
For the feed-in premiums, which will be granted to projects above 1 MW, the assigned capacity was 128.9 MW across five projects. The Japanese authorities originally planned to allocate 150 MW and agreed to review 13 projects, totaling 181.0 MW. The lowest bid offered in the auction was JPY 8.85/kWh and the average, offered final price was JPY 9.87. The ceiling price had been set at JPY 10/kWh.
The feed-in tariffs will be awarded to projects ranging in size from 250 kW to 1 MW. The authorities assigned 24.7 MW of capacity and the lowest bid was JPY 9.80/kWh. The final average price was JPY 9.93.
In the 11th auction, which was finalized in March, the assigned PV capacity was 268.7 MW and the lowest bid came in at JPY 8.99/kWh. However, that was the last auction to award fixed tariffs.
In 2021, the Japanese government allocated 675 MW of PV capacity across three different auctions. In the previous auctions, it allocated 942 MW.

Austria deployed around 740 MW of new PV capacity in 2021, according to new figures from the country's Ministry of Climate Action.
This compares to 341 MW and 247 MW in 2020 and 2019, respectively. It also represents the country's best year ever for new PV additions. Last year, solar was able to cover around 5% of Austria's total electricity demand.
“This record addition represents a good and important starting point for the path to energy independence,” said PV Austria.
Herbert Paierl, the chairman of PV Austria, said that companies have reported that the year was a success.
“The industry has achieved incredible things in the past year,” said Paierl. “Without massive grid expansion, however, I'm afraid we'll get stuck in the fossil age. Important accompanying measures such as sufficient designated areas for photovoltaics or the acceleration of the approval process are still missing.”
The association said that around 13 GW of new PV capacity must be deployed to reach the country's climate targets by 2030.
Austria mainly supports rooftop PV via a dedicated rebate scheme. But last week, developers launched the construction of a 120 MW PV project, which underscores growing interest in solar.

They used a molecule known as 2,6-dihydroxy-anthraquinone (DHAQ) – or more simply, anthraquinone – to avoid the decomposition of chemically unstable redox-active species, which is the main factor affecting the storage capacity of these storage devices.
“Organic aqueous redox flow batteries promise to significantly lower the costs of electricity storage from intermittent energy sources, but the instability of the organic molecules has hindered their commercialization,” said researcher Michael Aziz. “Now, we have a truly practical solution to extend the lifetime of these molecules, which is an enormous step to making these batteries competitive.”
DHAQ decomposes slowly over time, regardless of how many times battery cycles have been performed. When it is in contact with the air, after a cycle, this molecule absorbs oxygen and turns back into its original status. For this reason, the researchers refer to the molecule as a “zombie quinone,” as it is kind of returning to life after being dead.
“But regularly exposing a battery’s electrolyte to air isn’t exactly practical, as it drives the two sides of the battery out of balance – both sides of the battery can no longer be fully charged at the same time,” they said.
Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the academics discovered that the battery's active materials can be recomposed via deep discharge. This occurs in a battery when it has been discharged at its full capacity.
“Usually, in running batteries, you want to avoid draining the battery completely because it tends to degrade its components,” said researcher Yan Jing. “But we’ve found that this extreme discharge where we actually reverse the polarity can recompose these molecules – which was a surprise.”
They said redox flow batteries developed via this approach could offer a net lifetime that is 17 times longer than previous research has shown.
“Getting to a single-digit percentage of loss per year is really enabling for widespread commercialization because it’s not a major financial burden to top off your tanks by a few percent each year,” said Aziz, adding that the proposed approach was applied with success to a range of organic molecules.
They described their findings in “In situ electrochemical recomposition of decomposed redox-active species in aqueous organic flow batteries,” which was recently published in Nature Chemistry.
“Now, utilizing 2,6-dihydroxy-anthraquinone (DHAQ) without further structural modification, we demonstrate that the regeneration of the original molecule after decomposition represents a viable route to achieve low-cost, long-lifetime aqueous organic redox flow batteries,” they said.

The platform uses data and scenarios outlined in a dedicated study to present 400 different energy system designs for the Old Continent.
“The study does not include the option to top up the system with energy from stable, non-fluctuating fossil fuel sources, yet finds there to be sufficient flexibility in a raft of other technologies that convert, store and distribute energy,” the scientists said.

The mapping tool can be used for different sectors and regions across 35 countries. It considers fluctuating flows of power, heat, hydrogen, synthetic hydrocarbons and biofuels on an hourly basis over a period of a year.
“To help manage fluctuating power output from wind and solar, platform users can vary their preferred system’s reliance on a range of flexible technologies and balancing mechanisms such as storage capacity, biofuels, intra-European energy distribution, and the electrification of transport and heat,” said TU Delft researcher Stefan Pfenninger. “By varying these factors at will, users can visualize the complex relationships and associated trade-offs within the energy system”
The tool also identifies areas where renewable energy and synthetic fuels can be cheaply produced, where hydrogen hubs can be built, and grid expansion is needed.
“The model and online platform enable researchers and decision-makers to analyse more clearly the conditions determining the creation of a green and self-sufficient energy system for Europe, along with the various options and trade-offs involved,” the researchers said.

Servotech Power Systems has developed a first-of-its-kind solar performance monitoring and control device with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ). The ComPort service has been successfully tested, along with the portable solar system PV Port at the EUREF Campus in Berlin.
ComPort can be integrated into any domestic offgrid/hybrid solar system to turn it into a smart solar system. The Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled intelligent app helps to identify defects, issue notifications, diagnose issues, and suggest operation and maintenance tasks.
Anomalies or underperformance are recognized proactively with constant monitoring. The device can monitor, control and report input/output voltage, battery charge/discharge, and solar power generation. The device is developed on the do-it-yourself (DIY) concept and can be easily installed into any domestic solar system. It also offers data interfaces for third-party O&M companies to combine and analyze data.
Servotech developed the PV Port and the Comport under a bilateral Indo-German program implemented by the GIZ. It will contribute to the broader implementation of solar in India and Germany, especially for the urban PV.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/21/australian-companies-vying-for-3-1-billion-green-hydrogen-project-in-new-zealand/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NEW ZEALAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 21, 2022",Australian companies vying for $3.1 billion green hydrogen project in New Zealand,"From pv magazine Australia
After 80 companies expressed in the project last year, the shortlist has been whittled down to two, with billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) facing off against gas giant Woodside. The pair are now entering final negotiations to develop the reportedly AUD 4.5 billion ($3.1 billion) project.
Southern Green Hydrogen, which proposed the megaproject, is a joint venture between New Zealand power providers Meridian Energy and Contact Energy. It was set up in June 2021 to explore the opportunity of producing green hydrogen on New Zealand’s southernmost tip, following the announcement that Rio Tinto would close its Tiwai Point aluminum smelter, which is primarily powered by a Meridian hydroelectric plant.
The vision is to build a 600 MW facility which would use the power from Meridian’s Manapouri hydro scheme to energise hydrogen electrolysers, producing green hydrogen or green ammonia for export. According to Meridian Energy CEO Neal Barclay, the proposals received from both FFI and Woodside made it clear a Southland hydrogen facility would be both technically feasible and commercially sound, and both companies would be capable of delivering it. FFI and Woodside have now been asked to provide more detailed proposals to Southern Green Hydrogen by the end of August, with the final selection of lead developer to be announced soon after.
Rio Tinto has since wavered on its decision to close the Tiwai Point smelter, but the New Zealand media have quoted Meridian’s Barclay as saying that the company does not plan to continue Rio Tinto’s current energy contract, even if it wanted to keep its smelter operating. Likewise, spokespeople for Meridian have said the Southern Green Hydrogen project is not contingent on the smelter closing.
Hokonui representative and Ngāi Tahu lead for the green energy programme, Terry Nicholas, who has been closely involved with the project, believes the facility and its wider infrastructure could cost around NZD 5 billion ($3.2 billion). According to him, four potential sites for the facility have been identified.
Like Australia, New Zealand is keen to secure some of the green hydrogen market. Its government and private sector have committed around NZD 200 billion to support the development of the burgeoning industry.
The allure of a project with an already secured and established renewable energy input is no doubt vast – especially for FFI which is hoping to live up to the hype its created around itself, targeting 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030.
The allure also holds true for Woodside, which is facing sharp and renewed criticism over its Scarborough gas project, a sustained focus environmental group Greenpeace. Woodside is looking to stay relevant through its move into hydrogen, but is notably pursuing both blue (hydrogen made from fossil gas) as well as some green, renewable projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/21/rays-of-solar-hope-for-europe-a-midsummer-reflection/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",,"JUNE 21, 2022",Rays of solar hope for Europe: A Midsummer reflection,"Solar is described as the ‘kingpin’ of the REPowerEU plan to move away from Russian gas. In the current geopolitical climate, the decentralised and domestic production aspect of solar power generation is more appealing than ever. Stories from the Ukrainian resistance, where solar PV is keeping the lights on in hospitals, and homes, underline the strategic resilience of solar power. In partnership with the Solar Energy Association of Ukraine, we recently held a joint webinar on EU and Ukrainian solar markets, where discussions covered the role of renewables in divesting from Russian gas, as well as the role solar will play in the green rebuilding of the country.
As a consequence of the invasion of Ukraine, and the recognition that Europe must move away from Russian fossil fuels, the European Union has dramatically increased its renewable energy ambition. May 18 marked a watershed moment for European solar, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen introducing the first dedicated EU strategy for solar expansion. Crucially, we now have a dedicated European target for solar deployment for 2030 – around 750 GWdc. As initial EU ‘Fit for 55’ package proposals translated into around 420 GWac of solar by the end of the decade, this new 600 GWac / 750 GWdc target represents a 43% increase in ambition. In her complementary speech, EU Energy Commissioner Simson reaffirmed SolarPower Europe’s mission that by 2030 “solar energy will be the largest electricity source in the EU.”
Alongside the Solar Strategy, the European Commission has officially proposed a minimum 45% renewables target for 2030, in line with our #Yesto45RES campaign, supported by IPCC scientists and 10 other industry associations. The 45% goal now needs to survive the European Parliament, where key MEPs are calling for even higher targets, and the Council of the EU, where Czechia will soon hold the six-month Presidency. Given this landscape, and the geopolitical urgency, the minimum 45% ambition has a fair chance of enduring. Our modelling suggests that a minimum 45% goal would take Europe into its solar Terawatt Age at the end of the decade. Between the 750 GWdc solar specific target, and the Terawatt reality that could be achieved, solar could replace the equivalent of up to 117 bcm of Russian gas by 2030 (out of annual imports of 155 bcm).
Of course, ambitious targets need solid frameworks and inviting investment signals, and the EU solar strategy comes with a suite of flagship initiatives to support the massive solar deployment plans on the table – rooftop, skills, manufacturing, and permitting are all addressed.
Image: SMA Solar Technology
The EU Solar Rooftop Initiative – a long-sought achievement for SolarPower Europe – introduces a revolutionary mandate for solar rooftops on all public and commercial buildings by 2027, representing an enormous step for solar expansion and decarbonisation. Conservative estimates say that EU rooftops could cover around one quarter of the EU’s electricity consumption. With commercial and industrial rooftops representing two-thirds of Europe’s rooftops, we should also look to the inclusion of an industrial solar rooftop mandate to truly maximise rooftop potential. The rooftop mandate also, crucially, extends to new residential buildings in 2029, empowering Europeans to become the master of their home’s energy. To take the rooftop wave to its natural peak, we should address the rooftops of existing building stock, even aiming for around 80% solar rooftop coverage.
Solar sovereignty is best supported by a diversified and global supply chain, with a strong European manufacturing base – and the EU Solar Strategy introduces an EU Solar PV Industry Alliance to restore domestic manufacturing. Details are forthcoming, but the Industry Alliance endorses, and is set to build on, our European Solar Initiative minimum goal of 20 GW manufacturing capacity by 2025. The Alliance will convene actors along the value chain, supporting new, more efficient, & sustainable technologies – including strong R&D links to the Horizon Europe programme. InvestEU, the Innovation Fund, and Cohesion policy funds are all set to be included within a new EU-level mechanism to coordinate funding for domestic solar manufacturing.

Alongside rooftop and manufacturing targets, the European Commission have proposed a Skills Partnership for onshore energy – including solar – within the EU Pact for Skills. In 2021, our EU Solar Jobs report projected up to 1.1 million EU solar jobs by 2030, and already industry reports bottlenecks in accessing the skilled labour needed to roll out solar deployment. The Skills Partnership will seek to resolve this supply/demand imbalance by co-ordinating training and industry stakeholders, while also identifying EU funding sources to support local re- and up-skilling measures, such as the European Social Fund.
Any strategy to accelerate renewable deployment would be incomplete without measures addressing the well-known permitting issues that the sector faces. Alongside the EU Solar Strategy, proposed amendments to the EU Renewable Energy Directive would mandate EU Member States to appoint priority areas where renewable energy projects are likely to have low environmental impact – like artificial/built surfaces, degraded land, or former industrial sites.
These priority areas will be part of the favourable areas for renewables that member states already must define as part of their National Energy and Climate Plans. Notably a new set of proposed timelines for permitting procedures would limit their length to a maximum of 2 years outside priority areas, 1 year within those areas, and only 6 months for projects at 150 kW in priority areas. Should permit application processes exceed those deadlines without objection, tacit agreement from the competent authority would apply.
While 2022 is undoubtedly a difficult year, no more so than for our fellow Europeans in Ukraine, there is some hope on the horizon. New backing from European leaders and the European Commission for Ukraine’s EU Member State accession bolsters the country’s resistance. Increased renewable and solar ambition supports the continent’s independence from Russian gas. The world has just entered its solar Terawatt Age, taking us closer to our Paris Agreement climate commitments. There may be a tough winter ahead, but this Midsummer marks a ray of hope to take us through the challenging times we must face together.

A new startup, Sesame Solar, unveiled its nanogrids that are designed for use in disaster torn areas. They range from 10 to 40 feet long, and not only are they rugged, but they can be moved into place using a forklift, crane, truck, train, ship, cargo plane, or even a helicopter.
To use the nanogrid, the retractable solar array is electronically unfolded, and the system can start generating power within fifteen minutes of setup, the company reports. The systems can be tailored to the community’s need, for example in medical centers, for water filtration, or to provide communication services.
Previous off-grid nanogrids were run on diesel fuel, which just increases pollution in communities already suffering from weather-related events. The Sesame solution uses solar and green hydrogen. The green hydrogen is produced inside the nanogrid with the retractable solar array providing the energy to charge the lithium ferro phosphate battery storage system and to produce green hydrogen via electrolyzers.
The green hydrogen is then stored at low pressure (less than 300 psi) in onboard solid-state hydrogen tanks, which Sesame Solar says can be easily and safely transported, and which fuels the onboard hydrogen fuel cell that also charges the batteries. When the batteries are charged, the H2 Fuel cell shuts down. Small wind turbines can also be added.
“Our nanogrids are changing the trajectory of the effects of climate change while providing communities in distress with the power they need to access critical resources,” says Lauren Flanagan, CEO of Sesame Solar. “While we can’t stop hurricanes or wildfires from happening, we can create solutions that help communities recover efficiently without causing further damage to the environment.”
The solar and green hydrogen work together with the help of a built-in integrated energy management system that ensures the resources are optimizing the available energy. The solar array charges the batteries whose power is managed by the inverter and electronics. When the batteries are at 35% capacity, the hydrogen fuel cell provides power to the inverter. Electrolysis is engaged at the same time the hydrogen fuel cell powers up, so the solid-state hydrogen storage tanks are being refilled with hydrogen while hydrogen is being consumed by the fuel cell.
Then when the batteries have been recharged by the solar array, the hydrogen fuel cell shuts down. Electrolysis continues until the solid-state hydrogen storage tanks are refilled, and then it shuts off as well, making the nanogrid energy-independent and ready for the next extreme weather emergency with continuous,100% fossil fuel-free power generation.
The retractable solar array uses energy dense, thin-film solar panels that produce from 3 kW to 20kW of solar power, with total battery storage of 15 kWh to 150 kWh, although 40 kWh is most common. The nanogrids are engineered and sized to meet peak and average use and provide uninterrupted, sustainable power.
Sesame Solar reports that the US Air Force, major telecommunication companies, and emergency response organizations are using its nanogrids, which have helped to keep critical communications online at the site of infrastructure or by powering mobile Wi-Fi stations if infrastructure does go down. The nanogrids keep essential services operational in emergency response situation, and they can be used to charge last-mile mobility EVs like e-bikes and e-scooters–practical modes of transportation when roads are blocked.

Many Americans are giving heat pumps serious consideration as they try to reduce their dependence on oil and gas. Heat pumps, when combined with low-carbon electricity sources such as solar, can cut greenhouse emissions while saving families as much as $500 a year on their utility bills, according to the US Department of Energy (DoE). One drawback, however, has been the performance of heat pumps in cold climates.
In recent years, specialized cold-climate heat pumps have been designed that operate efficiently in temperatures below 32 F (0 C). Last year the DoE launched the residential Cold-Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge to stimulate domestic development of these cold-climate heat pumps (CCHP), which can help reduce energy costs and move the United State further along the path to achieving President Joe Biden’s goal of a net-zero carbon economy by 2050.
The program has two categories: CCHPs that are efficient at 5 F and below; CCHPs optimized for -15 F (-9.4 C). Product prototypes were due in early 2022, and the first results of lab testing are in.
The DoE announced that Lennox International is the first partner in the challenge. Lennox, based in Richardson, Texas, developed the first prototype that achieved the challenge’s standards about a year ahead of schedule, delivering 100% heating at 5 F at double the efficiency, and 70% to 80% heating at -5 F and -10 F. The DoE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory validated the performance and efficiency of Lennox’s prototype.
“DoE’s Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge calls on American businesses to make heat pumps more effective at heating and cooling, more efficient in their energy use, and more attractive options for consumers – so more households can unlock $500 in savings each year on utility bills. With this newest prototype, Lennox has answered that call,” said  Jennifer M. Granholm, US Secretary of Energy. “Tapping into the emerging clean energy market is a huge economic opportunity that will bring a bolstered manufacturing sector, good paying jobs, and a brighter, cleaner future to Texas and communities across America.”
Lennox is one of nine manufacturers competing in the CCHP Technology Challenge. The next step for this product and others that meet the CCHP Technology Challenge is to put them through trials in cold climate regions over the next two years to demonstrate performance, efficiency, and comfort when applied in the field throughout a winter. Deployment and commercialization are planned for 2024. Utility partners will work with the DoE to establish consumer incentives to encourage adoption, and state partners will also develop education and outreach campaigns. More than 20 utilities, cooperatives, and state agencies have committed to the challenge.
The lifetime cost study by Carbon Switch found that the average cost of a heat pump is $14,000 after rebates. But there’s a huge difference in costs depending on rebates available, size of the home, location, whether the home needs ducts, and more. It also didn’t look at the rising cost of electricity, which is important in light of many utilities substantially hiking energy costs.
In another study conducted in 2021, researchers found that heat pumps were cost competitive with propane in isolated areas in northern climates, regardless of whether a PV system is installed or not. The cost-optimal solution was found to be solar powered, especially if used for hot water production, assuming that solar module costs will further drop in the future.
