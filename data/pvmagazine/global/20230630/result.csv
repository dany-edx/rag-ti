Volkswagen Group France (VGF), a unit of German automaker Volkswagen, has commissioned a PV plant on a carport at its headquarters in Villers-Cotterêts, in the Hauts-de-France region of northern France.
The project consists of two 10 MW arrays covering a 15-hectare carpark. Xavier Chardon, chairman of the executive board of VGF, noted that the “solar cover of [the] parking area is fully in line with [its] GotoZero strategy to reduce its carbon footprint.”
Engie Green, the renewable energy unit of French energy group Engie, developed and financed the €20 million ($21.8 million) installation. It will operate and maintain the plant for 32 years.
The French Ministry of Ecological Transition selected the project through a tender process conducted between 2020 and 2021. The project also gets support through crowdfunding from local communities.
This carport marks Engie Green's thirteenth facility of its kind in France, converting parking lots into green electricity production sites across 200 hectares. As of Jan. 1, 2023, Engie Green was running 2.4 GW of wind farms and 1.7 GW of solar projects in France.

The proprietary coating, which promotes the formation and release of gas bubbles, enhances process efficiency and reduces production costs. An independent assessment by E4Tech has confirmed the cost-benefit advantage. OnS is collaborating with leading electrolyzer manufacturers to test and scale up nanoFLUX production, in order to reduce green hydrogen production costs, according to OnS CEO Ian Russell.
Denso has revealed plans to launch a pilot program at its Hirose plant in July with a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) to produce green hydrogen by electrolyzing high-temperature steam. Denso said that the trial will involve testing the green hydrogen in a prototype power card line at its semiconductor manufacturing plant, serving as a verification of SOEC technology and its application in manufacturing.
The Indian government has said that it actively developing a definition for green hydrogen as part of its plans to shape its hydrogen strategy during a three-day conference in New Delhi, starting on July 5. Indian Minister of Renewable Energy Shri Bhalla said there have been around 48 publicly announced projects on green hydrogen in India. He noted the industry's strong interest in the green hydrogen opportunity, particularly in relation to green ammonia production, which could yield approximately 3.5 million metric tonnes per year of green hydrogen.
Germany and South Africa have agreed to expand cooperation on green hydrogen and power-to-X products. “Our commitment in this area complements the German government's efforts to support South Africa in its overall energy transition,” said Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck. “To this end, we want to make an additional €30 million ($32.5 million) available from the International Climate Initiative.” The two countries said they aim to cooperate even more closely in producing, processing, and transporting green hydrogen. 
Gasunie has announced a planned €100 million investment in the construction of the initial segment of a hydrogen network in the Netherlands. Construction will start in Rotterdam after the summer. The Dutch transmission system operator (TSO) said that the €1.5 billion, nationwide hydrogen network will connect key industrial regions in the Netherlands and neighboring countries, including Germany and Belgium, from 2030. The network will facilitate connections between import terminals, domestic hydrogen production sites, and large-scale hydrogen storage facilities.
H2 Green Steel and Swedish shipping company Gotland Company have agreed to explore the possibility of establishing a production plant that could supply part of Gotland's fleet with green hydrogen. “H2GS will, in a few years, operate one of the world's largest electrolyzers in Boden in northern Sweden, with a capacity of over 700 MW,” said H2 Green Steel. 
Airbus UpNext has launched a new program to investigate the use of hydrogen fuel cells to generate non-propulsive energy in aircraft. The focus is on the auxiliary power unit (APU), which powers various non-propulsive functions. The company said it plans to replace the APU of an A330 with a HyPower hydrogen fuel cell system in order to reduce CO2 emissions, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and noise levels associated with traditional APUs. In addition, Airbus is conducting tests on a hydrogen conditioning system for supplying aeronautical gas turbines.
Air Liquide and Iveco Group recently reaffirmed their commitment to hydrogen at the inauguration of the first high-pressure hydrogen station (1 ton/day) for long-haul trucks in Europe, in Fos-sur-Mer, France. “This transport solution for long haulage features a fast refueling time at 700-bar pressure,” said Air Liquide. Iveco plans to deliver hydrogen trucks from later this year.

SolarPower Europe says the number of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in residential buildings throughout Europe jumped from 650,000 installations in 2021 to more than 1 million in 2022. This is a sharp rise, largely driven by jump in energy prices since the start of the war in Ukraine. And the number of households that have batteries coupled with solar installations in Europe is expected to triple to 3.5 million by 2026, according to the solar trade group.
Market growth is driven by five countries – Germany, Italy, Austria, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland – but France is still lagging behind.
“Compared to other countries in which we are present, France remains a niche market,” said Lars Brinkmeyer, international sales manager for German battery manufacturer Kostal, in an interview with pv magazine France.
French market research firm LCP Delta reports that approximately 566,000 homes in France had PV systems by the end of 2022, with  around 2 GW of capacity. Among these systems, only 1,000 were equipped with home storage batteries, with average capacities of 4 kW. In comparison, Germany installed 220,000 new residential batteries in 2022, totaling a combined capacity of 1.2 GW/1.9 GWh, according to data from the University of Aachen.
“In France, electricity prices, which are around €0.20/kWh, remain lower than the levels observed in other European countries,” Arthur Jouannic, France director for LCP Delta, told pv magazine France. “In addition, the government has capped the increase in regulated electricity prices in 2022 at 4%, which has limited the impact of the energy crisis for individuals.”
In addition, the current prices of “solar-plus-battery” systems need to be correlated with the lack of incentives. Business-to-consumer installers quote prices that can reach up to €30,000 ($32,570)  for a 6 kW PV system with a battery.
“As the price of electricity remains low, the return on investment of such a purchase is eight, 10, even 12 years,” said Jouannic. “In addition, interest rates are high, which makes leasing offers unattractive.”
It appears that these high prices exclude rational purchases. Only the wealthiest households wishing to participate in the energy transition tend to equip themselves.
However, Kostal has sensed a shift in the market in recent months.
“This winter, when the French government mentioned possible power cuts, we saw an increase in consumer interest in this type of system,” said Brinkmeyer.
Kostal plans to also launch a new generation of residential inverters by the end of this year, with capacities ranging from 3 kW to 20 kW. They will be scalable and configurable, with or without batteries.
“Thus, if demand in France intensifies, installers can easily add storage batteries to existing photovoltaic installations,” added Brinkmeyer.
Enphase introduced a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery storage solution in the French market in April. With the expected increase in electricity prices, the US group aims to promote storage solutions to installers and individuals.
“In France, only five out of 100 photovoltaic installations are equipped with a battery,” said Maâty Bouanane, Enphase’s France sales manager, during an interview with pv magazine France in March, noting that in Germany, this rate is 80%. “The French market is therefore in its infancy, but it is the right time to allow installers to familiarize themselves with these technologies, which are very simple to implement.”
Installers will need to undergo certifying training provided by Enphase to be qualified for battery installation.
In contrast, the market for residential heat pumps in France is experiencing significant growth. In 2022, approximately 550,000 heat pumps were sold, including 346,700 air/water heat pumps. This surge can be attributed to the implementation of the RE2020 directive on Jan. 1, 2022, which mandates that the total primary energy consumption (including heating, domestic hot water, electricity for lighting and appliances) remains below 100 kWh/m² per year.
“The heat pump market is mature in France, the very extensive offer of distributors and government incentives, via direct aid and tax credits, encourage individuals to equip themselves,” said Jouannic.
LCP Delta expects more than 1 million heat pump installations per year.
“It would seem that developers prefer photovoltaic solar heat pumps for new constructions, because the carbon intensity of electricity in France is not high,” said LCP Delta. “However, in a second step we expect the market for heat pumps in private homes to be a vector of growth for rooftop photovoltaics, asthis coupling is a logical continuation.”

The surplus reached as high as 30% over parts of Mexico and Quebec. The enhanced solar generation was particularly welcome in Mexico and the Southwest, where it helped meet higher electricity demand caused by record-breaking heatwaves.
The pattern of June irradiance anomalies was caused by a persistent region of high pressure over northern Canada, which also extended over the Pacific Northwest during the second half of the month. This deep, stationary region of high pressure limited or “blocked” the usual approach of weather systems from the west, causing hot and dry air to build up over Mexico and the Southwest, and preventing usual outbreaks of cool and cloudy weather across Canada and the Midwest.

Periods of regional storm activity led to cloudier than average conditions over California, the West and the Northeast during June, with solar resource reaching as low as 20-30% below average in Montana and Maine.
In Florida, storms and low pressure from the north Atlantic also led to major floods and the closure of several hydroelectric dams. Solar generation potential for this month remained at roughly the long-term expected June value due to sunny periods between storms, but the reduced hydroelectric storage and generation capacity introduces challenges in managing the variability of solar production.

Looking ahead for North America, El Niño was officially declared by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) during June, with a likelihood of developing into a moderate to strong event at its expected peak from November to January. El Niño events typically bring wetter, cloudier weather to Mexico and the southern United States during winter.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets glob    ally.

In the paper “The performance and durability of Anti-reflection coatings for solar module cover glass – a review,” published in Solar Energy, the research group presented all coating designs, materials, and deposition methods, split into two categories – single-layer and multilayer coatings. Furthermore, it provided an assessment of their durability, with a particular focus on their vulnerability to abrasion.
Moreover, they discussed the incorporation of properties such as anti-soiling and sub-bandgap reflection into existing AR coatings.
As for the single-layer AC coatings, the scientists said that the sum of their reflectance and transmittance values at each wavelength should be 100%, noting that this technology is currently the industry standard.
“Because single layers minimize reflection at a single wavelength, reflectance rises to either side of this, making single layer AR coatings less effective over longer wavelength ranges,” they said, however, stressing their current limits. “Also, the need for a low refractive index material means that porous materials are generally used, and this can lead to durability issues.”
Multilayer anti-reflection (MAR) coatings, by contrast, are presented as able to overcome the typical limitations of single-layer coatings, as they have a high and low refractive index, which reduces reflection across a broader wavelength range.
“The most basic type of MAR coating is a double layer coating consisting of one high index and one low index material, both a quarter-wave thick,” they explained, adding that MAR coatings also offer an advantage in terms of durability, as they have no need for ultra-low refractive index materials. They also stressed, however, that these coatings are generally more expensive, which limits their adoption at a commercial level.
When it comes to durability, the scientists said they found that the coatings' useful lifetimes are under 8 years, although manufacturers usually offer a 25-year warranty for their PV modules.
“Because the AR coating is hydrophilic, with a water contact angle of around 20 degrees, increased soiling has been observed in some locations, causing a power loss greater than the improvement obtained from the addition of the AR coating,” they emphasized. “This emphasises the need for the addition of hydrophobic, anti-soiling functionality for AR coatings on PV module especially for locations with levels of high soiling.”
Looking forward, the team said that the research should focus on improving AR coatings' durability and multifunctionality, with special attention for anti-soiling techniques. “Further work is required to improve the UV resistance of currently available commercial hydrophobic coatings, and this should be a focus for industry,” it concluded.

The fundamentals of this market, which have been characterized by limited availability and few spot deals, are still in place.
The prices of polysilicon vary greatly amongst different global producers; one producer claimed to be discussing prices of little more than $25/kg with its customers, but no agreements have yet been reached at this price. Another global provider is still providing pricing in the $35–36/kg area in the meanwhile. A source confirmed this week that Chinese enterprises are banding together for negotiations with the latter producer.

China Mono Grade, the OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon produced in China, is almost at its floor, notching down another 2.36% week to week to CNY62 ($8.54)/kg, its lowest figure in almost three years. Prices edge closer to the CNY60/kg mark, which is generally accepted to be the cost of producing polysilicon, indicating that there is no more room for sharp declines. As a result, the percentage decline for China Mono Grade fell into the single digits for the first time this month.
Oversupply concerns continue to be the main theme of the story about polysilicon in China, and multiple contacts concurred. One source estimated that China’s tier-1 manufacturers now sit on around 80,000 MT of the material, while another source put China’s total polysilicon stockpiles at more than 100,000 MT.
However, one source pointed out that the new manufacturing capacity, which was supposed to be released in June, has been delayed. The insider said it is better “to delay production and stay on the sidelines” because these facilities have significant manufacturing expenses and will incur losses if they produce polysilicon in the current low-cost market.
There has been a glimmer of calm in the downstream business as a result of the pricing of China Mono Grade becoming less volatile this week. Wafers prices have also stabilized for the first time after falling for more than two months. The Chinese Module Marker, the OPIS benchmark assessment for modules from China, held steady at $0.173 per W this week after four weeks of plunging prices. Looking ahead, OPIS believes that the production costs of the supply chain are no longer the decisive factor in pricing, and the ensuing changes in demand will have a significant impact on the prices of each manufacturing segment.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The transportation sector is the leading source of carbon emissions in the United States, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but electrifying vehicles across various categories will significantly contribute to decarbonization efforts.
Electric vehicle sales at the global level are expected to rise from 10.5 million in 2022 to almost 27 million in 2026, BloombergNEF says in a new report. It notes that the EV share of global new passenger vehicle sales will grow from 14% in 2022 to 30% in 2026. Shares in some markets are much higher, with the report estimating that EVs will reach more than half the sales in China and 42% in Europe.
In the United States, electric vehicles will make up nearly 28% of passenger vehicle sales by 2026, up from 7.6% in 2022, due to incentives offered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This projection is about 20% off from the Biden administration’s goal for electric vehicles to make up 50% of all vehicles sold in the United states by 2030, but perhaps the goal will be met with four years of additional growth.
The IRA provides incentives for buyers of new and used EVs that are made in North America. While there previously was a limit of 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer that could receive the incentive, the cap was lifted with the IRA. Also in 2023, new auto pricing and buyer income caps apply; however, if a taxpayer does not qualify, they may transfer the credit to the dealer, who can then offer a rebate to the customer.
According to SAFE, a group dedicated to accelerating the deployment of sustainable transportation and energy solutions of the United States and its sister organization, the Electrification Coalition, EVs must also meet critical mineral and battery component requirements to qualify for the maximum credit available. The IRA also stipulates that battery minerals and components come from North America or from countries with which the United States has free trade agreements.
The US government is also helping to meet its own goals by increasing procurement of electric vehicles for the federal fleet. According to a White House report, government agencies in this fiscal year have acquired five times as many EVs as last year, and are on track to meet the goal for 100% of new light-duty federal vehicles to be zero emission by 2027.
BloombergNEF notes that electrification is spreading to all types of vehicles, with light commercial EV sales expected to rise sharply. Municipal bus fleets are increasingly electric and are expected to reach 36% of sales by 2026.
While the trajectory of EV sales is impressive, BloombergNEF cautions that faster progress is needed in order to reach net-zero road transport emissions by 2050. The IRA has gone a long way to promote the adoption of electric cars in the United States, but heavy trucks are still lagging behind in the trajectory and should be a priority focus, according to the report authors.
Other challenges inherent in an EV buildout remain, including the need for a strong network of charging stations. The Biden administration set a goal of establishing a national network of 500,000 EV chargers. While ambitious, a recent report from Wood Mackenzie forecasts that 18 million chargers will be installed across the United States by 2027.

NREL conducted a time-motion study on solar contractors installing roofing-integrated photovoltaics (RIPV) on residential solar projects at several sites in California. The researchers published their findings in “Observations and Lessons Learned From Installing Residential Roofing Integrated Photovoltaics.”
They said that new construction RIPV can be installed very quickly. However, the time required for retrofit RIPV is still comparable to that of standard solar installations. The installation times are still higher for retrofit RIPV, at least in part, due to the application of new techniques and the continued evolution of supply chains.
This analysis was prompted in part by the fact that building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have not kept up with expected price declines. This is despite the fact that investing in BIPV during the retrofitting of roofing, siding or windows can reduce or eliminate the need for separate solar components. Even when these hardware and labor costs are factored in, the expense of BIPV installations still tends to surpass that of conventional installations.

To understand why costs remained higher than anticipated, NREL interviewed industry experts and performed time-motion studies at various RIPV residential installation sites.
The research compared the time taken for RIPV installations with that of standard residential solar installations. In the United States, 32% of the installation costs are attributed to racking and mounting, 32% to electrical work, 20% to meals, breaks, cleanup, and delays, and 16% to travel and installation preparation. Overall, the study found that standard installations required 6.9 worker-hours per kilowatt installed.
