The initial phase would have capacity of up to 300 megawatts (MW) and target production of 200,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of ammonia, matched to forecast customer demand,” wrote the company on Friday, adding that ammonia would be produced by hydropower and wind power. The main focus is on export, but the company also speaks about domestic use. “H2TAS is already garnering interest from existing and prospective Woodside customers in Asia and Europe,” Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill commented. In May, Woodside teamed up with Japan’s Marubeni and IHI to export ammonia to Japan. Woodside is aiming to take a final investment decision for H2TAS in 2023. Construction and commissioning activities are expected to take around 24 months. In October, Woodside Petroleum unveiled plans to establish an export-oriented hydrogen and ammonia production facility in southern metropolitan Perth.
Energy consultancy Xodus and Perth-based metals manufacturing company Unique Metals announced a memorandum of understanding for the Unique HyMetals hydrogen project in Australia. “Unique HyMetals will enable the company to rebalance and optimise energy from rooftop solar and use it to transform water into hydrogen, which can then be used at times when solar is not feasible or unused. Furthermore, there will be zero waste, as the resulting oxygen, which is often considered a by-product of the process, will be captured and used for manufacturing activities such as laser cutting and oxyacetylene welding,” Xodus wrote on its website. The companies expect to start construction activities for internal usages in 2022 and plan investments in commercial-scale refueling infrastructure in 2025.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced that the Australian government and Queensland state awarded Korea Zinc A$21 million (€13.37 million) in funding to start producing green hydrogen for fuel cell trucks at the company's zinc refinery in Queensland. The project will be located at the Sun Metals zinc refinery in Townsville, which is owned by Ark’s sister company Sun Metals Corporation (SMC). Ark and SMC are subsidiaries of Korea Zinc, the largest zinc, lead, and silver producer in the world. SMC’s zinc refinery is currently the second-largest single-site consumer of electricity in Queensland. After funding directed to light vehicle transport projects, ARENA now wants to focus on ultra-heavy fuel cell electric trucks.
Australia’s focus on heavy-duty vehicles came amidst similar developments in Europe. French oil and gas company TotalEnergies and Germany’s commercial vehicle manufacturer Daimler Truck have signed an agreement to team up in sourcing and logistics, dispensing of hydrogen in service stations, developing hydrogen-based trucks, and establishing a customer base. “The partners will collaborate in the development of ecosystems for heavy-duty trucks running on hydrogen, with the intent to demonstrate the attractiveness and effectiveness of trucking powered by clean hydrogen and the ambition to play a lead role in kickstarting the rollout of hydrogen infrastructure for transportation,” TotalEnergies wrote on Wednesday.
Siemens Gamesa’s Brande Hydrogen pilot project in Denmark produced its first green hydrogen as part of the testing and commissioning phase. “Project partner Everfuel is distributing this to hydrogen stations in Denmark, enabling a growing number of zero emission vehicles, such as fuel cell taxis, to operate on a 100% green fuel supply,” the renewable energy developer wrote earlier this week, calling it the “world’s first project capable of producing green hydrogen directly from wind, in island mode.” The Brande Hydrogen setup couples an existing onshore Siemens Gamesa SWT 3.0-113 DD wind turbine with an electrolyzer stack from electrolysis partner Green Hydrogen Systems. Siemens Gamesa is also using the Brande Hydrogen site, which can also operate connected to the grid, to explore the potential of integrating battery technology in the turbine-electrolyzer project.
European ports continue to announce investments in hydrogen infrastructures. Energy storage assets startup Global Energy Storage (GES) has announced its first investment at Europoort in the Port of Rotterdam. “It is buying an interest in part of the assets of the Stargate Terminal from Gunvor Group and will develop more than 20 hectares at the heart of the port,” GES wrote on Thursday. “The deal has been formally approved by the Port of Rotterdam Authority. The site includes a significant waterfront with deep water access, brownfield development opportunities and potential greenfield development sites.” Launched in May this year, Guernsey-headquartered GES is backed by Bluewater, a private equity firm focused on the middle-market energy sector. “Alongside a new jetty that we aim to develop and low-carbon commodity infrastructure, we are also looking to become part of the logistics chain needed to import blue and green hydrogen,” commented CEO Peter Vucins.
The Maritime Cluster of Cantabria – MarCA – has presented the consortium that will launch the Green Hydrogen Cantabria renewable energy project, formed by 26 companies and regional institutions. With an estimated budget of between €26.2 and €28.3 million, the creation of the Green Hydrogen Cantabria consortium makes it possible to begin the financing process. “Specifically, the consortium plans to raise national and European funds to promote the development of this pilot project,” MarCa wrote on Wednesday, adding that a change in legal and regulatory framework is needed to facilitate the mass deployment of the technology.
As anticipated, EDP Renewables (EDPR), the renewable energy arm of Portugal's Energias de Portugal (EDP), whose largest shareholder is state-owned energy company China Three Gorges, pledged to invest in renewable hydrogen projects that will secure an additional 1.5 GW of capacity by 2030. With the announcement, made on Tuesday during the COP26, EDPR joined the H2Zero initiative.
Last week, Solaria Energía and Enagás announced the signing of an agreement to study the potential joint development of a green hydrogen plant. The project envisages up to 200 MWp of solar photovoltaic energy for the production of green hydrogen.
Also last week, Vectalia, Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), Iberdrola, and Aguas de Alicante kicked off the HyVus project consortium, which includes the generation of green hydrogen that will power part of the fleet of Vectalia buses, as well as vehicles of other operators. The plant will be connected directly to a 1.25 MW PEM electrolyzer, which should produce around 345 kg/day (15 hours of operation per day). The project will include construction of a refueling station for heavy hydrogen vehicles at 350 bar pressure. The four companies plan to apply for Next Generation funds.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/12/greeces-policy-reform-fever-storage-net-metering-and-sub-500-kw-solar/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021","Greece’s policy reform fever: Storage, net metering and sub-500 kW solar","The Greek government has completed its wide-ranging policy framework that is expected to reshape the energy sector and also benefit energy storage projects. The bill is now headed to parliament.
Earlier this month, Greek environment and energy minister Kostas Skrekas presented the framework to cabinet ministers.
The reform includes policies that target three categories of storage projects: stand-alone energy storage; combined storage with renewable power systems; and storage projects installed by Greece’s electricity consumers.
Most crucially, storage projects installed alongside renewable energy systems that do not charge from the electricity network will be eligible to participate in the county’s renewable energy tenders.
However, combined storage and renewables systems that are able to charge using the network won’t be able to participate in the tenders.
Similar sub-categories will also be set for storage projects installed by electricity consumers (e.g net metered consumers that also install on-site batteries). Specifically, the forthcoming policy framework will differentiate between behind-the-meter and front-of-the-meter storage systems. Systems that do not inject power in the network will not need a license.
Upon approval of the bill by Greece’s parliament, the country is expected to run its first energy tenders in the beginning of next year. Greece had initially said it would run energy tenders for 700 MW of energy storage by the end of 2021, but the tenders are now expected to take place in the first quarter of 2022.
Greece’s upcoming bill
The energy storage policy framework will comprise part of the country’s upcoming environmental bill, which is the second major legislative effort of the current government since taking office in July 2019.
The first major bill passed in July 2020, speeding the renewables licensing process and introducing an electric vehicles policy.
The forthcoming bill will further improve the licensing process for renewable energy investment, aiming to make it completely digital.
The new licensing process will make it possible for a large-scale project to become fully licensed within just 14 months, from about the 5 years time that it takes now, the environment ministry said. This will unleash about 12 GW of new renewable energy capacity, corresponding to €10 billion of investment, it added.
The bill will also comprise frameworks for the country’s offshore wind and circular economy sectors and introduce carbon budgets intended to tackle emissions in all major parts of the economy.
Net metering systems
Meanwhile, earlier in autumn Greece introduced policies boosting the country’s net metering and small scale solar PV sectors.
Specifically, the country increased the upper limit for net metering installations in the mainland grid from 1 MW to 3 MW.
The policy change concerns consumers in the mainland as well as on the island of Crete, given that Crete linked to the mainland electricity system in May.
Equally significant though was a new measure introduced in autumn to phase out a licensing requirement concerning net metering systems of up to 50 kW.
Until recently these systems needed a connection agreement from the country’s distribution network, which was often time-consuming. The requirement for such an agreement has now been phased out. Instead, consumers need to only make an application with the distribution network, which in turn is obliged to reply with 15 days.
The new net metering policy also allows the installation of net metered systems in congested parts of the network as long as these systems do not inject electricity into the grid.
The timing of a net metering investment is now fully defined, with both the investor and the country’s institutions having to comply with specific timelines.
Stelios Psomas, policy advisor at the Hellenic Association of Photovoltaic Companies (HELAPCO), told pv magazine that the new net metering policy is expected to boost investment in this sub-sector given that Greece’s distribution network did not always process net metering applications in a timely manner.
Sub-500 kW solar sector
The policy change concerning ground mounted solar farms up to 500 kW of capacity is also important given this sub-sector added about 1 GW of new installations last year.
Until December last year, projects under 500 kW were supported by feed-in tariffs (FITs), but starting in 2021, the government required such systems to compete in the nation’s renewables tenders. The government recently reversed part of that decision, however, providing another two years of stable remuneration support to those sub-500 kW investors who do not own more than one solar park supported by FITs.
Therefore, investors who only own one sub-500 kW PV farm can still apply for FIT remuneration until the end of 2022.

Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly on Thursday officially started production at its new 20,000 metric ton annual capacity fab for fluidized-bed-reactor based granular silicon, the company’s new, less-energy-intensive method of making the raw material for solar panels. The project was started in February and completed at the end of last month. GCL obtained what it said was the world’s first carbon footprint certification for the technology from French environment and energy agency ADEME on October 27, and said the new plant, installed in a modular approach, will form the basis of future production projects planned in Xuzhou, Leshan and Baotou.
Heterojunction (HJT) solar cell production equipment supplier Maxwell Technology has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with its major customer, Anhui Huasun New Energy, for the development of an HJT solar cell production line with a production capacity of over 500 MW. The line is expected to deliver solar cells with efficiencies over 25% and with a lower cost per W compared to conventional PERC monocrystalline cells. The production equipment will be deployed at Huasun’s 2 GW fab in February.
Chinese manufacturer DaSolar announced it has signed an agreement with the government of the Dongshan County, Fujian Province, for the construction of a new PV module manufacturing facility with a planned capacity of 5 GW. The total investment value is around RMB1.5 billion ($233 million). The factory is expected to produce n-type PERC monocrystalline modules and products based on TOPCon technology.
Module manufacturer Longi is considering setting up production bases in overseas markets, including India and the US, according to Bloomberg. “Longi is evaluating the possibility of establishing a PV factory outside China, especially in those countries or regions with resource advantages,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine. “However, so far there is still no specific plan.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/12/system-design-for-greenhouses-relying-on-pv-and-ground-source-heat-pump/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TURKEY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",System design for greenhouses relying on PV and ground source heat pump,"Scientists at the Yaşar University in Turkey have developed a design concept for greenhouses relying on PV as an electricity source for LED lighting and a heat pump used for heating and cooling.
“We originally developed the system in 2017 and at the time the payback time value of the system was 5.7 years,” researcher Levent Bilir told pv magazine. “I am not sure if the payback time is shorter today than 2017, as the energy prices are increasing.”
The hybrid system was modeled assuming a 5 x 30 m greenhouse with a surface of 150 m2, the use of 66 south-oriented solar panels with an output of 200 W each covering 50% of the greenhouse's roof, and the deployment of a ground source heat pump, which is a kind of heat pump that can be used for both heating and cooling. The chosen location is the city of Izmir, in western Turkey, where the reference temperature is 25 degrees Celsius and solar radiation is 1,367 W/m2.
The maximum array efficiency values in a year were estimated between 14.17% and 16.14%, with the angle of the roof being 38.4 degrees. The panels were placed on the roof by creating a gap between the module rows in order to let more uniform solar radiation reach the inside of the greenhouse, which is made of aluminum frames and double glass windows with a 13 mm air layer. When the PV system produces more power than needed by the greenhouse, the surplus is injected into the grid. Likewise, when its output is not sufficient, electricity is taken from the network.
The research team evaluated the overall performance of the proposed greenhouse design considering the cultivation of tomato, cucumber, and lettuce, which require different indoor temperatures of 28, 36, and 24 Celsius degrees, respectively. As the cooling loads of the systems are extremely high, the cultivation is stopped in July and August. The greenhouse is heated or cooled 24 h/day by the heat pump.
The scientists calculated the heating, cooling and lighting load, as well as the monthly and yearly electrical demand by taking into account the coefficient of the performance (COP) values in heating and cooling. Furthermore, they calculated monthly and yearly coverage ratio values for each crop and the costs for the PV system and the heat pump, as well as costs for insurance and operation and maintenance.
Their analysis showed that during summer operation months, which are May, June and September, the PV system is able to cover electricity demand with a 33.2 to 67.2% coverage ratio range, which they explain with the fact the power needed to meet the cooling load for the cultivation of all crops is very high. “However, for the winter operation months, higher coverage ratio values are encountered,” the research team highlighted. “The coverage ratio for tomato cultivation ranges from a minimum of 67.4% in December to a maximum of 522.3% in October, while for cucumber cultivation a minimum coverage ratio of 37.6% is seen in December and a maximum coverage ratio of 185.3% is found for October.”
An economic analysis of the data collected showed that the payback time for tomato cultivation is 7.2 years, while those of cucumber and lettuce are 7.4 and 7.0 years, respectively. “The greenhouse gas payback time value of the system was 5.7 years and 2.6 years, based on natural gas and coal-based electricity generation, respectively.”
Looking forward, Bilir said future work should include more detailed analyses and consider storage as an additional option. “Maybe different renewable energy types can be incorporated,” he concluded.

German utility RWE is considering the sale of solar developer Belectric, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The agency said “two people familiar with the matter” had confirmed that RWE was evaluating the sale of the company and that the process was at an advanced stage.
The sale is reportedly part of the energy company's plans to streamline its activities in the field of renewable energy. The companies have not confirmed the report. Inquiries from pv magazine about the possible sale have so far remained unanswered.
Belectric itself recently divested its photovoltaic business in the U.S. as well as component manufacturer Jurchen Technology. Belectric has an operational installed PV capacity of 3,856 MW, 2140 MW under operational management and 729 MW in the construction phase. So far, the company has built more than 460 turnkey ground-mounted solar power plants and storage systems with a combined capacity of 3.85 GW.
On Thursday, RWE presented financial figures for the first nine months of the year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were slightly above the result for the same period last year at €2.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA in the onshore wind and solar segment dropped from €373 million to €36 million. RWE attributed the decline to the cold weather conditions in Texas and below-average wind conditions at its Northern and Central European onshore wind power sites.
Nevertheless, the energy company is sticking to the further expansion of its renewables business. In the first three quarters of 2021, the group invested a total of €2.5 billion in new PV and wind power projects as well as storage projects, around 80% more than in the same period last year. The utility also said it had current projects totaling 3.8 GW under construction that are scheduled to go into operation by the end of 2022 and expected to expand its project portfolio from 9.5 to 13 GW.

IEA PVPS analysis considers all options for underperfoming PV modules,"Repairing and reusing a solar module that is not complying with its expected lifetime provides for more environmental benefits than replacing the underperforming unit with a new and more performant PV module. The reuse option, however, still has several challenges to overcome in terms of economic viability, with only a limited number of positive business cases being available under current market conditions. It may become competitive in the future, however, if PV panels achieve higher efficiencies and costs are further reduced.
These are the main conclusions of the report, “Preliminary Environmental and Financial Viability Analysis of Circular Economy Scenarios for Satisfying PV System Service Lifetime,” published by the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power System Programme (IEA-PVPS).
In the paper, the agency's experts said the main goal of their efforts was to understand to which extent a circular economy approach could be applied to the PV industry. Their analysis was conducted through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and assuming a solar panel has a 30-year lifetime. “The functional unit metric is therefore defined as the total lifecycle environmental impact of the PV system divided by the total amount of electricity produced by the system over 30 years,” they explained. “The lower the metric value is, the more favourable it is for the environment.”
The researchers initially quantified the environmental impact of recycling, repair, and reuse of PV systems under different scenarios and found that the frequent replacement of panels with newer and more performant panels increases the environmental impact. The higher efficiencies provided by the new products do not offset the environmental footprint of additional panel production, they added. “Moreover, our sensitivity assessment shows that, even if maintaining the 30-year service life requires junction box repair and/or transporting the panel for long distances, keeping panels in use is the more environmentally favourable solution,” they emphasized. “In other words, it is better for the environment to keep a panel in use for 30 years instead of replacing it with new, more efficient panels.”
In the second part of the study, the IEA-PVPS group focused on the financial viability of the lifetime of prematurely decommissioned solar panels from a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) perspective and, for rooftop PV, it ascertained that satisfying the 30–year service lifetime of PV panels may be financially competitive with replacing the modules under certain conditions. “This is the case for relatively young panels (up to around 10 years old) with few or no defects,” it explained. “Although we do not account for testing and recertification costs, these costs could be a determining factor for the success of the reuse business case.”
As for utility-scale solar, the repairing or reusing options were not found to be financially viable due to surface–area restrictions, lower remaining power density, and the limited remaining lifetimes of prematurely decommissioned panels. “In addition, our analysis of PV as a utility-scale investment — using net present value as the key performance indicator — suggests that new panels are more attractive than prematurely decommissioned panels in this context as well, without and especially with surface-area limits.”
The experts cautioned that their analysis was limited to polycrystalline panels and that the reusing option should be further assessed under different geographical locations and solar irradiation conditions. “The financial viability of the reuse business case is influenced by additional country- and case-specific parameters, such as the grid tariffs that drive revenue and can fluctuate substantially,” they concluded.

US tracker provider Array Technologies has agreed to acquire Spanish competitor STI Norland €570 million.
The US company will pay €351 million in cash and €13.9 million in its own ordinary shares. STI Norland shareholders will be eligible for an additional payment of up to €55 million in cash based on the amount of EBITDA generated by STI Norland in 2021. If obtained, the additional payment will be made in 2022 following the completion of an audit of STI Norland's results for 2021.
The transaction is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2022. Javier Reclusa, CEO of STI Norland, as well as the rest of the company's management team, will remain with Array Technologies after the transaction closes and will continue to lead the company.
Based in Pamplona, STI Norland has its largest market shares in the Iberian peninsula and Latin America, and was a leader in 2020 in the rapidly growing Brazilian solar market. STI Norland has supplied tracking systems for more than 400 projects around the world, representing more than 12 GW of generation capacity. The company last year generated revenue and EBITDA of approximately €200 million and €43 million, respectively. Aurica Capital, a private equity manager, announced last summer that it had acquired a 41.5% stake in STI Norland through its Aurica III vehicle for around €200 million.
The merging of both manufacturers could create a new world market leader, according to Brad Forth, president of Array Technologies. “This transaction is an important first step in the expansion strategy we developed when we announced our preferred equity investment in Blackstone in August,” he stated. “The combination of Array and STI Norland creates the world leader in trackers, with leading positions in all major solar energy markets outside of China and India.” He also stressed that the STI Norland product line would be complementary to that of Array Technologies. “Increasing the scale of the new company also offers opportunities for significant cost reduction as we drive higher volumes with our suppliers and achieve greater leverage on our fixed costs,” he added.
“The entire STI Norland team is excited about joining Array and the opportunities that the combination of both companies will create,” said STI Norland CEO Javier Reclusa.

Anyone in Germany who wants to put a small-scale PV system into operation in November 2021 must expect electricity generation costs of €0.1152 ($0.13)/kWh and a feed-in tariff (FIT) of €0.0703/kWh.
The combination of high PV system prices and falling FITs could extend the payback period for new residential projects to up to 22 years by as early as 2023, according to EUPD Research. In a recently published report, it studied the potential impact on the German market and made a short-term growth forecast up to 2023.
It said that residential projects up to 10 kW in size will only be viable through the highest possible self-consumption rate. It said that it expects the installation of significantly smaller systems.
EUPD Research also said that a one-time increase in the FITs should be promptly introduced to compensate for the high subsidy degression of the past few months. And a looming short-term market slump must be prevented via reforms for the FIT degression mechanism.
In addition, further measures will be needed to strengthen the German PV market, such as raising the tender limit for rooftop PV systems, expanding the tax-free self-consumption of solar power, removing bureaucratic barriers, and establishing long-term planning security for system operators.

Eight energy-intensive industrial associations, representing the paper, aluminum, and chemical sectors, among others, joined together with SolarPower Europe and WindEurope to highlight the urgent need for policymakers to support the transition to cost-effective, reliable, renewable energy.
Meanwhile, at the household level, our own research shows that solar is already significantly insulating homes from energy price shocks. Households with existing solar installations across the European regions (Poland, Spain, Germany, and Belgium) are saving an average of 60% on their monthly electricity bill during this crisis.
As European Commission Vice-President Dombrovskis put it, this energy costs emergency “only reinforces the plan to move away from fossil fuels”. Vice-President Timmermans was even clearer when speaking to Members of the European Parliament, arguing that if “we had the Green Deal five years earlier, we would not be in this position because then we would have less dependence on fossil fuels and on natural gas.”
The European Commission’s recognition that the green transition must be accelerated was reflected in their ‘toolbox’ for EU member states to tackle the crisis. The guidance reiterates existing proposals on the acceleration of permitting for new renewable energy projects and puts forward recommendations to support industry access to renewable Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs). Corporate PPAs are key to reducing industrial carbon emissions while providing businesses with long-term stable energy costs, and insulating them from the price fluctuations we see today.
With the Commission’s latest endorsements of renewables, the potential of solar stands out as a clear winner. The European Commission has just published its work plan for 2022 – with solar as the sole named energy technology. We must use this opportunity to adopt the clear solutions available to address the remaining challenges to fulfilling the tremendous potential of solar. Just looking at the rooftop segment, for example, rooftop solar should be the expected standard with newly built or renovated commercial and industrial sites. More widely, we need to tackle the lengthy and burdensome permitting processes that slow down the installation of solar sites.
While countries remain dependent on fossil fuels, future energy price hikes are guaranteed. Last year, six EU member states, including Spain, called for a commitment to 100% renewable electricity systems. To take this further, governments must launch dedicated tenders and establish the right price signals for solar and storage projects, while implementing ambitious innovation policies to deploy the technologies that we need in our grids.
European leaders will meet again in December to discuss the energy price issue, with the Commission set to publish its latest additions to the Fit for 55 package in the same week. SolarPower Europe and our partners will spend the coming weeks and months working with policymakers to ensure that any legislative moves reflect the role of solar in shielding homes and businesses from price hikes while protecting the planet from carbon emissions.

Yale University researchers have found that more than one-third of Connecticut’s electricity could come from solar-covered parking lots.
Adding this potential to Google Project Sunroof rooftop’s solar data increased the availability of solar siting to roughly 85.5% of the U.S. state’s electricity provided solely from solar carports and rooftops.
The authors only examined parking lots with at least 100 standard-sized parking spaces, covering a minimum area of 29,400 square feet. Those criteria cut the number of potential sites to 16,900; later filtering lowered the total still more to 8,416. The authors then spot-checked 100 sites and designed solar power plants for them. They speculated that, on average, 35% of the chosen sites were good candidates for solar panels.
They found that the final 8,416 sites across the state could generate 9,042 GWh of electricity within their first year of operation. The total capacity of these sites was 7,021 MWdc of solar power. Priced at $3.00 per watt to install, the solar canopies would generate approximately $21 billion in construction activity.
The report was funded by People’s Action for Clean Energy (PACE). In addition to the technical analysis, the report showed that most parking lots were located in areas that were either low income or non-white.
Building solar power in low-income areas offers multiple benefits beyond simply generating kilowatt-hours. One benefit would be increasing job development in areas adjacent to people looking for local employment. A second might be that local generation of clean electricity could potentially allow for shutting down of gas power plants, which tend to be located in low-income and non-white communities.
Earlier analysis showed that solar power could power 100% of the energy and electricity in the United States while using a relatively small amount of land. Additionally, research suggests that getting to 80% of U.S. electricity from wind and solar is relatively straightforward.
 
The knowledge that the United States can get 85% of all electricity from solar power on already developed rooftops and carports alone should be a huge positive for the environmental aspects of solar power. And, just maybe, optimistic solar salespeople should reach out to the Yale researchers to ask about their list of 8,416 sites, which are waiting for a cold call and a proposal.

Adani Green Energy, an Adani Group company and the world’s largest solar power developer, aims to reach 45 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with the average tariff below the average power purchase cost (APPC) at the national level. The renewable energy developer had an operational renewable energy capacity of 5.4 GW (4.76 GW of solar and 647 MW of wind) as of Sept. 30.
The company will invest $20 billion in renewable energy development over the next decade. It also aims to develop 2 GW per year of solar manufacturing capacity by fiscal 2022-23.
The company announcements fall under Adani Green Energy's Energy Compact Goals as part of COP26, primarily adhering to Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). Under the goals, the companies must ensure universal access to affordable energy services and substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
Adani Transmission Ltd (ATL), another unit of the Adani Group, has also focused its business strategy on the achievement of SDGs, with SDG 7 as the cornerstone. It aims to expand its renewable power procurement and reduce its carbon intensity to support SDG 13 for Climate Change Mitigation.

Cbus Property, a subsidiary of fund manager Cbus, is trying to establish a new benchmark in sustainable design with a facade featuring energy-producing solar PV panels wrapped around a 49-floor commercial tower it is developing in central Melbourne, Australia.
The property developer has lodged a new Development Application (DA) with the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) for the commercial tower. Designed by architectural firm Bates Smart, the proposed tower will feature approximately 60,000 square meters of commercial office space across 48 levels. It will include 1,300 square meters of retail space, 116 car parks, a sky garden and several open-air terraces. The facade will be clad in “translucent, vertical glass photovoltaic panels,” said the company.
“The solar skin system is made up of translucent, vertical glass photovoltaic panels that will help generate 20% of the base building power,” said Bates Smart Director Cian Davis. “People working in the building will be able to look out the window and see where their energy comes from.”
The unveiling of the plans comes after new research from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science found buildings in Melbourne could generate almost three-quarters of their own energy needs if solar technology is fully integrated into roofs, walls and windows.
The research, which examined the viability and impact of window-integrated PV alongside other solar technologies at a city scale, found that comprehensive adoption of existing rooftop PV technology and the widespread deployment of emerging “solar windows” and other building-integrated PV applications could deliver up to 74% of the energy consumption which is required by the city’s buildings.
Davis said the collected energy, coupled with all-electric operations, will help the tower save 430 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
“We didn’t want to design a building that would be outdated by its completion. Instead, it will cater to any work setting and scenario, engage with its surroundings, be open to the neighbourhood at the ground, and achieve the best tall commercial tower performance in Australia,” he said. “When it welcomes its first tenants, it will be Melbourne’s most flexible, sustainable and, frankly, human commercial building. It is architecture designed for the future, which is already here.”
Cbus Property CEO Adrian Pozzo said the “state-of-the-art” development will serve as a “vertical village” for more than 5,500 city workers. Pozzo said the updated DA is an evolution of the previously approved tower, which was originally signed off by the DELWP in January 2020.
“Our vision is to create another world-class commercial building that represents Cbus Property’s leadership in resilient and sustainable development,” he said.
Construction is expected to commence in 2022, pending approvals.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/12/vanadium-oxide-based-silicon-solar-cell-with-18-6-efficiency-via-atomic-layer-deposition/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",Vanadium oxide-based silicon solar cell with 18.6% efficiency via atomic layer deposition,"Researchers at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Spain have fabricated a crystalline silicon solar cell based on vanadium oxide (V2O5) films used as a hole-selective layer.
The novelty of their approach consists of replacing thermal evaporation with atomic layer deposition (ALD) for the deposition of the films. The former is said to create potential scalability problems when the manufacturing process to build V2O5 crystalline PV devices reaches an industrial scale, as it requires the addition of a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) passivating layer.
“The atomic layer deposition (ALD) process provides soft and low-temperature deposition techniques compatible with solar cell fabrication, as well as, it allows conformal deposition of films with a higher degree of scalability to industrial production than the thermal evaporation process,” the Spanish group explained. “Moreover, the superior surface passivation on silicon substrates provided by vanadium oxide films has the advantage to potentially overcome the need to use an amorphous silicon film as a passivating interlayer, eliminating a fabrication step and reducing the overall cost.”
The solar cell was built with a high-quality float zone n-type c-Si wafer and a 4 nm thick V2O5 layer. The deposition process was carried out at 125 degrees Celsius and the vanadium precursor was heated to 58 degrees Celsius. The 70 nm thick indium-tin-oxide (ITO) film was deposited using radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, which is a high-rate vacuum coating technique that allows the deposition of many types of materials, including metals and ceramics. A 200 nm thick silver layer was then thermally evaporated over the ITO film.
The solar cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 18.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 631 mV, a short-circuit current of 38.36 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 75.8%. “The top solar cell achieved significant performance parameters with an efficiency of up to ∼19% without passivation from amorphous silicon,” the scientists emphasized. “Technological improvements in cell fabrication, such as better electrical quality of the ITO layer and/or a thicker silver grid could improve current efficiencies.”
The device is presented in the paper Atomic layer deposition of vanadium oxide films for crystalline silicon solar cells, published in Material Advances.
