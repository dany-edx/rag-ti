Compared to other forms of energy generation, solar parks have very little impact on the natural area in which they are installed. However, they interfere with the landscape and can affect the habitats of flora and fauna. Undesired effects can be avoided or at least reduced by choosing a suitable natural location or a special project design. German environmental association Naturschutzbund (NABU) and the German solar energy association, BSW-Solar, have published a joint paper that defines criteria for the construction of environmentally-friendly photovoltaic ground-mounted facilities.
It starts with the choice of the location and explains that requirements for nature and landscape protection should be incorporated into the decision-making process at an early stage. From a nature conservation point of view, areas with high levels of pollution and low levels of nature conservation should be chosen. NABU and BSW-Solar, on the other hand, are convinced that solar parks can add ecological value to such areas – especially if these were previously farmed conventionally.
The two organizations stressed that solar parks should never be built in wetlands of international importance (Ramsar areas), in nature reserves, or in core and maintenance zones of biosphere reserves and other legally protected biotopes. Local nature conservation associations should be included in the planning at an early stage and their knowledge and advice should always be taken into account during planning.
Habitats for ground-breeding birds and open-land habitats for flora and fauna can be used if the solar plants have the ability to create new habitats to promote endangered animal and plant species. Especially in areas that have a high value for the biotope network, the photovoltaic plants must be conceptually integrated as a retreat for certain threatened species. Fragmentation of the landscape should be always avoided.
NABU and BSW-Solar also established that no more than 5% of a total solar plant site should consist of sealed soil. The installation should also enable the extensive growth of spontaneous vegetation or native, site-appropriate species and their care. The installation of the module rows should be chosen in such a way that sufficient infiltration of precipitation is ensured. Depending on the location, the creation of a wetland biotope could be appropriate in this context.
The maintenance of the plant area should be carried out extensively with grazing or mowing, taking into account the absence of shade, the paper notes. Depending on the vegetation, up to two mowings per year are recommended. The first mowing is suggested at the end of early summer. As a result, plants can develop and increase fruit growth and the insect habitat can be preserved. The development of the natural balance on the plant area should be regularly documented, with suitable long-term monitoring.
“With the jointly developed minimum standards for solar parks, we show that nature conservation and species protection can benefit directly from one another,” says NABU federal managing director, Leif Miller. This would not only earn points for species protection, but also for the acceptance of solar parks among local communities.
“We want win-win solutions for nature and climate protection,” explained BSW-Solar managing director, Carsten Körnig. “Compliance with the quality criteria will avoid conflicts and can simplify and accelerate pending approval procedures.”

The sky's the limit report spells out just how inevitable the rise of clean energy – and consequent death of fossil fuels – will be, and progresses from reporting the global technical potential of solar and wind power, based on the abundance of each natural resource; and the economic potential, ranked by price versus fossil fuels; to assess the ‘political potential' as a final hurdle to overcome.
“The implication is that the energy minister of every country in the world can now sit down with a blank sheet of paper and figure out what is the best suite of options for the energy supply for their country,” states the study. One of the most striking statistics reported concerns the technical potential of solar and wind in each nation as a multiple of total energy demand.
With Carbon Tracker estimating 60% of the world's technical solar potential is already economically viable – rising to 90% by 2025 and all of it this decade – and with poorer nations having lower energy demand, the report notes: “The adoption of renewables is a profoundly just process because it will benefit the poor and the many.”
That's where Moagi, minister for mineral resources, green technology and energy security in Gaborone comes in. Whilst Carbon Tracker estimates nations such as Germany have less than 10 times their energy demand represented by their technical PV potential, the report estimates Botswana has 5,000 times more renewable energy (RE) resource than it needs to power its population.
Using technical-potential figures based on data from Slovakian solar mapping company Solargis, the report groups the world's nations, by RE-potential-to-power-demand ratio, into four clusters. The majority of the world's ‘super abundant' solar and wind power nations – those with more than 1,000 times more clean power potential than energy demand – lie in Africa. The kicker is that, most of the 40% or so of the world's technical solar potential which is still not economically viable – because of restrictive policy, cheap fossil resources and/or a challenging business environment – lies in sub-Saharan Africa.
A second group of countries with ‘abundant' solar and wind technical potential – boasting 100-1,000 times more clean power potential than energy demand – includes Morocco, Uruguay, Chile and Australia, and ‘replete' nations, with 10-100 times more potential than demand, include major powers China, the U.S. and India, and well as the U.K.
On the subject of the small number of ‘stretched' nations – which have up to ten times more clean power potential than energy demand – the report remains positive and points out the progress Germany has made even with ‘only' around 2.2 times more renewables technical potential than energy demand. As Carbon Tracker says: “If the Germans can find solutions, then so can everyone.”
With political will the only remaining barrier to the energy transition, according to the report, it is over to Mr Moagi and his peers.

The agency defined the move as a historical decision, as it is the first time such a measure has been taken, and said the special conditions granted to these projects were conceived as a transitional scheme that is intended at proving that their respective concepts work out and can be transferred to an even larger scale. The areas hosting the two projects were designated as “regulatory test zones.” 
GreenLab is developing an industrial and energy park in which the renewable electricity produced is used for several power-to-X facilities, including green hydrogen production, and is shared among several industrial players. The energy park will utilize a smart grid solution that lets all interested parties share their surplus energy resources with each other, and a ‘plug-and-play' cloud solution that is claimed to enable businesses to optimize consumption via a platform that integrates multiple data streams.
“GreenLab can now test innovative business models or new technology that have so far encountered barriers under the current regulatory framework,” the company itself said in a statement, adding that, through this approach, the setting up of joint energy production and consumption can be achieved without negatively affecting the existing power network and other consumers.
Brande Brint is setting up green hydrogen production in partnership with Spanish power electronics specialist Gamesa, a unit of German conglomerate Siemens. It is being deployed at Siemens' Danish headquarters in Brande, western Denmark, and includes a 3 MW wind power plant and a 400 kW electrolyzer.
“Brande Brint and GreenLab Skive are the first to join a test scheme where companies' projects are exempted from a number of current rules and regulations in the field of energy,” the Danish Energy Agency stated. “This allows them to gain concrete experience that can be used to improve the regulations themselves.”
The Danish government began supporting pilot large scale hydrogen projects in late 2019. In February, the Danish fund Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners unveiled a plan to build Europe’s largest power-to-X facility. The project is planned to be located in Esbjerg, on the west coast of Denmark, and the power-to-X-facility should convert electricity from offshore wind turbines to green ammonia, which would then be used by the agriculture sector as green fertilizer and by the shipping industry as a green fuel.
In March of this year, Danish gas transmission system operator Evida announced it will exempt homeowners and individuals that want to abandon gas and choose renewable energy for heating, from paying the grid disconnection fee. The scheme will be run on a first-come, first-served basis.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/05/ingeteam-unveils-power-station-for-string-inverters/,"INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"MAY 5, 2021",Ingeteam unveils power station for string inverters,"From pv magazine Spain
Spanish inverter manufacturer Ingeteam has launched a new power station for photovoltaic plants built with string inverters.
The new solution has been designed to be installed in combination with the Ingecon Sun 160TL string inverters, manufactured by Ingeteam and with a 1500 V system voltage.
Ingeteam explains that the design of the string station seeks to make installation and connection work in the field as easy as possible. For this reason, it is supplied as a turnkey solution, with all the elements pre-connected at the factory. In addition, it can be transported both by land and by sea, since it can be placed directly on the trailer of a truck or inside a 40-foot container, allowing it to be delivered anywhere.
Flexibility is another of the claimed advantages of this solution, which can integrate from one to four AC grouping boxes, responsible for receiving all the AC wiring from the solar inverters. Thus, the output power range of the string station varies from 1.6 MW to 6.4 MW, which allows Ingeteam to adapt to all types of project configurations and sizes.
Apart from the grouping boxes, the string station also integrates a low voltage/medium voltage power transformer, a transformer oil tank, a medium-voltage switchgear, the auxiliary services panel, and the auxiliary services transformer, thus optimizing the maximum use of available space. All these components are certified according to the IEC standard.
“The first units of the string station have been manufactured in Navarra and are already installed in several photovoltaic projects in Toledo and Huesca,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
“This new product strengthens Ingeteam's scope of supply for the solar sector, to which the group supplies many other products and services,” the manufacturer said in a statement.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/05/a-stable-sodium-battery-without-the-anode/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 5, 2021","A stable sodium battery, without the anode","Anode-free batteries, or those incorporating alkali-metal anode materials, present one of the many possible pathways to improvement in battery technology. This type of battery though tends to show serious issues with stability, and the formation of dendrites quickly leads to short-circuiting or heavy performance loss.
Solid-state batteries, most often incorporating lithium-metal anodes are being heavily investigated as a solution to this. However, scientists led by Washington University in St. Louis (WUS) working with a liquid-electrolyte-based sodium-ion battery have demonstrated a new approach that allowed them to fabricate a working anode-free battery that showed impressive stability. “…the problem has been, with this well-known chemistry, no one ever showed this anode-free battery can have a reasonable lifetime,” explained WUS assistant professor Peng Bai. “They always fail very quickly or have a very low capacity or require special processing of the current collector.”
The battery designed at WUS is described in the paper Dynamic Interfacial Stability Confirmed by Microscopic Optical Operando Experiments Enables High‐Retention‐Rate Anode‐Free Na Metal Full Cells, published in Advanced Science. It comprised a copper foil current collector at the anode side, a sodium-vanadium-based cathode, and a sodium-fluorophosphate liquid electrolyte.
The battery achieved a capacity retention rate of 99.93% per cycle. “In our discovery, there are no dendrites, no finger-like structures,” said Bingyuan Ma, the paper’s lead author. “This kind of growth mode has never been observed for this kind of alkali metal.”
The group attributed its success at least in part to a longer drying process for the electrolyte, and minimizing its water content, noting that this is not often treated as a primary concern in battery research. “Water content must be lower than 10 parts-per-million,” said Bai.
The group was also able to make better observations on the mechanisms at work in the battery by designing what it calls a transparent capillary cell. This enabled them to more easily observe the cells in operation, where much earlier research has relied on taking batteries apart after the fact in order to work out what happened to them. “What really matters is instability during the dynamic process, and there's no method to characterize that,” added Bai. “We could clearly see that if you don't have good quality control of your electrolyte, you'll see various instabilities, including the formation of dendrites.”
The group says its research should overturn much of the earlier perceived wisdom on anode-free battery designs, and that future research could be extended to the growth of other metal anodes in liquid electrolyte batteries. “Our work proved the possibility and significance to achieve the ideal interfacial stability of an alkali metal in liquid electrolytes,” they concluded.

The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has signed a memorandum of understanding with Underwriters Laboratories, a U.S. nonprofit standards development organization, to develop and commercialize Solar Automated Permit Processing Plus (SolarAPP+) software. The software automates the permitting process for residential solar systems.
The use of SolarAPP+ so far has enabled U.S. local governments to cut down on the time required to grant a permit from a national average of five business days to zero.
SolarAPP+ is designed to make it easier for local governments to determine whether a proposed residential solar system is compliant with safety and code standards. If it is, SolarAPP+ will approve the design and issue a permit instantly. If not, SolarAPP+ will decline the application and indicate the issues for the contractor to resolve.
The collaboration with UL is a step in meeting NREL’s goal to deliver instant permitting nationwide, and have the software used to cover 90% of all residential solar and solar-plus-storage permits by 2030. UL’s code-related experience in the solar market, including with installers, customers, and local governments, drove the partnership decision, NREL said.
Late last year, NREL released the pilot version of the free SolarAPP+ software to help reduce the time and cost of local government permitting and support faster deployment of residential solar.
The DoE funded the development of SolarAPP+, and a coalition of stakeholders including the International Code Council, National Fire Protection Association, International Association of Electrical Inspectors, local governments, and the solar industry are helping to develop the software and engage local governments in its adoption.
NREL has committed to adding new features to SolarAPP+ until March 2023, when UL will take over management and deployment of the software with code organizations, the SolarAPP+ coalition, and related stakeholders. UL also plans to work to create new features that expand the scope to other clean energy technologies and installation scenarios in accordance with an NREL license agreement.

The project will be implemented in partnership with Taiwan-based power electronics specialist Shihlin Electric and Engineering Corporation, French battery manufacturer Saft, and Underwriters Laboratories, a U.S., nonprofit, standards development organization.
The storage system will be coupled to an operational 150 MW solar plant owned by Taiwan Power Company that was energized in early April and is located at a former salt mine in the south of the country. The solar park is the largest PV facility ever built in the island to date.
The battery will be provided by Saft and will help stabilize the local grid and provide ancillary services.
Developers of huge solar parks in Taiwan must continue to deal with resistance from the government, other industrial players, and the farming sector. As in neighboring South Korea, land shortages are a big issue for solar deployment in Taiwan, as roughly two-thirds of the country is mountainous.
The Taiwanese government aims to install 20 GW of solar by 2025, with 3 GW of rooftop PV and 17 GW of ground-mounted capacity. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the island had around 5.8 GW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020.

A rising national FIT bill prompted Kiev to last year pass a law which reduced the amounts payable to clean power generators, including reductions ranging between 2.5% and 15% for developers holding signed FIT payment contracts.
A newsletter produced by the Kiev office of London-based legal and tax advisory CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang LLP has referred to a document produced by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers last Wednesday, which mentioned the need for legal representation due to a challenge posted to the FIT-reduction legislation, by renewables developer Modus Energy International BV, part of Lithuanian business Modus Group.
pv magazine has learned the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce will hear the dispute, and London-based Tomas Vail, founder of Vail Dispute Resolution, will represent Modus.
The minutes of the cabinet meeting explain Modus, which owns three Ukrainian solar plants with a combined generation capacity of around 47 MW, have claimed the FIT cuts breach the Energy Charter Treaty international agreement which governs the energy sector, and to which Lithuania and Ukraine are signatories.
The legal firm's newsletter states local media ran with the story after the cabinet minutes were published and an article on Russian news service Interfax reported the Modus plants have suffered a 15% drop in the FIT payments they will be due to the end of 2029. The reduced payment levels came into effect from August.
Both the newsletter and the agency state Modus is seeking €11.5 million in damages, interest and legal costs, with Interfax reporting that figure was an estimate made in the government minutes.
Numerous renewables developers signed up to the government's proposed revision of the incentives program in June, in a bid to reduce the backlog in overdue FIT payments, and in return for curtailment being compensated for. An initial suggestion, by the government, that FIT contracts could be extended as a further pay-off for reduced payments did not materialize in the legislation adopted by parliament.
The law firm and Interfax reported Modus was not among the signatories to the FIT-reduction law.
This copy was amended on 06/05/21 to include details about the venue for the hearing and Modus' legal representative.

The French PV sector is one of the pioneering solar markets in Europe, market research firm EUPD Research says in the newly published 13th edition of its “Global PV Installer Monitor 2020/2021” report.
Nearly 1 GW of solar capacity was installed in 2020, making France the continent's fifth-largest PV market after Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Poland. Cumulative solar installed capacity in France reached 10.9 GW at the end of 2020, while the French market benefited from additional slight growth year on year – a trend that has continued since 2017.
Last year, nearly 85% of new PV plants were installed in the residential segment (less than 9 kW), and represented around 11% of the total installed capacity in 2020. Over the past 12 months, a large proportion of French installers have started to include battery storage solutions in their portfolios.
In 2019, the share was only 29%, but in 2020, almost three-quarters of the surveyed installers said that they offered storage systems to their customers. Around 19% of installers said they plan to include storage solutions by the end of 2021. Installers that do not offer storage systems have complained about high prices, training requirements, concerns about technological maturity, and the potential environmental impact of systems.
EUPD Research also lists the brands of modules, inverters and storage systems that installers have in their portfolios. It also discusses how and where they buy their components, and which brands they offer.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/05/16-63-efficient-perovskite-pv-module-via-slot-die-coating/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 5, 2021",16.63%-efficient perovskite PV module via slot-die coating,"Researchers at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, in China, have developed a perovskite solar module with an active area of 20.77cm2.
The scientists used diphenyl sulfoxide (DPSO) as an electron acceptor and combined it with a formamidinium-cesium (FACs) perovskite precursor solution. “DPSO is demonstrated to impressively enlarge the nucleation energy barrier, effectively retard the natural nucleation of perovskite during the slot-die coating process, and stabilize the wet precursor film,” they explained.
Slot-die coating, which is a coating process used for depositing thin and uniform films with limited material waste and low operational cost, was used to place the FACs perovskite films on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/NiMgLiO substrate with a size of 20x14cm. “Film thickness could be simply controlled by adjusting the concentration of the perovskite precursor ink,” the Chinese group stated, adding that the film showed homogeneous photoluminescence intensity and good uniformity.
The film was cut into 12 pieces, each with a size of 4x4cm, with which 18%-efficient solar cells with an active area of 1cm2 were built. The cells were then assembled in a parallel-interconnection architecture to form the large-area module. This design is said to avoid direct contact between the perovskite and the metal electrode, which would be, otherwise, detrimental to module stability.
Furthermore, the researchers explained that an ultrathin lithium fluoride (LiF) interlayer was used to improve the films’ surface passivation and, as a result, the panel's open-circuit voltage, and that a bismuth interlayer was utilized to prevent silver interdiffusion and the metal's reaction with perovskite, which could affect the module's stability.
The performance of the p-i-n-structured panel was analyzed by the Newport PV Lab in Montana, in the U.S., which ascertained that the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 16.63%. “The encapsulated modules maintained 97% and 95% of their initial efficiencies after 10,000 and 1,187 hours under day/night cycling … respectively,” said the Newport researchers, who added, the devices were tested under “one-sun-equivalent, white-light, light-emitting diode array illumination, with maximum power point tracking at 50 degrees Celsius.”
The research team believes that the proposed manufacturing technique may be used for the commercial production of large-area perovskite PV panels. The device was described in the paper Slot-die coating large-area formamidinium-cesium perovskite film for efficient and stable parallel solar module, published in ScienceAdvances.

Amp Energy, a Toronto-based clean energy investment firm, has revealed plans to invest more than AUD 2 billion ($1.5 billion) to create the 1.3 GW Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia (REHSA), which will include the Spencer Gulf Hydrogen Energy Ecoplex, which forms part of the South Australian state government’s hydrogen action plan. 
The hub will include large-scale solar, wind, and battery energy storage assets in South Australia. It will also feature three solar projects at Robertstown (636 MW), Bungama (336 MW), and Yoorndoo Ilga (388 MW), supported by a total energy storage capacity of 540 MW. 
Two of the projects will form part of a plan to generate hydrogen for both the domestic and export markets from the Spencer facility to ports in Asia where Amp Energy already has operations. South Australia set out plans for green hydrogen hubs in November 2020. It also revealed plans for hubs centred on Port Bonython, Cape Hardy/Port Spencer and Port Adelaide, as well as a blue-hydrogen hub using natural gas extracted from the Cooper Basin, processed in the vicinity of Moomba, and exported through Port Bonython.
The Port Bonython green hub will be based on 2.3-6.5 GW of renewable energy capacity to feed 1.2-2.5 GW of electrolyzers. The Cape/Hardy Port Spencer green hub assumes 1.1-61 GW of generation to feed 0.6-2.6 GW of electrolyzer capacity, at 75% of electrolyzer utilization, to allow for intermittent supply.
The Canadian outfit is not wasting any time with the massive investment. It has already secured development and land approvals for both the Robertstown and Bungama projects, and has set an energization date in late 2022. It says the two projects alone will create 550 full-time jobs during the construction phase. 
Robertstown, which is the location for the 636 MW project, is ideally placed for the planned New South Wales-South Australia Interconnector. The 900 km, 330 kV line is set to connect the South Australia and New South Walkes power grids for the first time. 
”The strategic value of the South Australian portfolio is significant in a jurisdiction which is undergoing one of the most rapid energy transitions in the world,” said Dean Cooper, executive vice president and head of Amp Australia.
South Australia Minister for Trade and Investment Stephen Patterson welcomed the prospect of the REHSA. “South Australia has significant land mass and world-class wind and solar resources, with aspirations of reaching net 100% renewable energy generation by 2030,” he said. “The Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia will be fundamental in integrating our state’s renewable energy storage assets and building our capability and supporting the fast-moving energy transitions we’re experiencing.”
