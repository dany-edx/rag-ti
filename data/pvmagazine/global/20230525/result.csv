Madrid plans to open Spain's first green hydrogen plant to use reclaimed water. The plant will start operations in 2024 at the Arroyo Culebro Cuenca Media Alta wastewater treatment facility in Pinto. It will be built by Canal de Isabel II, a water-management company owned by the city of Madrid.
The project, with an initial capacity of approximately 80,000 kilograms of hydrogen per year, stands out for multiple reasons. Firstly, hydrogen will be produced from reclaimed water and undergo additional treatment through electrolysis. The Madrid government said that it will be the largest green hydrogen generation plant in Spain to use recycled water.
It will also combine two renewable technologies – solar generation and biogas cogeneration, using waste from the treatment plant itself. The oxygen generated during electrolysis will also enhance the purification treatment of wastewater, improving the facility's ability to handle the pollution produced by 1.2 million residents.
By implementing tertiary treatment, Canal de Isabel II will supply the required water to the electrolyzer, with 12 liters of water necessary to produce 1 kilogram of hydrogen. The project involves an investment of €7.3 million ($7.8 million) and is expected to be completed in the next 13 months.
In addition, the wastewater treatment plant will have the capacity to produce up to 30 million liters of conventional reclaimed water per day. It will use ultrafiltration membranes and reverse osmosis for purposes such as irrigating green areas or cleaning streets.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/25/energy-majors-dominate-list-of-worlds-leading-big-pv-developers/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 25, 2023",Energy majors dominate list of world’s leading big PV developers,"Established energy utilities are increasingly dominating the ownership and development of utility-scale solar plants. Only six renewable specialists now make the list of the world's top 20 project developers, and only two appear among the top 20 utility-scale solar plant owners, according to the data compiled by UK research outfit Wiki-Solar.
NextEra Energy now tops both lists. According to Wiki-Solar’s Philip Wolfe, this is “thanks especially to the recent intense “solarization” of its subsidiary Florida Power & Light. Just six years ago, NextEra was down at No. 6, but it has moved up one place each year since then.”
Independent renewables developers are led by Canadian Solar and First Solar, which rank fifth and sixth. India’s ACME Solar follows at ninth place, with US-focused Cypress Creek at 14th.
Wiki-Solar counts Lightsource, which ranks 17th, as a renewables company, but BP now has a major stake in it. The last of the six is the legacy of projects left by the now-defunct SunEdison.
Five other pure-play renewable companies made it into the top 30 – China’s JinkoSolar and Europe’s BayWa r.e, In addition, Neoen, FRV, and X-Elio each have at least 2 GW (AC) of cumulative capacity under their belts.
On the list of utility-scale PV owners, China's State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC) holds the second spot, with five other Chinese companies in the top 20.
Europe is led by Enel, which ranked third, but EDF, Engie, and Iberdrola are also all high on the list. India comes in with Adani at No. 4, and NTPC and Azure are also listed. AES, Dominion, and Duke Energy represent the United States, alongside NextEra.
“Utility-scale solar projects are getting ever larger, with the biggest now measured in gigawatts,” said Wolfe. “Few but the major multinationals have the financial muscle to take on projects at that scale, so we expect their dominance to continue.”
The only renewables companies among the top 20 IPPs/owners are JinkoSolar and Lightsource BP. Three infrastructure investors also feature, led by Global Infrastructure Partners at No. 19, with D.E. Shaw Renewable Investment (DESRI) and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway lower down.

ESA Solar has announced the completion of the first 1.2 MW phase of a 3.6 MW ground-mounted solar project for an indoor cannabis grower in central Florida.  The three-phase solar farm project is part of ESA’s ongoing expansion efforts to provide pathways to decarbonization for companies and communities in new markets and regions, including recreational cannabis.
The solar farm uses Q Cells Q-Peak Duo XL bifacial double glass solar modules mounted on Terrasmart Glide racking hardware – a design built to provide maximum efficiency and stability, an ESA Solar spokesman told pv magazine USA. The array’s panels are strung together using 62.5 kW Sunny TriPower Core 1 inverters from SMA Solar, he added.
A 2022 report from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that climate control measures represent more than 80% of the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production. On-site solar systems can reduce costs for growing operations, as electricity can add up to 30% to 50% of the cost of cannabis production.
Cannabis production represents more than 1% of US electricity demand, said the National Conference of State Legislatures. This presents a large opportunity for renewable energy adoption.

Situated in Weert, the Netherlands, the facility can manufacture 200,000 panels per year.
Solarge's focus lies in developing lightweight products suitable for installation on rooftops with limited load-bearing capacity, eliminating the need for extensive roof reinforcement. It prides itself on the circularity of its solar panels, which are designed with full sustainability in mind. Composed of premium lightweight materials, these panels can be fully recycled at the end of their 25-year lifespan to produce new solar panels.
The production facility will make two types of monocrystalline PERC panels – SOLO and SOLO Ultra Low Carbon. The two panel types weigh 5.5kg/m2, with maximum power outputs ranging from 470 W to 520 W, and module efficiencies between 17.4% and 19.2%.
The primary distinction between the two panel lines lies in their carbon footprints. The SOLO panels have a carbon footprint of 629 kg CO2 eq/kWp to 596 kg CO2 eq/kWp, based on maximum power output, along with an Environmental Cost Indicator (NMD) of €32.48 per piece over 25 years. The SOLO Ultra Low Carbon panels offer a lower carbon footprint of 489 kg CO2 eq/kWp to 442 kg CO2 eq/kWp, and an environmental cost indicator (NMD) of €32.14 ($34.46) each over 25 years.
Chemical supplier SABIC, a global player in the industry, is serving as a close partner by supplying high-quality raw materials for production. Solarge said it plans to commence customer deliveries by June and has plans to expand its production capacity to 600,000 solar panels per year.

The Chilean National Energy Commission (CNE) has issued the details of its National and International Public Tender for the Supply of Energy and Electric Power 2023/01, which will address electricity supplies for regulated customers.
The CNE said in a statement that the planned auction will be for a total of 5,400 GWh, divided into two blocks of 1,800 GWh and 3,600 GWh each, to cover consumption from 2027 and 2028. The auction will include “important innovations” regarding the treatment of market risks and incentives for storage and non-variable renewable energies, noted the CNE. The innovations include “the segmentation of the bidding into three zonal blocks, an increase in the duration of supply contract to 20 years, the possibility of transferring the systemic costs of the short-term market, and the inclusion of a direct incentive for means of storage and generation with non-variable renewable energy sources,” it added.
Chilean Energy Minister Diego Pardow said that the division into three geographical zones will reduce risks for operators. He added that incorporating side payments for consumers helps operators mitigate risks and achieve greater flexibility in system operations. “The special consideration of flexible renewable energy sources allows us to work on strengthening the renewable energy storage pillar,” he explained.
CNE Executive Secretary Marco Antonio Mancilla said that the “measure is part of the mitigation of risks to suppliers that the initiative of the Ministry of Energy is considering and its main objective is to promote the portfolio of clean, efficient renewable generation projects and mitigate risks to which suppliers are exposed.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/25/inorganic-perovskite-pv-cell-hits-17-04-via-fullerene-derivative-interlayer/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",BERNADETTE GEYER,"MAY 25, 2023",Inorganic perovskite PV cell hits 17.04% via fullerene-derivative interlayer,"A group of material scientists improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSC) by adding an interlayer called bis-dimethylamino-functionalized fullerene derivative (PCBDMAM). These solar cells have higher efficiency but lower thermal stability compared to those made with organic-inorganic light absorbing materials.
The scientists focused on the interlayer positioned between the zinc oxide (ZnO) electron transport layer (ETL) and all-inorganic CsPbI2.25Br0.75 perovskite layer to enhance electron transport and PCE. The addition of the interlayer increased the PCE to 17.04%, significantly higher than the control device's 14.44% efficiency.
In terms of thermal stability, the PCBDMAM-incorporated PSC device retained around 80% of its initial PCE after 600 hours of heating, while the control device degraded rapidly to about 62% under identical conditions.
Lead investigator Shangfeng Yang stated that they achieved defect passivation of all-inorganic PSCs by using various types of interlayers, such as small molecules, polymers, inorganic compounds, 2D perovskite layers, fullerene, and its derivatives.
The team will continue exploring ways to enhance the functionality and lifespan of solar cells. Their focus includes altering the composition, concentration, and application of solar cell layers to optimize temperature stability and efficiency. The ultimate goal is to make solar energy production more reliable and affordable.
The group published its findings in “Synchronous defect passivation of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells enabled by fullerene interlayer,” which was recently published in Nano Energy Research.
