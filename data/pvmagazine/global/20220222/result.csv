Called Hevo, the electrolyzer is powered by a concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) cell, which converts more than 40% of the solar energy it captures into electricity. The remaining 60% is released as thermal energy. By coupling directly to the CPV unit, Hevo can use electrical energy without transport or conversion losses to power the electrochemical reaction while using thermal energy to preheat the feed water and reduce the energy load needed to split the water molecule. “In a place with 2,100 kilowatt-hours per square meter per year of solar irradiation, which coincides with the annual average in the south of Portugal, each Hevo Solar [unit] can produce 1 ton of hydrogen per year,” said Fusion Fuel Green, adding “it is also designed to use renewable energy from the grid or other sources to operate at night or when the sun is not shining, which would double the annual production of each unit.”
India’s Adani Group and Canadian PEM fuel cell producer Ballard Power Systems have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to evaluate a joint investment in the commercialization of hydrogen fuel cells for mobility and industrial applications in India. “Under the MoU, both parties will examine various options to cooperate, including potential collaboration for fuel cell manufacturing in India,” Adani Group wrote yesterday.
Researchers at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) have demonstrated an “easily produced” composite of gallium and aluminum creates aluminum nanoparticles that react rapidly with water at room temperature, to yield large amounts of hydrogen. “We don’t need any energy input and it bubbles hydrogen like crazy. I’ve never seen anything like it,” said UCSC chemistry professor Scott Oliver who, together with professor Bakthan Singaram, wrote a paper on the finding, which was published last week in Applied Nano Materials. “The gallium was easily recovered for reuse after the reaction, which yields 90% of the hydrogen that could theoretically be produced from [the] reaction of all the aluminum in the composite,” the researchers wrote. A US patent application is pending on the technology.
The government of Niger has signed an agreement with Germany's Emerging Energy Corporation (EEC) to work together to explore and develop commercial green hydrogen projects in the African state. “Emerging Energy Corporation will also invest in various project[s] to decarbonize oil field operations and refineries in Niger with carbon capture technologies,” EEC said yesterday. “Green hydrogen will be produced in Niger by electrolysis, using renewable power.  This low-carbon solution will decarbonize emission-intensive industries in Niger, Africa, Europe and other countries that depend a lot on fossil fuels.” The agreement came after last week’s summit between the African Union and the EU. German economy and climate protection minister Robert Habeck last week said hydrogen will ramp up very quickly in a short time as he visited energy company Apex Energy, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Euro-African co-operation plans include a project consortium led by Norwegian clean energy company Scatec, which is planning to install an electrolyzer near the Suez Canal ahead of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.
Australian engineer Worley, Swedish-Swiss electrical equipment firm ABB, and American tech giant IBM have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop an “integrated, digitally enabled solution for facility owners to build green hydrogen assets more quickly, cheaply, and safely, and operate them more efficiently.” Worley will provide engineering, procurement, and construction expertise; ABB electrical infrastructure input, automation, operations digitalization and optimization, and energy management; and IBM will support systems integration.
Belgian consortium Hyoffwind – comprising generation company Virya Energy and gas transport system operator Fluxys – has signed an agreement with compatriot businesses the mechanical engineer John Cockerill and construction company Besix to design and build a green hydrogen production unit in Zeebrugge. “The permit application process was begun in late 2021 and the consortium expects to receive a permit by mid-2022,” said Fluxys last week. “The final investment decision, which is also subject to the granting of subsidies by the Flemish government under the [Covid] recovery plan, will be made in the course of 2022.” John Cockerill has reported solid growth in its electrolyzer business and last week claimed to be “the global leader in the supply of electrolyzers in 2021, with a 33% market share of shipments.” The business sold almost 200MW of electrolyzer capacity last year to book a threefold annual rise in hydrogen revenue. The company said it shipped two stacks of electrolyzers in November which had a unit power of 6.5MW, which John Cokerill described as “the largest in the world.”
The Hy24 joint venture between French private investment house Ardian and Swiss hydrogen asset management company FiveT Hydrogen will acquire a 30% stake in the renewables division of Spanish energy company Enagás. The Enagás Renovable start-up was founded in 2019 with a portfolio of more than 50 Spanish renewable gas and decarbonization projects. The furthest advanced projects represent more than 750MW of electrolysis capacity with planned commercial operation dates between next year and 2026. “This deal follows the first investment made earlier this month in participating [in] the €200 million fund rais[ing round] of the German company Hy2gen AG,” Hy24 said today.
University College London (UCL) spin-out company Bramble Energy has closed a £35 million (€42 million) investment round which should help the company expand its hydrogen fuel cell stack operations. “UCL engineers think about solutions that will ‘change the world’ and the faculty of engineering is very entrepreneurially-minded, incubating young companies such as Bramble to maximize the chances of success,” said UCL chemical engineering professor Dan Brett last week. Brett is the co-founder of Bramble Energy, a company led by UK-based investor HydrogenOne Capital Growth and supported by institutional investors including the BGF small business investor set up by the biggest UK banks in the wake of the financial crisis; London-based university intellectual property investors IP Group and Parkwalk Advisors; and the UCL Technology Fund which is part of London based investor Albion Capital Group.
The UK is collaborating with several countries in the hydrogen sector. Last week, for instance, the British government spoke with Australian politicians about measures to boost bilateral cooperation and work more closely in the Indo-Pacific. “[UK-based fund manager] Octopus Australia is partnering with an indigenous business group to create Desert Springs Octopus, a project worth £26 billion (€31.2 billion) over ten years that will deliver wind, solar and hydrogen energy,” the British government announced last week. 
The UK is also proceeding with natural gas powered blue hydrogen plans. The Eni UK unit of the Italian energy company this month announced it has signed agreements with 19 companies interested in having their emissions captured, transported and stored at Eni UK’s depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, as part of the HyNet North West industrial decarbonization project focused on the North West of England and North Wales.

The Alaminos solar plant is located in Alaminos, Laguna province, in the Calabarzon region of the island of Luzon. The plant began commercial operations in June.
Several large scale storage projects were completed or announced in the Philippines over the past months.
The power arm of the Philippines-based brewing-to-energy conglomerate San Miguel Corporation (SMC) recently said it is ready to start operations of an initial 690MW of battery storage facilities. These projects include a 470MW/470MWh portfolio that UK storage specialist Fluence is developing with San Miguel. The first 20MW/20MWh battery energy storage system of this portfolio was commissioned in late January.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) private-sector arm of the World Bank will support the development of a 600MW solar park development site in Uttar Pradesh on a public-private partnership basis.
The solar-ready site is one of two 600MW solar parks planned in Uttar Pradesh to be developed by central government-owned hydropower business THDC India Ltd in a joint venture with the Uttar Pradesh New & Renewable Energy Development Agency. Under the terms of the joint venture, THDC India will own 74% of the Tusco Ltd joint company, with the state renewables body holding the balance.
THDC India and the state renewables agency have been tasked with developing up to 2GW of solar park site capacity, including the 600MW solar-zone to be prepared in the Jhansi district of the Garotha tehsil, or township, of Uttar Pradesh which the IFC will try to attract private investment for.
The 2GW of solar parks to be set up by Tusco will be installed under the Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Park scheme run by the national Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
Tusco will get federal government funding of INR20 lakh ($26,800) per megawatt of solar generation capacity which can be hosted at the site or 30% of the solar park project development cost, whichever is lower. The cash will be used to provide park infrastructure and the joint venture will also meet electricity transmission costs to the central or state utility.
The park will encompass 242 acres of government land and 2,851 acres leased from farmers in the villages of Sujanpura, Jaswanpura, Jalalpura, Pura, and Kharora, next to the Dhasan river in Garotha.

In many remote regions of the world, small light aircraft take care of the people who live there. However, refueling the aircraft is often a problem because the necessary infrastructure is lacking. On top of that, the high costs for fuel must be considered.
With this in mind, UK non-profit organization Nuncats has set itself the goal of creating a more practical, cheaper, and more climate-friendly alternative – to power, with solar, electric small aircraft.
Nuncats has now put a demonstration facility into operation at an airfield in Old Buckenham, around 150km northeast of London, which is intended to show what a photovoltaic charging station for electric aircraft could look like.
The 14kW station is equipped with 33 Q Peak Duo L-G8 solar modules from Korea-based manufacturer Hanwha Q-Cells. The modules are mounted on a frame developed by UK solar installer Renenergy which is similar to the construction for solar carports. According to Nuncats, this is the first facility of this type in Europe.
The modules provide solar power to a specially adapted Zenith 750 aircraft – the “electric Sky Jeep.” This prototype has a 30kWh battery, which is enough for a 30-minute flight. According to Nuncats, this is the minimum for use in rural areas. The facility at Old Buckenham Airfield currently uses a single-phase, 5kW charger. However, the charging infrastructure can be adapted in such a way that it best suits each application.
Tim Bridge, co-founder of Nuncats, hopes the facility will become a launchpad for further airspace electrification. “In the developed world, the benefits of electric aircraft are all about reducing CO2 and noise emissions,” says Bridge. For the rest of the world, a major untapped advantage is that electric aircraft offer a robust, low-maintenance alternative that is not dependent on fossil fuel supply chains.

The net profit attributable to shareholders reached RMB1.88 billion (US$297 million), up 52.64% on the 2020 figure. The company said the rise in profits was down to bigger sales, in particular of its high-margin, 210mm-wafer based modules; and to growth in its distributed smart energy business.
Wafer manufacturer Shuangliang Eco-Energy recorded revenue of RMB3.83 billion (US$605 million) last year, up 84.87% on 2020, with operating profit up to RMB403 million (US$63.6 million) for a year-on-year improvement of 152.62%. The net profit attributable to shareholders reached RMB312 million (US$49.3 million), 127.24% more than was banked a year earlier. Shuangliang said the numbers were boosted by sales of its solar production equipment, including polysilicon furnaces, as well as by previous investment in its poly production capacity.
Fellow polysilicon manufacturer, and solar project developer, GCL-Poly Energy Holdings yesterday proposed changing the name of the business to GCL Technology Holdings Ltd – subject to shareholder approval – to “better reflect the current status of the group’s business development.” The company also announced new executive director Lan Tianshi has been appointed joint CEO alongside previous sole occupant of the post, Zhu Zhanjun. GCL, whose project development business is pivoting toward gas-fired hydrogen production, said the company would benefit from Lan’s “extensive experience in chemical manufacturing.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/22/damp-heat-stable-perovskite-solar-cell-with-24-3-efficiency/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Damp heat–stable perovskite solar cell with 24.3% efficiency,"Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have developed a perovskite solar cell based on a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction that is claimed to retain over 95% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 hours at damp-heat test conditions.
“The study is not the first focusing on damp-heat passing perovskite solar cells, but it is the first to report an efficiency exceeding 20% after the damp-heat test, with industry compatible encapsulation methods,” the research's corresponding author, Erkan Aydin, told pv magazine.
The special heterojunction was fabricated by growing two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layers on the top surface of a 3D-perovskite, which is claimed to ensure defect passivation and eliminate ion migration. These layers were embedded between the 3D-perovskite surface and the opaque hole-selective top-contact stack. The 2D-perovskite fragments were dimensioned by tuning the annealing conditions with higher temperatures. This resulted in more efficient charge transfer at the 2D/3D perovskite interface and the electron-selective layer. “In addition, the effects of 2D-perovskite capping layers also enhanced the resilience against moisture of 3D-perovskite film,” the scientists highlighted.
The cell was fabricated with a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), the 2D layers, the 3D perovskite layer, an electron-selective layer, a buffer layer based on bathocuproine (BCP), and silver metal contact.
The device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.7%, an open circuit voltage of approximately 1.20 V, and fill factor of around 82%. “Our 2D-perovskite passivation simultaneously served as ion-migration-blocking, moisture-oxygen ingress barriers, and defect passivation layers, particularly at elevated operating temperatures,” the research team emphasized. “Our results represent the successful encapsulation of PSCs passing industry-relevant damp-heat test according to the IEC 61215:2016 protocol.”
According to the academics, the cell was able to achieve an efficiency of over 19% after 1,000 hours of damp-heat test. “There was no substantial change in the structural and optical properties of the 2D-perovskite passivation films (both 3D and 2D perovskites) after over 500 hours thermal annealed at 85 degrees Celsius, confirming the robustness of our 2D-perovskite passivation approach,” they concluded.
The solar cell is described in the paper Damp heat — stable perovskite solar cells with tailored-dimensionality 2D/3D heterojunctions, published in Science.

Those were among the findings of a survey of the prospects for a global solar market that will surpass 1TW of new generation capacity out to 2025, according to analyst IHS Markit.
The London-based market data company has extrapolated the performance of solar last year and recent policy changes to predict what the world market will look like over the next four years.
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
The expected dominance of China in most market segments will come as little surprise to industry observers, with the Asia-Pacific region set to account for 51% of installations over the four-year window, led by the solar superpower, which IHS Markit says will corner 36% of new capacity alone.
The region will trail Europe when it comes to residential solar though, according to an infographic released by the data company on Thursday, with Germany the leading nation in a region which it is expected will claim 43% of the global market, versus 30% in Asia-Pacific, 24% in the Americas, and just 3% in Africa and the Middle East.
The US will actually lead a residential market which will offer more resilience than the large scale solar segment which is suffering from rising panel prices and logistics headaches, according to IHS Markit, which said the United States will account for 19% of all new home solar arrays through 2025. Australia will not lag far behind, with 18%, and Germany and Poland can both be expected to add more household systems than China, the data company predicted.
Those residential numbers will help the Americas claim 19% of the total solar market over the next four years, the analyst expects, with Europe amounting to 23%, and Africa and the Middle East 7%. The US will also be the nearest rival to China in whole-market terms, ahead of India, Germany and Brazil.
On the trackers front, IHS Markit has predicted 85% of ground-mounted solar panels added in the Americas through 2025 will be tracker mounted. That compares with just 22% of Asian projects and 43% in Europe. With ground-mounted arrays set to supply 66% of new solar over the next four years, the analyst said, an Asian-Pacific region led by China will claim 56% of the market during that time, with Europe amounting to 29%, the Americas 12% and Africa and the Middle East 4%, with the percentages offered by IHS Markit rounded off. In country terms, the US will be the second biggest ground-mount market through 2025, ahead of India, Germany and Spain.
Spain also figures among the leading nations in the analyst's prediction for utility scale solar projects, a segment in which China and India, sandwiching second-largest market the US, will corner 45% of capacity between them, with Spain and Brazil set to be the fourth and fifth national markets. Asia-Pacific will host 47% of the utility scale solar generation capacity built over the next four years, the analyst said, ahead of the Americas (with a 24% market share), Europe (20%), and Africa and the Middle East (9%).
The latter region will supply 8% of the global rooftop solar market out to 2025 but only 5% of the commercial and industrial segment, according to IHS Markit. Commercial arrays from China will account for almost half the global total during that period, with Germany supplying 10%, ahead of Brazil, Japan, and Australia, as the Asia-Pacific region will claim 63%, Europe 23%, and the Americas 9%, the data company predicted.
The familiar figure of China will also dominate the next four years' rooftop arrays, ahead of Germany, the US, Australia, and Brazil as Asia-Pacific accounts for half the global picture, the Americas 22%, Europe 20%, and Africa and the Middle East 8%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/22/solarstone-launches-patented-framing-kit-for-bipv-market/,"SPONSORED,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Solarstone launches patented framing kit for BIPV market,"Nordics-based Solarstone has launched a patented universal aluminum framing kit, called Click-on, for the building-integrated PV (BIPV) market that it says essentially renders any solar panel into a two-in-one weatherproof roofing material without the need for additional sublayers.
“The Click-on Full Solar Roof concept tackles the main issues BIPV has been facing – compatibility and complexity of installation,” says Solarstone, adding that the kit does not require any screws or adhesives to combine with standard PV modules.
The kit can be easily mounted on-site and, together with the use of aluminum non-active “dummy” modules, even the most complex rooftop configurations can be handled with ease, it says. The two-in-one system has also been successfully tested against fire, wind uplift, and snow-load.
The solution is said to be “the most cost-effective BIPV solution on the market” and Solarstone aims to install 10,000 full solar roofs over the next few years in its goal to attain global BIPV market leadership in the fast-growing retrofit and new-build solar rooftop segments.
Currently, just 10% of the EU-built stock (130 million units) has been upgraded to meet climate change targets and efficiency standards, says Solarstone, meaning there are significant opportunities for installing solar roofs on retrofits and new-builds in both the residential and non-residential sector throughout the EU.
The Click-on kit has “major advantages” over conventional integrated and on-roof solar installations including:
Non-active PV modules (‘dummies’) can be easily integrated into the roof perimeter, areas with permanent shading, and positions with fixed obstacles (chimneys, skylights, ventilation outlets, snow barriers, etc.), says Solarstone.

It explains that the dummy modules are made from aluminum honeycomb panels and are framed with the same Click-on technology. “Active and non-active modules blend naturally with the overall concept of a modern solar roof. Special transition flashings are available to accommodate regular roofing material if passive aluminum modules are not the first choice,” it says.
Amongst other top solar manufacturers like Longi, Solarstone has joined forces with FuturaSun which recently launched a new series of colored PV modules.

“Combining new, exciting PV modules with Click-on framing kit we can now deliver various combinations alongside the full black solar roof experience, providing architects and city planners yet another viable alternative to conventional solutions,” concludes the company.

Mark Phillips, prime minister of the South American nation which struck oil a little over two years ago, told an energy conference last week the country would deploy natural gas, hydro and solar power over the next five years, before phasing out heavy fuel oil, expanding wind farm generation capacity and deploying a second big hydro project between 2027 and 2032.
An article reporting the comments for the government's Department for Public Information on Thursday stated that, after 2032, the nation's energy transition would hinge on “the continued expansion of those projects using new technology.” It is not clear whether that referred to only wind and hydro or would also include gas and solar.
Phillips, speaking at the conference in the capital, Georgetown, said more than 500MW of new power generation capacity would be built over the next five years. It was confirmed that figure would include a planned 300MW gas plant and the 165MW Amaila Falls hydro project.
The prime minister said the government had budgeted GY$1.1 billion (US$5.04 million) for solar projects and mini hydro facilities away from populous coastal zones in the off-grid hinterland of the country.
Those plans presumably include the tender for 13 solar arrays on government buildings inland with an unspecified total generation capacity. A pre-bid online meeting is due to be held on Friday with developers having until March 24 to submit bids, which will be opened on that date.
The PM also told the energy conference, which closed on Friday, the government would trial electric vehicle fast charging in three of the country's 10 regions. The areas of the Essequibo Islands-West Demerara; Demerara-Mahaica – which includes Georgetown; and East Berbice-Corentyne, are all coastal.

The modules are manufactured with CIGS solar cells provided by US manufacturer Miasolé and have a power conversion efficiency of 17.6%.
“We are currently planning to set up a manufacturing facility in Mandelieu, near Cannes, together with our partner Soy PV, which is a new French CIGS platform for the manufacture of CIGS cells with electrolytic deposition,” Solar Cloth's CEO, Alain Janet, told pv magazine. “The new production unit should be operational in April, with a capacity of 20 MW.”

The panels measure 1400 x 820mm and weigh 1.5 kg/m². The products are described by the manufacturers as rollable and extremely flexible modules, which do not contain breakable silicon or glass. “CIGS has a low carbon footprint of 12g to 20g CO2/kWh, and its recycling process has low impact and high value,” the manufacturer claims.
The module is also said to be adaptable to all kinds of textiles and was recently used for several tent lodges at the Paradise Springs California resort in the United States. The panels were deployed with a west-east orientation on both slopes of the tent lodges and connected to a battery with a capacity of 75Ah.
According to Solar Cloth, each of the tent lodges can now use on average 1,300 Wh per day and power a fridge, three portable lights, one lamp in the bathroom, one in the main room, a computer, three mobile phones, and other minor applications for a total output of 379 W.
“Solar Cloth participated last month in a European call for tenders, joining a consortium for the development of the perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells,” Janet stated, referring to the latest steps the company has taken to further scale up its module technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/22/polysilicon-price-reaches-39-3-kg-the-highest-since-2011/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Polysilicon price reaches $39.3/kg — the highest since 2011,"The global solar industry's supply chain issues that have been triggered by the Covid-19 crisis may continue during 2022 and the expected price drop for polysilicon and solar products may not materialize.
This is, at least, the outlook of Chinese solar module manufacturer JinkoSolar, which in a statement to pv magazine said the polysilicon and international freight costs may stay elevated for a few years before normalizing again.
“The latest announced price of solar-grade polysilicon jumped 10% month-to-month on Tuesday, February 15, sitting at 249RMB/kg (39.3US$/kg), the highest since 2011,” the manufacturer stated. “It’s up more than 400% since the start of June 2020 and 280% YoY growth. It is opposite to most predictions that polysilicon costs will decline in 2022.”
The price indicated by JinkoSolar includes value-added tax (VAT).
According to the panel maker, polysilicon producers are currently recording very high margins, which make them reluctant to reduce prices. “The lasting shortage gives a renewal excuse for polysilicon makers to keep the price at a high level, and the pricing environment for solar modules is continuously nervous after China’s Spring Festival,” it further explained. “Strong demand and the effect on inflation jointly create a destructive mix in the solar industry.”
The company also claims that the current polysilicon shortage will push module manufacturers to reduce silicone consumption per wattage and seek to increase efficiency, in an effort to further reduce costs. “Adopting higher power and higher efficiency technology and products could be the only possible way for downstream project developers as well as cell/module producers to navigate the risk of logistics and raw material price fluctuation,” it emphasized, noting that efficiencies over 22% may become crucial to achieving economies of scale benefits and a reasonable LCOE in large scale projects.
*The article was updated on February 24 to specify that the polysilicon price indicated by JinkoSolar includes value-added tax (VAT). Polysilicon prices outside China are usually indicated without VAT.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/22/roth-100mw-of-modules-detained-in-the-us-under-hoshine-wro-released/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",ROTH: 100MW of modules detained in the US under Hoshine WRO released,"From pv magazine USA
Hundreds of detained shipping containers housing roughly 100MW of LONGi solar modules have been released, reports ROTH Capital Partners in an industry note.
On top of the 100MW of LONGi modules released, ROTH also believes that Trina has had the vast majority of its detained product released, if not all of it entirely.
The modules were originally detained under the Withhold Release Order (WRO) applied to silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. (Hoshine) and its subsidiaries, which was instituted after Customs and Border Patrol identified two indicators of forced labor during its investigation of Hoshine.
The action was taken under Section 1307 of the Tariff Act. Section 1307 prohibits the importation of merchandise mined, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by forced or indentured labor, including forced child labor. Such merchandise is subject to exclusion and seizure, and may lead to criminal investigation of the imported goods.
ROTH believes that LONGi may still have more detained product, and the outlook following the release has been mixed, with the industry note describing the release as “a step forward toward more product for utility scale projects that are desperately needing modules.”
Just how big of a step it will be still has yet to be determined. ROTH believes this month’s round of anti-circumvention cases being filed against Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and now Cambodia casts a shadow over the ability for LONGi and Trina to actually restart their facilities in SE Asia and to ship to the U.S.
One of the signers of the most recent petition, Auxin Solar, claims that Chinese manufacturers are shipping cells to the aforementioned countries to avoid paying tariffs that have been in place since 2012.
ROTH said under this case, all crystalline-silicon modules from each of the four countries could be subject to a tariff. Unlike the first case, this one is designed to be focused on entire countries, rather than specific companies. This new petition adds Cambodia, as Auxin claimed Chinese companies were moving operations to the country in anticipation of tariffs. Historically, Cambodia contributes less than 3% of all US C-Si module imports.
ROTH also outlines that remaining uncertainty over how the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act will be implemented only compounds the difficulty for  LONGi and Trina to re-establish their manufacturing and shipping processes for the US market. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would ban all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labor, a time-consuming and costly process.
