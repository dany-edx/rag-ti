The company said the site would host the world’s largest electrolyzer facility. “Stage one is the AU$114 million (US$83 million) electrolyzer facility, which will be expanded as current demand indications crystalize,” said Foretscue. “The GEM has several growth stages already planned into its factory footprint, which includes green manufacturing technology such as cables, batteries, wind turbines and solar panels.” The company added, the electrolyzer facility will have “an initial capacity of two gigawatts per annum – more than doubling current global production and enough to produce more than 200,000 tons of green hydrogen each year.” Fortescue wants to make 15 million tons of green hydrogen per year by 2030. The first electrolyzers will be manufactured at the facility in early 2023. They will be used in Queensland at the company’s planned green-hydrogen-to-ammonia project on Gibson Island.
A research team in South Korea has synthesized metal nanoparticles it says can “drastically” improve the performance of hydrogen fuel cell catalysts. The Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) team synthesized nanoparticles by a physical method, rather than chemical reactions. The researchers used sputtering, a thin-metal-film deposition technology used in semiconductor manufacturing. “The KIST research team synthesized a platinum-cobalt-vanadium alloy nanoparticle catalyst using this technology and applied [it] for the oxygen reduction reaction in hydrogen fuel cell electrodes,” wrote the academics in a paper published in Nano Today. “As a result, the catalyst activity was seven and three times higher than [for] platinum, and platinum-cobalt alloy catalysts that are commercially used as catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells, respectively.”
After completing a pre-feasibility study on the Pedirka Blue Hydrogen project in Australia's Northern Territory, Hexagon Energy Materials has said Western Australia is the area offering the company the best opportunities for clean hydrogen production, and added, the use of ammonia as a hydrogen carrier is more commercially viable than liquid hydrogen. Nearby infrastructure such as ports and CO2 storage facilities are crucial elements to make projects commercially attractive. “Locating the hydrogen plant adjacent to feedstock supply is also critical to minimizing raw material logistics costs and, as a result, commercial returns,” wrote Hexagon yesterday. “Low cost access to local process water supply and infrastructure impacts commercial returns.” The Australian company will announce more details of its hydrogen project in Western Australian in the coming week.
Germany is opening its second hydrogen diplomacy office in Saudi Arabia.”The offices are tasked with providing expertise as well as analyses of the local and regional impact of the transformation,” the German Foreign Ministry wrote on Sunday. “Another key part of their role is to build ties between decision-makers, experts and companies from both countries. The offices are established in cooperation with [state-owned development entity] the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and supplement existing energy partnerships.”
UK-based maritime classification society Lloyd’s Register has awarded approval-in-principle status to Norwegian shipping company Egil Ulvan Rederi for its zero-emission, self-discharging hydrogen-fueled bulk carrier, With Orca. “The vessel is planned to enter into a long-term transport contract with cargo owners Felleskjøpet Agri and Heidelberg Cement,” Lloyd's wrote today. The vessel will be powered by hydrogen, stored onboard in compressed form. “It will also have a fuel cell system for energy production in low load conditions,” said Lloyd's. “A significant part of the energy required to operate the 88m/5,500 ton vessel will be harvested directly from the wind through two large rotor sails.” The craft, which is scheduled to enter operation in early 2024, will be able to store excess energy in batteries.
The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) has said renewable electrolysis needs policy and financial support to become economically viable. In the white paper published last week, the ICCT focused on the cost of renewable hydrogen produced at European refueling stations. “Even our optimistic estimate of €6/kg hydrogen is significantly higher than the 2030 target of €1.80/kg announced by the president of the European Commission,” wrote ICCT’s Yuanrong Zhou and Stephanie Searle. They said the industry could advance down the price curve 10 years with a €3/kg hydrogen subsidy. “This subsidy amount can enable cost parity, from a fuel-cost perspective, of on-site electrolysis renewable hydrogen and diesel before 2030,” wrote the authors of the white paper.
Shell Global Solutions International has awarded Houston-based engineer KBR a contract to provide professional services for hydrogen liquefaction developments. “KBR will provide technical solutions as part of concept studies to advance technology for large scale hydrogen liquefaction – an alternative method for long distance renewable energy transport,” said Shell yesterday. “Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) also provides a versatile energy solution for a wide variety of end uses including mobility, power generation, [and] industrial and domestic heat as well as molecular end-use markets.”

Renewables plants have not generated power for the Ukrainian grid since state-owned electricity transmission system operator Ukrenergo ordered them to be powered down on Thursday, for a three-day trial of running the grid in isolation from the power systems of Russia and Belarus.
That grid isolation exercise was part of a plan to eventually link the Ukrainian grid with the pan-European network overseen by EU body the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, a DTEK spokesperson said.
After the trial concluded, on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy decided to continue to operate the national grid in isolation mode, meaning renewables facilities in the nation had to remain powered down.
However, DTEK told pv magazine today that restriction has begun to be lifted, for the first time since Russia invaded the country a week ago, with the spokesperson stating: “As of the morning of March 1, DTEK RES [Renewables] solar power plants Trifonovskaya, Nikopolskaya, [and] Pokrovskaya [have begun] to gain load and supply electricity to the grid due to the gradual lifting of restrictions by NPC [National Power Company] Ukrenergo.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/01/satellite-cyber-attack-paralyzes-11gw-of-german-wind-turbines/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",MARIAN WILLUHN,"MARCH 1, 2022",Satellite cyber attack paralyzes 11GW of German wind turbines,"From pv magazine Germany.
German wind turbine operators have reportedly been confronted with a fault in the satellite connection of their systems. Dominik Bertrams, MD of wind farm operator Tobi Windenergie Verwaltungs GmbH, yesterday announced on Twitter the remote monitoring and control of thousands of wind turbines had failed.
With the outage having occurred between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. on Thursday – when the Russian army invaded Ukraine – Bertrams suspected a cyber attack by Russian hackers. The reason for the failure has not yet been clarified.
It would appear unlikely, however, Russian hackers directly targeted German wind turbines. Commenting on the incident to the Handelsblatt business newspaper, a spokesperson for the German Wind Energy Association said the disruption was due to the failure of the KA-Sat communication satellite belonging to Viasat. An article in weekly news magazine Der Spiegel stated the US military's military communications services also run through Viasat satellites.
Those reports would suggest failure of the wind turbine control systems could be the collateral damage from a cyber attack on a primarily military target.
The KA-Sat network is also used by satellite communication service provider Euroskypark. Wind turbines in areas without mobile network coverage use satellite-supported communication for control and remote monitoring. Euroskypark could not be reached for comment.
Bertrams initially estimated around 3,000 wind turbines could be affected by the incident. The Handelsblatt article said wind park operator Enercon had reported 5,800 of its turbines, with a total power output of 11 GW, used Euroskypark's communication channels.
German new energy industry body the Bundesverband Neue Energiewirtschaft told pv magazine, however, not many turbines had been affected by the problem and that most systems could fall back on other communications channels. The association said it had no knowledge of photovoltaic systems that might have been affected by the incident.
If communication breaks down, solar and wind plants automatically switch to a kind of “autopilot” operation.
Germany's Federal Office for Information Security updated its assessment of the cyber threat situation on Friday and activated the national IT crisis response center. Federal administrations, operators of critical infrastructure, organizations and companies have been advised “to increase vigilance and readiness to react.”

A 5.4MW solar site will be constructed at the Rosh Pinah zinc and lead mine in the Karas region of southern Namibia to supply energy to Rosh Pinah Zinc Corp, according to the state-owned Development Bank of Namibia (DBN) which announced it has financed the solar park.
pv magazine reported in April that the Canadian company which owns the mine, Trevali Mining Corp, had signed a power purchase agreement related to the solar park. A Rosh Pinah Zinc Corporation (Pty) Ltd business listed on LinkedIn is a warehousing company based in the same region as the mine and pv magazine has asked Trevali whether it is connected to Rosh Pinah Zinc.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

The solar project was announced on Saturday by the DBN, which said it had provided an unspecified amount of finance for the facility. The DBN did not reveal how the finance was structured for a solar project which is backed by a 15-year power purchase agreement, with the amount the energy offtaker will pay for the solar electricity also not mentioned.
The DBN press release, issued after the finance arrangement was signed on Friday, stated only that the solar project takes to almost NA$1.04 billion (US$67.5 million) the amount the state development bank has invested in renewable energy, as part of a commitment to back 13 clean energy projects with 87.9MW of total generation capacity.
The Rosh Pinah Solar Park is being developed by the local unit of South African renewables company Emesco Energy and will be constructed by Windhoek-based civil engineer Otesa Energy Projects. Those two businesses will own and operate the solar park with Otesa holding a majority stake, according to the DBN.
The bank said the solar panels would generate enough electricity to meet Rosh Pinah Zinc's power needs over the next 15 years as it expands operations. The facility will also help address a national deficit in generation capacity which, in December, saw Namibia generate 89GWh of electricity while importing 264GWh from neighboring South Africa and the Southern African Power Pool, which spans state utilities across 13 regional neighbors.
The DBN said the Rosh Pinah park is the second project financed under its climate adaptation facility.
Further north, the AfDB has pledged US$164 million to its new leveraging energy-access-finance framework (LEAFF), to speed the deployment of solar home systems, renewables-powered mini grids, and off-grid commercial and industrial solar arrays in Ghana, Guinea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tunisia.
The multilateral lender hopes to trigger private-sector investment in the program – including from commercial banks in the nations concerned, and in local currencies – for a total US$800 million of cheap loans to finance the off-grid solar systems.
The AfDB is essentially on-lending the money after the UN-established Green Climate Fund helped it develop the LEAFF initiative and provided US$171 million in low-cost loans for the idea in July.
Announcing the program, the AfDB said six million people and businesses would get access to electricity over the six years of the LEAFF scheme.

Germany-based electrolyzer manufacturer Enapter has unveiled a new electrolyzer that is said to be suitable for projects of all sizes via “plug-and-play” operation.
The EL 4.0 electrolyzer is the fourth generation of the patented anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer that the company has been developing since 2017. According to the manufacturer, its technology relies on cheaper materials than the competing proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Enapter's new product is lighter and smaller than previous models and is ISO 22734 certified. The standardized modules could be plugged together for projects of any size.
The AEM electrolyzer is available in four versions – AC, DC, air-cooled, or water-cooled. It is claimed to enable the production of 1.0785kg of high-purity hydrogen per day. The maximum power consumption is 3.0kW with water consumption of 0.4 liters per hour. The device measures 482x635x266mm and has a weight of 38kg.
In response to an inquiry from pv magazine about the cost of the electrolyzer, Enapter said that the new electrolyzer is not yet in mass production but can already offer a price reduction of up to 35% compared to the price of its previous module.” With the ramp-up of mass production in Germany, the costs for the production of green hydrogen would then fall below those for hydrogen from fossil fuels,” the spokesperson from the company stated.
The plug-and-play products could be used in a wide variety of applications, thus promoting decarbonization in the energy, transport, industry and building sectors. In addition, it is quick to install. “The EL 4.0 will be a building block for system integrators, enabling them to quickly introduce hydrogen production and realize the market ramp-up needed globally. We are sure that the future mass production of these AEM electrolyzers will fundamentally change the production of green hydrogen,” said Sebastian-Justus Schmidt, co-founder and CEO of Enapter.
*The article was amended to reflect that the maximum power consumption of the electrolyzer is 3kW and not 3W, as we previously reported.

The city government wants to replace almost all conventional garbage cans with the new devices in an effort to reduce garbage collection costs and carbon emissions. “This would mean a 94% reduction in emptying operations, compared to traditional bins, with a strong reduction of CO2 as a result of the reduction in the traffic of collection vehicles in squares and streets of the historic center,” it said in a statement.
The CleanCube cans were provided by Korean manufacturer Ecube Labs. “The baskets installed in Florence are the first generation of the CleanCube,” a spokesperson from Alia Servizi Ambientali SpA, the municipality environmental company, told pv magazine. “To date, there are 11 installed in the historic city center and another six will be installed shortly, in addition to the over 850 standard bins present in the area.”

Each solar-powered can has a capacity of 120 liters of compacted waste, which is equivalent to 600 liters of non-compacted waste. The bins rely on a 35W polycrystalline solar panel connected to a deep cycle battery with a capacity of 38Ah and a voltage of 12V. The battery in turn powers a 120W gear motor which increases the torque. The motor pushes a patented pantograph compactor with a force of 300kg that performs garbage compression.
A laser sensor measures the filling level of the can and communicates it, together with other operating parameters, through a 4G connection to the control software platform of Alia Servizi Ambientali SpA. “All the cans and sensors are connected to this platform providing, to those who manage the collection, a complete picture of the filling level of all devices,” the spokesperson further explained. “Finally, the software processes, and offers statistics relating to, the quantity and frequency of waste collected and the efficiency of the collection, as well as overfilling, for any set reference period.”
According to Ecube Labs website, the CleanCube cans are available in different sizes and capacities. The smallest device measures 500x 550×1,200mm and has a capacity of 100 liters. The largest can has dimensions of 670x770x1,600mm and a capacity of 240 liters.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/01/jinkosolar-tiger-neo-demonstrates-the-n-type-advantage/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"MARCH 1, 2022",JinkoSolar Tiger Neo demonstrates the n-type advantage,"Much has been written lately about the production of n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells, which in 2022 are set to become the first n-type cell technology seen in large, gigawatt-scale production.
The solar cells achieve higher efficiency than today’s standard PERC technology, thanks to better passivation and conductivity. JinkoSolar’s in-house developed TOPCon processing, “HOT 2.0” deposits a tunneling oxide layer and a carrier-selective microcrystalline silicon film on the rear side of the cell, which serves to improve passivation and conductivity while reducing sub-surface recombination. With this approach, JinkoSolar can already achieve cell efficiencies up to 25.4%, and an upper limit of 28.7% leaves plenty of room for improvements over the coming years.
Beyond efficiency, n-type cells also promise improvements in long-term performance, bifaciality, and high-temperature performance that all add up to more energy, a lower levelized cost of electricity, and a faster return on investment. With challenges in processing TOPCon cells resolved and modules ready to roll off the production line, the industry is keen to see whether all of the reported advantages will play out in the field. And with the Tiger Neo module, JinkoSolar is ready to demonstrate that they do.
Light-induced degradation and light elevated temperature induced degradation have been major challenges for p-type products, and still cause some level of performance loss in PERC modules being produced today. N-type’s inherently lower susceptibility to both mechanisms means lower degradation and a higher energy yield over the product lifetime.

For the Tiger Neo module, JinkoSolar calculates first-year degradation at 1%, and annual linear degradation thereafter at 0.4% – representing a 100% improvement to the first-year figure, and 37.5% on the linear degradation figure – compared to typical PERC figures of 2% first-year degradation and 0.55% annually. Taking a 100MW power station as an example, JinkoSolar calculates that with an average annual power generation of 168 million kWh/year, the TOPCon modules’ lower degradation would lead to an additional 16.8 million kWh generated in the first year, and an extra 61.5 million kWh over a 25-year project lifetime.
These degradation rates are covered by a 30-year linear warranty as well as a 12-year product warranty, meaning the Tiger Neo will retain at least 87.4% of its initial performance after 30 years in the field.
With module efficiencies of up to 22.3%, and module power outputs up to 620 W, JinkoSolar estimates that the Tiger Neo will generate up to 9% additional electricity than PERC modules over the same installation area.
And there’s more to it than just efficiency gains. With a temperature coefficient of -0.30%/°C, compared to a typical value of -0.35%/°C for p-type PERC, there are lower performance losses in high-temperature conditions. Based on a 100MW installation and a surface temperature of 40 C, Jinko calculated that the difference in temperature coefficient would lead to a 1.3 million kWh/year advantage for the Tiger Neo over p-type modules. Further, for the bifacial products in the Tiger Neo series, the company estimates a bifaciality factor of 85%, compared to 70% for p-type, which would create a 3.4 million kWh/year advantage for the n-type product, again based on a 100MW installation using trackers.
While many of the earliest projects to incorporate n-type modules have targeted hot, arid climates to best take advantage of the better temperature coefficient, Jinko also notes that the increased bifaciality of the Tiger Neo also makes it a better choice for snowy regions – since it can better take advantage of the high reflectivity and generate more power while the front side is temporarily covered.
These and other advantages, for example keeping the module width below 1.2 meters so that it can be carried by a single installer, translate to a lower levelized cost of electricity, which Jinko has been able to demonstrate in projects from small residential and commercial rooftops all the way up to power plants in the hundred-megawatt range.
Analyzing a 30kW rooftop project in Liaocheng, China, Jinko first found that by requiring fewer modules to reach the planned capacity, the initial cost for the installation was reduced by around CNY 2500 ($395) and that compared to a similar system with p-type modules, the rooftop would generate an additional 2-5 kWh per day depending on the climate, amounting to 18,222 kWh over a 20-year lifetime. And for a larger commercial rooftop, a 500kW installation in Hebei Province, China, Jinko’s analysis found that the Tiger Neo’s bifacial advantage could lead to a 21% increase in rear side generation, allowing the system owner to reach payback in just three years.
The advantage plays out in the large-scale sector as well, according to JinkoSolar’s calculations: Analysis of a two-in-portrait tracker project in Saudi Arabia showed that compared to a 60-cell, p-type module incorporating 210mm cells, the Tiger Neo would achieve a 2.8% reduction in BOS costs and a 6.2% reduction in LCOE. For a larger, 66 cell module incorporating the same technologies, the Tiger NEO still retains a 0.40% advantage in BOS costs and a 4.94% reduction in LCOE over the lifetime of the project.

A leading renewable energy expert has warned that if the current negotiations between the two countries end up being a dead-end, the conflict may change the energy landscape of Europe and possibly of the world for long into the future.
“This is wartime and wartime requires war economy measures,” LUT professor of solar economy, Christian Breyer, told pv magazine. “Preparation for the worst case is mandatory in such a situation, as rational decision making on the Russian side cannot be expected anymore. As long as the energy is still delivered the case is severe, but not yet the worst-case scenario. Whenever the Russian side would stop the energy exports, then they may never come back.”
Breyer stressed that there are few reference points for the current situation, which is a core characteristic of a wartime economy – where stability lies at the core of decision making. He said that at a minimum, high energy costs should be expected, with fossil gas prices higher than €100/MWh and crude oil of higher than $100/barrel.
“For a short period of time some higher coal-based electricity generation may have to be accepted for balancing some lack of fossil gas,” Breyer said. “On the full value chain greenhouse gas emissions including methane emissions of natural gas the overall effect may be not that strong, as the direct methane leakage is often neglected, while the higher overall air pollution of coal with heavy metal emissions is an additional price to be paid.”
Breyer added that the scheduled phase-out of the remaining nuclear power plants in Germany should not be on the table since massive investments for the prolongation of their operation due to security issues would have to be considered. In contrast, he advised investing in options such as rapidly adding wind electricity, more heat pumps, more solar PV, and more battery-electric vehicles. “All these options substitute gas and oil imports which may be at risk in the worst-case scenario.”
The crisis, according to the professor's first estimates, may last for years, if there is no change on the side of the aggressor. “With a return to peace the most severe threats of the crisis may be removed as well, however, the present situation may lead to preparation for the worst-case. In such a scenario, the distortion would remain for several years, and the only real solution for the short-, mid-, and long-term would be a massive emergency ramping of renewables,” said Breyer. “The biomass-based waste, residues and by-products shall be checked for biogas and biomethane conversion, as this can substitute fossil gas directly, using the existing infrastructure. Some extra fossil LNG imports may be not avoided right now, however, newly build capacity shall be constructed in a way that they could be easily switched to e-ammonia, e-methanol, or e-kerosene, as these are the bulk fuels and chemicals which will be required for the long term.”
According to Breyer, measures to address the looming energy crisis should be taken for the entire European Union. “There would be the chance to deploy between 50 and 100 GW of wind and between 75 and 150 GW of solar in a very short time,” he stated. “This requires full capacity utilization of all value chain elements, and massive further manufacturing expansion. It will also require capital inflow, and guarantees for several years that the output is taken up by respective projects, driven by energy security policies.” The impact of additional wind electricity, solar PV and in combination with heat pumps will be the substitution of fossil gas-based electricity generation but also a direct substitution of fossil gas for space heating with such additional electricity to be used for heat pumps, not in all but many European countries.
Extremely fast ramping would be required for an effort of such a scale and would also require turbo speed wartime permissions for projects. “We know that many projects are in the project development since many years, thus they could be well accelerated,” Breyer went on to say, noting that emergency permits are now known from the pandemic and may be used currently for avoiding cold buildings in the upcoming winters. “The ramped annually newly built capacities are required for several years on such high levels, so that extra imports of fossil LNG can be reduced again,” he added. “We are talking about wartime measures.”
Grid expansion should also be accelerated and hybrid tenders for wind and solar plus storage should be implemented, so that grid congestions can be further reduced with batteries. Developers should be helped minimize risk through project financing, clear income steams with clear premium fees, contracts for differences, feed-in tariffs, tenders, so that the income risk can be minimized. “Massive political backing is required to get the permitting, manufacturing and financing ramped,” Breyer emphasized. “We also need battery manufacturing, chips, and faster manufacturing for EV batteries, and in particular a massive expansion of heat pumps manufacturing, with the exchange of gas and oil boilers not only in individual buildings but also in district heating.”
Heat pumps may be the real game-changing factor, according to Breyer. “We need huge amounts of heat pumps across Europe,” he highlighted. “There may be adaptations required, as in older buildings higher temperature levels are required as in new buildings. This may be not fully possible by heat pumps, so heat pumps and electric boilers in combination may be required. For demand flexibility, a combination with thermal energy storage may be required, as we learned from oil and wood boilers. However, a ramping up of the heat pump industry on a much larger scale will be required.”
Yesterday, the German government announced dedicated actions to accelerate renewable energy ramping, and a 100% renewable electricity target by 2035, based on a broad set of measures addressing all energy demand. “This implies a mid-decade target of at least 10 GW per year of new wind onshore, 20 GW per year of new solar PV, plus wind offshore, and the legal upgrade of renewables as important for the public interests and security,” Breyer concluded. “Let’s hope that many countries draw comparable conclusions.”

“The price of silicon wafers, the main material used in photovoltaic manufacturing, has risen dramatically due to the global silicon shortage,” the company said in a statement released. “The prices of other materials such as high transparency glass escalated in addition to logistics costs which placed severe pressure on its business revenue.”
It also explained that price increases have been avoided for a long time through cost reduction. “However, the measures reached the limit and thus Kaneka could not help but to make price revision to steadily provide photovoltaic products to the market,” the manufacturer stated.
The new prices will apply to Kaneka's all residential and non-residential photovoltaic products.
According to the Kaneka website, the company sells different types of thin-film modules for utility scale projects and building-integrated PV installations, as well as modules for electricity-generating windows and walls.
The company currently holds the world's highest conversion efficiency of 26.63% for a practical size (180 cm2) crystalline silicon solar cell.

This technique consists of enhancing the cell's electromagnetic field through metal nanostructures, which in turn improves the device's low optical absorption in the visible spectrum.
“The cell was conceived for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) but it also can be considered for cars and smart glasses,” the research's corresponding author, Lioz Etgar, told pv magazine.
The device was built with an ultra-thin, semi-transparent, triple-cation perovskite film and gold nanorods (Au NRs) that are able to produce strong resonance peaks near the bandgap of the perovskite. “The longer wavelength absorption is commonly compensated in a very thin perovskite film; thus, having plasmonic resonance around these wavelengths should help reduce it,” the research group explained. “The synthesis of Au NRs includes capping, using protection layers to stabilize Au from agglomeration.”
The scientists bought the organic cations from Australian manufacturer GreatCell solar, the lead compounds were purchased from German provider TCI, and the spiro chemicals – with 99.9% purity – and other compounds came from Germany-based Sigma-Aldrich. “The Au NR synthesis was conducted based on the seed-mediated method in an aqueous solution using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the ligands,” they stated. “In order to use the Au NRs on top of the perovskite film, it is essential to transfer them to a suitable organic solvent that does not harm the perovskite. Therefore, the Au NRs were transferred to organic medium using tetraoctylamonium bromide (TOAB), which functions as the ligand.”
Through this Au NR post-deposition treatment on the perovskite film, the researchers were able to optimize its morphology without significant changes in the grain size. They also achieved a thickness of only 200nm for the film, which compares to around 500-700nm in typical high-efficiency perovskite films. “The Au NR treatment improves the perovskite/hole-transporting material (HTM) interface by passivating defects at this interface, which results in better charge transport and reduction of charge accumulation,” they emphasized.
The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 13.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 1,097.1mV, a short-circuit current of 17.11mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 73.12%. The device also showed an average visible transmittance (AVT) of around 27% and enhanced stability over 1,000h.
The cell was presented in the paper “Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cells with > 13% Efficiency and 27% Transparency Using Plasmonic Au Nanorods,” published in ACS Publications. The research team includes scientists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in Israel, and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU Singapore), in Singapore. “We are currently in negotiations to establish a spin-off company for the production of semi-transparent perovskite cells for BIPV,” Etgar stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/01/akuo-speaks-out-on-recent-fire-accident-at-its-17mw-floating-pv-plant-in-france/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,FRANCE",MARIE BEYER,"MARCH 1, 2022",Akuo speaks out on recent fire accident at its 17MW floating PV plant in France,"From pv magazine France
Inaugurated in October 2019 in Piolenc in the Vaucluse department in the southeastern French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, the O'Mega 1 power plant is one of the largest floating photovoltaic installations in Europe and Akuo's first project based on this technology. It has a capacity of 17MW which should be increased to 22MW within a few months thanks to the “O’Mega 1 bis” extension project, currently under construction on the site.
On Jan. 30, 2022, under the effect of a storm coming from the North Sea, a fire broke out on the installation. A little less than a month after the incident, Akuo has revealed the first conclusions of the analysis it carried out internally. pv magazine was able to visit the installation to see the damage and the solutions put in place by the developer.
 
At the end of January 2022, the body of water where the installation is located was exposed for several days to violent winds blowing up to 80km/h in gusts. Under the effect of the swell and repeated friction, the cables connecting the modules to the junction boxes became bare, causing a short circuit on one of the three-panel floaters of the power plant. The affected inverters were shut-off but three floats ignited.
The smoke released by the fire alerted some passers by who called the fire department. Once on site, intervention was not possible for safety reasons related to the conditions of the fire, which came from an electrical source in an aqueous environment. At this point, Akuo manually and completely shut down the plant from the point of delivery. At this time, the three floats on which the cables were placed were already submerged, although retained by the structure. The fire went out. Following the incident, the intact parts of the facility – around 15MW of the 17MW – were returned to service.
Maintenance teams quickly identified the source of the fire. Indeed, traces of wear on the cables that connect the modules to the transmission terminals had been observed since October 2021. Akuo admitted to having underestimated the effect of wear in the medium term and underestimated the weather risks. In detail, when the site teams became aware of the friction of the cables, the priority was to integrate the adjustments on the new 5MW unit currently under construction. 
The adjustments in question are quite simple. Sheath security was added to the cables to protect the metal structure on which they rest. “The problem has more to do with supplying and resizing all the cables than with changing the technology,” explained Raphaël Chevrier, director of solar asset management at Akuo and director of the O'Mega 1 site. To that was added the extent of the work to be carried out, since the operation involves removing all the cables from the site and, as a result, that solution was not considered immediately. Because of that, the wear continued, more heavily than had been estimated and, during the high winds at the end of January, the rupture took place.
Stable weather will also be necessary to allow these operations to be finalized as soon as possible. Said works should begin almost in line with the commissioning of the O'Mega 1 bis extension, by the end of the first half of 2022. In the meantime, the damaged fraction of the plant should quickly be put back into service. “We are doing everything we can to repair with the current conditions which are unfavorable to us, whether in terms of the weather or electricity supply problems at the moment,” Chevrier stated.
The floating Hydrelio technology, initially supplied by Ciel et Terre and under license from Akuo since 2016, is not in question. On the contrary. Rather, it is about adapting maintenance needs and becoming familiar with large scale floating PV to more effectively deploy this model in the future. Asked about the operating costs of a floating installation, Raphaël Chevrier estimates that they are “roughly equivalent to a rooftop installation”.

India added 10GW of new solar capacity in 2021, up 210% from the 3.2GW installed in 2020, according to a newly released report by Mercom India Research.
Large-scale solar projects accounted for 83% of all PV installations, up 230% year on year. Rooftop solar installations accounted for the remaining 17%, said Mercom India Research.
A significant number of 2020 projects were delayed until 2021 due to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's pandemic-related project timeline extensions. This boosted overall capacity additions in 2021. India’s cumulative installed PV capacity reached approximately 49 GW at the end of December.
The Mercom India Research report predicts strong PV growth for this year, despite module supply constraints due to the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) mandate. It identifies basic customs duties and rising component prices as the key challenges for the industry on the supply side.
“Demand outlook for 2022 is strong, but significant challenges await the industry, beginning with the basic customs duty, import restrictions, and the goods and services tax on top of global supply chain issues, and high component prices. Challenges aside, the Indian solar market has significant growth potential and is only just starting to take off,” said Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer of Mercom Capital Group.
The report noted that average project costs rose in 2021 due to higher module costs, raw material prices, and freight charges. Average large-scale project costs increased 21.6% year on year in the fourth quarter – the highest increase recorded in the past 10 years. Average rooftop solar costs in the fourth quarter rose 14.8% year on year.

Poseidon Marine H2 is owned and funded by Liberty Energy Capital, the fund behind many of Australia’s hydrogen vehicle plays, including H2X and Aviation H2. Poseidon H2, its marine unit, has brought in two engineers, Peter Mastalir and Kevin Morgan from consultancy Dynamic Efficiency, to “lead the development of an emissions-free pleasure craft.”
The company says the pair are now looking at taking the hull of an existing pleasure craft and “redesigning” it.
“Initially, we will be following a rigorous 10-month research and development process, then commence building the most commercially viable option,” Mastalir said. “We intend to use existing technologies as much as possible, which is why we are looking to use an existing hull design with a unique upper deck and internal layout.”
Poseidon H2 is owned by Liberty Energy Capital, an Australian investment firm with “significant positions” in 18 hydrogen-focused companies. Its investments include H2X Global, Patriot Hydrogen, Aviation H2, Sweetman Renewables, Verdant Earth Technologies, and Port Anthony Renewables Limited.
Liberty Energy Capital’s portfolio is heavy on biomass-to-hydrogen projects. It holds stakes in almost every company with biomass-based projects in Australia. Biomass is not a zero-emissions technology.
In November, Liberty Energy Capital’s Aviation H2 unit said it had appointed a team of engineers to fast-track the building of Australia’s first hydrogen-fueled airplane, which is set to fly by 2023.
Poseidon H2, meanwhile, seems to be aiming its hydrogen-fueled boat at ordinary consumers. It has described its design as a pleasure craft. That said, many have questioned the potential market acceptance of consumer hydrogen vehicles because they tend to be less efficient and more expensive that electric alternatives. Liberty Energy Capital is nonetheless backing them, with H2X very much focusing on consumer cars in its current vehicle rollout, which is expected to continue unveiling new models throughout this year.
“Our number one goal is to build a better boat, it just happens to be that it will be powered by hydrogen. The brief is to ensure it has an equivalent operational range, requires less maintenance and is cheaper to run than traditional fuel sources like diesel,” said Mastalir.
The company said it is confident that it will be able to create a model that allows for a new top to be seamlessly installed onto a repurposed hull. Once commercialized, it said it will lead to “quick uptake by significant players,” as the “majority of the infrastructure for a carbon-free boat is already at hand.”
Mastalir and Morgan have both been appointed to Poseidon H2’s board.

Hecate Energy is developing a 50MW solar project in New Mexico, set to be fit with a 20MW/80MWh Honeywell-designed battery energy storage system (BESS). The project, located in the northern part of the state, is expected to power 16,000 New Mexican homes throughout the year.
Honeywell’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) BESS is integrated with an Experion Energy control system, a battery management platform that integrates with asset monitoring, distributed energy resource management, supervisory control, and analytics functionality. These capabilities will help Hecate Energy to forecast and optimize energy costs.
The company said the storage system has a four-hour round-trip efficiency of 98%. The battery management system has three levels of safety, at cell, module and rack level. Forced air HVAC and optional liquid cooling manage heat for the battery.
Honeywell’s BESS segment serves commercial and industrial operators, independent power producers, and utilities. The BESS can be scalable from 500kWh to 4GWh. The company also deploys integrated SCADA solutions for solar plant operation and maintenance, and microgrid control systems.
Performance and outcome-based guarantees back the BESS. Honeywell guarantees predictable and consistent costs and improved uptime. The system enables “revenue stacking” capabilities, participating in multiple activities, like peak shaving, backup power generation, and demand response programs.
“We chose Honeywell for this landmark project because of their depth of knowledge and decades of expertise,” said Alex Pugh, project manager for Hecate Energy. 
The project comes in pursuit of the Public Service Company of New Mexico’s (PNM) decarbonization goals. Earlier in February, PNM released its integrated resource plan, which aims for zero-carbon emissions by 2040. The plan builds on previously announced strategies for an accelerated phase-out from coal-fired generation, which is set to take place by 2024.
