https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/09/zinc-ion-batteries-for-residential-applications/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,AUSTRIA,EUROPE,SWEDEN",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",Zinc-ion batteries for residential applications,"Enerpoly has developed configurable, modular zinc-ion batteries for stationary storage applications. They are suitable for short- to medium-duration storage applications of two to 10 hours.
Its 3 kWh battery packs weigh 60 kilograms and measure 800 mm x 177 mm x 432 mm. They operate in the temperature range of -10 C to 50 C. The nominal voltage stands at 48 V, with a nominal capacity of 60 Ah. The battery packs have a maximum charge/discharge power of 2.8 kW, with 1.4 kW of continuous power.
Enerpoly’s technology uses zinc metal as the anode and manganese dioxide as the cathode, with a water-based electrolyte. Its proprietary battery cells are built with a prismatic form factor.
It claims that the technology is safer, without the possibility of thermal runaway. The Swedish startup says it has passed all safety standards and notes that it has tested its batteries against the UL 9540A standard.
Now, Enerpoly is partnering with Austrian PV startup EET (Efficient Energy Technology) on the “ZincMate” project. The say that their goal is “to drive the development and commercialization of an energy storage device that can be installed in all European households.”
The project partners have secured €870,000 ($937,000) in grant funding under the Eurostars-3 program, which originated from Vinnova and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). The total project budget is €1.74 million.
The companies will produce ZincMate prototypes of a plug-in storage system with rechargeable zinc batteries. The technical basis for ZincMate is EET's on-grid technology, in combination with Enerpoly's cost-effective batteries. EET makes photovoltaic systems with energy storage that can be set up on a balcony and plugged into a wall outlet, so homeowners and tenants can produce their own renewable electricity.
EET, founded in 2017, is said to be the only company producing storage devices that can be installed by amateurs, without the help of technicians. EET’s innovation core for the SolMate device is an integrated and patented measurement technology that can assess the energy demand of a household via a power outlet connection. This eliminates the need for further installation or connection to a household’s electric grid.
“Currently, EET’s SolMate device is equipped with a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery and it’s obvious that battery technology needs to improve,” says Christoph Grimmer, CEO of EET. “Moving to zinc-ion technology for residential applications is the next step in the right direction.”
The batteries developed under the ZincMate partnership will be tested in both laboratory and home environments, including apartments, small living spaces, and shared housing. The project will start this year and run for two years.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/09/tongwei-adds-solar-modules-to-its-pv-powerhouse/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",ECKHART GOURAS,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",Tongwei adds solar modules to its PV powerhouse,"According to Joe Chen, Head of Asia Pacific & MENA for Tongwei Solar (TW Solar), the company announced last year that it was entering the module business to add solar panels to its broad range of PV products. With its push into the modules business, TW Solar is, in the words of Chen, “the only module maker in the top 10 to have its own polysilicon. That is our advantage.”
And it’s a big advantage, since TW Solar can pass on its command of polysilicon to its customers in the form of more predictability when it comes to module pricing. With polysilicon prices fluctuating widely in the past year, this ability to effectively shield the customer from large price swings can be a big benefit to customers who are trying to avoid price shocks as they bid on large projects in very competitive markets like utility-scale solar in the Middle East.
Chen said large players like ACWA Power and Masdar had approached TW Solar at WFES to possibly tap the benefits that such a vertically integrated PV supply chain offers. And TW Solar is not simply vertically integrated with a PV product portfolio ranging from high-purity crystalline silicon to ultra-thin silicon wafers, high-efficiency solar cells, and now high-efficiency modules. It is in fact the world’s largest polysilicon manufacturer, with an annual production capacity of 230 kilotons (KT) covering three production bases in Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Yunnan in China.
The company is also the world’s largest cell manufacturer, with 70 GW of production capacity in place at the end of 2022. Its wafer production capacity amounts to 15 GW. Chen highlights the fact that there is “enough wafer capacity on the market” and that “we can buy from this market” to feed the 70 GW the company needs on the cell side.
Module production capacity stood at 15 GW at the end of 2022, a big jump from the 500 MW the company started with when it acquired Hefei LDK’s module-making business in 2013. According to Chen, that marked the beginning of TW Solar’s foray into the module business.
WFES, part of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, marked the first big opportunity to showcase the company’s module business at a leading international solar energy event, as MENA is an important target market for the Chengdu-based manufacturer. For large-scale PV power plants in the Middle East, TW Solar’s track record and cell and module technologies provide various benefits. Given its vertical integration, the manufacturer can offer both M10 and G12 cells. It can also offer a wide range of cell technologies from mono PERC to n-type TOPCon to heterojunction (HJT).
Chen sees n-type TOPCon becoming a key market for TW Solar in the Middle East, and the manufacturer can offer this product from April. Its n-type TOPCon bifacial module products will deliver up to 700 W of power, based on 66 G12 cells.
Chen points to TW Solar’s extensive experience in deploying bifacial panels in large-scale projects in mainland China. A company affiliate in the project business has installed more than 2 GW of projects annually over the past five years.
So far, all of TW Solar’s vast manufacturing footprint is based in mainland China. It already leads in polysilicon and cell production and its new goal is to become the world’s leader in module production within the next three years. To get there, it plans to ramp up module production from 15 GW per year currently to 80 GW in the course of this year, and more than 80 GW next year. This ramp-up will be accompanied by major ramp-ups further upstream, from 70 GW to 102 GW on the cell side in 2023, and between 130 GW and 150 GW in 2024. On the polysilicon side, it will ramp up from 230 KT to 350 KT in 2023, and to between to 800 KT and 1,000 KT in 2024. Given its strong cooperation with Longi and other wafer producers, wafer production capacity will remain constant at 15 GW per year.
While MENA offers a perfect environment for 700 W bifacial TOPCon modules, Chen is also keen to promote the “TW Solar” module brand in European PV markets – especially Germany, Spain, Holland and Poland. In these markets rooftop applications will feature prominently – a good fit for the company’s all-black modules. Other priority markets overseas are Australia and Brazil.
For these six key markets, TW Solar should have local offices in place by the third quarter of this year, on the back of strong brand-building activities. As Chen puts it: “So this year for overseas markets the most important thing is to show our brand, to let the market know who is TW Solar – what can TW Solar offer?”
There can be little doubt that the market will find out that TW Solar is one of the leading Chinese PV manufacturers, with a long track record in upstream manufacturing and PV technology. It already offers mass production n-type TOPCon and HJT modules with a 35 year product guarantee and control of a large spectrum of the PV supply chain. That level of control should prove enticing to customers outside of the Middle East as well.

It has not provided any details on the combined and individual capacity of the solar plants, nor has it revealed their locations. Interested developers have until March 31 to submit their bids.
The utility issued a similar tender in January 2022. However, it is unclear if the new tender builds on that procurement exercise, or simply replaces it.
Botswana also aims to deploy large-scale PV through several tenders. In addition, the Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security (MMGE) launched a net-metering scheme for rooftop PV systems in late 2020.
Solar energy is expected to help Botswana reduce its dependence on electricity imports from South Africa, as its neighbor is plagued by energy shortages due to an operational and financial crisis at national utility Eskom. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Botswana had just 6 MW of installed PV power by the end of 2021.

With the goal of a competitive battery ecosystem, the EU Strategic Action Plan on Batteries had already, in 2017, envisaged a new legislative setting. In December 2020, the European Commission announced a key element of the European Green Deal: a proposal for modernized EU battery rules.
After almost two years of discussion, the European Parliament and Council of Ministers in December agreed on changes to the original proposal and the EU Batteries Regulation will, after final approvals, likely enter force in the summer.
Europe has approximately 7% of global battery manufacturing capacity, but most materials extraction and processing is done elsewhere. Long-term battery supply chain investment, and research and innovation, will continue to depend on a predictable, clear, consistent regulatory framework. The regulation sets new rules for competitiveness.
Recharge has advocated for years for carbon footprint and social responsibility requirements and welcomes the regulation’s introduction of such measures. These provisions are supported by a level-playing-field approach and by transforming market drivers for consumers to purchase sustainable batteries. Carbon intensity and due diligence provisions have the potential to not only prevent under-performing batteries entering the EU but to work toward the bloc’s climate-neutrality and sustainability objectives. If correctly implemented, the carbon footprint and due diligence measures have an unsurpassed steering potential to push European competitiveness based on sustainability and responsibility.
Sustainability, in addition to cost and performance, can become the competitiveness criteria. If correctly implemented, the sustainability measures will set the rules for selling batteries in Europe. Effective enforcement and control of the provisions is key.
Batteries will now have to show their carbon footprint and eventually comply with a maximum threshold: it will first be applicable to electric vehicle (EV) batteries, with mandatory declaration from the end of next year. Performance classes to steer consumer choice will arrive in mid-2026, and high-carbon footprint EV batteries will be shut out by a maximum threshold from the end of 2027. CO2 reporting will be mandatory for industrial batteries from the end of 2025, for light means of transport (LMT) devices – such as e-bikes and scooters – from mid-2028, and for rechargeable industrial batteries, with external storage, from mid-2030.
Industrial, EV, starting, lighting, and ignition batteries – such as those used to start cars – will have to report how much recycled cobalt, lead, lithium, and nickel they contain from mid-2028 and will have to hit minimum targets from mid-2031. The same will apply to LMT devices from mid-2036. From 2027, industrial, EV, and LMT batteries will need a battery passport, accessible through a QR code linking to a unique identifier.
Companies with a turnover of at least €40 million ($43.6 million*) will have to conform to due diligence requirements on the sourcing of cobalt, lithium, nickel, and natural graphite from mid-2025 and address social and environmental risks linked to sourcing, processing, and trading raw and recycled materials.
Portable battery makers must collect 45% of their waste this year, rising to 73% by the end of the decade and the LMT battery targets are 51% by the end of 2028 and 61% three years later. Lithium batteries must hit a 65% recycling target, by average weight, by 2025; and 70% by 2031.
Commission guidance will be crucial to safely applying the removable and replaceability requirements enshrined in article 11 of the regulation, applicable from the end of 2026, and Recharge will make recommendations on how to achieve that.
Responsibility for ensuring batteries are correctly collected and recycled at the end of their life must be assigned to the correct actor along the supply chain. If the producer identified as liable for extended producer responsibility under the regulation is not the last operator supplying the product to a distributor or consumer, it could be impossible to correctly record how many products enter an EU member state market.
While the European battery manufacturing segment remains relatively small, round 800,000 jobs are expected this decade if Europe manages to increase its market share to 20%. To achieve the sector’s potential, we need robust implementation of the regulations. It will be important to carefully specify technical details to relevant articles in the upcoming secondary legislative process, and to clarify inconsistencies in the commission’s guidance document. Recharge will work with legislators on the broad package of implementing legislation and to translate ambition into meaningful rules.
The industry is prepared for discussion of the secondary regulation, potentially determining the feasibility and efficiency of the regulation. The commission’s Batteries Regulation proposal is an important milestone to delivering the Strategic Action Plan on Batteries. The test of the effectiveness of the new rules will come this year, when they are expected to come into force.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/09/dutch-parliament-approves-proposal-to-phase-out-net-metering/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",Dutch parliament approves proposal to phase out net metering,"The Dutch House of Representatives has approved a legal proposal submitted by Energy Minister Rob Jetten to phase out the country's net-metering scheme, with a narrow majority.
“Maintaining the net metering mechanism puts a brake on the long-term growth of the rooftop solar market and thus the energy transition and it is therefore important that this proposal is adopted,” said Wijnand van Hooff, general manager of Holland Solar, a Dutch trade group.
If approved by the Senate, the new provisions could still ensure a payback time of around seven years for new PV system owners, while favoring the deployment of residential batteries. The time frame for the phasing out of the scheme is still unclear, however.
Dutch PV analyst Peter Segaar said the new rules might not ensure the same high growth volumes of recent years.
“Residential PV will grow further, but at a slower pace which is good, as installers are totally overworked, with risk of cheap, low-quality systems,” he told pv magazine. “The surpluses in summer are so high and an expensive battery may be full in a blink of an eye.”
The proposal could still ensure the further development of the residential PV segment in the country, but only if specific incentive schemes for batteries are introduced.
In 2021, Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of electricity and gas network operators, and Energy Storage NL proposed the phasing-out of the net-metering regime, in combination with a rebate program for storage systems. They said that would make it possible to bring battery technologies to commercial maturity in the Dutch market by as early as this year. They said solar capacity is growing too quickly and that grid bottlenecks are becoming a serious issue, especially for the nation's low-voltage network.
The latest edition of pv magazine is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
The Dutch government modified the net-metering scheme in 2020 and it is expected to remain in force, if not in modified form, until 2030. Since the provisions were put into place, net-metering payments for excess power will fall in value by 9% per year. These tariffs still ensure reasonable payback times and continue to drive the growth of the country's residential PV market.
The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency recently estimated that the country could reach 27 GW of installed PV capacity by 2030. The researchers said the planned phasing-out of net metering for rooftop PV would probably influence the type of projects installed after 2023, rather than affecting overall volumes.
The Netherlands likely installed around 2 GW of new residential solar capacity in 2022, according to provisional statistics from Netbeheer Nederland.
“The net metering scheme is an important driver of the popularity of solar panels among homeowners,” Netbeheer Nederland said in a statement. “Since 2004, this scheme has led to unprecedented rapid growth in the number of solar panels on the roofs of homes.”

Australian modular solar manufacturer 5B will work with a team of researchers from the University of Sydney (UoS) to develop optimization tools for the design of gigascale solar farms after the project received a share of AUD 40 million ($27.2 million) in the latest round of the Australian Research Council’s (ARC) Linkage Project Grants program.
Sydney-based 5B will lead the project in conjunction with Mark Baldry from the UoS’s Faculty of Engineering. Clean energy developer Sun Cable, which is now for sale after entering voluntary administration in January, has been listed as an industry participant.
5B was selected as the preferred supplier for Sun Cable’s proposed Australia-Asia PowerLink project in the Northern Territory (AAPowerLink), which would include up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage on a 12,000-hectare site in Australia's Northern Territory.
The research partners said the scale of the Sun Cable project means that temperature-induced panel efficiency losses represent a major challenge that must be overcome through thermal performance optimization.
The project, which was awarded AUD 636,676 as part of the Linkage grants program, will include the building of “sophisticated multiscale models to simulate and understand the multiple interacting phenomena that cause panel heating.”
“This project will create the tools and know-how to optimize array design and solar farm development, delivering major efficiency gains and enhancing the viability of future gigascale solar projects,” the research partners said.
The project is one of eight energy installations to receive funding through the ARC Linkage Projects scheme 2022 Round 1. Funds totalling AUD 40 million for 81 new projects were announced under the program.
Linkage grants support strategic research partnerships between Australian universities and other publicly funded research institutes, plus industry or community participants. Grants under the scheme are worth between AUD 50,000 to AUD 300,000 per year, for projects running between two and five years.
“By supporting the development of partnerships, the ARC encourages the transfer of skills, knowledge, and ideas as a basis for securing social, commercial and other benefits of research,” ARC Chief Executive Officer Judi Zielke said.
Other agencies to receive funding this week include the University of Melbourne which will work with Spark Property Developments to develop an ultra-low carbon precast panel system that allows for rapid modular construction. This proposed project, which was awarded AUD 545,173, aims to develop a precast panel comprising a novel ultra-low carbon concrete mixture that is cast in vertical battery moulds.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia’s Oceans Institute received AUD 420,000 to deploy helix-shaped anchors to secure floating wind developments.
Project lead Professor Christophe Gaudin said the project will reduce the cost of offshore floating wind energy. UWA’s partners on the project are Ocean Infinity (Australia), Ireland’s University of Dundee and Geowynd Offshore Engineering.
A full list of approved projects is available at the ARC site.

They conceived the dataset to set up installation registries by extracting small-scale PV metadata from overhead imagery.
“Our dataset provides ground truth installation masks for 13303 images from Google Earth and 7686 images from the French national institute of geographical and forestry information (IGN),” the researchers said, noting that the metadata includes installed power, surface, tilt, and azimuth angles.  “To address architectural differences, researchers can either use the coarse-grained location included in our dataset or use our dataset in conjunction with other training datasets that mapped different areas.”
The dataset provides thumbnails with a resolution of 400 × 400 pixels centered around the locations of PV systems. The thumbnails are based on the geolocation of a PV database for deep learning known as Base de données apprentissage profond PV (BDAPPV).
The user initially performs image classification by clicking on an image if it depicts a PV system and then annotators delineate the PV panels on the images.
“Once we generate our PV panels polygons, we match them with the installations’ metadata reported in the BDPV dataset.” the French researchers said, adding that this step involves internal consistency, unique matching, and external consistency.
The file containing PV installations’ metadata and the notebooks used to generate the masks are available in two separate datasets. The dataset provides installation metadata for more than 28,000 installations and segmentation masks for 13,000 installations.
“Dataset applications include end-to-end PV registry construction, robust PV installations mapping, and analysis of crowdsourced datasets,” the scientists said.
They described the dataset in “A crowdsourced dataset of aerial images with annotated solar photovoltaic arrays and installation metadata,” which was recently published in Scientific Data.
“To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a training dataset contains PV panel images, ground truth labels, and installation metadata,” they concluded.

The novelty of the system consists of using these two components instead of the commonly used PV/T heat exchanger as the condenser.
“When solar energy and long-wave radiation energy resources are available, the proposed system is suitable regardless of the type of buildings,” researcher Man Fan told pv magazine. “The system performance is improved by the complementary utilization of solar energy, air energy and long–wave radiation energy.”
The PV/T condenser generates power during the day and assists the air–cooled condenser for heat dissipation during the night. The system features an evaporator and condenser, a compressor, an electronic expansion valve (EEV), a four–way reversing valve, a gas– liquid separator, and a hot gas bypass valve. It uses a refrigerant known as R410.
“A bypass pipe is set between the air-cooled condenser and PV/T condenser,” the scientists explained. “By controlling valves near the bypass pipe, the system can be converted between the air-cooled PV/T air conditioner and conventional air-cooled air conditioner.”
By opening and closing the three valves, the system can operate as an air–cooled PV/T air conditioner or as a conventional air–cooled air conditioner.
“The switch of air-cooled air conditioning system and air-cooled PV/T air conditioning system mainly depends on the condensing effect of PV/T exchanger,” said the research group.
The PV/T condenser consists of a PV plate, an aluminum plate with dimensions of 1580 mm × 810 mm × 2 and 8 mm copper tubes from top to bottom. The aluminum plate is attached to the back of PV plate, and copper tubes are welded on the aluminum plate. The air-cooled condenser consists of a fan and fa 8 mm finned tube heat exchanger. The PV panel used for the system has an area of 1.28 m2, a rated output of 200 W and a power conversion efficiency of 19.1%.
The academics measured the performance of the system by using Evap-Cond, which is a software program that offers simulation models for finned-tube evaporators and condensers. They found that the heat dissipation rate of system condenser is “positively “correlated with outdoor wind speed, refrigerant flow rate and inlet temperature, and “negatively” correlated with solar irradiance and outdoor temperature.
“When the refrigerant flow rate increased from 10 kg/h to 50 kg/h, the heat dissipation rate increased by 3.9 times, and the maximum value was 3,116.2 W,” they explained “While under other conditions, the heat dissipation rate merely changed by 2.9% to 10.3% with an average value of 3,064.8 W.”
They also ascertained that the system cooling capacity at night is about 7.1% and 42.3% higher than that on a cloudy and sunny day, respectively, and that the system coefficient of temperature (COP) is between 2.9 to 4.1, which is approximately 20.0% and 123.7% higher than that on a cloudy and sunny day.
“The air-cooled PV/T air conditioning system was suggested to be operated when the solar irradiance was not higher than 200 W,” they said. “The increase in solar irradiance and outdoor temperature were both unfavorable to the system cooling and power cogeneration performance.”
The researchers introduced the system in “Simulation of air-cooled PV/T air conditioning system for cooling and power cogeneration,” which was recently published in Applied Thermal Energy.

The US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has approved the construction of the Desert Quartzite solar project near Blythe, California. EDF Renewables North America will develop 300 MW of solar, plus 600 MWh of storage.
“The BLM continues to approve responsibly-sited renewable energy projects to help advance clean energy production on public land and meet the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a net-zero economy by 2050,” said Karen Mouritsen, the California state director of the BLM. “The project will generate good paying union jobs, boost local economies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
The Desert Quartzite solar project will result in capital investment of $1 billion and supply clean power to roughly 120,000 homes. The facility is expected to create more than 900 construction jobs and is expected to reach commercial scale operations by December 2024.
Upon completion, the project will likely rank among the top 10 largest utility-scale solar projects in the United States, based on projects in development from 2024 to 2025, where projects range from 300 MW to 690 MW in total capacity.
Desert Quartzite anticipates using Canadian Solar BiHiKu7 650 watt (DC) bifacial monocrystalline PERC panels, SMA 4.2 MW inverter stations, Nextracker horizontal single-axis tracking solar photovoltaic (PV) hardware and 150 MW / 600 MWh of battery systems.

They said that PV- and wind-powered seawater reverse osmosis desalination can produce water to maintain enough trees to capture 730 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) between 2030 and 2100.
“This new concept may lead to an additional PV demand of about 10.7 TW and 19,700 TWh of PV electricity,” researcher Christian Breyer told pv magazine.
The team chose a mix of trees in desert and arid climate zones to simulate the carbon capture and water demands of forests grown on dry land between 2030 and 2100. They used the LUT Energy System Transition Model (LUT-ESTM) to analyze the energy requirements of afforestation and to estimate the electricity, water, and global carbon sequestration costs over the 70-year period.
The results show that the world’s areas with the greatest potential are the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), followed by sub-Saharan Africa. These regions have a cumulative CO2 sequestration potential of 131 gigatons and 87 gigatons by 2070, respectively.
”This potential is driven by the availability of restoration and bare land areas with demand for desalination in these regions,” the scientists said.
The regions with the least potential by 2070 are Europe (3.4 gigatons) and Eurasia (1.2 gigatons), due to the low availability of suitable land.
The annual global cost of irrigating and maintaining restored forests with desalinated water has been estimated at €457 ($490) per CO2 ton in 2030. Costs fall to €99 per CO2 ton by 2100. Costs are higher in Afghanistan, Iran, Chad, and Niger, mainly due to water transportation costs that are higher than the global average.
The global average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) decreases from €46.90 ($50.34)/MWh in 2030 to €31/MWh by 2100. This includes the cost of electricity for continued water supply for irrigating the forests and for powering desalination and water pumping.
“By 2050, countries with CO2 sequestration potential have more than 80% of the corresponding electricity generation from solar PV, highlighting the high solar irradiation levels in regions with afforestation potential,” the academics said.
Battery storage is used to support PV generation during low electricity production, meeting up to 67% of the global electricity demand, according to the study. This solar application could capture 0.26 gigatons of CO2 per year by 2050, improving to 6.7 gigatons of CO2 by the end of the century, claimed the scientists.
The researchers published their findings in “Afforesting arid land with renewable electricity and desalination to mitigate climate change,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability.

Ionblox says it has secured $32 million in a recent Series B funding round. The funds – provided by Lilium, Applied Ventures, Temasek, and Catalus Capital – will help the startup to scale its high-power cells for electric aviation and prototype its fast-charge EV cells.
The batteries are developed with lithium-ion cells that have pre-lithiated silicon dominant anodes. Ionblox said the technology leads to a powerful combination of 50% greater energy density and five times more power over lithium-ion batteries, while enabling fast-charge times of 10 minutes. The cell performance has been verified by Idaho National Laboratory.
A rapid charge can power 80% of the battery’s capacity in 10 minutes. For a 300-mile vehicle, this means you can charge 240 miles in the time it would take to stop at a normal gas station. Idaho Labs tests of 12 Ah pouch cells confirmed energy density of 315 Wh/kg. The battery can operate 1,000 charge cycles at the C/3 charge rate while retaining nearly 90% of original capacity.
The company said the breakthroughs in battery capability are particularly well-suited for cutting-edge electric aircraft like Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircrafts (eVTOL), where weight must be minimized, and power output maximized. The large-format pouch cells of up to 50 Ah, which also have applications in ground EVs, are currently being built on Ionblox’s pilot production lines.
“The Ionblox technology enables one of the highest performance cells for eVTOL aircraft existing today,” said Yves Yemsi, chief operating officer at Lilium. Yemsi’s company will work to integrate the new battery tech into its conforming aircraft, the Lilium Jet.
“Test results to date are showing the technology will deliver not only superior energy and power density for the Lilium Jet at launch but also very good aging performance,” said Yemsi. Lilium said it will support continuous improvement and industrialization of the technology.
The battery provider received a development contract from the United States Advanced Battery Consortium to develop low-cost, fast-charge EV batteries. Ionblox is also partnering with Applied Materials for semiconductor equipment supply.
This second Series B round builds on a $24 million investment round in October, 2022. Founded in Fremont, California in 2017, as Zenlabs, Ionblox has more than 40 issued patents for pre-lithiation for all types of silicon-based anodes.
