The model considers both the temperature-dependent power yield and the solar module time to failure (TTF), which calculates the time from when the panel is put into service until it fails. These two values were then unified in an equivalent ratio, designated with the Greek letter γ, which evaluates the influence of temperature on the performance of a PV system.
“This ratio expresses which absolute percentage in power conversion efficiency increase would be needed for achieving the same reduction in LCOE,” the scientists explained, noting that the model allows the prediction of a module's temperature from the basic solar cell and module materials and device architecture properties. ” Whereas the temperature-dependent LCOE speaks to those working at system level, γ provides technologists working at the module and cell level with a more tangible metric.”
The model is said to enable the calculation of the total cell heating power by either adding the components contributing to the cell heating or by subtracting the electrical power output of the cell/module and the reflected/escaped power from the incident power. “We find that more than 60% of the incident solar power leads to cell heating,” the Saudi Group stated. “In addition, the encapsulation of the cells into modules further increases the heating power to over 65% of the incident power.”
In order to create a quantitative link between the module heating-power density and the module temperature, the scientists also developed an opto-electronically coupled thermal model to compare the thermal behavior of different cell technologies and investigate possible strategies for mitigating potential heating issues. “We found that the most effective and simple way to reduce the module temperature is to place the module in a windy environment with a proper mounting arrangement to enable effective heat transfer via convection,” the researchers concluded.
The proposed model was described in the paper Heat generation and mitigation in silicon solar cells and modules, which was recently published in Joule.

The latest report published by the international NGO in its green hydrogen series is a guide to policymakers which pointed out 71% of the blast furnaces used in steelmaking around the world require investment this decade, with the remainder requiring attention before 2040.
With chemicals plants enjoying a typical 30-year lifespan, the report added, the average ammonia fab is already 15 years old and the world's oldest facilities are based in Europe and Asia.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

With fossil fuel-powered hydrogen a significant contributor to the heavy carbon footprint of the iron and steel and chemicals industries, Abu Dhabi-based Irena said policymakers must act immediately to foster green hydrogen before another generation of polluting plants are locked in to, and beyond 2050.
That also means, the Green Hydrogen for Industry report added, the world needs to roll out the huge wave of renewable energy generation facilities needed to power hydrogen electrolysis without eating into the renewables capacity needed to generate electricity for non-industrial uses.
Policies are needed to incentivize heavy industry and end-product consumers, Irena stated, to help bridge a gap between the current prices of fossil-fuel powered hydrogen, ammonia and alternative transport fuel methanol and their greener counterparts.
The report estimated green hydrogen costs around $4-6 per kilogram versus $1-2 for the grey version of the energy carrier. With conventional ammonia costing around $250-450 per ton, according to Irena, a green hydrogen-powered version of the fertilizer feedstock and shipping fuel could be made for $500-625/t this decade. Methanol costs around $100-400/t at the moment but the use of green hydrogen, bioenergy and carbon capture and storage to manufacture it would drive that figure to around $800-1,600, with the expense even higher if untested use of carbon captured directly from the air is factored in.
All of which means policymakers need to roll out the full toolkit of measures to tip the scales in favor of green hydrogen if the world is to have any hope of reaching net zero by mid century, with those heavy industry investment decisions looming.
Irena's 68-page study suggests blast furnaces must be phased out and replaced by direct reduced iron (DRI) processes, with quotas introduced stipulating the proportion of hydrogen use which must come from the green version of the gas as well as related minimum purchase requirements for manufacturers further down the chain, such as steel-reliant carmakers.
Emissions trading schemes and direct carbon taxes are further “sticks” which can bring manufacturers to heel, with income from the former supplemented by carbon contracts-for-difference which ensure emissions trading revenues are topped up by government bodies to an agreed strike price level which would decrease over time.
Making it easier for manufacturers to go green by offering access to all sources of grant and funding support in one-stop shops would reduce red tape, the Irena document suggested, adding tax systems can be altered to incentivize green industry and that governments should also back R&D.
Bilateral auctions, such as that planned by Germany's H2Global, would see public intermediaries hold auctions to secure the supply of green hydrogen for the lowest price and then hold procurement exercises to determine the price at which the gas is sold on to industrial consumers, with public funds making up any shortfall initially.
Green procurement by public bodies would also help create demand for green hydrogen and, in an interesting point for the solar industry, Irena suggested renewable energy procurement auctions could be tweaked to have a requirement to source materials from eco-friendly processes. The study estimated 35 tons of glass is needed for a 500MW solar plant, alongside 28 tons of steel, 23.5 tons of concrete, 9.5 tons of aluminum, 3.5 tons each of silicon and copper, and three tons of plastic.
The report noted progress is already being made in some quarters, and highlighted the project being planned by Spanish fertilizer company Fertiberia and utility Iberdrola, who plan to establish 800MW of green hydrogen production capacity in four stages to 2027. The first of four plants produced its first green hydrogen in December at a green ammonia plant in Puertollano, Spain and will consist of 100MW of solar generation capacity, a 20MWh lithium-ion battery, and 20MW of electrolyzer capacity.

France's Ministry of Ecological Transition introduced, in October, a new package of measures to support PV systems of up to 500kW which included a feed-in tariff bonus for solar tile-based building-integrated PV (BIPV) systems that comply with a series of landscape integration requirements.
This week, the ministry announced the first four solar products that were eligible for the incentive scheme: A solar tile developed by Rivesaltes-based Sunstyle; two BIPV products manufactured by Grossouvre-based Edilians; and a tile produced by Alsace-based Systovi.
The French authorities specified that the use of these products will not be sufficient to secure the premium and that the characteristics of each project will also have to be evaluated.

According to the recent provisions introduced by the French government, projects that are eligible for the scheme must ensure a roof sealing function and the roof must have an inclination of between 10 and 75 degrees. Furthermore, the BIPV system will have to be approved by France's Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment CSTB, a public establishment aimed to guarantee the quality and safety of buildings.
Moreover, the rules establish that a BIPV system may not cover more than 80% of the roof surface.
France reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 13.99GW at the end of December.

Spanish water management company Aqualia is leading a consortium that intends to set up a green hydrogen production facility.
The consortium comprises Spain's energy giants Repsol, as a producer and consumer of hydrogen, and power utilities Naturgy, Redexis, and Reganosa, as gas distributors. It also includes Spanish technology companies Norvento, Perseo, and Técnicas Reunidas.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
The pilot project is called Zeppelin and is planned to be implemented at the Isla Verde Wastewater Treatment Plant, located in the port of Algeciras, in the southern region of Andalucia, where Técnicas Reunidas will install several innovative hydrogen production facilities.
The project has a total budget of more than €7 million, with €4.23 million coming from the Spanish government.
The consortium aims to process more than 99 million tons of waste and 50 million tons of municipal wastewater to produce 135,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. “Translated into practical examples, this represents sufficient production for Spanish industry to meet the objectives set out in the Hydrogen Roadmap, or to satisfy the energy needs of the entire Spanish railway network,” Aqualia said in a statement. “The choice of Algeciras as the site for Aqualia's activities is directly related to the presence of large industries in the area, such as Acerinox, Viesco, Air Liquide, [and] Linde, as well as the port companies, as potential end consumers of green hydrogen.”
The delegate of the government of Spain in Andalusia, Pedro Fernández, present at a launch event, recalled that the aid comes from a tender held in July 2021. “More than 500 companies agreed to this call, being resolved in November with 228 accepted projects to receive state subsidies of more than €122 million, plus the €61 million of the applicants,” he said.
The Zeppelin project is another of Repsol's commitments to green hydrogen in Spain, a race in which it competes head-to-head with Iberdrola.
Técnicas Reunidas is among the 20 partners promoting the Hydrogenizing BCN Initiative, which seeks to develop economically viable business models based on green hydrogen, in several phases.
Aqualia is also involved in the construction of a photovoltaic plant that will power the Rambla Morales desalination plant to make it more sustainable and preserve the environment of the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park.

New South Wales company Hysata is on track to commercialize the world’s most efficient electrolyzer, capable of producing green hydrogen for less than US$1.5 per kilogram by the ‘mid 2020s,’ it says. Moreover, the company believes it can reach gigawatt scale hydrogen production within a similar timeframe, saying its design is simple and suitable for mass manufacture today.
The company was born out of an electrolysis breakthrough made at the University of Wollongong, south of Sydney, around three years ago. There, researchers led by Gerry Swiegers discovered hydrogen could be produced far more efficiently using capillary-fed electrolysis.
This was verified in a paper published today in peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature, which found the capillary-fed electrolyzer could produce green hydrogen from water at 98% cell energy efficiency.
The Hysata electrolyzer consumes 40.4kWh of energy for every kilogram of hydrogen it produces. The Nature paper noted commercial electrolysis cells tend to use around 47.5kWh/kg, though Hysata CEO Paul Barrett claimed it was closer to 52.5kWh/kg. This equates to around 75% system-level efficiency, whereas the Hysata system claims a total efficiency of 95%.
This 20% efficiency boost has enabled the massive cost reduction Hysata says it’s only a few years away from making a reality. “You really collapse the project economics through that efficiency lever,” Barrett told pv magazine Australia. The academic added the company has “a simplified system which really reduces the cost quite substantially.”
Barrett didn’t want to commit publicly to the price of the Hysata electrolyzer, but said the company is in conversation with around 30 “name brand companies,” needing green hydrogen, who are “thrilled” about the economics.
“Our technology will enable hydrogen production of below US$1.50 per kilogram by the mid-2020s, meeting Australian and global cost targets much earlier than generally expected,” Barrett said.
Barrett said the company is busy building its pilot line of electrolyzers in a house near Wollongong now. “We’re building a huge test capacity, like, today,” he said. He is hoping to begin testing them in parallel within the next few months, with plans to ramp up the pilot line in 2023.
From pilot scale, the company wants to jump directly into gigafactories. To enable this, Hysata will grow its team of 20 engineers significantly this year.
“We are planning to have systems in the field by 2025,” Barrett said.
“I’ve got plates working today at the efficiency and performance that we’ve got on that paper,” he added, referring to the study in Nature, and adding: “our next thing is to basically string lots of those together, not unlike the way you’d string multiple solar modules together. We’ll connect them in series and that becomes our stack.”
The company “certainly” plans to keep its manufacturing in Australia, Barrett said, possibly remaining in Wollongong – which is right next door to the proposed Port Kembla hydrogen hub.
“This can be an era defining company for Australia,” the CEO said, noting that Australia imports the vast majority of its renewables equipment today, such as solar panels and wind turbines. “There’s a real opportunity to build sovereign manufacturing capacity here in Australia and export it to the world,” he added.
This very much aligns with Matt Kean’s plan, the state’s environment and energy minister as well as treasurer. In February, he announced AU$250 million (US$180 million) in funding to boost locally manufactured renewable energy content and a further AU$300 million (US$216 million) to build a renewables-powered manufacturing base including renewable hydrogen.
The company is the “first in the world” to commercialize a capillary-fed electrolyzer, according to Barrett. To date, he says, electrolyzer technology has been “too inefficient and too complex” to make green hydrogen attractive. Hindering efficiency in electrolyzer cells is resistance, which has typically come from bubbles which are non-conducting, and mask electrodes.
Barrett said the research team at the University of Wollongong “basically looked at that problem with a blank sheet of paper and really tried to understand where all the resistance is, inside the cell.” That exercise led to the invention of capillary-fed electrolysis which eliminates these bubbles and boosts efficiency.
This leads to a “double whammy benefit on the economics,” Barrett says, because hydrogen projects would need less renewables to get the same hydrogen output, saving on capital outlays while also only needing to purchase a smaller electrolyzer.
The company’s electrolyzer is fives times smaller than a traditional alkaline electrolyzer, Barrett says, and contains 20 times less liquid. It fits inside a six-meter shipping container and can be moved by forklift for easy transportation, he added. “So we’ve got a drastically simplified balance of plan.”
Hysata’s electrolyzer cell frame is made using a scalable, low cost and mass manufacturing technique – making the product nimble so it can get to market as quickly as possible.
“We’re one of the few, if not the only, electrolyzer from time zero, to be mass manufacturable,” Barrett said.
Hysata, a start-up, only officially launched in June last year. It kicked off with AU$5 million (US$3.6 million) in seed funding from the UK-based IP Group, with AU$750,000 (US$539,000) from the government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
Swieger, who led the University of Wollongong ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science research, has since become Hysata’s chief technology officer.

Spanish PV developer Solarpack has launched a new energy sales business under its click&go brand.
The new service offering is based on a remote solar self-consumption model that is already available for Spanish households and businesses. With click&go, customers can produce and consume their own solar energy without needing to install solar panels on their rooftops, as they will source their energy remotely from Solarpack solar plants.
Consumers can enjoy all of the output of their solar panels for self-consumption at cost, regardless of where they are located. Solarpack also guarantees the supply of additional energy that consumers might need and the sale of excess power generated by solar panels to the grid.
The price at which clients can buy electricity produced by their panels is close to €30 ($32.98)/MWh. The contract between the customer and Solarpack is 100% digital and immediate, without the need for paperwork or additional procedures.
The first plant that the company will use to support the new business is located in Tejeda de Tiétar, in the southern Spanish province of Cáceres. The project has a capacity of 10MW and is already producing energy equivalent to the consumption of around 5,000 medium-sized homes.
According to Iván Nieto, director of energy sales at Solarpack, click&go can significantly reduce the main barriers to access to solar energy for end consumers. These barriers include high upfront costs and the need to have adequate rooftop space and solar radiation, he explained.

“The work is intended for sustainable PV development, with reducing scarce material use, meanwhile improving solar cell performance,” researcher Olindo Isabella told pv magazine. “Beside bifacial silicon heterojunction devices, the results of this study could provide insights in the development of other TCO-required c-Si solar cells with carrier selective passivating contacts, such as high-efficiency bifacial TOPCon, and metal oxide-based contacts.”
The TCOs used for the cell are based on indium(III) oxide (In2O3), which is considered a technology-critical element by many experts.
“Reducing indium consumption, which is related to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) use, is a key challenge for scaling up silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technology to terawatt level,” the scientists said.
They tested three types of indium oxides doped with tin (ITO), fluorine (IFO), and tungsten (IWO). The three oxides exhibited different opto-electrical properties from post-transition metallic cationic doping, anionic doping, and transition metallic cationic doping, respectively.
They deposited the oxides on corning glass substrates at room temperature through the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technique, which is an approach involving alternating the electrical potential of the current in a vacuum environment at RFs. The 2 cm2 × 2 cm2 cell was fabricated via copper (Cu) plating metallization, based on a technique that was recently developed by the same research group.
“Silver consumption is largely reduced due to the use of copper-plating metallization approach,” Isabella further said.
The properties of the three TCOs were assessed through an HMS-5000 Hall Effect Measurement System provided by South Korea-based Ecopia Corp. and an M-2000 DI spectroscopic ellipsometer supplied by US-based J. A. Woollam. The measurements showed the IFO and IWO are favorable for p-contact and n-contact, respectively, while the ITO was found to work well in both p-contact and n-contact.
The performance of the solar cells was analyzed for both monofacial and bifacial SHJ devices. The champion solar cell is a 22.84%-efficient bifacial device built with a 25 nm-thick IWO on the front side and 25-nm-thick ITO on the rear side.
“This represents a 67% TCO reduction with respect to a reference bifacial solar cell with 75-nm-thick TCO on both sides,” the scientists said.
The scientists described the manufacturing technique in “Towards bifacial silicon heterojunction solar cells with reduced TCO use,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The research group includes scientists from the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands and Nankai University in China.

The project will store excess power produced by a 30MW solar plant under development at Rome-Fiumicino International Airport.
“The storage project is planned to have a capacity of 5MW/10MWh and cover evening peak-demand, while also providing flexibility services to the grid,” Luigi Lanuzza, Enel X Global Retail's head of B2C and B2B innovation factory, told pv magazine. “The solar park will be operated by Aeroporti di Roma and is planned to have its capacity expanded to 60MW at a later stage, which means the capacity of our storage facility will also have to be expanded.”
The storage facility will be built through a modular approach, as it will integrate different types of second-life lithium-ion batteries with high-energy density mainly based on nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) with usable storage capacity ranging from 10kWh to 25kWh.
“This approach makes us independent from a single supplier or technology,” Lanuzza explained. “We are in talks with different electric car makers to secure the storage devices for the project.”
Cost reduction is one of the project’s objectives. According to Lanuzza, one of the main cost issues of similar projects relates to the adaptation of batteries that come from the automotive sector for stationary storage.
“You could, in theory, acquire these second-life batteries for free, but then making them suitable for stationary applications is not so inexpensive, ” he said, noting that batteries for stationary storage usually work with system voltages ranging from 1,000V to 1,500V. “Batteries for automotive applications, by contrast, have normally a voltage of 350V on average, which means you need a multi-level inverter to reach the required efficiency levels.”
Higher costs also come from the higher number of cables that will have to be used, as well as non-standardized components.
This project will rely on special software created by Enel X Global Retail to optimize the storage of PV electricity and help to provide grid services. The software purportedly maximizes revenues by stacking multiple services, based on techniques such as unsupervised machine learning to model the degradation of batteries in different applications and sites for both atmospheric and load/grid conditions.
“It helps efficiently size batteries and prevent the risk of performance degradation during operation, by creating a real digital twin of the storage system,” Lanuzza explained. “This facility is expected to reach a technology readiness level (TRL) of seven and our target is to achieve total cost of ownership and performance comparable to those of a conventional stationary storage project.”
The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies for full commercial application. The storage facility is expected to have a lifecycle of at least 10 years.
“Automotive batteries are designed for a shorter and typically not deep cycling compared to stationary storage, and we will have to monitor how they interact with a solar plant,” Lanuzza said, noting that the modular approach enables quick replacement of batteries. Overall, around 720 batteries will have to be used to reach the desired capacity.
The batteries will be placed in a dedicated area in the airport. Construction is expected to start in the second half of 2023 and take about a year, with the first half of the system ready by end of 2023, said Lanuzza.
The EU Innovation Fund is providing €3 million ($3.3 million) for the project. The company expects more cost reductions from the new generation of EV batteries.
“New batteries are now being produced with a ready-to-reuse design, which will help us have more uniformity in their second life application,” Lanuzza said, adding that these new devices also occupy less space while providing better performance.

The Durable Module Materials consortium (DuraMAT), established by the Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technology Office (SETO), has been working since its inception in 2016 to improve the use of PV materials.
DuraMAT has awarded $30 million to high-impact projects, and in 2021 was given an additional $36 million by SETO for six more years of funding. The funds will help the consortium continue to develop solar module materials science in pursuit of a 50-year life for PV.
“We are trying to shift into a reliability research mode where we’re directly targeting modules that last 50 years,” said Teresa Barnes, DuraMAT director. “We’re very focused on high-energy-yield modules and making those in a sustainable way. We know there are going to be big material and energy impacts from ramping up deployment as fast as we need for the energy transition. But our question is, ‘How can we do that in a way that’s environmentally sustainable and in a way that our supply chain can keep up?’”
The consortium has five core objectives. First, it seeks to act as a central data resource, collecting and disseminating solar module reliability data, and applying the data to create insights. The DuraMAT database is a centralized source with the ability to ingest, curate, combine, analyze, and manage diverse datasets.
Second, DuraMAT provides fielded module forensics, quantifying and characterizing module failures in outdoor exposures and recording environmental effects. It said one of the biggest hurdles to studying degradation or failure in fielded modules is that frequent absence of a “reference” or control module. This core objective is designed to provide better understanding of PV material durability, and to generate practical, multi-modal data that guides next steps in materials and module design.
As a third objective, the team develops a multi-scale, multi-physics model to accelerate testing and quantitatively assess material degradation.
“We are now shifting our emphasis towards predictive testing and modeling methods that will enable us to assess reliability more quickly and more accurately in new technologies,” said Barnes.
Fourth, it provides module materials solutions, in which the consortium designs, develops, de-risks innovative materials and module architectures to address PV reliability issues. The group has worked to characterize failure modes, develop crack tolerant metallization, and design recyclable backsheets. It has also developed technical requirements and materials guidelines that have enabled thin-film module development.
And as a final core objective, the consortium uses disruptive acceleration science to test materials. Using aggressive conditions like pressing modules with rings to simulate bending, or with sound waves to mimic the warping effect of wind, the consortium stress-tests PV modules to see how they would perform in the toughest conditions and over long stretches of time.
“If solar is going to expand and become this ubiquitous technology that we have across our power system, on our houses – and be responsible for 40% of our electricity generation – old technologies are not enough,” said Barnes. “PV modules need to be made more efficient, less expensive, and more sustainably at much larger scale. But we also need to know that these new modules – whether they’re new module designs or new cell technologies like bifacial or tandem cells – will perform predictably in the field.”
