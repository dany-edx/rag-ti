The company built the huge project in five phases with the support of EPC contractor PowerChina. The plant occupies a water surface of around 44 square kilometers.
Leascend Photovoltaic Technology said it has signed an agreement with the government of Nantong, Jiangsu province, to build a CNY 7 billion ($970 million) heterojunction solar cell factory with a capacity of 12 GW. The company currently operates an 8 GW manufacturing facility that was commissioned in August.

The East and West Coasts enjoyed particularly sunny conditions, setting records in some areas. Notably, Washington recorded the highest
October average irradiance in years, matching levels not seen since 2008. In contrast, Mexico, Texas, and central and eastern Canada were shrouded more frequently by clouds, a situation that was further intensified in Mexico by Hurricane Otis towards the end of the month.

A weakened jet stream over North America caused Fall storm activity to focus offshore over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, leading to clearer skies over the East and West Coasts. For the East Coast, this effect was particularly strong, as the Atlantic storms drew persistent offshore winds, bringing drier continental air to coastal regions.
Irradiance was above average from Cuba to New York, and Washington, Delaware and New Jersey saw up to 130% of the climatological average.
For the West Coast, the decrease in Jet Stream effects led to less moisture from California as far inland as New Mexico and the Mid West, with irradiance up more than 10% over the climatology for October. This will have benefitted the higher solar capacities in California, Nevada and Arizona, which all saw 105-110% of normal October irradiance.

The effects of the weakened jet stream weren’t all good for solar, also allowing a summer weather pattern to continue in the Gulf of Mexico.
A lack of drier westerly fronts allowed onshore winds to continue, pushing more humidity and clouds over the continent, depressing irradiance in Mexico and Texas across the month. This was compounded by Hurricane Otis at the end of the month, which pushed cloud across Mexico and into Texas, bringing down irradiance to 80% of long term averages.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with a typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

The company said that NREL has confirmed the results, which represent a world record for this cell typology. The previous record was held by Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), which achieved a 33.7% efficiency for a device with the same configuration in June.
“The theoretical efficiency of perovskite-silicon tandem cells is 43%, which makes them the most feasible alternative to current mono-junction silicon cells,” said Longi President Li Zhenguo, without providing technical details.
In June, Longi reported an efficiency of 33.5% for the same cell. The European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) certified the results, which represented a significant increase on its previous 31.8% efficiency rating, which was announced during the SNEC conference in late May in Shanghai, China.
Longi has broken the world record for solar cell efficiency 15 times since April 2021. It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.

Encapsulation and backsheets protect PV modules from UV radiation, moisture, diffusion of chemical substances, and mechanical damages, while ensuring their electrical conductivity.
Good-quality backsheets are essential to protect the connected solar cells from environmental factors and ensure long-term module use. With this in mind, Germany's Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics (Fraunhofer CSP) is leading “Folie40,” a research project aimed at investigating novel encapsulation techniques and backsheet designs for PV modules that should have lifecycles of at least 40 years.
The project consortium includes German backsheet maker Folienwerk Wolfen, Switzerland-based module manufacturer Meyer Burger, Spanish coating specialist Aluminum Féron, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE), and the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences.
Fraunhofer CSP contributes expertise in polymer analysis, focusing on material changes under real-world conditions through systematic weathering tests. They are also developing a materials database to predict service life based on material formulation and environmental factors.
“It is often the polymer backsheets of the photovoltaic modules that limit their service life,” said Fraunhofer CSP scientists Anton Mordvinkin.
The project will run for three years and is funded through the energy research framework program of the Germany Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection.

The new methodology, dubbed SolarSTEPS, is reportedly the first probabilistic model that considers the advective motion of clouds, as well as their temporal variability.
“Current models do not capture the evolution of clouds over time, their growth, and dissipation, even though cloud evolution is a major source of forecast uncertainty,” the researchers said. “Clouds are the results of complex dynamical, thermodynamical, and chemical interactions. A purely advective forecast approach cannot capture these processes.”
The novel method starts with clear sky index maps, and estimates cloud motions using an algorithm. Then, the index maps are divided into several levels of data, to represent various spatial scales. Following that, the method employs an autoregressive (AR) model, simulating the temporal levels of the cloud. Finally, noise fields are computed to generate an ensemble of different forecasts, which derive probability density estimates.
The group compared the performance of SolarSTEPS with that of two reference models – probabilistic advection (PA) and SolarSTEPS without cascade (SSND). The test set comprises six consecutive days selected from each month, specifically, the fifth to the 10th day of each month in 2018, over Switzerland.
“In PA, the forecast ensemble is generated by perturbing the cloud motion field norm and direction. The perturbed motion fields are then used to advect the last input map in different ways,” the scientists explained. “In SSND, the forecast ensemble is generated by perturbing the autoregressive model with spatially correlated noise. No decomposition is performed, so only one AR model is used to simulate the temporal evolution of cloudiness.”
According to the results, SolarSTEPS yields a 9.3% improvement in ensemble forecast quality, compared to probabilistic advection, measured in normalized continuous ranked probability score (nCRPS). This corresponds to an extension of the forecast lead time by about 45 meters at a given level of forecast quality.
“We also show that predicting the cloud evolution at different scales further improves the forecast quality, as seen by comparing SolarSTEPS to SSND forecasts,” the researchers concluded. “Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating a local covariance matrix in ensemble generation further improves the forecast quality because it accounts for local variability.”
They presented the new methodology in the paper “Intraday probabilistic forecasts of surface solar radiation with cloud scale-dependent autoregressive advection,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
The scientists – from the Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland’s Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science, Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology, and the Finnish Meteorological Institute – concluded by saying that “SolarSTEPS forecasts clearly yield improved forecast quality (lower nCRPS) when compared to probabilistic advection and SSND benchmark forecasts. The forecast quality improvements are particularly pronounced in cloudy and variable weather conditions.”

The scientists said they addressed the typical phase segregation issue that inevitably takes place inside perovskite films and affects both the power conversion efficiency and thermal stability of perovskite PV devices. This is a troublesome issue, with illumination, such as sunlight, disrupting the delicately arranged composition of elements within mixed-halide perovskites.
“We all know from previous work that cations in different groups are distributed inhomogeneously, but how exactly these cations are distributed and the reasons behind it and how it affects efficiency remain unclear,” said researcher Xu Pan. “We visualized the out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity along the vertical direction across the perovskite films and identified the underlying reasons and the potential impacts for devices.”
The researchers said in “Out-of-plane cations homogenize perovskite composition for solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature, that they measured the vertical distribution of cations FA+ and Cs+ in the film. They discovered Cs+ aggregation at the film's bottom and FA+ concentration at the upper interface.
“Then we found that cations in different groups crystallize and transform at very different rates,” said Pan, in reference to the main cause of the film inhomogeneity.
In order to create more homogeneous films, the group used an additive known as 1-(Phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole (PSP), which they said successfully fulfilled its mission.
With the optimized perovskite film, the academics built a solar cell with an active area of 1 cm2. Tested under standard illumination conditions, this device showed a power conversion efficiency of 26.14%, an open-circuit voltage of of 1.164 V, a short-circuit current of density of 26.14 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 85.74%. The cell was also able to retain 92% of its original efficiency after 2,500 h.
The scientists also said that an undisclosed third-party entity has certified the cell efficiency at 25.2%.

Twelve organizations have set up the IAA to promote agrivoltaics in India, an agrarian nation with ambitious renewable energy goals. The country faces the challenge of needing large tracts of land for solar installations, but agrivoltaics, involving solar panels co-located with agriculture, could be an ideal solution.
The IAA has emerged to drive this initiative, launched during the India Agrivoltaics Summit. Supported by the India Climate Collaborative and Bloomberg Philanthropies, the IAA collaborates across the agriculture and solar value chains, with the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) serving as the alliance's secretariat.
It aims to develop agrivoltaic business models, study socio-economic impacts, and promote inclusivity. Agrivoltaics promises water conservation, increased farmer income, and a financially viable power sector. NSEFI's director general, Deepak Gupta, views IAA as a pivotal step towards sustainable energy, harmonizing agriculture and solar energy for a cleaner, more resilient future in India.
“The launch of the India Agrivoltaics Alliance is a pivotal moment in our nation’s journey towards sustainable energy,” said Deepak Gupta, the director general of NSEFI. “Agrivoltaics is not just a technology, it’s a commitment to harmonizing agriculture and solar energy for a greener, more resilient future. This alliance will be instrumental in achieving this harmony, fostering innovation, and driving the transition towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy landscape in India.”
IAA steering organizations include NSEFI, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), International Water Management Institute (IWMI), Indian Society of Agricultural Engineering (ISAE), Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture (ICFA), The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), Indo-German Energy Forum (IGEF), Skill Council for Green Jobs (SCGJ), Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies (ISEP) Japan, and Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation.

It claims that its Smart Module Controller can shut down inverter voltages in 25 seconds (DC) and 11 seconds (AC).
The line features two products with rated DC inputs: 450 W for the SUN2000-450W-P2 and 600 W for the SUN2000-600W-P.
“Based on the buck circuit, Smart Module Controller Solution adopts the ‘optimizer + two-stage inverter’ architecture,” the company said. “With optimizers installed, PV modules are optimized independently to achieve maximum yield.”
Huawei conducted tests with TÜV Rheinland. In the first test, they measured the ability to shut down the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inverter quickly.
“The only option is usually to let the PV system burn in a controlled way until all the PV modules burn out. This method will prolong the fire and cause heavier property losses,” the company said. “It is necessary to adopt comprehensive measures such as rapid shutdown technology combined with intelligent arc fault detection to improve the safety of distributed PV.”
Test results on a shopping mall roof showed that the MPPT inverter voltage dropped to 0 V in 25 seconds (DC) and 11 seconds (AC) after disconnecting the DC and AC switch, due to the optimizer.

Huawei also claims in its white paper that its optimizers could raise yields of PV systems by up to 30%. It said that by installing optimizers in a shaded roof area, a school could improve its yield by 25.9%.
In one test, households with older models experienced a mismatch, and those equipped with optimizers saw a 3.56% and 2.73% increase in PV energy yield compared to two households without optimizers. In another case, where old and new PV modules were used together, optimizers boosted the energy yield by 7.26%.
The company also assessed the operations and maintenance (O&M) of its optimizers, which send data to a smartphone and computer interface. According to the white paper, the system can instantly identify a faulty module and reduce the need for inspections from two to three times a month to just once.

“By pairing the EP760 with two to four B500 battery packs, users can create an energy storage system ranging from 9,920 Wh to a maximum of 19,840 Wh,” Bluetti said, noting that the EP760 inverter delivers up to 7,600 W of single-phase power in grid or off-grid mode.
Bluetti said the system has been designed to respond to growing calls for an affordable home backup system and takes less than 10 milliseconds to switch from grid power to battery power.
The EP760, which operates at 240 V, can be integrated with existing or future solar systems, supporting up to 9,000 W solar charging.
“Even without solar panels, the EP760 offers an intelligent peak load shifting feature that enables homeowners to charge the system when grid electricity is cheap and discharge it during peak hours, reducing overall energy costs,” the company said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/03/new-design-parameters-for-photovoltaic-thermal-air-collectors/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 3, 2023",New design parameters for photovoltaic-thermal air collectors,"A group of researchers led by the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom has conceived new design parameters for photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) air collectors by taking into account the effect of modifying the duct depth and velocity.
Air-type PVT collectors utilize air as a transfer medium to take heat from the backside of the PV panel unit. Compared to water-based PVT collectors, these devices are cheaper to produce and maintain and can be theoretically used in any climate. Their performance, however, depends on design elements such as PV module technology, internal structures in the heat collecting space or the shape of the air pathway, among others.
The scientists explained that duct depth has a significant effect on the performance of PVT air collectors as it directly influences air flow behavior. “As the depth of the duct increases, the temperature of the PV cells increases,” they stated. “The depth of the duct has a negative relationship with the duct velocity. Due to this, the heat transfer coefficient depreciates, leading to limited heat extraction from the PV cells.”
Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, the research group investigated the performance of an air-based PVT system, including two 75 W PV modules with an air duct with a depth of 0.05 m, and compared it with that of a reference system without the air duct.
“The PV module consists of 5 layers including a glass bottom/tedlar, two EVA layers, PV cell layer and a glass cover,” the academics said, noting that each module contains 36 solar cells. “The glass cover has a transmissivity of 0.95, maximizing the amount of solar radiation that can pass through it to reach the PV cells, while also providing some protection to the panel.”
Through their analysis, the researchers found that the air duct “greatly” lowers the PV panel temperature, specifically the temperature of the PV module without the duct was 77.9 C, whereas the panel with the duct was just 53.3 C. “The air flowing underneath the panels extracts the heat generated by the cells,” they explained. “This led to a 13.67 % increase in electrical efficiency, emphasizing the impact of the air duct.”
The new design methodology was described in the study “Performance evaluation of a solar photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) air collector system,” published in Energy Conversion and Management: X. “This work has provided high quality simulation results to develop design parameters and improve efficiency, as this was identified as a gap in the literature initially,” the scientists said.
The research group also included researchers from the Technical University of Liberec in the Czech Republic.

System USA, a greenhouse operator, said this week that it has recruited ClearVue to install clear solar glass on a greenhouse in California. The solar glass will provide approximately 82 kW of electricity, with an estimated 107,000 kWh per year. The project is expected reduce annual operating costs.
ClearVue developed its single-pane laminate glazing in partnership with D2Solar.
The company uses nano- and micro-particle technology to internally diffuse, redistribute and reflect elements of incoming light towards the edges of its clear glass panel, where it is collected by monocrystalline silicon PV modules. The modules are placed into a circuit, which is designed to collect energy rays from multiple directions.
The California project build on previous solar greenhouse projects, including the Murdoch University R&D Greenhouse in Perth, Australia, operational since 2021. It also installed solar glass at the Sendai Ignis resort in Japan via its licensee Tomita Technologies.
At the test installation in Perth, daily average energy production is near 1.6 kWh generated by about 25 square meters of solar windows. The installation produced about 500 kWh over the course of a year of operations from 2019 to 2020. The company said a 1000 square meter installation could produce about 70 kWh per day.
“Greenhouses have been an integral part of our strategy from day one as we understood the growing global need for renewable energy solutions for sustainable agriculture,” said Martin Deil, chief executive officer of ClearVue Technologies. 
ClearVue PV technology uses an activated interlayer, sandwiched between two or three glass panes, some of which feature specialized thin-films and low-emissivity coating, enabling PV production without compromising natural daylight for crops below and maintaining a high color rendering index (CRI) of up to 99%. The technology can yield up to 32.5% energy cost savings compared to traditional single-glazing greenhouse panels.
“ClearVue glass also has the potential to add efficiency to automobiles, public transport, agriculture and mobile electronic devices,” said the company.

The price of M10 TOPCon cells likewise decreased by $0.0031/W week to week to $0.0690/W.
The prices of cells have decreased for the fourth week in a row, according to OPIS data. Due to the acute lack of downstream demand, cell makers have been engaged in a price war; they have to compete to cut prices in order to encourage demand and increase sales volume, according to a cell manufacturer.
The Mono Perc M10 cell, the market's mainstream product, is currently assessed at roughly CNY0.489 ($0.067)/W ExW this week in the Chinese domestic market, according to the OPIS market survey. This is approximately 27% less than the price of roughly CNY0.67/W at the start of the third quarter.
An insider in the polysilicon industry claims that the cash cost for the Tier-1 cell manufacturers to produce Mono Perc M10 cells is approximately CNY0.48/W based on the current upstream materials’ prices. Concurrently, a Tier-2 cell supplier said that they are losing money on sales of Mono Perc M10 cells at a price of CNY0.5/W, suggesting that their production costs are higher.

Additionally, cell producers are concentrating on cutting inventory by lowering operating rates, OPIS learned from its market survey. The market's average operating rate for cells is currently between 70% and 80%, according to a seller source.
When asked what plan they would further take to deal with the present slow sales, another cell manufacturer responded that there aren't any effective approaches at the moment and that it's anticipated that wafer and cell makers’ operating rates would continue to drop in November.
