https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/18/northvolt-and-cinis-to-turn-battery-waste-into-sustainable-fertilizer/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,SUSTAINABILITY,SWEDEN",MARIAN WILLUHN,"OCTOBER 18, 2021",Northvolt and Cinis to turn battery waste into sustainable fertilizer,"Battery production waste could be the key sustainable ingredient to make crops grow faster. Northvolt, a Sweden-based battery manufacturer that was founded with circular production methods and sustainability written into its DNA, has partnered with Cinis Fertilizer, a Swedish startup company producing sustainable fertilizer from waste industrial products it sources from battery and paper manufacturers.
Per the agreement, the battery manufacturer will provide 200,000 tons of sodium sulfate per year to the fertilizer maker. The material is a type of salt that can be recovered during the battery manufacturing process. To this end, Northvolt has designed a new water treatment technology at its Gigafactory “Ett” in Skellefteå, Sweden, that has been developed with the precise setup of Northvolt’s cathode manufacturing steps in mind.
During the electrode active material production of its NMC cells, wastewater containing ammonia and metals is produced. The new facility can recover ammonia from this water for repurposing in battery manufacturing. After further filtration, the metals are removed leaving a slurry of highly concentrated sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The slurry is then dried and crystalized before it is sent to Cinis for fertilizer production.
“This is just one example of the positive outcomes that can be achieved from making investments into circular manufacturing,” said Northvolt’s chief environmental officer, Emma Nehrenheim. “In this instance the material in play is salt, but in other areas of the Northvolt production process, our engineers are engaged in developing solutions to ensure that water, heat, energy, and other materials that would otherwise be wasted are instead recovered and recirculated to one purpose or another.”
The salt's off-taker is a Swedish startup company that has set out to produce the “world’s most environmentally friendly mineral fertilizer”. The company sources chloride-rich ash that paper and pulp mills collect in electrostatic precipitators, sodium sulfate from Northvolt, and Cinis also sources potassium chloride from other industrial facilities.
By sourcing the feedstock for their fertilizer from the industrial waste products of the pulp and paper industry as well as from battery manufacturing, Cinis Fertilizer says it can reduce the energy consumption of its operation by 50%. By repurposing the chemicals that are considered waste in other industries, the production of this fertilizer will produce 75% less carbon dioxide than conventional equivalents.
“We share a common goal with Northvolt: creating value-adding products for a fossil-fuel-free future,” said Cinis’ chief executive, Jakob Liedberg. “Through this new partnership, we will produce a fossil-free fertilizer with a close to zero carbon footprint, and make a unique contribution towards securing more sustainable agriculture.”
A precise date for the first delivery of sodium sulfate from Northvolt to Cinis has not been settled as part of the agreement. Within the next two years, Cinis will, however, build two fertilizer factories in northern Sweden, one of which will be next to the Northvolt Ett Gigafactory. The electricity required for fertilizer production will be renewable, the company says. For now, the wastewater treatment will only be deployed at the Swedish facility, as it is designed to handle the wastes of electrode active material production. There are no such processes undertaken at Northvolt's site in Poland, and therefore no opportunity to produce the sodium sulfate.
“Looking forward, Northvolt will always work to ensure that the environmental footprint of its activities is as low as possible; as and when Northvolt establishes additional active material production capacity, we look forward to building upon the foundation we already now have in place with the wastewater treatment technology at Northvolt Ett,” Northvolt's editorial manager, William Steel, told pv magazine.

Though there was some disagreement over certain issues, particularly 24/7 matching, everyone agreed demand is on the increase. “All the evidence points to demand increasing,” said Oster. But the obstacles to supply remain the same, the arduous permitting process, grid congestion, the electrification of heat and particularly in light of the current energy price spike, the cost of renewables. 
De-risking renewable PPAs 
PPAs often last from 10-15 years and as such the deal itself can be worth hundreds of millions of Euros. “These are huge risks,” said Eneco's Lucien Wiegers. And while some corporate buyers might balk at a 10-15 year contract when they're used to buying their electricity on a much shorter basis, Shell's Colin Brooks pointed out that natural gas has been sold on “very long-term off-take agreements too”, so the time-scale isn't exactly new. Nevertheless, Brooks continued, “there's space for innovation and standardization of these contracts.” 
Of course, the biggest risks involved in PPAs is that faced by renewables in general, such as the permitting process. Enrico Ambrosini, SVP, Green Investment Group, said the “permitting process still has plenty of obstacles. The European renewable strategy has to be transmitted to local permitting”, and the system operators should be incentivized to reply sooner. “Governments need to listen to the problem on the demand side,” he said. This latter point was echoed by Ørsted's Alana Kühne, “We don't have the framework to bring corporates and governments together.” 
Engie's Jerome Malka stated that the “regulatory environment needs to foster more deployment”, but was “very excited to hear the EC was ready to step in for credit guarantees.” 
Axpo's Christoph Sutter pointed out that the easiest way to de-risk your PPA investment is, firstly, to do your due diligence, and albeit obvious, to sign on to a PPA toward the end of a project's development. Perhaps less obvious, however, is his advice to individualize a contract by insisting on a “replacement option” should there be an issue with the contracted renewable generator. 
Ultimately, as Statkraft's Pieter Schipper pointed out, “there are all sorts of flavors of renewable PPAs,” and something can be tailored to fit. 
Encouraging SMEs 
On the contract side, there are several ways for PPAs to be made more manageable. Wiegers spoke about making the procurement process as normal as possible for smaller buyers, as normal as a traditional electricity contract, that is. And in order to make more PPAs available for smaller customers, Wiegers said big projects could be chopped up into smaller, bite-sized pieces.
Of course, it should be remembered that in the case of renewable energy uptake, an SME should be regarded in terms of its load, not its number of employees or any other measure. Nevertheless, SMEs need to be better incorporated into the global PPA market, that was clear in the messaging of the event. And what was also stressed was the problem of super locally connected corporates that would not think to come to Re-Source 2021, these companies also need to hear about the benefits to renewable energy PPAs and virtual PPAs.
24/7 Matching 
24/7 sourcing/matching was certainly a key trend of Re-Source 2021, with many calling it an “absolute must for decarbonization.” 24/7 matching refers to calculating renewables consumption on an hourly basis as opposed to an annual basis. This means matching renewables with real-time demand, and according to Iron Mountain Data Center's Chris Pennington “more and more companies are wanting 24/7”. 
For companies pursuing 24/7 it gives them a much more detailed overview of their consumption, more visibility about what you're consuming every hour. In terms of overview, it is the difference between a map of the world and Google Earth.
Speaking of Google, Google's Brian Denvir said the tech giant is “pursuing 24/7 because it is the best way to go if we want to totally decarbonize our operations and the grid.” From Google's and Denvir's perspective, the tech giant has been on the forefront of renewable energy purchasing for 10 years, so “we're in a position to push the boundaries.” 
FlexiDao's Simone Accornero argued that annual reporting gives a false impression of consumption, pointing with Powerledger's Cristina Mata Yandiola to the need for granularity. EnergyTag's Killian Daly stated it simply, “If we don't look at time, we're not looking at the problem.”
These advocates of 24/7 also pointed to its necessary encouragement of energy storage and demand-side flexibility. Denvir noted that such granularity would enable more buying on the same grids and the opportunity for buyers to find complementary generation profiles that fit their needs. 
Nevertheless, the advocates were aware of the job ahead of them in terms of convincing everyone. After all, many corporates who are looking for ways to renewables to cut costs, cut emissions and achieve climate pledges, don't see the point in opening themselves up at the granular level. “If a grid is 100% renewable,” one person said to pv magazine, “24/7 becomes meaningless.” The underlying suggestion being that everyone should get behind one clear goal, rather than changing the metric all the time. 
In confidence, some buyers were confused that it was possible to reach 100% renewables on an annual basis and not on an hourly basis, suggesting it felt like the big tech companies were moving the goalposts to benefit their own resources. For industries, like the chemical industry for instance, it can be much harder to decarbonize than in the tech sphere, and in their eyes 24/7 sourcing will only slow the rate of decarbonization, making it harder and make certain hard-to-electrify industries look worse. 
The counterargument from advocates of 24/7 matching was the sheer complexity of the global energy market, and the statistic that many at Re-Source 2021 kept citing to illustrate this complexity was that Germany has 900 Distribution System Operators (DSOs). “900!” 
“Market-based accounting of carbon is going to lose favor,” said Pennington, “the other measurement needs to be a granular/hourly measurement.” With many on the software side agreeing that a new metric is needed to drive toward corporate decarbonization. 
Some questioned the prioritization of temporal matching versus geographical matching. But most seemed satisfied with the idea that temporal matching is necessary over the next 10 years or so to ensure fewer geographical boundaries and a more liquid market, but that in 10-15 years time, once a speed of transition has been set, then geographical matching will need to be stronger. Once the transition is established, it seemed to be thought, the less liquidity is needed. 
Additionality 
Additionality has been one of the buzziest of buzzwords in the renewable energy sector in recent times and Re-Source 2021 was no different. Of course, one of the reasons ‘Additionality' is such a buzzy word is that, as Statkraft's Tiago Thomaz put it, “nobody really knows what ‘additionality' is.” 
Indeed, the discussion of ‘Additionailty' at Re-Source 2021 began with an interactive mind-mapping of what the term suggests. In general, people understand ‘Additionality' to refer to the addition of new renewable assets to the grid, or on-site at a company's facilities, which would not otherwise have happened. 
That last phrase is simultaneously the most important and the most ambiguous, hence the wide-scale confusion. Tomaz's definition settled on the idea that ‘Additionality' should refer to the addition of renewable energy which changes the status quo. Though again, that is not a clear metric for some, and corporate listeners were weary of such an ambiguous concept being mandated in policy or celebrated as the only metric of progress. 
What is certain is that ‘Additionality' is seemingly as contentious an issue as 24/7 matching, with some big corporate representatives asking if it is more of a hindrance than a help. On the other side of the aisle, however, the argument for ‘Additionality' is the argument for choice, ‘Additionality' asks corporate energy buyers to make a choice between the status quo and adding something sustainable to the world. Of course, it may not be as simple as that, but the energy market isn't simple, after all, “There are 900 DSO's in Germany!”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/18/growing-advantage-for-off-grid-storage-in-grid-tied-applications/,"ENERGY STORAGE,SPONSORED,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 18, 2021",Growing advantage for off-grid storage in grid-tied applications,"When you power a back-up system, it is not only necessary to have sufficiently high AC power but also to provide excess power. Why is this? And what is a good value for power and duration of the possible excess power?
Pierre-Olivier Moix: We consider a back-up system as an off-grid system for a limited period. The system should be able to power the required demand and not the opposite – just having limited demand that can be supplied by the system. And this is why it is not possible to fix a value, it depends on every project and specific demand. The good news is that the value can be adjusted with the time, depending how the demand is evolving. In our case, there is no limit, because you can even add units in parallel if the demand increases heavily.
You have launched a new product, which you say provides such “real autonomy and back-up power,” also for grid-connected single family houses in northern and southern Europe. Which customers do you think will be willing to pay the surcharge for this advanced back-up performance?
We are all now aware of the trends in electricity prices. The sector is transforming, from a centralized and heavily subsidized market towards a multi-actor, dynamic scenario. The electrical demand for single family houses is also shifting, especially with the arrival of electric mobility. People looking to drastically reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing autonomy or independence will rely even more on storage systems in the future. A storage system without ‘small print’ limitations will provide the freedom to decide the electrical model based on their own circumstances without considering external factors.

The experts of Studer Innotec will introduce their new solution in a pv magazine Spotlight on Wednesday and explain the new next3, an all-in-one three-phase battery inverter, and answer your questions.
Date: 20 October, 11:00 a.m. CEST, Berlin/SAST, Cape Town; 12:00 p.m./EAT, Kenya; 2:30 p.m./IST, Delhi; 4:00 p.m. Bangkok, Hanoi

You not only emphasize the quality of the back-up power, but also the energy management functions. What do customers want, in that respect?
Everything is becoming smarter, and this is also happening with electrical devices. To centralize and control all of the intelligence available is still a challenge and far from being standardized. We have incorporated straightforward energy strategies that can easily be implemented to have the first layer of smart energy management without any additional controller. These strategies will have a real impact on the energy profile, making it possible to increase energy self-sufficiency by between 20 and 50%.
What are the typical dimensions of a solar and battery home system that you would recommend, when one wants to profit from the performance of the next3?
The next3 architecture has been conceived for a three-phase demand, with a lot of flexibility. In terms of power, we can supply up to 24-30 kW peaks and 10 kW peaks in a single phase. The flexibility is also available on the storage type, not only in terms of battery technology, as our inverter can work with lithium, lead-acid and many other battery technologies. In terms of storage capacity, our flexible charge and discharge profile makes it possible to configure the profile for each battery storage system, so the client, and not the system, is responsible for deciding their own autonomy.
Technically, what are the main design differences of your new product compared to standard solar and energy storage home systems?
It is not fair to directly compare existing energy storage home systems with our solution. We propose to apply the off-grid model in grid-tied applications, we are a step ahead in terms of autonomy and autarky. In our case, the battery is a must and the grid is an accessory that we could use as an asset. Our device requires a battery to work, the system architecture is different. This is why we offer solar autarky without conditions. For designing such a system, we advise to focus on the demand and autonomy required. Solar, if available, is often the most interesting energy source, in terms of maximizing the output. Other variables, especially the battery capacity, will depend on the autarky rate desired. The system should be able to match the energy requirements foreseen in the next 10-20 years. The battery capacity, however, is a modular asset that can evolve with the system.
To provide advanced back-up performance, do you have to pay the price of reduced efficiency, due to an over-dimensioning of the components? How important is efficiency for such a product? How have you measured and quantified your system’s efficiency?
Based on our long experience with energy storage, the efficiency is important but is not a critical element compared to the demand and energy management. However, with our innovative system architecture based on a DC link, we are able to reach efficiencies from solar to loads and from solar to the grid, that are at the same level or even higher. The main impact in system performance comes from smart management not only of the solar resource available, which is pretty well managed by all, but also the storage asset. Efficient use of the storage can lead to a huge boost in the total system efficiency and the autarky rate.
Would you also use this system for pure off-grid solutions, or do you have other products for these cases?
In off-grid most of the time, we need to handle an AC source as well (generator, hydro turbine, etc). In fact, we consider the grid as another AC source that should be integrated in the system. The device can therefore perform for both off-grid and on-grid applications and the main advantages of integration, flexibility and smart energy management are very useful in both cases. Our well known Xtender battery inverters were also a very important factor in the beginning of the self-consumption industry. Different regulations and simple applications were a hurdle. With the next3, we believe that we provide a very relevant solution for solar autarky, and are well prepared for the challenging future trends.
Which off-grid applications are present in Europe that installers should keep in mind?
Agricultural and field applications, mobile applications, C&I [commercial and industrial] portable and temporary applications, remote set-ups. There is an off-grid sector that will remain off-grid.

“There’s a war over talent globally,” said Miguel Stilwell, the CEO of Madrid-based, Portuguese-owned clean energy business EDP Renewables recently. “The renewables sector, given the massive amount of growth that is expected, doesn’t have enough people.”
The fact companies are retraining staff from the oil and gas industries is no bad thing, given the widely-acknowledged need for a ‘just transition‘ to new forms of power generation, but renewables businesses the world over should not ignore the solar workforce which has been steadily building in Nigeria for the past 16 years.
pv magazine’s  UP Initiative spent the second quarter looking at what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to the workers, often far removed, who are involved in the production of their products and services. Supply chain traceability and polysilicon provenance were key topics.
A power reform act passed in 2005 led to Nigeria's Renewable Energy Master Plan, or REMP, which has provided the bedrock of renewable energy policy in the nation.
Since that landmark legislation was passed, the Nigerian solar industry has developed to the stage the cities of Lagos and Abuja alone boast more than 40 PV companies.
The REMP was revisited in 2013 and 2015 and recast as the National Renewable and Energy Efficiency Policy, or NREEP, and has seen the market develop further, with off-grid and mini-grid solar arrays ranging in scale from 5 kW rooftop systems to 1 MW solar farms, forming the backbone of today's PV industry.
Far from calling on overseas personnel, however, these small scale systems – increasingly vital given the fragile nature of the conventional grid network – are being designed and implemented by Nigerian solar engineers. With a World Bank report published last year having estimated Nigeria's total workforce runs to more than 62.4 million people, it is tempting to wonder how many of them are equipped with solar skills and whether such PV industry recruits could help with the much-discussed personnel shortages around the world.
I conducted a quick survey of 22 Nigerian solar engineers, including some with 4-15 years' experience in the industry, and the respondents estimated the PV industry might stretch to 5-15% of the nation's total workforce. Fifteen-year veteran Olubukola Ayeni, who has affiliations with the U.S.-based Solar Energy International and Germany's Renewables Academy, said up to 5% of Nigeria's labor force might consist of PV installers, with solar engineers making up 2% of the total, and renewables consultants and PV design engineers another 1% each, although he suggested there would be some overlap between roles.
Of the sample of solar engineers polled, around 40% had worked on projects with a generation capacity of more than 100 kW, with experience ranging from 5 kW arrays to 1 MW systems.
Around half of those I questioned were familiar with at least one of the PV design software packages PVsyst, PVCAD, HOMER, PowerHub, AutoCAD and HelioScope. The engineers familiar with such software were affiliated with at least one of the wholesale suppliers Africa Energy; the Simba Service business which is part of Nigerian conglomerate Simba Group; USAID's renewables and energy efficiency initiatives; the International Association of Engineers; French energy multinational Schneider Electric; German development agency GIZ; Senegalese start-up Oolu Solar; and Dutch off-grid PV business Victron Energy.
With 10 of those polled stating they were confident of their ability to lead a team on the construction of a 10 MW solar project, the respondents said the skills they felt they lacked concerned experience on larger facilities, solar design software training, and project funding.
The biggest challenges facing the Nigerian solar industry, according to the interviewees, were the high cost and low standard of materials, hard-to-access funding, lack of domestic PV manufacturing, and an inadequate policy framework. Despite operating in a vacuum characterized by little external support and slow domestic backing, the engineers I spoke to said the Nigerian solar workforce lacked experience in just two areas to be globally competitive: the execution of large projects, of around 100 MW of generation capacity; and solar design software training.
Progress is being achieved, however, with the state government of Lagos recently flagging collaboration with the International Institute of Technology and Application, based in Georgia, in the U.S., to help people gain global solar technology certification, with the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners as a partner.
To reach our net zero goal by mid century, we need to get boots on the ground working to install solar as quickly as possible. There is already a small percentage of Nigerian solar engineers who could work worldwide and, as for the rest, it is not about transitioning to global solar jobs; our workers already have the skills, they simply need to be integrated into the global solar workforce, rather than operating in isolation.
With the U.S. Department of Energy having noted the solar workforce is predominantly white and male, helping Nigerian engineers enter the global stage would help and would see Nigerians make a contribution in the manner in which we are already doing in the fields of information technology, medicine, sports and music.
And our engineers will bring that precious commodity of a different perspective. After all, in progressive fields such as software and renewables, doing what no one else has done before is part of the job description and what is standard today may be obsolete tomorrow, hence the need for industry personnel to constantly evolve.

Sunfire co-founder and CEO Nils Aldag said the investment “marked the largest equity raise of a green-hydrogen-focused private company anywhere to date.”
The company plans to use capital to build the first in a series of production gigafactories and bring its advanced pressurized alkaline solid oxide (SOEC) electrolysis technologies to industrial scale, creating major electrolysis capacity for its customers.
“Our electrolysis technologies are critical for increasing green hydrogen supply that is needed to decarbonize industrial companies at significant scale,” Aldag added. “Europe is emerging as a global leader in the hydrogen sector, and Sunfire plans to be a frontrunner by providing world-class technology at scale.”
Sunfire recently announced plans to scale its alkaline electrolysis business and build a large-scale electrolyzer production site in Germany with an annual manufacturing capacity of 500 MW by 2023, with a further extension to gigawatt-scale already in the planning.
Describing its SOEC electrolyzers as “game-changing,” Sunfire predicts the technology will change the scale of hydrogen production through both greater efficiency and its unique capability of producing syngas. A mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, syngas can be converted into everything that is currently produced from crude oil, such as jet fuel, diesel or waxes, but without the harmful emissions that come from using fossil fuel feedstocks.
“Sunfire’s unique technologies will drive down costs for green hydrogen production, helping to establish a competitive hydrogen value chain and further increasing the range of industries that can economically decarbonize,”said Lightrock partner Kevin Bone. “The many net-zero targets set by businesses and governments cannot be met without a dramatic scaling in green hydrogen production and adoption, which Sunfire will play an integral part in facilitating.”
Frédéric de Mévius, managing partner of Planet First Partners, added: “Green hydrogen has tremendous potential to abate at least ten percent of global carbon emissions. Sunfire’s breakthrough electrolysis technologies, the scale-up of manufacturing capacities and the overall dynamism its management team is bringing to the market will benefit the ramp-up and use of green hydrogen across industrial and transport applications.”
Also joining the latest investment round were New York City-based Carbon Direct Capital Management and London-based HydrogenOne Capital as well as Sunfire's existing shareholders.

Under the terms of the transaction, Omers will acquire a 49% stake in FRV’s Australian renewable  energy business, which includes 637 MW (DC) of PV projects already operational or under construction with offtakers and green certification already in place, as well as a pipeline comprising 2.7 GW of PV projects and 1.3 GWh of battery storage in earlier phases of development.
FRV has been present in the Australian renewables market since 2010, and the new alliance with Omers follows a fundraising process begun earlier this year to enable it to achieve new growth targets in the region.
Omers Infrastructure holdings in renewable energy include U.S. company Leeward Renewable Energy, which owns and operates a portfolio of 22 renewable energy facilities amounting 2GW of installed capacity across nine U.S. states. Omers also holds a stake of approximately 19.4% in India-based IPP Azure Power Limited, which has around 2 GW of operational renewables capacity and another 5 GW awarded or under construction.
The FRV transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2021, after going through customary regulatory approvals and reaching financial close. “in line with our long-term strategy, Omers looks forward to partnering with FRV to develop a multi-technology renewables platform in Australia,” stated Christopher Curtain, senior managing director for Asia Pacific at Omers.

CDI Energy CEO and founder, Darryl Bower, told pv magazine Australia “RSM is up to 30% cheaper than traditional fixed axis PV or solar tracking”, though this doesn't include fellow Aussie modular maverick 5B. However, “unlike 5B and the peg system,” Bower says, RSM is 100% Australian made”, and its “partially pre-fabricated” design which is then assembled on site reduces costs. 
Modular solutions are proving increasingly popular, especially as a solution for remote sites like mining operations which want to reduce their diesel consumption.
“RSM modules have been designed for use across a range of industries including mining,” Bower continued. “They have a smaller footprint than competitors and lower capital outlay – making it more cost effective for mining companies to go green.” 
Mining on the move 
For at least the next few decades, mining is going to fuel the energy transition, and renewables like solar are, in turn, going to fuel mining. According to the “State of Play: Electrification” report – recently released by Virtual Consulting International and sponsored by the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre – 89% of the world’s leading mining executives expect mine sites around the globe to electrify within the next two decades. And 61% of mining industry respondents said they believe the first and most important step in the process of electrification is the development of renewable energy generation capacity.
The crucial element in decarbonizing the entire industry is finding solutions that fit mining companies’ requirements, said Thomas Hillig, managing director of THEnergy, a German management consultancy specializing in cleantech innovations. “One such solution is needed for remote, offgrid, and short-life mines,” Hillig explained.
Of course, a particular appeal of modular systems for mining companies is not just the easy scalability of modular solutions, but that they can be easily packed up and re-deployed to a new site. 

In the last year CDI has installed more than 1 MW of RSM at sites in the Pilbara, Kimberley and Goldfields, with another 4 MW of planned projects in the pipeline. 
“Our clean energy options are designed to instantly reduce operating expenses,” said Bower. “We also have rental options for clients so we can build, own and operate the energy asset so there is no upfront capital required.”
This allows customers “who would have once rented a diesel generator – the ability to now rent a solar system for their short to medium term projects.” 
According to Bower, the RSM requires only 5,500m² per MW compared to 18,000-22,000m2 (approximately five acres) required by traditional fixed axis or solar tracking setups.

Gareth Jones, MD of solar business Carbon Zero Renewables, claimed he has experienced a 1,000% rise in demand for PV panels in recent weeks, as gas and electricity prices have soared in the U.K., forcing many smaller energy companies to go bust.
Jones, whose business is part of North Wales-based hot tub company UK Leisure Living Group, said the U.K. government was wrong to prioritize measures such as EVs and heat pumps because there is not enough electricity generation capacity to support a surge in demand for power.
Pick up your copy of the latest edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
Policymakers, said Jones, should instead support solar installation so consumers can generate the power they need at source.
In a press release issued by his business on Tuesday, Jones said: “I applaud the government for encouraging people to move towards low carbon methods and electric cars but we simply do not have the network infrastructure to meet demand. People are getting in touch with us every day; we’ve seen an unbelievable spike in orders as they want to get away from traditional energy and move to renewables, despite no government incentives … They [ministers] should be helping people who are looking at long-term future-proofing of their homes, [they should] use different strategies hand in hand, and do so sustainably, to avoid mistakes being repeated. I think the government has its priorities wrong.
“It’s all well and good transitioning to electric cars and air source heat pumps but we don’t have the electric capacity now, never mind in five to 10 years. The government needs to support solar and get homes and business generating and consuming power at the source.”
Despite wide reports about supply chain disruption dogging the solar industry, Jones, whose UK Leisure Living business is based in Mochdre, Colwyn Bay, said: “We are in a strong position and have plenty of stock in store, so there are no supply chain issues, unlike many sectors struggling to obtain materials.”
The Carbon Zero press release stated “a large domestic solar PV system could save consumers upwards of £800 (€948) a year,” and Jones added: “Businesses can see a four-year return on investment right now by going solar powered.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/18/aiib-accused-of-backing-bangladeshi-fossil-fuels-instead-of-renewables/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ASIA,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"OCTOBER 18, 2021",AIIB accused of backing Bangladeshi fossil fuels instead of renewables,"Contrary to its stated commitment to social and environmental issues, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is reportedly promoting the expansion of fossil fuel use in Bangladesh.
The findings were published in a new report “Financing Fossil Fuels Failing Our Future”, by climate activists from the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BWGED) and Coastal Livelihood and Environmental Action Network (CLEAN), Amsterdam-based Recourse, a Filipino NGO Forum at the Asian Development Bank, and Germany’s Urgewald.
They allege that the AIIB did not keep its commitment to offsetting the impacts of climate change and has instead aggravated the issue by investing in fossil fuels in Bangladesh.
Since 2016, the regional bank has reportedly invested a total of $2.39 billion in Bangladesh’s energy sector and has committed to lending a further $2.35 billion. The report also found that on average, its rate of investment in this area is increasing by 23% annually.
Of the funds invested in fossil fuels to date, 80% are said to have gone to supporting the electricity transmission and distribution heads, while 10% have been used to build power plants. The remaining 10% has reportedly been channeled into the oil and gas sector.
“In spite of this level of financing, significantly the AIIB has yet to invest in any RE options (wind, solar) in the country, exposing the bank as an influential financier directly undermining global efforts to protect the climate and community resilience,” said the report’s authors.
They added that as a multilateral development bank, formed after adoption of the Paris Agreement, the AIIB should take a lead in supporting the required renewable energy transition in the region; and that it should be supporting, without exception, renewable and decentralized power options in Asia, especially in climate-vulnerable Bangladesh.
The groups have called upon the AIIB to stop investing in coal and fossil fuel-supporting infrastructures including transportation, transmission and distribution, port development, hybrid plants, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage.
They have also demanded that it support its developing member countries, including Bangladesh, to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050 at the latest to ensure zero emissions from the energy sector.
Petra Kjell, Campaign Manager of Recourse, said AIIB shareholders like the U.K. have pledged to not provide funds for fossil fuels; however, the bank continues to back them in Bangladesh.
“None of the AIIB’s energy investments in Bangladesh supports renewables. This is unacceptable in a time of climate crisis,” he said.
Professor Shamsul Alam, Energy Adviser of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh added that the bank has breached its own policies by financing transmission lines in Bangladesh which will connect coal-fired power plant to the grid. “The bank should compensate people for its irregularities,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/18/swiss-solar-announces-new-european-pv-module-factory/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SPONSORED,EUROPE",,"OCTOBER 18, 2021",Swiss Solar announces new European PV module factory,"Swiss Solar will manufacture bifacial PV modules at the new facility, which is expected to see an overall investment of CHF 300 million over the next five years. The company has also increased its product warranties to 25 years.
More details on where the facility is located and the capacities it will manufacture will follow next month.

In 2020, solar energy became cheaper than coal as a source of electricity in markets like the U.S., EU member states, and Latin America, among others, says Swiss Solar.
For instance, according to research by the International Energy Agency, distributed PV will account for almost 40% of new capacity additions in Brazil in 2021-2022. There is also a boom in Chile’s utility-scale solar market. Overall, the country’s solar industry is expected to rapidly grow over the coming decade and the situation is the same in Mexico.
Government programs and subsidies for solar energy are popular in both North and South America, which helps to accelerate the adoption of bifacial PV technology in these markets. In keeping with data from the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the U.S. solar industry passed 100 GW of installed solar capacity during the first quarter of 2021.
Meanwhile, according to consultancy, Wood Mackenzie, bifacial modules will account for 17% of the global PV module market in 2024. ITRPV (the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic) has further predicted that the market share of such modules will increase by at least 35% by 2030.
Investing in the large-scale production of bifacial PV modules of more than 500 Wp in size allows Swiss Solar to enter these promising markets with a sought-after product.
With high demand for bifacial PV modules, warranties that ensure only a minimum base of electricity production must increase. Module output production will degrade to some degree, but they should not lose more than 10-20% over 25 years.

Generally, performance drops by 0.5 to 1% per year. As a rule, a performance warranty will guarantee 90% production for the first 10 years and 80% for up to 25 years. However, these 25-year warranties pose an enormous financial risk to manufacturers.
Due to the durability of bifacial PV modules and their capacity to weather different types of degradation, these panels are expected to have longer lifespans. As a result, they have longer warranties.
Swiss Solar pays particular attention to the quality of its products and performs obligatory monitoring of module parameters and testing of finished products during the production process.
This approach excludes poor-quality products from reaching customers. Consequently, the company has increased its product warranties to 25 years.S

“The thing that really impressed me is how far technology has advanced around PV performance and reliability monitoring,” Dr. David Parlevliet, Murdoch University’s deputy head of engineering and energy, told pv magazine Australia when a report he co-authored for the Australian PV Institute (APVI) on portable onsite inspection methods for PV was released last week.
The report – “Qualification of PV power plants using mobile test equipment” — was published by the International Energy Agency’s PV Power Systems Task 13. It incorporates input from participating countries throughout the world, with the aim of keeping the PV industry up to date with the latest technologies and best practice for optimizing PV performance.
The value of large-scale PV installations relies on the modules performing to their anticipated yield, but the sheer scale of many PV plants today means 100% technical inspection is unfeasible.
“In Australia, drones play an important part in identifying underperforming power plants,” said a statement from the APVI, which partnered with international contributors on the report.
pv magazine Australia recently reported, for example, on South Australian utility SA Water’s decision to contract UK aerial  solar inspection and data analysis specialist Above to monitor the performance of its 370,000 solar panels deployed over 33 separate sites as part of the utility’s Zero Cost Energy Future Initiative.
Rapid advances in infrared inspection using drones mean aerial surveillance now provides a clear overview of the operational status of installed PV arrays, as well as identifying specific PV strings or modules for further detailed analysis using mobile PV test centers, said the APVI.
Importantly, the quality of such on-site inspection results is now comparable to insights gained in lab tests, and can reliably contribute to information required to implement repairs and substantiate warranty claims on faulty panels, without the need to ship them to offsite laboratories for assessment. This in turn poses the risk of damage to panels during transportation, and can result in lengthy downtimes of one or more PV strings.
Parlevliet is also chief remote pilot at Murdoch University, and brings deep experience of the capabilities of drones and the regulations governing their safe deployment, to his work on the paper.
“The drones themselves are significantly more advanced than they were even in relatively recent years,” he said. He noted that they have become more commercially available, and the cost of the technology has fallen, so “you can get an infrared equipped system from a common drone manufacturer for a few thousand dollars, which makes it a lot more accessible to small companies or users.”

Low- and moderate-income (LMI) households are less likely to install rooftop solar photovoltaics, and U.S. policymakers, stakeholders and community leaders are calling for a more equitable adoption of these technologies.
Research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Clean Kilowatts suggest improved marketing strategies could help.
Researchers to date have focused on demand-side explanations for adoption inequity. Those factors include cash constraints, lower homeownership rates, building structural issues, and language barriers. Likewise, LMI policies largely have been designed to address demand-side barriers, such as adoption subsidies and carve-outs in community solar programs.
The report argued that supply-side factors may pose significant barriers, as well.
The report noted one study of U.S. solar industry quotes and contracts that found that customers who received fewer than four quotes were about three times less likely to adopt solar than those who saw more.For one thing, the industry often selects to market to high-income customers. The report found a significantly lower number of project quotes are shown to LMI customers.  Fewer quotes mean those customers have fewer opportunities to gather information and make an informed buying decision. Higher price quotes also can occur as there may be less competition among installers in LMI markets.
The report suggested that the supply side issues in solar can be addressed in a way similar to inequity in food access. It said that large grocery stores stocked with healthy foods often are located in affluent areas, while LMI areas often host low-quality food stores. Through a series of state and local interventions, policymakers responded by providing supply side incentives to induce health-oriented grocers to open in LMI areas.
The researchers offered three policy solutions for improving LMI solar access:
1) Providing subsidies or non-financial incentives to solar installers who will site their headquarters in LMI communities.
2) Offering incentives for submitted quotes in LMI communities, rather than installed systems. The research found that increased numbers of quotes drive higher adoption, despite installers having a bias that LMI customers install solar less frequently.
3) Funding programs to train installers to understand the unique needs of LMI customers.
