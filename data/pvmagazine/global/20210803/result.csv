The project continues assessment of commercial-scale import of hydrogen from overseas sources to Northern Europe, through the port of Rotterdam “Chiyoda Corporation has developed the Spera Hydrogen technology to release hydrogen from MCH [Methylcyclohexane]. MCH is produced from toluene through hydrogenation process,” reads the note released last week. Chiyoda, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, completed in 2020 their demonstration project focused on the long distance transportation (5000km) and storage of hydrogen. MCH was produced in Brunei and shipped to Japan; toluene was then sent back to Brunei. Mitsubishi Corporation will lead the commercial development of the project. The feasibility study is expected to take one year. “It is the ambition of the companies to import 100 to 200 ktpa hydrogen in 2025 and 300 to 400 ktpa in 2030.”
The British government expects to produce hydrogen from nuclear, reads a note released last week. “A Call for Evidence, published today (29 July), sets out the government’s suggested approach to building the first advanced modular reactor (AMR) demonstrator. This will specifically explore high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) as the most promising model for the demonstration programme, which ministers are investing £170 million into delivering by the early 2030s,” reads the note, adding that “HTGRs will also be able to generate low-carbon hydrogen.” Also last week, the British government encouraged fleet operators to convert to battery-electric vehicles for road freight, while supporting Scotland’s hydrogen truck feasibility study. “It’s great news that a study involving Scottish utility, logistics companies and the University of St Andrews to design a potential trial for hydrogen fuel cell trucks and new refuelling infrastructure has received a share of £20 million UK government funding,” commented UK government minister for Scotland Iain Stewart. The UK should present its hydrogen strategy this week. Michael Liebreich, Founder of BloombergNEF and adviser to the UK Board of Trade, wrote on Twitter that “if new nuclear is to have any chance of succeeding it will be by being paired with demand-responsive processes like electrolysis or desalination. But the idea of making H2 only with excess power on sunny or windy days is daft: the economics won't work.” The Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy published last week a safety assessment of hydrogen in domestic properties and buildings, explaining that “all hydrogen appliances must be new” and that “the proposed hydrogen base case ignition probability for weak electrical sources is 0.2 i.e. a four-fold increase from that of natural gas (0.05).”
Japan’s automotive manufacturer Toyota is looking into geothermal potential for hydrogen production. “In Kokonoe Town, Oita Prefecture, Obayashi is engaged in a demonstration project for the integrated production of green hydrogen using geothermal power for the first time in Japan,” reads the note released last week. The company also entered a vehicle equipped with a developmental hydrogen-powered engine at the five-hour-long Super Taikyu Race in Autopolis (July 31 to August 1). “By entering a hydrogen-powered vehicle that uses green hydrogen produced locally in Kyushu, Toyota intends to further strengthen the hydrogen-centered partnerships it enjoys with other industries in Kyushu.”
Estonia-based PowerUp Energy Technologies, which produces hydrogen fuel cell-based electric generators and proton exchange membrane fuel cells, signed a contract with the European Space Agency to develop a 1kW liquid-cooled closed cathode hydrogen fuel cell stack for Lunar and Mars exploration missions. The closed cathode hydrogen fuel cells will be used on Lunar cargo ships (Lunar nights survival) and potentially also on rovers. “This stack would serve as an additional energy source that will be integrated with solar panels and batteries. In cases where the solar panels could not be used to charge the batteries such as during nighttime, that is when our stack will come into play. I believe fuel cell systems have a great potential in space missions to the Moon or to Mars,” Ivar Kruusenberg, CEO of PowerUP Energy Technologies, commented. The Estonian start-up reported that one of the major goals of this project is to reduce the complexity of fuel cell systems and substitute ancillary systems with non-moving parts. “While the first prototype of the stack is expected to be completed by 2023, the project has already kicked off this month,” reads the note released on Monday.
Indian automotive manufacturer Maruti Suzuki is considering hydrogen in the attempt to counterbalance its reliance on imported lithium, Maruti Chairman R.C. Bhargava told shareholders in the company's annual report. “I have no doubt that the large resources that are now being deployed for technology development will lead to lowering the cost of EVs and reducing dependence on Lithium, procurement of which poses some strategic issues of national importance,” Bhargava said, adding that the CNG and hybrid cars remain the two most promising options. “Thus, these two technologies, coupled with biofuels, gives the country a means of moving towards the final goal of net zero emission. The use of hydrogen is also an interesting alternative and should be considered specially to reduce dependence on importing lithium,” elaborated Bhargava on Monday.
US-based electric company Entergy wrote last week that it has begun the process to seek approval to construct the Orange County Advanced Power Station, a 1,215-megawatt, dual-fuel combined cycle power facility. “The plant will be located near Bridge City, Texas and will be capable of powering more than 230,000 homes and use a combination of natural gas and hydrogen,” said the company lat week. The company wants to store hydrogen in facilities such as in Entergy Texas’s Spindletop storage facility. “Southeast Texas is well-positioned to play a key role in the transition to increased use of hydrogen in electric generation,” said Sallie Rainer, president and CEO of Entergy Texas, adding that the area could become “a global hub for hydrogen production and consumption.”

The Suzhou-based company hopes to raise a total RMB2.8 billion (US$433 million) with a private stock placement and said it will retain the balance, after the fab costs, for operating capital. Maxwell said the new fab will feature 40 PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition) and PVD (physical vapor deposition) equipment production lines and generate sales revenue of RMB6 billion (US$928 million) annually. The equipment supplier said the production base will take three years to build.
Inverter maker Ginlong was able to increase its profits by 101% year-on-year in the first half of the year. The company's net result for the period was RMB238 million ($37 million) and its revenue reached RMB1.45 billion ($225 million), which represented an increase of 99.8% compared to the same period a year earlier. Ginlong said 338,000 inverters were sold in the first six months of 2021 and that its annual capacity will reach 770,000 inverters by end of 2021. Ginlong also expressed concern about the shortage of chips which limited its capability to fulfill growing market demands. The company added the chip shortage may continue in the second half of the year.
Battery raw materials company Ganfeng Lithium is preparing to move downstream with a RMB971 million (US$150 million) capital injection for its Ganfeng LiEnergy Technology Co Ltd subsidiary. The unit will include solar storage system R&D among its expanded remit, provided shareholders approve the move at an EGM at the end of the month. Ganfeng has lined up 20 public and private investors for the capital increase, led by smartphone business Xiaomi, which will contribute RMB375 million (US$58 million). And the LiEnergy unit secured a further RMB37.5 million in capital on Friday, with Ge Qiaoyu and Jiang Rongjin subscribing to that volume of stock in return for Ganfeng Lithium buying their Guangdong Huichuang lith-ion battery manufacturing business for RMB52.4 million (US$8.1 million).

These storage systems have a combined capacity of 212.1 MW and a maximum storage capacity of 333.0 MWh. This compares to 115.9 MW/186.3 MWh of distributed storage capacity at the end of December 2019 and 189.5 MW/295.6 MWh at the end of 2020.
The newly installed capacity for the first three months this year was 22.5 MW/37.9 MWh, which represents the strongest quarter ever recorded in the country for storage deployment to date.
According to the new figures, just four of the batteries are not connected to a solar power generator and most of the devices – 42,274 for a total capacity of 206.5 MW/319.1 MWh – are based on lithium-ion technologies, with the remaining share being represented by lead batteries and other unspecified technologies.
Most of the storage systems are deployed in the region of Lombardy – some 13,102 units with a combined capacity of 55.9 MW/93.6 MWh.
The regional government is implementing a multi-year rebate scheme for residential and commercial storage systems coupled with PV. The scheme is open to two different kinds of projects – installations of PV systems linked to storage systems, and the deployment of standalone storage systems linked to existing solar arrays. For the first project category, the rebates cover 50% of purchase and installation costs. This percentage could go up to 90% for projects developed by small municipalities.
The Veneto region, which is also supporting distributed storage deployment through an ad hoc scheme, has the second-largest volume of storage capacity, at 33.3 MW/57.0 MWh.

The latest version of the Photovoltaics Report produced by German research body the Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy Systems (ISE) shows the energy payback time of PV systems varies greatly depending on the geographical location.
The report authors considered the rooftop PV installation in different geographies used a typical, Chinese-made, 60-cell, mono-crystalline PERC, 19.9%-efficient solar module.
As per the report, such a PV system, mounted in India, would take only 0.44 of one year (160.6 days) to generate the amount of energy consumed during its production process, with the figure rising all the way to 1.42 years – 518.3 days – in Canada. 

The energy payback time is the period required by the PV system to produce the same amount of electricity (converted into equivalent primary energy) as consumed by during its manufacture.
The researchers considered energy needed during different stages like poly-Si, ingot wafering, cells, modules, balance-of-systems, and transport to arrive at the total energy consumption in a PV system production.
In the examples cited by the report’s authors, the balance-of-system, non-generating components of the PV system required the most time to displace their energy footprint, accounting for about 0.46 of one year (167.9 days) of 1.28-year (467.2-day) energy payback period of a PV installation in Europe.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/03/solar-powered-large-scale-microbial-food-production/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 3, 2021",Solar-powered large scale microbial food production,"Scientists at the Göttingen University in Germany have proposed to combine solar power generation with the production of microbial proteins, which they believe may be an alternative to plant and animal proteins and ensure food security while reducing land consumption. 
The production of microbial proteins, which consist of a powder that can be used as protein-rich feed for animals or as food for people, can be done by bacteria, fungi, yeast, and algae and is considered an alternative to growing conventional crops. The scientists note that a quantitative comparison between traditional agriculture and photovoltaic-driven microbial protein systems, in terms of land use and energetic efficiency, had not yet been made.
“We show that the production of microbial foods outperforms agricultural cultivation of staple crops in terms of caloric and protein yields per land area at all relevant solar irradiance levels,” the academics stated in the paper Photovoltaic-driven microbial protein production can use land and sunlight more efficiently than conventional crops, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).
The German group modeled the large-scale production of microbial biomass, which is also known as single-cell protein (SCP), by combining ground-mounted photovoltaics, air, water, and nutrients to grow the microbial proteins. Under this configuration, PV is used to convert atmospheric CO2 derived from direct air capture into microbial biomass.
First, the electricity generated by the solar plant is used to produce chemical energy that is stored in electron donors such as hydrogen, methanol, and formate. This is then converted into chemical energy stored in biomass by microbial growth. In the final filtration step of the process, nucleotides, fatty acids, and carbohydrates are discarded from the biomass and only the protein is retained.
According to the researcher's findings, the solar-powered production of SCPs requires only 10% of the land area compared to soybean, which is the most efficient plant crop. In addition, the report notes plants and animals use approximately 100 and 10,000 times more water to generate equivalent calories, respectively.
“The study calculated that even in northern climates with less sunshine, the yields of solar-powered microbial foods could far outproduce staple crops, while minimizing water and fertilizer use,” the academics emphasized. “Importantly, this production could also be located in regions not suitable for agriculture, such as deserts.”
They also acknowledged, however, that SCPs may have to deal with a difficult consumer acceptance in the food market or pressure on prices in the feed market.

The two facilities have a combined capacity of 90 kW and will benefit 273 farmers spread across the municipalities of San Isidro and Peñaranda.
The solar pump in San Isidro, which was built at a cost of PHP 17,780,519 ($356,540), will serve an area of 323.3 hectares and benefit 159 farmers. The facility in Peñaranda, for which PHP 20,461,286 ($411,940) was invested, will cover 228.9 hectares and have 114 farmer-beneficiaries.
The NIA explained that, although solar pumps have higher upfront costs compared to conventional water pumps based on fossil fuels, the new facilities will be almost maintenance-free and will work for more than 25 years.
The agency is also planning to invest in more floating PV projects, as well as hydropower, to improve the water supply for irrigation. It said last year that floating solar projects will be encouraged as they have less environmental impact during construction than hydropower infrastructure and require minimal use of heavy equipment. The Pantabangan and Casecnan dams, in the province of Nueva Ecija in the Central Luzon region, were identified as ideal locations for floating solar.
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization recently said it was seeking to support the seaweed industry on the Philippine island of Tawi-Tawi – in the Bangsamoro autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao, at the southernmost frontier of the country – through aquavoltaic projects. The organization is bringing power access to one of the least electrified areas of the archipelago, with solar-plus-storage chosen as the cheapest and most efficient source.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/03/australian-researchers-go-round-the-twist-with-latest-ultra-thin-solar-discovery/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 3, 2021",Australian researchers go round the twist with latest ultra-thin solar discovery,"From pv magazine Australia
Scientists at The Australian National University (ANU), which received $3.6 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in January as part of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics Infrastructure project, have discovered something interesting about the potential of ultra-thin 2D materials. 
Back in 2019, Hieu Nguyen and PhD candidate Mike Tebyetekerwa demonstrated the maximum potential of ultra-thin 2D materials to generate electricity using sunlight for the first time. This is to say, materials thin as a single atom capable of harvesting solar energy, a technology that could revolutionize the solar industry as well as many other industries besides. 
Last week, the two ANU scientists published a study in “Cell Reports Physical Science” in which they demonstrate a curious and exciting observation – that the ability of these ultra-thin materials to convert sunlight into electricity can be controlled by “twisting” the angle between two layers of the material. 
By themselves, a monolayer of the material can’t do much, they have to be paired in what is called “heterobilayers” in such a way that the “close interlayer spacing…of their similar hexagonal crystal symmetry” means they can be tuned with a ”wide degree of freedom.”
Tebyetekerwa, the lead author of the paper, said this discovery of “tuneable twistronics” opens up exciting opportunities. 

“This study essentially provides a bit of a how-to guide for engineers,” Tebyetekerwa said. “We’re looking at 2D materials that have just two atom-thin layers stacked together. This unique structure and large surface area make them efficient at transferring and converting energy.”
The potential of this technology is virtually limitless, and certainly not limited to solar cells, but also mobile phones and sensing devices. The materials, which are hundreds of thousands times thinner than human hair, could be coated on all types of surfaces, from phone screens to car windshields, enabling the device to power itself. 

“It’s an exciting new field,” said Nguyen, “simply twisting the two ultra-thin layers can dramatically change the way they work. The key is to carefully select the matching pair and stack them in a particular way.” 
There is still a lot of research to do on these ultra-thin, ultra-lightweight, transparent materials capable of holding high-voltage solar cells, but these researchers are proving that you don’t have to go completely round the twist to make great innovations, just a little twist is enough.

Maui has dashed ahead of Hawaii’s 2045 clean energy mandate and by 2024 may become among the first 100% renewables-powered interconnected electric transmission systems anywhere in the world .
The island has a pipeline of 175 MW of new solar-storage hybrid power plants over the next three years, adding to the almost 200 MW of solar and wind presently on the grid. This is expected to be enough power to supply Maui’s roughly 70,000 customers without using conventional generation for many hours of the year.
The Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory said it is developing and validating multi-timescale tools that are expected to help bring Maui closer to its clean energy goals.
