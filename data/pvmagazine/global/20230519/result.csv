Social media company Meta, in its ongoing quest to power all of its data centers with renewable energy, has moved into the US state of Idaho. The operator of the Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook apps has turned to a Salt Lake City-based project developer to build what could become the largest utility-scale solar project in Idaho to support its data operations in Boise, at 200 MW of power capacity.
Project developer rPlus Energies has signed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with investor-owned utility Idaho Power to install the 200 MW Pleasant Valley Solar project in Ada County, Idaho. Upon completion, the project will be the largest solar farm in the utility’s service territory. Construction is expected to begin later this year.
“The sunshine is plentiful in Idaho – and we at rPlus Energies are proud to help the state achieve a commonsense approach to energy independence and utilize the abundant energy source to its full potential,” said Luigi Resta, president and chief executive officer of rPlus Energies.
The developer won the Pleasant Valley Solar PPA through a negotiated process with Meta and Idaho Power. The PPA was made possible by an energy services agreement that will allow Meta access to renewables to support its local operations while power also goes to the utility. Pleasant Valley will deliver clean power into the Idaho Power grid and contribute to Meta’s goal of powering 100% of its operations with clean energy.
The developer has retained Sundt Renewables to provide engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services for the Pleasant Valley project. The contractor has experience in the region, and has agreed to work with rPlus Energies for 280 MW of utility-scale solar projects in neighboring state Utah.
“Meta is committed to minimizing our environmental footprint in the communities where we live and work, and central to this goal is creating, building and running energy-efficient data centers supported by renewable energy,” said Urvi Parekh, head of renewable energy at Meta. “One of the core factors in selecting Idaho for our new data center location in 2022 was access to renewable energy, and Meta is proud to partner with Idaho Power and rPlus Energies to help bring even more renewable energy to the Treasure Valley grid.”

Ayana Renewable Power, a Bengaluru-based renewable energy platform, has secured a project to supply 300 MW of renewable energy to REMCL, a joint venture between the Indian Ministry of Railways and RITES Ltd. 
Ayana Renewable Power won the capacity at a levelized tariff of INR 4.1 ($0.050)/kWh via its Project Nine Renewable Energy subsidiary, in a reverse bid auction for 900 MW of capacity tendered by REMCL. 
To supply 300 MW of round-the-clock power, Ayana will need to install around 1 GW of solar and wind capacity, supported by a storage solution. It will develop the project on a build-own-operate basis. 
“The project is a first-of-its-kind, with a high degree of availability and dispatchability, and will add installed capacity of approximately 1 GW of renewables through solar and wind to Ayana’s portfolio with third-party storage arrangements,” said Ayana Renewable Power. “This takes Ayana’s cumulative capacity in operation, maintenance, and development to nearly 5 GW.”
Ayana Renewable Power said that the project, with an annual availability of over 85%, will deliver reliable renewable energy for 25 years. It claimed that it will demonstrate the capability of RTC to facilitate baseload power instead of traditional peak-load management.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/19/denmark-hits-3-2-gw-of-installed-pv-capacity/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,DENMARK",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 19, 2023",Denmark hits 3.2 GW of installed PV capacity,"Denmark reached 3,251 MW of cumulative installed solar capacity at the end of March 2023, spread across 131,979 PV systems, according to new data from the Danish Energy Agency.
PV installations built without any subsidies and for self-consumption account for 1.72 GW of the capacity, while solar arrays under a power purchase agreement contribute 336 MW. Additionally, projects selected in public tenders contribute 248 MW, and PV systems installed under expired incentive schemes represent 938 MW.
The agency reports a newly added PV capacity of 236 MW in the first quarter of this year. In a statement, it said that developers connected more PV power generators to the grid in the first three months of 2023 than in the entire year of 2021. It also said that more than 1 GW of PV systems were installed in Denmark from March 2022 to March 2023.
“This growth comes mainly from unsubsidized large scale plants,” the agency said.
Big corporations increasingly prioritize clean electricity from solar sources, leading to the growing market share of unsubsidized large-scale PV projects. Despite the potentially lower economic profitability compared to wind power, these PV facilities continue to gain traction in the market, driven by the desire for sustainable energy solutions.
According to a recent report from Rystad Energy, Denmark is expected to lead solar development in Scandinavia, reaching 9 GW of PV by 2030. Denmark will also lead the uptake of green hydrogen, accounting for 12% of the European market, said Rystad Energy.

The government said that the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) is currently mapping the territory of the three islands to identify suitable sites for wind and solar project deployment. The funds for the development of the SDE++ program for Curaçao, Aruba and Sint Maarten will come from a €200 million ($215.3 million) budget from the National Growth Fund (NGF) that the government has earmarked for the economic development of the islands.
The first solar park of the Dutch Caribbean was inaugurated in November 2017. The 4.1 MW project, located on the island of St. Eustatius, was fully funded by the Dutch government and combined with a 5.9 MWh storage system.
Curaçao and the Dutch Caribbean were both part of the Netherlands Antilles until 2006. From 2007, however, Curaçao and Sint Maarten were granted special autonomy, while Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba became special municipalities of the Netherlands.
In the latest round of the SDE++ program, the Dutch authorities allocated 1.9 GW of PV capacity. It said that the allocated PV capacity consists of 1.051 MW for commercial and industrial PV systems, while an additional 862 MW will come from utility-scale PV plants to be constructed on land or water. Wind power projects, on the other hand, were only assigned 39 MW.
Overall, the agency has allocated 2,813 MW of capacity spread across different renewable energy technologies, as well as other technologies for CO2 capture.

“Our findings demonstrate the potential of using (n)nc-SiOx:H and (n)nc-Si:H interfacial layers in tandem solar cells to minimize reflection losses at the interfaces between the perovskite and silicon sub-cells,” said Yifeng Zhao, the lead author of the research. “Through optimizing interference effects, these light management techniques can be applied to various tandem structures.”
The perovskite solar cell, with a 19.1% efficiency, features an indium tin oxide (ITO) and glass substrate, a carbazole (2PACz) hole transport layer, a perovskite absorber, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and an aluminum (Al) metal contact.
In the tandem device, a nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) layer was employed at the recombination junction to reduce electrical shunting. The presence of hydroxyl-rich NiOx facilitated the assembly of 2PACz, resulting in reduced electrical shunts in the top cells. Additionally, an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2) and the optimization of C60 and SnOx layer thickness helped minimize reflection losses.
The champion solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.81 V, a short-circuit current of 18.1 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 75.0%.
By using (n)nc-Si:H and (n)nc-SiOx:H layers with thicknesses of around 95 nm and 115 nm, respectively, reflection reductions of 1.35 mA/cm2 and 1.51 mA/cm2 were achieved at the intermediate interfaces between the perovskite and c-Si bottom-cells, allowing for better light coupling into the bottom c-Si solar cells.
They presented the cell in “Optical Simulation-Aided Design and Engineering of Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Publications. The research group includes scientists from the Eindhoven University of Technology and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).
“This technique can be adapted to different tandem designs to realize optimal light management in tandem devices,” the scientists concluded.

BP has progressed its plans to establish 10 GW of wind and solar generation that would be used to power an export-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production facility in Western Australia with the purchase of Daisy Downs, a 22,568-hectare cropping property north of Mullewa, about 120 kilometers from Geraldton.
Daisy Downs provides about 25% of the land BP estimates it needs for the proposed Geraldton Export-Scale Renewable Investment (GERI), which would eventually comprise 10 GW of renewable energy generation capacity used to produce renewable hydrogen and convert it to a carrier such as ammonia. BP is targeting sales to domestic and international markets in the 2030s.
“What we wanted to do here was really access one big tranche of land quickly to demonstrate that we are serious about developing this project,” BP spokesman James Foley told the ABC. “It also gives us some flexibility around what we can do on the land. Wind and solar will be the main aim [but] we may look at opportunities to turn it into hydrogen on the site.”
BP said phase one of the GERI project seeks to develop about 3 GW of wind and solar with the green hydrogen and ammonia expected to be exported from the state government’s planned Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area, about 20km north of Geraldton. The company was recently granted 220 hectares of land alongside the proposed port at Oakajee as the state government looks to fast-track the development of green hydrogen projects in the area.
BP is also reportedly negotiating with landowners in the mid-west to access an additional 73,000 hectares to expand its renewable generation infrastructure further.
BP, which acquired a stake in the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) project in Western Australia’s Pilbara region last year, has set its sights on establishing a similar project in the Geraldton region based on the positive findings of a feasibility study into the potential of the area.
The latest issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
When the findings of the study were released, BP Australia President Frédéric Baudry said they confirmed the potential for scaled-up green hydrogen production in Western Australia.
“This looks particularly promising in the mid-west of [Western Australia], which has existing infrastructure, access to land and abundant renewable energy resources such as wind and solar,” he said. “Importantly, our study also confirmed strong demand from potential customers in the hard-to-abate sectors, and for both local and export markets.”

They claim the system may be a suitable solution in rural areas where transmission and distribution networks are difficult to access.
“The proposed approach adopts a load sizing factor as the key input parameter, it determines the extent to which the load demand in winter times is supplied by hydrogen to meet the seasonal imbalance,” the researchers stated, noting that the energy system is intended at serving an energy community consisting of several buildings. “In addition, a rule for selecting a proper load sizing factor to achieve the defined objectives, such as self-sufficiency.”
In the proposed system configuration, the electrolyzer is mostly utilized through surplus PV power in summer times to produce hydrogen, which is then delivered to a compressor, stored in tanks, and used for electricity production via the fuel cells in winter. Not all the surplus solar power, however, should be used to produce hydrogen, as this would increase the project's Capex.
The innovative part of the system, the research group explained, consists of the fact that it divides load demand in winter times into two parts, of which one is met by PV and battery storage, while the other one is met by hydrogen when PV generation is not available and the state of charge of the battery is below 40%.
“The PV sizing follows the approach in that annual PV generation equals annual load demand,” the academics emphasized, adding that the battery size will be strictly dependent on the days of autonomy of the energy system and the project location. “The required PV generation for producing hydrogen is determined by both the efficiency of the electrolyzer and the fuel cell.”
The Dutch group said the system should be sized in a way that loss of load probability (LLP), which it defined as the ratio between the load demand that cannot be met by the energy system in a year divided by the total annual load demand, is always equal to zero. “The lower the LLP is, the more stable and reliable the energy system is,” it further explained.
The academics conducted a series of simulations and found the system can achieve a levelized cost of energy that is still higher than the energy price in the Netherlands, although it also found that the integration of the electrolyzer and the fuel cells with the solar-plus-storage installation is able to increase the reliability and security of the energy supply.
“However, as technology advances, the costs associated with hydrogen storage tanks and electrolyzers are expected to decrease, thereby increasing the affordability of this type of energy system,” they stressed. “In addition, the efficiencies of electrolyzers and fuel cells will also improve at the same time, which will also increase the system’s overall efficiency.”
Looking forward, the scientists said they want to investigate other cheaper options than the tank for hydrogen storage and reduce the system costs. “In future work, it is worth investigating the use of heat to meet the heat demand of the end-users to help them save heat costs as well,” they concluded.
They introduced the new methodology in “An approach for sizing a PV–battery–electrolyzer–fuel cell energy system: A case study at a field lab,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.

Canadian Solar, a China-based integrated solar manufacturer and energy storage systems distributor, achieved a record-breaking 6.1 GW of solar module shipments in the first quarter of 2023, marking a 68% increase compared to the 3.63 GW shipped in the first quarter of 2022.
The company manufactures solar modules in Canada, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Brazil. In the first quarter of 2023, it reported net revenues of $1.7 billion, representing a 36% year-on-year growth from $1.25 billion in the previous year. These results align with the recent guidance range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for the first quarter of 2023.
“We started off the year strong with 36% year-over-year revenue growth and 750% increase in diluted earnings per share,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and chief executive officer of Canadian Solar. “We continue to leverage our premium brand to capture increased solar and battery storage opportunities, while laying the groundwork for future success with strategic capacity expansion.”
Group unit CSI Solar plans to list more than 540 million shares on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, an index of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The mainly residential storage and inverter business is reportedly close to concluding the initial public offering by the end of second quarter of 2023.
“We remain focused on profitable growth and continue to optimize our cost structure through vertical integration,” Qu said. “With the imminent IPO of our CSI Solar subsidiary, we will have a new platform to raise investment capital and further strengthen our leading position in solar and battery storage manufacturing.”
Recurrent Energy, the integrated company’s project development business, operated a global project development pipeline of 24.6 GW, which includes 1.7 GW of projects in construction, 17.7 GW of early- to mid-stage projects, and 5.2 GW of backlog projects.

The Dulight150 carport hosts bifacial solar panels with a power output of 590 W and an efficiency of 21.1%. It is available in four different versions with capacities ranging from 3.5 kW to 10.62 kW.
The smallest model can host six PV panels and between two and three vehicles. The largest version can host 18 panels and up to nine vehicles.
The manufacturer said the higher snow load capacity was achieved by using a structure with reinforced beams and increasing the number of pillars in front and back from 2 to 3. It also claimed that this architecture provides load-bearing performance to both the mounting frame and the solar panels.
The company began selling the system in Japan at the end of April.
Next Energy is based in Komagane, Nagano prefecture, and has been active in the Japanese PV sector since 2003. It sells and installs residential, commercial and industrial solar arrays and also distributed second-life solar panels. It also operates a solar module recycling center.

Prices for Mono M10 and G12 wafers, the mainstream sizes, plunged this week, with M10 wafers falling 9.26% to $0.696 per piece (pc) and G12 wafers diving an even more pronounced 16.02% to $0.818/pc.
Not immune to this weakness, the less-traded M6 wafers also dropped 5.17% to $0.624/pc. Mono G1 wafer prices remain unchanged at $0.666/pc while its trading remains restrained in the face of declining market share.

Chatter about the motivation behind and consequences of Zhonghuan’s latest move – a momentous price cut of approximately 15% across wafer types – dominated this week’s market survey. In the perspective of multiple sources, Zhonghuan is trying to increase its market share by undercutting its main rival, LONGi. By dropping G12 prices more heavily than M10 prices, Zhonghuan appears to be paving the way to for G12 wafers to expand its share in the overall wafer market, a source added.
Although other smaller wafer makers were surprised by the speed at which the market leader had slashed prices, it is “reasonable” according to a market participant who believes the price cuts are equivalent to the cumulative trickle-down effect of domestic China polysilicon’s price declines in the preceding months.
Given the persistent softening of polysilicon prices as production output of the raw material grows, OPIS expects wafer prices to slip further in the near term and pave the way for declining prices downstream.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The company expects to begin construction on the facility next year, as reported by the Public Broadcasting of Latvia. The plant will be situated on an agricultural surface owned by the local farmer Kotiņi.
The media outlet said that the location choice was influenced by the proximity of a high-voltage power line currently connected to Russia, which is set to be disconnected soon. Latvia has plans to transition away from Russia's high-voltage electricity lines by 2025, according to the article.
This is not the first large-scale PV project under development in the Baltic country. In January, Green Genius said it was set to build a 100 MW of unsubsidized solar in Jekabpils, southeastern Latvia. The Lithuanian renewables developer said this solar park could sell electricity to the spot market or via power purchase agreements.
Lithuania-based Ignitis announced a plan in September to invest up to €270 million ($273.8 million) in acquiring an undisclosed Latvian renewables company. The company holds the rights to develop a 200 MW hybrid wind-solar project at an undisclosed location in Latvia. Ignitis, which currently operates a 4 MW solar park in Obeniai, Lithuania, will increase its total capacity to 7.4 MW this year, according to a company spokesperson cited by pv magazine.
Latvia had 56 MW of cumulative solar capacity by the end of last year, with the majority, 49 MW, deployed in 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The country currently supports rooftop PV through a net metering scheme.

Spring brings a confluence of factors that can cause these events. Increased solar irradiance warms the ocean and land masses, creating a boundary layer of warm air. But winter-time cold airmasses have not yet fully retreated north, and if weather patterns push these airmasses together, they mix violently and a low-pressure system like Minerva can result.

On Tuesday 16th of May, Minerva was centered over Italy. Solcast was tracking the system's clouds in real-time to monitor and forecast solar production, and the rotation of the low-pressure system is clearly visible in these Solcast GHI maps. Total daily irradiance values were low, particularly in northern Italy and the west coast.

Consequently, solar PV production in Italy and the TransnetBW ISO region in southern Germany was significantly depressed from previous days. Conversely, wind power trended high, due to the intense and widespread nature of the system.
 


Solcast produces these figures via its irradiance forecasting and weather API by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1 to 2 km resolution globally using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.
