https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/01/the-mobility-revolution-iberdrola-bp-partner-on-fast-ev-charging-infrastructure/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 1, 2022","The mobility rEVolution: Iberdrola, bp partner on fast EV charging infrastructure","Iberdrola and bp have announced plans to form a strategic collaboration aiming to significantly expand fast EV public charging infrastructure and green hydrogen production. The partners have earmarked €1 billion for deploying up to 11,000 fast charge points across Spain and Portugal. The plan includes installing and operating an initial 5,000 fast charge points by 2025, and up to a total of 11,000 by 2030, including Iberdrola’s existing fast charging hubs. In addition, the companies also plan to form a joint venture for large-scale integrated green hydrogen production in Spain, Portugal, and the UK, as well as production of derivatives such as green ammonia and methanol, which could be exported to Northern Europe. The energy majors are aiming for up to 600 kilo tons per annum (ktpa) of hydrogen production capacity, integrated with new renewable power. “With this agreement, we continue advancing in the decarbonization and energy self-sufficiency through the electrification of two key sectors of our economy, transport and industry. The scale of this challenge requires alliances between companies such as Iberdrola and bp, which have the technology and knowledge necessary to help accelerate Europe's industrial development and generate, at the same time, well-being and new opportunities for all through clean energy,” said Iberdrola Chairman Ignacio Galan. Iberdrola and bp aim to finalize both joint venture agreements by end 2022, subject to regulatory approvals.
In a separate announcement, bp has pledged to invest up to GBP 50 million ($61 million) in its new global battery research and development center in Britain. Planned to open by the end of 2024, the new EV battery testing center and analytical laboratory will be located at bp’s existing global headquarters for its Castrol business in Pangbourne, Berkshire. The new facilities will aim to advance the development of fluid technologies and engineering for hybrid and fully battery electric vehicles. Used by a great number of car manufacturers today, bp’s trademark Castrol ON advanced e-fluids play a key role in managing temperatures within the battery, which enables ultra-fast charging and improves efficiency, helping EVs to go further on a single charge and extend the life of the drivetrain system. “The growth of EV fluids is a huge opportunity, and we aim to be the market leader in this sector,” Castrol CEO Michelle Jou said. “This significant new investment will now allow us to build additional strategic technologies and capabilities to further advance EV fluids for the future.” Previously, bp announced its intention to invest up to GBP 18 billion ($22 billion) in the UK’s energy system by the end of 2030.
California-based QuantumScape has built a prototype 24-layer solid state cell, up from 16 layers presented earlier this year. In its Q2 letter to shareholders, the company said that its 24-layer cell showed similar early capacity retention behavior to its single-, four-, 10- and 16-layer cells. “This is an important result because, as we have previously indicated, 24-layer cells represent A-sample candidates for some automotive OEMs,” the company said. Delivery of the A sample represents the beginning of the automotive qualification process, which involves several major delivery milestones — A, B and C samples — followed by the start of production. In the document, QuantumScape said it has agreements in place with six prospective automotive customers — “from global top-10 manufacturers by revenue to premium performance and luxury automakers, encompassing both pure EV and conventional OEMs.” To date, its main shareholder remains Volkswagen Group. QuantumScape added that the 24-layer cell is being tested in various formats, including a proprietary one in which some of its cells have achieved over 600 cycles and were still cycling. In addition, the company has reported advances in separator manufacturing and the implementation of its second-generation catholyte, which allows for discharging at ultralow temperatures of -30 C with good capacity retention. The company said it has also faced some challenges in its manufacturing processes, “from the discovery of a contaminant in our material to identifying defects introduced during the production process.” It said it has successfully addressed a number of these challenges while it continues to work through others.
Toyota Motor plans to invest IDR 27.1 trillion ($1.80 billion) in Indonesia in the next five years to produce EVs, Indonesia's economics ministry said on Wednesday. The Japanese carmaker has thus joined the likes of Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solutions to announce big investments in the Southeast Asian country, which aims to become a global EV manufacturing hub. “I believe demand for EVs whether its four-wheels or two-wheels will keep increasing in Indonesia and ASEAN,” said Indonesia's chief economics minister, Airlangga Hartarto, after a meeting Toyota's Vice Chairman Shigeru Hayakawa last week. Earlier last week, Indonesia also announced that Mitsubishi Motors planned to invest about IDR 10 trillion in Indonesia between 2022 and 2025 to produce hybrid and battery EVs.
Dutch solar car company Lightyear has welcomed Swedish manufacturer Koenigsegg as a development partner and investor. Under the technology-sharing partnership, the two automakers will share proprietary and patented information to enable the development of ultra-efficient vehicles and jointly develop new automotive technologies. Specifically, Koenigsegg's technologies will be applied to further improve the energy efficiency of Lightyear’s second model, Lightyear 2, slated to enter production in late 2024 or early 2025. Lightyear 2 is to be available as a mass-market model at prices starting at 30,000 euros, the Dutch company previously announced. The announcement of a new partnership comes only weeks after Lightyear launched the final design of its long-range, production-ready solar car. The model, which has been renamed “Lightyear 0,” has a Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) range of 625 kilometers and consumption of 10.5 kWh per 100 kilometers.  However, the Dutch startup claims that a theoretical range of 695 kilometers could be achieved, with a battery pack capacity of 60 kWh. “The optimized solar roof and holistic design mean that the car can drive for weeks, even months, without charging,” the company said.
Stellantis has seen global sales of BEV vehicles increase by almost 50% year-on-year to 136,000 units in the first half of 2022. Among all its brands, the group offers 20 fully-electric vehicles and it plans to increase that number to 28 vehicles in the next two years. The company achieved record profitability with an adjusted operating income (AOI) margin of 18.1%. In North America, Stellantis said it “achieved record profitability” in the past six months, pointing to the strong early uptake for the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, which is now said to be the best-selling plug-in hybrid in the US. Stellantis’ H1 2022 AOI margin for Europe was 10.1%, while its European Union EV market share went down to 21.2% from the previously reported 22.9 percent. Among BEV vehicles, the new Fiat 500 electric sold best in Germany and Italy, while in France it was the Peugeot e-208. The group also reiterated its plan to build three gigafactories in Europe with the help of Automotive Cells Company, Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution, as well as two more in North America.
Battery cell manufacturer Britishvolt has received confirmation from the British government that it is to receive funding to support its plan to build a battery cell gigafactory in Northumberland. “I’m delighted to confirm we have now provided Britishvolt with a final grant offer through the Automotive Transformation Fund,” UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is quoted as saying in the company’s announcement. “The Blyth gigafactory will turbocharge our plans to embed a globally competitive electric vehicle supply chain in the UK and it is fantastic to see how the project is progressing.” The total investment for Britishvolt’s Blyth Gigafactory stands at around £3.8 billion ($4.6 billion), with the overwhelming majority coming from private sources. At full production, the factory will crank out enough cells for more than 300,000 lithium-ion batteries a year. The facility is expected to employ more than 3,000 people directly and another 5,000 in the wider supply chains. In a separate announcement last week, Britishvolt said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Beijing-listed BTR for the supply of synthetic graphite and silicon oxide. The anode material supplied by BTR will be exclusively processed by hydropower and thus contribute Britishvolt’s sustainability efforts.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/01/us-solar-sector-prepares-to-meet-smart-inverter-requirements/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 1, 2022",US solar sector prepares to meet smart inverter requirements,"From pv magazine USA
US states that require smart inverters for new rooftop solar can enable more rooftop installations because smart inverters can stabilize voltage on a distribution circuit. And because smart inverters can receive communications, an aggregation of distributed storage can serve as a virtual power plant, injecting power to the grid when needed.
A handful of states already require new distributed resource installations to use smart inverters that meet a standard known as IEEE 1547-2018. As more devices that meet the standard become available, more states are evaluating such a requirement. The SunSpec Alliance expects that more than 30 states will set smart inverter requirements by April 2023 based on an examination of state regulatory dockets from the past year, said SunSpec Alliance Chair Tom Tansy in an email.
Most smart inverter manufacturers will be able to provide smart inverters to project developers and distributors sometime between March and August 2023, according to an analysis from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) authored by IREC chief regulatory engineer Brian Lydic.
That’s of special interest in states where a smart inverter requirement is expected to take effect once smart inverters meeting the IEEE 1547-2018 standard become commercially available, such as Maryland, Washington, D.C., New York and Massachusetts, as noted in IREC’s analysis. Hawaii and California already require smart inverters that meet earlier state standards, and are now shifting to the IEEE 1547-2018 standard.
IREC developed the timeline largely based on the time required to test all manufacturers’ inverters and certify them as meeting Underwriters Laboratories standard UL 1741 SB to verify compliance with the IEEE 1547-2018 standard.
IREC considered 155 representative smart inverter models to be tested, across 30 inverter manufacturers, with each representative model representing a “family” consisting of multiple models with different power outputs.
Based on survey responses from manufacturers and nationally recognized testing laboratories, IREC determined that the likely duration of each test for a single inverter family could range from nine to 12 weeks. At a nine-week average test duration, testing labs could test 85% of inverter families within 54 weeks, while a 12-week average test duration would mean testing would take 72 weeks.
After testing, 16 more weeks would be needed for a manufacturer to produce and ship the first inverters to project developers and distributors, IREC estimated.
IREC assumed that testing began in November 2021, or about a month after the latest UL 1741 SB standard was issued. Based on that testing start date, IREC estimated that 85% of manufacturers would be delivering smart inverters by the timeframe of March through August, 2023.
IREC’s analysis used industry surveys and a database of smart inverters available from the California Energy Commission (CEC). IREC expects that the database, which can be downloaded to show a data column for UL 1741 SB certification, “should provide good data on the number of certified models” as the CEC updates the list based on information provided by manufacturers.

(Toshiba EES), a unit of Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, has energized a refueling station for hydrogen vehicles in Niigata, the capital of Niigata Prefecture located in the Chūbu region of Japan.
The H2One ST Unit, which the company has already deployed across several locations in Japan, is powered by a 20 kW photovoltaic array located nearby and is intended to power fuel cell buses.
According to the company, the system is able to refill about eight hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, each in three minutes. It is also able to supply both hydrogen fuel to fuel cell vehicles and electric power by using hydrogen produced with renewable energy within the station. The hydrogen generated may also be transported in trailers and hydrogen bundles to users elsewhere in the prefecture as well as in other regions.
According to the company, that kind of installation can be deployed easily and operated by customers such as factories, harbors, airports and bus depots.
Toshiba’s energy system and solutions business began a demonstration of a holistic hydrogen supply chain for electricity generation in May 2018.

India installed 12.3 GW of solar in financial year 20221-22. Of the new additions, 10.1 GW were utility-scale and 2.2 GW rooftop (onsite), according to JMK Research’s Annual India Solar Report Card FY 2022.
The analysts expect the nation to commission 20 GW (16.5 GW utility-scale and 3.5 GW rooftop) of solar in FY 2022-23.
In FY 2021-22, overall module sales across the utility-scale, rooftop/onsite, off-grid, and solar pumping segments reached 21,086 MW DC. Chinese manufacturers supplied around 72% of the market demand. Longi Solar was the largest module supplier with a 23.4% share. It was followed by Jinko (22.3%) and Trina (14.8%).
String inverter shipments reached 11.193 MW during FY 2022, with Sungrow (27.9%), Huawei (22.3%), and Solis (12.9%) topping the sales. Central inverter shipments stood at 8,683 MW AC, with Sineng securing the top spot with a 38.4% market share. Sungrow (20%) ranked second and Fimer (19%) third.

The scientists said the new technology is similar to pumped-hydro storage, as it uses water as a storage medium and responds to the same basic mechanism, but explained that it can be used in a flat country such as Denmark, where no hydropower plants have ever been built. The new tech uses surplus power from wind and photovoltaics to pump water from a reservoir into giant underground water balloons.
According to AquaNamic, which is a Danish startup partnering on the project, a full-scale balloon may reach a size of 330 m x 330 m and, when buried under thousands of cubic meters of soil, can be raised up to 14 meters when the balloon is filled up with water in the charging phase. This balloon would reportedly have a storage capacity of 230 MWh. In the discharging phase, a valve opens and the pressure of the soil pushes the water out of the balloon and through a turbine to generate power. According to the scientists, this system has an efficiency of around 85%, which they say is in line with most pumped-hydro stations.
AquaNamic and the Aarhus University are currently planning to build a 10 m x 10 m demonstrator and have secured DKK 4.9 million ($674.147) from the Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program. “We’re about to begin analyzing, designing and testing selected critical technologies related to the membrane and to the construction of the ‘movable hill' that will form the terrain part of the battery,” said researcher Kenny Sørensen. “Naturally, we’ll have a strong focus on abrasion testing for the membrane, and we’ll need to develop a specially designed test rig to carry out lifetime tests for representative membrane solutions.”
One of the crucial aspects of the demonstrator will be assessing the extent of possible energy losses. “We want to retain as much energy in the system as possible, and this is a complex process with such a large system, which in principle will fill up every night, when the turbines are spinning and the world is sleeping, and then empty every day, when the energy is needed,” Sørensen further explained. “But every time the soil moves, the system is deformed, and these deformations contribute to the energy loss. They’re called plastic deformations. Our job is to optimize the system, using advanced calculation models.”
The new technology is also being developed in partnership with Danish wind energy giant Vestas and renewable energy developer European Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/01/surface-engineering-for-an-18-6-efficient-large-area-inverted-perovskite-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 1, 2022",Surface engineering for an 18.6% efficient large-area inverted perovskite solar cell,"When working with perovskite solar cells, improvements to stability often come with a cost to performance, and vice-versa. Finding the right balance between the two is an important goal for scientists in this field. And since the perovskite structure is versatile in both the materials it can contain and the ways it can be produced as a thin-film solar cell, there is a wealth of different approaches under investigation.
Among these is the “inverted” perovskite cell, where the perovskite cell material is deposited onto a hole transport layer, and then coated with an electron transport layer – the opposite way round to conventional device architecture. Inverted perovskite solar cells typically show strong stability, but have lagged behind conventional devices in terms of conversion efficiency and cell performance.
A group of scientists led by China’s Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics is now looking to improve performance without losing the stability advantage, primarily through surface engineering of the hole transport layer onto which the perovskite is deposited. The group worked with nickel oxide (NiOx) for the hole transport layer (HTL), which previous work has shown to have excellent stability and light transmittance, but is also prone to problems at the interface between perovskite material and HTL, particularly when devices are scaled to a larger size.
By engineering the surface of the HTL before the perovskite was applied using slot-die coating, the group was able to improve various characteristics including uniformity of the perovskite film and mechanical adhesion at the interface. The group described the approach in the paper “Surface redox engineering of vacuum-deposited NiOx for top-performance perovskite solar cells and modules,” published in Joule.
It was able to demonstrate small-size perovskite solar cells that reached conversion efficiencies of 23.4% (rigid device) and 21.3% (flexible). And when scaled up to a larger area of 156 mm x 156 mm – similar to that of a crystalline silicon cell – the approach maintained efficiency of 18.6%. The group did not share stability figures, but stated that each device maintained high performance after “thousands of hours under various stressed conditions.”
“The SRE strategy provides a proof of concept for combining vacuum-fabricated charge transport layers with wet-processed perovskites and facilitates the stacking engineering of large-scale, uniform thin films for the development of efficient and stable perovskite modules,” said Liu Shengzhong, a scientist with the Dalian Institute who led this research.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/01/photovoltaic-thermal-panel-with-overall-efficiency-of-83-via-mxenes-nanofluid/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 1, 2022",Photovoltaic thermal panel with overall efficiency of 83% via MXenes nanofluid,"Scientists at the Ulster University in the United Kingdom have demonstrated a photovoltaic thermal panel (PVT) that relies on a heat transfer fluid (HTF) based on water and two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXenes. Earth-abundant MXenes compounds take their name from their graphene-like morphology and are made via selective etching of certain atomic layers from a bulk crystal known as MAX.
According to the researchers, the MNenes particles are able to considerably enhance the thermal conductivity of the base fluid and the heat transfer enhancement of the panel. Their numerical simulation was conducted on a module with a size of 1,640 mm × 200 mm × 5 mm and a sheet-and-tube absorber geometry consisting of a glass cover, an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sheet, a photovoltaic panel, another EVA sheet, a Tedlar sheet, an absorber sheet, and an absorber tube.
The UK group considered different varying concentrations of MXene nanofluid at 0.01, 0.1, and 0.2 wt%. “The upper limit of MXene nanofluid concentration was selected from literature based on the optimum concentration that generates better thermophysical property improvement with a minimum viscosity enhancement,” it explained.
The academics compared the performance of the module with that of a panel with a heat transfer fluid based on water and a module with a fluid using ethylene glycol (Eg). They performed the simulation by varying mass flow rates while keeping constant inlet temperature, and solar radiation. Thermal efficiency, electrical efficiency, heat transfer coefficient (HTC), and pressure drop were the key parameters of their analysis.

The panel based on MXenes showed the highest percentage enhancement in thermal efficiency by 17% over the water-based system. “The highest thermal efficiency of 67.49% was reported with 0.2 wt% MXene nanofluids,” the scientists said. “Around 63% and 60.4% thermal efficiency were shown by MXene nanofluids of 0.1 and 0.01 wt%, respectively. Increasing the mass flow rate of 0.2 wt% nanofluid by 60 kgh−1 produced about a 21% increase in the thermal efficiency of the system.”
The MXenes fluid also contributed to the highest increase in photovoltaic efficiency, which was 15.94% and was achieved by a 0.2 wt% nanofluid concentration. “However, the corresponding increase in electrical efficiency of N-PV/T was only about 0.65%,” the research team noted. “The highest overall energy efficiency attained by N-PV/T with 0.01, 0.1, and 0.2 wt% MXene nanofluid was calculated to be around 76, 78, and 83% at 90 kgh−1. Also, the outlet temperature was found to decrease with the flow rate.”
Their analysis also showed that the new nanofluid may help reduce the module size by 14.5%. “The highest size reduction (14.5%) was found to be possible with the 0.2 wt% MXene nanofluid,” they emphasized. “Corresponding size reduction of the system achieved with 0.1 wt% and 0.01 wt% was calculated to be 7.8% and 4.45%, respectively.”
They presented the module in the paper “Numerical investigation and feasibility study on MXene/water nanofluid based photovoltaic/thermal system,” published in Cleaner Energy Systems. “For practical implementation of N-PV/T additional cost would be incurred on setting a secondary heat exchanger, long-term stability maintenance steps, and safe disposal,” the academics stated. “Hence, the proposed efficiency enhancement of the MXenes-based PVT needs to compensate for the additional expenses compared to conventional PVT.”
