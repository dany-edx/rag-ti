Solar Greener has developed a novel hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) bifacial panel with a maximum electric output of 530 W and a thermal capacity of 1,280 Wh.
The photovoltaic unit is based on 144 monocrystalline PERC cells and has a power conversion efficiency of 20.7%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius.
The PVT panel measures 2,094 mm x 1,038 mm x 3.5 mm and weighs 43 kg. It uses a water pump to circulate water behind the module uniformly. This cools down the panel temperature, with excess heat being moved to a heat exchanger. The latter is then connected to a boiler, producing hot water.
The company said the panels have an overall dual electrical efficiency of 26%, due to module cooling and a thermal efficiency of 55%. The recommended module retail price is €40o ($437.60).
“We are installing the system in a boarding school in Israel,” CEO Peter Graner told pv magazine. “We are installing 60 panels producing 9,000 liters of 60 C water daily. In addition, those panels will produce 52,470 kWh per year.”
Graner said the company will install an additional 150 panels on boarding schools later this year. This will be the company’s first commercial project, although it has launched a number of pilot projects over the past five years.
Dan Halperin, the company's VP of business development, said that while the panels are now only available in Israel, the company is seeking global partners to further expand.

Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) have emerged as one of the alternatives to lithium-ion battery technology that now dominating the renewable and stationary energy storage market. However, the development of the technology faces major challenges due to chemical corrosion, which severely limits the ability of such batteries to recharge.
The benefits of AZB chemistry are attributable to the energy-dense zinc metal anode and aqueous salt solution electrolytes. But their incompatibility, which results in chemical corrosion of the anode, effectively reduces the cycle life of the battery cell.
A team of researchers from the UNSW School of Chemical Engineering say they have developed a solution that addresses the corrosion issue, improving the battery life span by five to 20 times, the equivalent of pushing the lifetime from a few months to more than three years.
Researchers Yuan Shang, Dr. Priyank Kumar, and Dr. Dipan Kundu said they spent three years working on the solution, which involved adding small concentrations of organic compounds to the battery electrolyte.
The researchers have now revealed that adding a 1% concentration of 1,2 butanediol to the electrolyte addresses the corrosion issue and effectively reduces the dendritic zinc deposits that otherwise short-circuit the battery cell.
The outcome of their work, recently published in Advanced Materials, is a five to 20 times improvement in the battery cycle life under conditions suitable for beyond-lab-scale development.
The research team said the solution preserves the aqueous nature of the electrolyte, maintaining cost and safety benefits of AZB technology and the results are approaching that of competing lithium-ion batteries.
Kundu said AZB technology could provide “a cost-effective and reliable storage option for industries like mining, construction, and telecommunications.”
The UNSW has estimated that a fully developed technology would cost consumers around one-third to one-fourth the price of the present-day lithium-ion systems.
“The AZB technology can be implemented as energy storage systems at various scales, from small-scale residential/commercial and medium-scale community storage units to large-scale grid-level installations,” said Kundu.
The UNSW team said it is continuing to work on developing the technology with an eye on developing battery cell prototypes and is seeking funding to develop a spinoff focused on commercial development.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/09/building-bridges-between-east-and-west/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA,ITALY",,"JANUARY 9, 2024",Building bridges between East and West,"From pv magazine 12/23-01/24
FuturaSun was founded in 2008, in the medieval town of Cittadella in Italy’s Padova province. After a phase of original equipment manufacturer production and international sales of Chinese-made PV modules, the company opened a 1 GW module facility in Taizhou, in China's Jiangsu province. FuturaSun makes modules for large-scale arrays and rooftop PV systems, as well as building-integrated PV products and solar components. With a European base in northern Italy and Asian headquarters in Suzhou, China, steady growth has opened an exciting phase of upstream expansion with solar cell production in Huai’an, in Jiangsu province. That city of five million inhabitants is in the same province as FuturaSun’s headquarters and module production facilities.
A new industrial complex is being realized in two phases that will house 15 GW of solar cell production. The first-phase of construction will finish in 2023 with the first cells due in early spring 2024.
The lightning-fast development is the result of a unique support system the Chinese government offers those companies it deems worthy after stable growth, and which have a solid business case and strong project team. Chinese cities and district governments can offer support to jump-start enterprises considered important for the region. FuturaSun should generate jobs and tax revenue and attract more businesses to expand the supply chain and boost regional knowledge.
The support package includes the provision of land, construction finance, and access to state-related investment. Repayments can be made over a designated period. The land will be leased for at least 30 years and may be renewed.
The land and buildings can be used as collateral for loans and other finance. That is a big difference from European financial arrangements, where collateral to back finance has to be provided by a company. While it could be argued that the Chinese approach is only possible in a planned economy, the West could still learn from the arrangement.
Success for an individual enterprise is not guaranteed and it is ultimately up to the company itself to realize its dream. The government does not provide free money and does not support a failing company; enterprises in China can – and regularly do – go bankrupt. Although the USA and China often focus on their differences, the striking resemblance between the two financial ecosystems is that both systems enable rapid and large-scale entrepreneurship due to a willingness to “burn cash” in large amounts. In Europe, financiers tend to be more cautious and risk-averse, resulting in smaller projects with much longer lead times that are also subject to complex decision making processes and bureaucracy.
It can be difficult to keep up with the speed and scale at which China expands its production capacity, especially in the field of photovoltaics. The nation’s large size gives economy-of-scale effects that result in lower production costs. Large-volume production gives more stable processes, resulting in higher yield and efficiency. Scale also enables substantial investment into research and development.
There is the human factor as well. It is difficult to compete with a nation of highly educated, highly motivated people that work more or less around the clock amid an environment featuring rapidly increasing automation, rising quality levels, and an excellent knowledge base. While Europe discusses a four-day working week, China populates R&D laboratories 24/7 and moves forward at lightning speed.
FuturaSun is making use of the unique opportunities offered in China while maintaining and expanding its strong base in Italy. It is building bridges between East and West. The company provides a welcome counterpoint to what has become a more strained relationship between China and Western countries. FuturaSun’s plans include developing new headquarters in Suzhou plus a considerable expansion of its module production capacity, an R&D center, and a new office building.
In Cittadella, a piece of land has been acquired for a new Italian headquarters and for a gigawatt-scale module production facility to be erected. The company has also invested in the startup Solertix, a spin-out from Rome’s Tor Vergata university that specializes in the development of perovskite modules.
FuturaSun has engaged in a partnership with German PV research institute ISC Konstanz and licensed its Zebra technology for back-contact solar cells. Zebra cells will be produced in the new cell factory in Huai’an and incorporated into state-of-the art modules in Cittadella.
Earlier in 2023, I had the pleasure of visiting several suppliers of production equipment for solar cells and modules for FuturaSun’s new production plant. In my role as the company's technical adviser, I was asked to assess quality and the industrial readiness of the different systems and processes available. In what I experienced as an intense two-week road trip, the team and I visited several suppliers and manufacturers per day, traveling all over the region.
Technical meetings alternated with official receptions and banquets with local government to learn about support programs and opportunities offered by different regions. Government officials proactively try to invite businesses in the renewable energy industry to invest in their region and even compete – sometimes fiercely – with other regions.
The speed and scale of things I witnessed were mind-boggling. From maximum 30-day decision-making periods on big projects advertised by some local governments, to machine-building companies that can assemble the equivalent of 40 GW of modern solar production equipment per month, to the construction site of a well-known tier one PV manufacturer we visited. This is where, in less than nine months, a 600,000 m² green field was being transformed into a fully operational multi-gigawatt factory complex for cells and modules.
On leaving the site, where newly erected buildings were still visibly missing windows, and excavators and other machinery were crisscrossing the location, we passed by a whole range of production equipment that was already waiting to move in on a seemingly endless line of trucks. I remembered that many years ago, I visited companies in China that were visibly struggling with quality and organization. Today, a very different picture emerges. The latest factories are clean, well-organized, and efficient. The scale and speed of development are hard to grasp.
The leading turnkey company, for example, has already supplied 400 GW per year of production equipment to market for tunnel oxide passivated contact cells, the latest in commercial crystalline silicon technology. And that in little more than a year. In its workshops, endless rows of machines are assembled by thousands of workers.
I left humbled and impressed by what I had seen. Europe struggles to bring back part of the value chain for the production of renewable energy products – items that should be, and are, fortunately, now increasingly regarded as highly strategic and critical for national safety and survival. Now all Europe needs to do is to put cash to work as it can vicariously learn from its neighbors to the east and west.
Bringing back the solar industry requires bold entrepreneurship and huge, potentially risky, investment. Only sufficient scale, hard work, and clever innovation can bring back an industry that can be competitive and, ultimately, successful in today’s globalized market. To achieve that, Europe should try to cooperate with China rather than exclude it or revert to blunt protectionism. The greatest strength lies in joining forces.

The Hydrolution EZY heat pump is available in two versions, with outputs of 10 kW and 14 kW.
The systems use difluoromethane (R32) as the refrigerant and can ensure “exceptional performance,” even at temperatures as low as -25 C, according to the manufacturer.
“The integrated water heat exchanger in the outdoor unit simplifies installation compared to the split-type systems, which requires both refrigerant piping and water piping,” it said in a statement.
MHI Thermal Systems also said that the new heat pumps feature an unspecified improved anti-vibration technology.
“This structure effectively reduces sound power levels, including noise, to 60dB (A) in the 10kW class model, even when running at full capacity,” it said. “Additionally, the addition of a quiet mode, further reducing operational noise, ensures compliance with various noise regulations, particularly important in densely populated residential areas.

We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
MHI Thermal Systems also claims that the new product can produce domestic hot water with temperatures of up to 60 C when outdoor temperatures hit -25 C. It did not provide additional technical details, however.
In March 2023, MHI Thermal Systems unveiled a residential air-source heat pump using propane (R290) as the refrigerant.

They surveyed 32 solar park plots and 32 adjacent control plots in Slovakia during a single breeding season.
“We selected ground-mounted photovoltaic power plants with an area of at least 2 hectares,” the researchers explained. “All of the studied solar parks had fixed-tilt solar racks, one of which also had panels mounted on biaxial trackers, and were developed at least eight years earlier. Seventeen solar parks were developed on arable land, and 15 parks were developed on grassland.”
The scientists visited each plot twice, each time surveying it with binoculars for 20 minutes, and recorded all the birds that could be seen or heard. They were then classified according to species, population trends, nesting places, diet, and foraging strata. The plots were also classified for elevation, previous land use, land type, and vegetation management.
Overall, the academic group spotted 353 individuals of 41 species in the solar parks and 271 individuals of 40 species in the control plots. Black redstart, European stonechat, white wagtail, and Eurasian tree sparrow were identified as species most strongly associated with solar parks.
According to the research group, bird species richness, diversity, and invertebrate-eater species richness and abundance were higher in the solar parks than in the control plots. Among the reasons provided by the research group is the food availability for insectivorous birds, as the PV panels attract various species of water-seeking aquatic insects.
“As food availability and accessibility is low in winter, it can be assumed that solar parks can have a positive impact on farmland birds outside the breeding season, as they can serve as stopover, foraging and roosting sites during migration and wintering as the ground under the solar panels can remain snow-free in winter,” the academics explained.
Another possible reason suggested was the higher structural diversity of solar parks.
“We observed that the support structures of the solar panels were used as nesting sites by the black redstart and the white wagtail, the Eurasian tree sparrow nested in the support structures of the panels made of pipes, while the stonechat nested in the uncultivated or extensive vegetation under the solar panels or next to the fence,” the researchers added.
They also stressed that the solar parks considered for the study were designed and managed for renewable electricity production only. “Therefore, it can be assumed that the biodiversity benefits would be even greater if they were managed synergistically with a stronger focus on wildlife,” they concluded.
They presented their analysis in the study “Solar parks can enhance bird diversity in the agricultural landscape,” published in the Journal of Environmental Management. The research was a collaborative work of scientists from Slovakia’s Slovak Academy of Sciences, Gemer-Malohont Museum, Comenius University in Bratislava, Catholic University in Ružomberok, Slovak Ornithological Society/BirdLife Slovakia, and Belgium’s University of Antwerp.

Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) holds huge potential for the future of the building industry, as it represents a pivotal intersection of electricity generation and building functionality. However, to identify the potential of BIPV installations in detail, the need for an evaluation tool becomes apparent. Recognizing the multifunctional nature of BIPV installations—acting as electricity generators, building components, and contributors to visual aesthetics—the IEA-PVPS Task 15 adopts a multidimensional approach for comprehensive evaluation.
Defining and Rating of Performance Indicators
To assess the quality and efficiency of BIPV systems, a set of performance indicators (PIs) was established in four categories: Economic, Energy-relevant, Environmental, and Optical/Visual Appearance. The PIs range from BIPV building element costs to recognizability and glare risk (see Figure 1).
Image: IEA-PVPS
Subsequently, a numerical rating system, ranging from 1 to 5, was established for each performance indicator. The process involved defining possible ranges based on real installations, setting a scale for each PI, calculating mean-rated PIs for each category, and visualizing the results in a newly developed diagram format (see Figure 2 for an example). This step ensures a quantifiable and comparative analysis of diverse BIPV installations.
Image: IEA-PVPS
Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Tool
The heart of the methodology lies in the Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Tool. This tool requires specific data on installation sites (geographical, climatic, orientation, inclination, shading), PV modules (datasheet), BIPV installations (application and system category, sub-system, building type, total installed area and total nominal power of the BIPV building skin, photos), and rated performance indicators. By combining general information and performance indicators, stakeholders can assess the multifunctional performance of a BIPV installation in terms of energy, economy, environment, and visual appearance.
Harmonized vocabulary for BIPV installations
To ensure a standardized approach, a harmonized vocabulary for BIPV installation types has been developed by IEA PVPS Task 15 experts. This optimized hierarchical approach serves as a reference for the classification of BIPV building envelope technology, facilitating a comprehensive breakdown into individual parts (see Figure 3).
Image: IEA-PVPS
Multi-Functional Evaluation of BIPV Cases
To validate the tool, real BIPV installations representing various building typologies were identified. These included a multifamily apartment complex with a camouflaged BIPV facade, an office building with BIPV elements, BIPV roofs of terrace houses, and a multifamily apartment block with BIPV parapets and window balustrades. Experts conducted a preliminary analysis of representative building typologies to test and validate the methodology. The assessment covered BIPV facades, roofs, and external devices. Results showcased the tool's efficacy in providing a comprehensive understanding of BIPV installations, including visual performance.
Challenges and Difficulties
The journey towards a comprehensive BIPV evaluation methodology was not without challenges. Issues such as data availability, the subjective nature of aesthetic assessments, and the evaluation of lighthouse projects were encountered. Despite these challenges, the methodology underwent several improvement iterations, providing valuable insights into real-world applications.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
IEA-PVPS Task 15's multidimensional assessment methodology for BIPV systems represents a significant step forward. Through continuous learning cycles and real-world testing, the challenges posed by data availability, visual assessments, and project evaluation have been addressed. The methodology, showcased through real BIPV installations, serves as a valuable resource for architects, developers, and stakeholders involved in the design process of BIPV projects. As the BIPV landscape continues to evolve, this innovative evaluation approach paves the way for more effective and sustainable integration of photovoltaics into building structures.

Three months earlier it began construction of a 12 GW TOPCon cell manufacturing plant in Huai’an, Jiangsu province. This factory was originally planned to have a capacity of 10 GW.
Futurasun CEO, Alessandro Barin, told pv magazine that the higher nameplate capacity for cell production is the result of two elements, specifically the “untapped potential for technological advancements in current production equipment” and the prospect of integrating “two additional production lines, strategically enhancing the original project blueprint”.
“The announcement was based on the projected efficiency of the cells, which increased in the meantime. There will be two identical 6 GW plants side by side, each with ten lines of 600 MW,” Barin stated.
Civil works have been completed with the next major works commencing after the Chinese New Year, which is in mid-February 2024. “The teams in China are very good at scaling up. Building large-scale manufacturing is their strength,” said Barin.
When asked about progress on its €25 million ($26.4 million) plan for a 2 GW European module factory in Cittadella, Italy, announced early last year, Barin indicated the project is still being considered.
“We bought the land in Italy. The costs of going to the next step, however, are discouraging. No state support from Italy or Europe is evident. We are doing the homework, feasibility studies and preparing to apply for Innovation Fund, but it is a complicated process, and costly for a privately-owned company,” he said, adding that he is more optimistic about doing R&D in Italy.
“I could see building an R&D hub in Rome, leveraging the Solertix acquisition to be able to attract talents from around the world,” said Barin, referring to Futurasun’s June acquisition of Rome-based Solertix, a perovskite solar cell startup that was spun out of the University of Rome Tor Vergata.
“We can do a lot to build up intellectual property around cells, modules, inverters, with the industrial-scale manufacturing in China,” he also stated.

The expanded agreement with Qcells makes Microsoft one of the world’s largest purchasers of renewable energy. Qcells agreed to supply Microsoft with 12 GW of solar modules and EPC services over an eight-year period. This expands the 2.5 GW module and EPC agreement reached a year ago.
Qcells, a global supplier of complete clean energy solutions, announced an eight-year strategic alliance with Microsoft. The tech giant wants to cover all of its energy needs with renewable energy, and plans to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030.
Through what is Qcells’ largest module and EPC agreement to date, the two companies intend to bring an estimated 1.5 GW of solar panels a year to projects Microsoft has contracted through 2032. This is estimated to be enough to power more than 1.8 million homes a year.
“We are pleased to be a part of such a substantial commitment that will accelerate the global shift to renewable energy solutions,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Qcells. “Qcells is uniquely positioned to ally with Microsoft towards creating a clean, sustainable future because of our investment in building an American-made solar supply chain.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/09/covering-sahara-desert-with-solar-plants-may-increase-cloud-cover-in-surrounding-regions/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,NORTHERN AFRICA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 9, 2024",Covering Sahara desert with solar plants may increase cloud cover in surrounding regions,"An international research team has investigated the potential impact of deploying photovoltaic solar farms in the Sahara Desert on atmospheric circulation and global cloud cover in an effort to estimate potential issues arising from changes in land surface properties.
The scientists sought to demonstrate that solar farms deployed in the Sahara may result in atmospheric circulation changes and perturbations to the global cloud fraction and surface downward shortwave radiation (RSDS), which is the sum of the incoming solar energy over the earth's surface in the shortwave spectrum.
The academics explained that solar plants in arid regions may amplify regional climate response through local atmosphere-land and vegetation feedback processes. “In North Africa, reduced surface albedo and feedbacks trigger localized warming and convection,” they stated. “This leads to surface convergence, and subsequently a positive geopotential height and divergence at the upper troposphere over North Africa.”
The scientists considered three different scenarios in which the Sahara desert is covered by solar plants with percentages of 5%, 20%, and 50%. It conducted a series of simulations via the Earth system model (EC-Earth), which simulates the physical, chemical, and biological processes that govern the Earth system, at different levels of complexity.
“EC-Earth reasonably reproduces several key dynamic processes relevant to this study, such as the atmospheric general circulation and monsoon system, atmospheric teleconnections, and clouds in the tropics and the mid-latitudes over land,” they said.
Through their analysis, the researchers found that the 5% scenario may see a “limited significant” regional climate response over North Africa and the Sahel region, while the 20% scenario may see a larger impact reaching Southern Europe and the Southern Arabian Peninsula.
The 50% scenario will be that with the largest impact, with the increased annual mean cloud fraction reaching also India, North Asia, and Eastern Australia. “Conversely, decreased cloud cover is observed over Central and South America, South Africa, Central & Eastern United States, Central Asia and Northwestern China,” the scientists stressed.
They presented their modeling in the paper “Large-scale photovoltaic solar farms in the Sahara affect solar power generation potential globally,” published in communications earth & environment. “More in-depth analyses and sensitivity simulations considering various scenarios combined with multiple Earth system models which overcome these limitations can shed more light on the impacts of this particular anthropogenic land use and land cover change,” they concluded.
The research group comprised researchers from the Guangdong Ocean University, the Tsinghua University and the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in China, the Lund University and the Stockholm University in Sweden, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and the Western Sydney University in Australia.

In the week of Jan. 1, solar energy production decreased in most major European electricity markets compared to the previous week. The German market registered the largest drop of 33% while the Italian market registered the smallest drop of 7.7%. The Iberian Peninsula was the exception as solar energy production increased by 4.0% mainly due to a 22% increase in the Portuguese market. On Jan. 7, the Spanish market generated 80 GWh with solar energy, marking the highest production using this technology since the end of November last year.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s production forecasts, solar energy will increase in Germany, Italy and Spain in the week of January 8.


As for wind energy production, in the first week of 2024, it registered increases in most major European electricity markets compared to the previous week. Italy led the increases with 246%. The Spanish market also registered a significant increase of 157%. The French market had the smallest increase of 1.1%. Despite this, on Jan. 2, France generated 402 GWh with wind energy – the highest daily value in the historical series. Although the German market was the leader in wind energy production among the analyzed markets during the week, it registered a 23% decrease compared to the production of the last week of 2023.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts, production with this technology will drop in all analyzed markets in the week of Jan. 8.

Electricity demand
Major European electricity markets registered an increase in electricity demand during the week of Jan. 1 compared to the previous week. It was anticipated that demand would recover after Christmas celebrations the previous weeks. Among all analyzed markets, the British market registered the largest increase, reaching 20%. The Spanish market registered the smallest increase, 1.8%.
In the first week of 2024, most analyzed markets registered decreases in average temperatures. These decreases also favored an increase in demand. Decreases ranged from 1.3 C in France to 2.6 C in Germany. In contrast, in Southern European countries, average temperatures were less cold. Increases ranged from 0.3 C in Italy to 2.2 C in Spain.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts, the trend will continue and electricity demand will increase in all analyzed markets in the week of Jan. 8.

European electricity markets
In the week of Jan. 1, prices in most major European electricity markets increased compared to the previous week. The exceptions were the IPEX market of Italy, with a 14% decrease, and the MIBEL market of Spain and Portugal, with a 23% drop. On the other hand, the EPEX SPOT market of Germany registered the largest percentage price rise, which was 222%. In the rest of the markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices rose between 49% in the N2EX market of the United Kingdom and 163% in the EPEX SPOT market of France.
In the first week of January, weekly averages were below €85/MWh in almost all analyzed European electricity markets. The exception was the Italian market, which reached the highest average, €100.01/MWh. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €58.88/MWh in the Spanish market to €83.13/MWh in the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries.
As for hourly prices, the German, Belgian, French and Dutch markets registered negative hourly prices on Jan. 1 and 3. On Jan. 1, the British market also registered negative prices. However, these negative prices were not as low as those reached in these markets during the previous week. On the other hand, on Friday, Jan. 5, from 16:00 to 17:00, the Nordic market price was €254.58/MWh. This was the highest hourly price since December 2022. The MIBEL market registered the lowest daily prices between January 5 and 7, which helped it to have the lowest weekly average compared to the rest of the main European markets.
During the week of Jan. 1, the general increase in electricity demand led to higher prices in European electricity markets. The fall in solar energy production in countries such as Germany and France and the decline in German wind energy production also contributed to the price increases. However, the significant rise in wind energy production in Italy and the Iberian Peninsula favored lower prices in these markets.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the second week of January, prices might continue to rise in European electricity markets. The recovery in demand and the general decline in wind energy production might contribute to this behavior.

Brent, fuels and CO2
On Tuesday, Jan. 2, Brent oil futures for Front‑Month in the ICE market registered their weekly minimum settlement price, $75.89/bbl. The rest of the week, prices were above $77.50/bbl. On Friday, Jan. 5, these futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, $78.76/bbl.
In the first week of January, instability in the Middle East exerted its upward influence on Brent oil futures prices. Production disruptions in Libya also contributed to the price increase. However, the announcement of price cuts by Saudi Arabia might exert a downward influence in the second week of January.
As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, on Tuesday, January 2, they continued with the declines of the last sessions of the previous week. On that day they reached the weekly minimum settlement price, €30.57/MWh. According to data analyzed by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was the lowest since the first half of August 2023. As of Wednesday, Jan. 3, prices started to increase. As a result, on Friday, Jan. 5, TTF gas futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €34.55/MWh. This price was 6.8% higher than the previous Friday.
In the first week of January, the forecast of a cold snap in Europe had an upward influence on TTF gas futures prices. However, at the beginning of the second week of January, forecasts of milder temperatures, abundant supply and still high levels of European stocks might exert a downward influence on the prices of these futures.
As for CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2024, during the first week of January, settlement prices were lower than those of the previous week. On Wednesday, Jan. 3, these futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €77.35/t. In the following session, they fell by 2.0% to €75.82/t. This was the minimum settlement price for the first week of January.

Auxin Solar, a small solar panel manufacturer with operations in California, has filed a lawsuit against the CBP and Department of Commerce for failing to collect fees and credits from solar imports related to antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) laws.
Auxin began a long saga related the enforcement of AD/CVD on solar goods imported to the United States when it filed a petition alleging that four Southeast Asian nations were in violation of trade laws.
Solar component suppliers in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia, responsible for roughly 80% of the US supply at the time, were alleged to be in violation of harboring tariff-dodging goods from Chinese manufacturers. Goods found in violation of AD/CVD laws can be assessed with tariffs as high as 50% to 250%.
In June 2022, President Joe Biden issued a moratorium on solar tariffs, pausing any collection of fees for two years. The move came as solar industry advocates pleaded with the administration to halt tariffs, citing a great deal of uncertainty and solar project delays and cancellations related to the financial risk of tariff assessments.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/09/dutch-team-completes-african-overland-adventure-in-a-4x4-electric-skoda/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JANUARY 9, 2024",Solar helps Dutch team complete African overland adventure in electric Skoda,"A Dutch team intent on showing that “it is possible to implement sustainability in everybody's daily lives” travelled over 38,000 km by electric car from the north to the south of the African continent and back. They used solar panels they brought with them to make up for a spotty charging infrastructure.
Maarten van Pel and Renske Cox left the Netherlands in November 2022 to circumnavigate the African continent. They travelled 38,238 km. The journey took 14 months with 1225.5 hours of driving. “Of our total trip through Africa we used 43% solar,” Renske Cox told pv magazine.
The Morocco to Capetown leg of the trip used solar 54% of the time, sourced from their 60m2 of solar panels with 10.8 kW capacity. “The rest of the energy was charged with wall outlets, and sometimes custom made 3 phase setups,” said Cox.
The team took sixty 180 W solar panels made by Austrian module manufacturer DAS Energy on the road. Each weighs 3 kg/m2 and measures 1/10 the thickness of conventional panels, according to Cox.
They traveled in a Skoda Enyaq iv80 built in 2021 with a 77 kWh battery that is chargeable with either AC or DC power.  Its default range is 537 km, but fully loaded for the expedition with all-terrain tires, a tent, storage box and solar panels, the range was 400km, according to Cox.
It was not a luxurious trip. The two slept in a rooftop tent and turned the expedition vehicle into a self-sufficient home for the duration. They had to curtail the last part of the journey as the North East was deemed too dangerous at the time. The car had to be shipped from Kenya to Greece to be able to complete the final leg.
Locating uninterrupted sunny ground for the panels at an angle with good irradiation was a challenge they met along the way. “When we started our expedition in Morocco in November, the optimal angle for our solar panels was roughly 60 degrees. This was really steep, so we had to be creative,” according to the team's logbook. They found a clear space on a hill and used pegs from home to hold the panels in place. Related challenges they noted: shading caused by leaves, animals, and smoke.
The video below shows the team packing up the panels.
 
The Enyaq was equipped with 460 W of custom vehicle-integrated PV (VIPV) panels based on 135 Maxeon-Sunpower back-contact cells from Dutch specialist Mito Solar. They were installed on the hood, rooftop tent, and rooftop storage box to power the team’s appliances, such as an induction cooking stove, fridge, lighting, and water pumps, as well as to charge electronics. “The panels of Mito Solar charged a separate 3 kWh battery in the car,” said Cox.
A prototype of a custom-designed DC-DC converter was connected to the panels to charge the car battery on the road. It minimized the amount of equipment needed but it also decreased the energy losses due to switching to AC and back, according to Renske.
“Normally about 20% of the energy is lost due to switching from DC to AC and back. Other people interested in solar travel have expressed interest in the solution, as well as those who want to charge a car at their home without energy losses, so now we are working on a consumer version with Mito Solar,” said Cox.
To complete the journey using fossil fuel would have required 2,669 liters of petrol.
