Spanish start-up Tornasol Energy has launched a solar kit to enable flexible PV power generation on balconies, terraces, awnings, caravans and boats.
The kit consists of one or two modules, a microinverter, and a five-meter cable. Thanks to its plug-in technology, it can be connected to any electrical outlet and immediately begin generating electricity.
The company sells a 300 W kit including only one panel, at a price of €450; and a 600 W kit, including two modules, at a price of €790.
The offer also includes the mounting structures to hang the panels on a balcony railing.
“The idea came from our own experience. Seeing the trend in the cost of electricity, we wanted to rely on solar energy by installing panels on our balconies but the bulky conventional panels we found did not allow it,” said Santiago Vernetta, co-founder of the company. “It was then that we decided to investigate [creating] kits that would allow a more versatile use.”
According to the company, the solar panels are flexible and easy to handle, and they connect directly to any socket feeding the home network. Tornasol Energy is currently working on including batteries in the kits.
*The article was updated on December 7, to reflect that the kit does not include Sunpower-branded PV modules, as we previously reported. The previous version was based on information taken from Tornasol's website, but Sunpower has stated that the modules that are shown in the wepage are not its own products.

Wärtsilä said it booked the order, for an unnamed client, last month, and will supply its GridSolv Quantum modular lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) battery system plus its GEMS Digital Energy Platform energy management system.
The company said the system would be used to regulate the electrical grid by providing services including reserve power, frequency control response, capacity dispatch and voltage support.
The storage set-up is expected to be active in the final three months of next year. Wärtsilä did not reveal the value of the contract.
Quoted in a press release issued today by Wärtsilä to publish the order, energy business director for Europe Pekka Tolonen said: “This project is notable for Wärtsilä as our first project in Belgium to date, and another important milestone on adding state-of-the-art flexibility to the power system. We see a major opportunity and paramount need to increase deployment of energy storage in Europe … to harness the full benefit of intermittent renewable energy across the continent.”

French highway operator Vinci Autoroute, a unit of France-based infrastructure company Vinci Group, is partnering with solar project developer Tryba Energy to build a ground-mounted PV facility along the A19 motorway, on a five-hectare area located near the town of Chantecoq, in the Loiret department of the Centre-Val de Loire region of northern-central France.
Once operational, the grid-connected plant will produce an average of 6,100 MWh annually, which is equivalent to the consumption of around 1,500 households in the area.
The €4 million project is being financed by Tryba Energy with its own funds and is scheduled for commissioning by the end of 2023.
It is part of the Vinci Group's plan to develop unused areas close to the motorways operated by Vinci Autoroute.
Similar projects and technologies, for solar plants located near highways, are currently being developed in Israel, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, India, Austria and South Korea.

With Germany accounting for 70% of the home batteries installed in Europe last year and the biggest five markets – also including Italy, the U.K., Austria, and Switzerland – cornering 93%, SolarPower Europe expects France to supplant the latter in an otherwise identical line-up in 2025.
Net metering programs which encourage home solar owners to export excess power to the grid, rather than storing it in a residential battery, will continue to hamper growth in the Netherlands and Belgium, even if both EU member states are slowly moving away from such systems. The picture is even bleaker in Eastern Europe, according to the report – published yesterday – with cheap, often fossil fuel-fired electricity coupled with a lack of policy support.
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The important role policymakers can play in driving sales was spelled out by a bald statement in the report which referred to the negotiations under way in Germany to form a new coalition government. With the study positing low, medium and high scenarios out to 2025, the authors wrote: “A new German coalition government without Conservatives is likely to push developments towards [our] high scenario.” The same would also be true if the Green party is part of the new cabinet, the report later added.
Describing Germany as “the European power house in both residential solar PV and residential battery storage systems,” the document stated the nation added 749 MWh of home batteries last year, to account for the lion's share of the 1,072 MWh installed as Europe's home battery market breached the gigawatt mark for annual installs for the first time.
That is perhaps not surprising given the highest-quality home solar-plus-storage systems in Germany can offer a levelized cost of energy of as little as €0.122/kWh, around a third of the typical retail electricity price in what is an expensive power market. Those economics ensure around 60% of the new residential solar systems installed in Germany at the moment are accompanied by batteries.
SolarPower Europe is predicting a surge of retrofitted batteries to bolster the market from this year, as the first of the solar arrays to benefit from 20-year feed-in tariffs introduced by renewable energy law the Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG) in 2000 begin to expire.
The report's medium expectation (neither Greens nor Conservatives in government, perhaps?) estimates Germany will add 1,181 MWh of home batteries next year, followed by annual returns of 1,402 MWh, 1,577 MWh, and 1,793 MWh for 5.95 GWh of battery capacity installed between this year and 2025.
The 90,000 or so battery systems added in Italy last year ensured Europe's number two home storage market added 94 MWh of capacity, some way behind Germany but bolstered by the extension, to 2023, of the Covid-recovery ‘super bonus‘ incentive which offers a tax rebate of 110% of the value of residential solar and storage systems provided they are keyed to more substantial building energy-efficiency renovations. Italy is expected to add 625 MWh of new battery capacity between this year and 2025, according to the study's authors.
If SolarPower Europe is ready to offer pointers to the politicians horse-trading for Bundestag influence at the moment, it was also ready to contribute thoughts on the U.K. – Europe's third biggest home storage market – with the trade body lamenting “political uncertainty remains high in the U.K. these days,” thanks to Brexit.
Around 11,000 residential batteries were installed in the U.K. last year, according to the report, despite the lack of solar feed-in tariffs, but the ability of energy users to maximize returns from batteries is crippled by the poor roll-out of smart meters. The devastation being wreaked among new-entrant energy companies in the country, thanks to rocketing gas prices at the moment, could present another obstacle and the section of the SolarPower Europe report praising the “high stage of liberalization” in the U.K. energy market already looks out of date as fears rise only the ‘Big Six' energy companies will survive, following the demise of Bulb – the nation's seventh largest energy company – this week.
Still, the document forecast the U.K. will install 500 MWh of batteries from 2021-25.
Austria, which could introduce a new solar and storage grant by the end of the year, added around 6,000 residential batteries last year, for around 41 MWh total storage capacity, and is expected to add 304 MWh for the 2021-25 period.
The only change in the top five European markets expected by SolarPower Europe in 2025 concerns France overhauling Switzerland, with homeowners warming to the technology despite the low electricity prices in the former country that are largely down to its extensive nuclear fleet. Supportive policy will see France add 178 MWh of home storage capacity in the 2021-25 period but, SolarPower Europe added, Switzerland will still be a promising market and there is potential too in Spain, Ireland and Czechia.
With the trade body predicting the EU will need 1.6 TWh of small-scale ‘distributed' energy storage by mid century to reach a net zero economy, SolarPower Europe has called upon the legislators working on a pending EU battery regulation to take into account device carbon footprints and recycled content, as well as “due diligence,” which could relate to supply-chain workers' rights.
In an interesting aside for the solar industry in the report – which will be updated annually – the trade body said it expects the current rising prices for solar panels and batteries to be a temporary blip on a longer term, downward pricing trend “as supply chains adapt” to post-Covid shocks. The situation will ease from the second half of next year, according to SolarPower Europe.

In 2020, the budget for the scheme was RON252 million.
The program is being run by Romania’s Environment Fund Administration (AFM), the state funding body for environmental protection. It provides rebates for installations larger than 3 kW in size, which cover up to 90% of the array costs, provided that the grant does not exceed RON20,000 for conventional projects and RON25,000 for projects in isolated areas.
Applications may be submitted by homeowners, through their installers, by December 16.
The scheme had been temporarily suspended last year, due to alleged fraud that the Romanian authorities are currently investigating. In February, the Romanian government had introduced new provisions to improve the installation process and settlement of rebate payments under the scheme.
Romania's net metering regulations, which apply to all systems up to 100 kW in size, include fiscal incentives for owners of PV systems with capacities of up to 27 kW. Under the scheme, owners of renewable energy power systems are entitled to sell power surplus to the country’s four power distributors – Enel, CEZ, Eon and Electrica – at a rate that is set by the energy regulator ANRE, depending on the distributor.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Romania had 1,387 MW of solar installed at the end of 2020, which is 11 MW less than the capacity it had at the end of the previous year.

The floating structure is hosting 80 kW of solar modules and was deployed in Heraklion, on the Greek island of Crete. It is claimed to withstand 12m-high waves and wind speeds of up to 27m/s without suffering any damage.
“Sinn Power’s Ocean Hybrid Platform is a seaworthy solution suitable for near shore and offshore applications and ready for reliable and economical operation,” the company said in a statement, noting that the installation relies on solar modules with IP68 junction boxes and smart-grid forming power electronics for floating hybrid systems.
“The Ocean Hybrid Platform (OHP) is particularly suitable for European green ports and marinas, tourist resorts on coasts and islands and for nearshore solutions for floating industries, such as aquaculture, substituting diesel generators,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine. “Besides applications at sea, the OHP is suitable for electricity generation on freshwater bodies in stormy regions. Future applications are complementation of offshore wind parks and offshore hydrogen production.”
According to the manufacturer, the platform can be used in a modular approach to build floating solar facilities with a combined capacity of up to 10 MW.

The system can also be powered by wave energy converters, depending on the maritime conditions and power demand. Furthermore, each of the corner points of the platform can host small wind turbines of different sizes, in a modular configuration. The small scale wind turbines are provided by German specialist Luvside. 
The facility has a size of 6x12m and can be equipped with adjustable buoyancy for different load scenarios. The anchoring specifications depend on a project's size and water body. The structure fences are made of maritime aluminum and each floating body consists of a polyethylene segment, a connection hub, and a belt. The support buoys are said to enable a corrective movement of the platform and reduce tension within the entire structure.
“Sinn Power has successfully carried out real-life tests in Heraklion and actively markets its innovative solution to project developers worldwide,” the company stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/24/cop26-and-solar-satellites-for-net-zero-emissions/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",COP26 and solar satellites for net-zero emissions,"The conference remained more focused on emission reductions than on the provisions of support by developed countries to developing countries as outlined in a summary by UN-Energy. It highlighted key recommendations and milestones towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 – Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all – and net-zero emissions from the Ministerial Thematic Forums, key elements of the global roadmap  that included:
The COP26 conference made history for being the first climate summit to explicitly include the “phasedown of coal” in its decision and laid out new rules for carbon market mechanisms commonly referred to as Article 6. This was following a recent analysis estimated that the world would save around US$300 billion annually by 2030 if a global carbon market were in place.
World's first partnership for an interconnected solar grid, known as the Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG) was also launched by the International Solar Alliance (ISA), India Presidency of the ISA, the U.K. COP Presidency in partnership with the World Bank Group at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, an ISA statement said. The announcement was accompanied by the One Sun declaration.
COP26 resulted in commitments for billions of investments in climate finance and the phase-out of coal-fired generation in the coming decades, alongside an increased urgency to control greenhouse gas emissions to control global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.
COP26 was widely billed as a critical event for securing meaningful commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Countries put forth emissions-cutting targets, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), above pre-industrial levels, far in excess of the 1.5C set out in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
The UNFCCC updated its synthesis of countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The revised NDC synthesis report (FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/8/Rev.1),  updated key findings of the full report and confirmed a projected increase in global emissions in 2030 for all available NDCs, which may lead to a global average temperature rise of about 2.7°C by the end of the century.
According to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit’s Net Zero Tracker, Canada, Denmark, the EU, France, Germany, Hungary, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the U.K. have signed net-zero commitments into law, with Germany and Sweden aiming to reach carbon neutrality already by 2045. Chile, Fiji, and Ireland have proposed net-zero legislation. Forty-five countries, including major emitters such as China and the U.S., have net-zero goals reflected in policy documents, and almost 80 are considering targets.
According to the UNFCCC, 733 cities, 31 regions, 3,067 businesses, 173 of the biggest investors, and 622 higher education institutions have also pledged to “race to zero.”
This year’s Emissions Gap Report found that the “latest climate promises for 2030 put the world on track for a temperature rise this century of at least 2.7°C,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UN Environment Programme (UNEP). He added that countries “need to make their net-zero pledges more concrete, ensuring these commitments are included in NDCs, and action brought forward”  by the end of 2022. (Previously, countries were asked to submit new pledges every five years.)
Currently, six of the world's highest CO2 emitting countries – China, the U.S., EU, India, Russia, and Japan – are investing and developing Solar Power Satellite (SPS) systems to produce clean energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year without the atmospheric, day/night light interference. And based on a new study from the Frazer-Nash Consultancy, on behalf of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the U.K. which left the EU may be joining this list as a feasible solution to cutting the country’s carbon footprint.
SPS is the collection of solar energy in space and its wireless transmission for use on Earth or other bodies. The growth of the global SPS market has been propelled by the implementation of strict government regulations concerning environmental pollution and a rise in investment in sustainable power generation.
Currently,  China is taking the lead in SPS by building the Bishan space solar energy station in the southwestern city of Chongqing. It is expected to begin tests by the end of the year to build on experiments in beaming energy over vast distances.
According to a report published by Allied Market Research, the global space-based solar power market garnered $425.7 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $902.2 million by 2030. $100 million of this funding came from a single source: billionaire Donald Bren and his wife to the California Institute of Technology to help make space-based solar photovoltaic power from orbit a reality. The laser transmitting solar satellite segment comprised the largest market share in 2020, contributing to more than half of the total share, and is expected to maintain the lead throughout the forecast period.
Dr. Paul Jaffe, an electronics engineer who has investigated SPS systems for the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has summarized his recent space solar power beaming experiments in a report which concludes that power beaming offers a range of benefits for space applications to address a wide range of distances.
But “so far, there has not been a power beaming demonstration in orbit spanning > 1 meter with > 1% end-to-end efficiency. Therefore, creating a power beaming link that exceeds these modest thresholds is the logical next step in SPS technology. Because, implementing SPS might result in a clean, constant, and globally distributable energy supply — unmatched by any earth-bound source,” he said, adding. “Anything we can do to wean ourselves off of coal and fossil fuels is a step in the right direction” he added.
Nevertheless, he cautions: “For space solar to work, it will almost certainly need to offer some compelling advantage in a given application before it can compete on cost. There are several segments involved: launch, manufacture of the space and ground portions, and the industries associated with each. The logistics will be challenging.”

German utility RWE is set to sell solar developer Belectric to Czech power utility CEZ Group.
According to the German Federal Cartel Office, which is currently reviewing the transaction, CEZ will buy all shares and take full control of the German developer.
“It is correct that RWE is currently selling parts of Belectric,” an RWE spokesperson told pv magazine. “The transaction has yet to be approved by the relevant authorities.”
Founded in 2001, Belectric is one of the largest EPC companies for photovoltaic power plants in Germany. In 2017, the photovoltaic project developer became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Innogy. In the course of the far-reaching transactions between RWE and Eon, it was transferred to RWE in 2020 and has been part of RWE Renewables since then.
The sale of Belectric by RWE is part of a plan to streamline its renewable energy business. Last week, the energy company announced an investment offensive for wind power, hydrogen and storage. RWE intends to invest €50 billion by 2030 and, among other things, increase its installed photovoltaic capacity worldwide from around 1 GW to 8 GW.
According to the company, the sale of Belectric has no impact on its ambitious growth plans in the solar sector. “We will invest massively in this technology,” the company stated. “We concentrate on the development and operation of systems – but not on construction, for which we will hire service providers.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/24/swedish-utilities-are-competing-to-buy-distributed-solar-power/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",Swedish utilities are competing to buy distributed solar power,"Swedish power utilities and electricity traders are increasingly competing to buy solar power from residential and commercial PV systems in a rally to secure large portions of prosumers as their clients for years to come.
“Usually, in Sweden, residential prosumers buy more energy than they produce and, by offering them a contract to buy excess electricity, utilities not only secure clients for the future but they may also take the opportunity to sell or lease them their own PV solutions,” Amelia Oller Westerberg, PV market analyst at Swedish consultancy Becquerel Sweden told pv magazine.
“The proactiveness of electricity traders started, already, in 2011, and more and more utility companies now have various offers for the micro-producers' excess electricity, their green electricity certificates, and guarantees of origin,” Becquerel Sweden founder Johan Lindahl added. According to him, the offers and compensation vary between the utilities and most of them have in common that the micro-producer is a net consumer of electricity during a year and buys electricity from the utility company. “It can be considered a sort of unique case in Europe, as utilities and traders usually tend to see solar customers as a source of income erosion, while Sweden is showing this is not always the case,” he further explained.
A historical policy landscape rewarding self-consumption has resulted in a market dominated by distributed PV systems, where installers and homeowners are increasing the self-consumption rate of their projects in order to maximize the higher value of the self-consumed kilowatt-hour, compared to the price for electricity injected, as surplus, into the grid. “Currently, residential and commercial PV projects generally have a self-consumption rate of around 30-50%,” Lindahl went on to say. “Excess power can still be sold to electricity traders, and homeowners are paid with a feed-in premium on top of the energy prices.”
According to the two analysts, utilities and traders are offering different rates for surplus electricity and this market is characterized by transparency and fair competition. “PV system operators can find offers that entitle them to a higher price for the excess electricity than the Nord Pool spot price,” Oller Westerberg explained. “Especially if you are buying the PV system from the utility.”
In a recent study, a group of scientists from Sweden's Chalmers University of Technology examined the solar business strategies of 30 Swedish electric utilities and found that their behavior is mostly influenced by incentives and pressures related to corporate strategies and the external environment.
They also ascertained that the availability of proper infrastructure is the main factor ensuring the success of a power provider in the solar business while horizontal alignment with corporate strategy and marketing goals was pointed out as another decisive dimension. Furthermore, they considered demand, policy, and availability of potential partners as a third combination of factors having an impact on a company's plans to operate in the PV sector. According to them, a strong misalignment in one of those three factors can make the solar business difficult to implement.
“In contrast to previous literature, we find that horizontal alignment is not the main driver for solar model adoption,” the authors of the paper stated. “Instead, a model needs to fit a utility's corporate strategy and allow it to respond to external threats or opportunities in order to be adopted.” They concluded that incumbent utilities are not only able to participate in the distributed generation market but they are also well-positioned to implement potentially disruptive business models.
“What the Swedish example and this study, in my opinion, show regarding utilities' PV businesses is that if only a few incumbent utilities in a liberalized electricity market start to promote attractive offers for private prosumers, many more will follow when these private prosumers have positive examples to compare with,” Oller Westerberg added.
For the last ten years, Sweden has offered rebates for residential PV systems but the subsidy scheme closed for new applications in July 2020. It was replaced by a tax reduction for green technologies that reduces a PV system cost by 14.55% of the total capex for private persons. Additionally, Lindahl explained, there has also been a tax credit scheme in place since 2015 for PV systems with a capacity of up to 69 kW. These two schemes, along with the payments by utilities and traders, should ensure the Swedish rooftop solar market will have no disruption. “Even commercial projects exceeding the 69 kW threshold have good chances in the current market environment if they can ensure higher self-consumption rates,” he went on to say.
According to the latest IEA-PVPS National Survey Report of PV Power Applications in Sweden, authored by Lindahl and Oller Westerberg, the SEK0.60/kWh (€0.059) tax credit that is currently being given to PV installations of up to 69 kW can be considered as a second feed-in premium payment for surplus energy fed into the network, exactly like the grid-compensation tariffs that are paid by grid operators to PV system owners when they feed in electricity to the low voltage grid. “The compensation shall correspond to the value of the energy loss reduction in the grid that the excess electricity entails,” the report read. “The compensation varies between different grid owners and grid areas and is typically between SEK0.02 (€0.002) and SEK0.10/kWh.”
According to the Swedish Solar Association – Svensk Solenergi – the number of pre-registrations of PV systems in 2021 has increased by 43% in the first three quarters, compared to the same period in 2020. Its forecast is that about 34,000 new PV installations will be deployed in 2021, in addition to the 66,000 systems that were operational at the end of 2020.
At the end of 2020, the county had an installed PV power of 1.09 GW.

The result, which the researchers said is a world record for the CZTS PV technology, improves the cell's previous record efficiency of 11.4%, which they achieved in November 2019. In 2013, Japanese manufacturer Solar Frontier had obtained a 12.6% efficiency but this was obtained on a cell measuring just 0.4cm².
The Korean group said the cell was improved by utilizing a heteroatom doping optimization technology, without providing further details. In its previous announcements, it has said the cell is based on a novel, seven-layer thin film structure which they found offered superior performance to a more standard three-layer film in terms of efficiency and large area uniformity.
“Our research achievement has presented ways to secure the uniformity of large-area process, which can cause issues in commercialization,” said the paper’s lead author, Kee-Jeong Yang, at the time. “We will be able to advance the commercialization of [a] next-generation solar cell which is applicable in various fields, such as building outer walls.”
In its latest announcement, in which the efficiency world record was disclosed, the DGIST said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Korean manufacturer SolarFlex Ltd to start commercial production of the solar cells. “The cooperation not only includes the collaboration for the commercialization of the thin-film solar cell technology, but also the joint research related to the development of original technologies, such as tandem technology, for achieving further high efficiency of the solar cells,” the research institute added.
SolarFlex currently operates a 10 MW factory in South Korea.
Solar cells based on copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) have attracted plenty of attention in recent years thanks to their reliance on cheap, abundant, non-toxic materials and their resulting potential for low-cost production.
Thus far the efficiencies achieved with various combinations of such materials have lagged well behind the achievements of silicon and other technologies, with leading research groups struggling to surpass the 10% mark, even on smaller laboratory devices.

JSC Korem received 14 project proposals with a combined capacity of 60 MW in the procurement exercise and prices ranged from KZT16,96 ($0.0392) to KZT12,87 ($0.0297)/kWh.
The winning project is a 20 MW solar plant proposed by Kazakh developer NextEcoEnergy PTE LTD LLP, which submitted the lowest bid in the auction.
The country's Ministry of Energy said in a statement that another 20 MW solar auction will be held in 2022.
In 2020, JSC Korem allocated 55 MW of PV capacity in two different procurement exercises. The lowest final prices of the two auctions were KZT14.99/kWh and KZT14.58/kWh, respectively. Two projects, totaling 40 MW, were secured by Russian module manufacturer Hevel Solar.
In the first solar auction, held in 2018, JSC Korem selected four PV projects totaling 170 MW and the lowest bid was KZT18.6/kWh. In a second, 50 MW procurement exercise held a year later, the total allocated power was 50 MW and the lowest price was KZT12.49.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Kazakhstan had an installed solar power generation capacity of around 1,719 MW at the end of 2020. Most of this capacity – around 570 MW – was deployed in 2020 alone. Several more projects were built outside the country’s auction scheme over the past years.

Tata Power Solar, a unit of Indian conglomerate Tata Power, is set to close a deal with the Tamil Nadu government for the construction of a 4 GW vertically integrated solar cell and manufacturing unit in the state, according to local media outlet Times of India, which said the factory will likely be located in Gangaikondan, near Tirunelveli.
“The investment by Tata would be around Rs 3,000 crore (US$403 million) with an employment potential of 2,000 locals,” Times of India reports, citing Tamil Nadu government sources.
Currently, Tata Power Solar operates a solar cell and module manufacturing facility in Bengaluru. In April, it expanded its cell and module manufacturing capacity at this factory with the addition of new lines to produce high-efficiency monocrystalline PERC solar modules. 
The manufacturer has added 230 MW of mono PERC capacity to its 300 MW cell plant and 180 MW of half-cut mono PERC capacity to its existing 400 MW production setup. With this, it has reached an aggregate capacity of 530 MW for cells and 580 MW modules.

With solar module prices surging due to increased raw material and shipping costs coupled with China’s lingering energy crisis, many Australian installers are reportedly having trouble delivering on their project commitments.
The situation has led Australia’s only manufacturer of solar modules, Tindo Solar, to release a stockpile of 1000 panels to the wholesale market. The Adelaide-based company says it opted to release the stocks “to help installation companies who are facing the prospect of cancelling their pre-Christmas installs because they can’t access China-sourced panels.”
“We’ve been fielding calls for more than a month, with solar installation companies desperate for panels,” Tindo Solar’s Chief Executive Officer, Shayne Jaenisch, said. “Not only are they faced with not enough panels to fulfil their installations, but the panels they can buy are 30 to 50% more expensive than they were mid-year.”

Jaenisch said installers are being warned by wholesale panel suppliers that the current conditions will get worse, a sentiment mirrored by One Stop Warehouse’s Head of Product Procurement and Marketing, Andy Cheng, who told pv magazine Australia last month that prices would continue to rise into 2022.
China is the world’s largest solar supplier, dominating not only panel manufacturing but the entire upstream supply chain. Which means the ramifications of the country’s energy crisis combined with shortages of polysilicon and price hikes for solar glass, aluminium and other materials (which have risen between  9% to 35% since the first quarter of the year) have been felt globally.
Australia, as Cheng noted, is in a particularly delicate position though, competing for stock against Europe and the United States – both of which are far bigger markets and better able to absorb the pricing turbulence. Adding to that, Australia doesn’t have what one would call a diversified portfolio – sourcing around 80% of its solar panels from China, according to the Clean Energy Regulator.
One of China’s largest solar manufacturing companies, Longi, said it is working to secure supply to Australia. According to the Managing Director of the company’s Australian arm, Stephan Zhang, Longi’s vertical integration has allowed it to weather the current storm better than smaller outfits.
Longi recently refocussed on its longterm partnership with One Stop Warehouse, Australia’s largest solar distributor, saying it had signed an agreement with it to guarantee a significant supply of solar modules to Australia in 2022.
Longi said it was able to do so because it creates all of the key components that go into its modules, rather than purchasing them from third party suppliers. As such, it said, Longi Solar Australia is able to make sure that they have enough stock for their Australian customers.
Coming back to Tindo Solar, Jaenisch said as Australia’s only manufacturer, the company has received an “overwhelming number of enquiries” as industry turns to it for stock. In response, Tindo is releasing 30 Pallets (33 panels per pallet) of its Karra330P modules. The wholesale-only release includes a 25-year product warranty at the standard pricing of $221.10 per panel ($0.67 per watt). Jaenisch said Tindo Solar is already looking at further release of 500 panels, given the demand.
Tindo Solar is currently in the process of commissioning its new factory in Adelaide which will have almost three-times the output of its old factory, if only it were ready now!

An affiliate of Hydrostor filed an application for a 400 MW / 3200 MWh long duration energy storage (LDES) project with the California Energy Commission (CEC). Hydrostor deploys compressed air energy storage, a technology that is able to store and dispatch energy for long durations.
As the region’s 2,200 MW Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is set to retire in 2024/2025, the LDES project has a target for commercial operation date as early as 2026. The project is expected to have a capital investment of around $800 million.
LDES technologies are viewed as important components in an evolving grid that features a growing share of renewable energy. They provide reliability services, and are hailed for their synergies with the weather-driven generation cycles of renewables.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process for storing and dispatching energy. It first compresses off-peak or surplus energy from the grid, producing heated compressed air. Then, the heat is extracted from the air stream, and stored inside a thermal store, preserving the energy for later use. The compressed air is stored in a tank that uses a process called hydrostatic compensation to maintain constant pressure during operation.  When the energy needs to be dispatched, pressure forces air to the surface, where it is then recombined with heat, and sent through a turbine, producing dispatchable electricity.
The company said its technology has a 50 + year system life, uses no toxic materials, is emissions-free, and can provide rotational inertia in support of grid stability.
The plant, named the Pecho Energy Storage Center, will be able to deliver 400 megawatts of electricity for 8 hours, and will be comparable in physical size to some of California’s largest fossil fuel power plants. It is planned to interconnect at an existing 230 kV PG&E Morro Bay Switching Station, strategically located to serve California’s central coast.
The Pecho Energy Storage Center is expected to create 30 to 40 permanent, full-time jobs, and 200 to 450 labor jobs during construction. 
In June, the CEC said it would procure 1,000 MW of LDES, with duration of eight hours or longer, to be activated between 2026-2028. LDES technologies are continuing to take stage in the climate discussion, with an international LDES council formed at the recent COP26 summit. The council projects a need for 85 to 140 TWh of global LDES by 2040 to meet decarbonization goals, which could entail an investment of $1.5 to $3 trillion.
