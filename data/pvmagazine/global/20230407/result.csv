Sydney-listed Tivan said it has signed a letter of intent with AAPowerlink Australia Assets, a Sun Cable subsidiary, for the supply of 200 MW to 300 MW of solar-generated electricity. The capacity could be used to power a “state-of-the-art” minerals processing facility to be built in Darwin, Australia.
Sun Cable, which entered voluntary administration in January – following an “absence of alignment” among the shareholders – aims to develop one of the world’s largest integrated renewable energy generation, storage and transmission projects. It will include the supply of up to 800 MW of renewable electricity to Darwin.
The Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) project proposal involves building up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage in the Northern Territory's Barkley region, along with a 5,000-kilometer transmission network to supply Darwin, Singapore and Asian markets with renewable electricity.
While the future of the AAPowerLink project has been clouded since Sun Cable abruptly entered administration, Perth-based Tivan said its one-year deal with the developer will see it progress commercial and technical discussions towards the potential offtake of up to 300 MW of renewable electricity from the project.
The solar-generated electricity will be used to power a facility to be built at the Middle Arm sustainable development precinct for processing minerals from Tivan’s flagship vanadium, titanium and iron ore project at Mount Peake, being developed about 235 kilometers northwest of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.

They shared their findings in “Power balance control and dimensioning of a hybrid off-grid energy system for a Nordic climate townhouse,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.
The team considered four scenarios for improving the energy efficiency of the building in Lahti, southern Finland, consisting of 18 apartments with a total heated area of about 1,100 square meters. A scenario with a 45 kW air-source heat pump and a 78 kW electric boiler (EEO); another with a 45 kW ground-source heat pump and a 33 kW electric boiler (EE1); another with a 79 kW ground-source heat pump (EE2); and finally a scenario with a 15 kW ground-source heat pump, 16 kW electric boiler, 15 kW heat recovery ventilation, and additional insulation of the roof, as well as renewal of windows and doors (EE3).
They simulated an off-grid PV-powered system with a fuel cell, battery, and hydrogen energy storage (HESS) for each scenario and studied the impact of waste heat on the dimensioning of the system’s components. The researchers created a calibrated energy simulation model of the current building with the IDA ICE 4.8 building performance simulation software. The PV generation was simulated in PVsyst, while the entire system modeling tool was created with Excel and MATLAB.
The fuel cell is supposed to act as a secondary energy source in winter when solar PV generation is reduced or inexistent. The waste heat generated in both the fuel cell and the HESS electrolyzer is intended to be recovered for space and domestic hot water heating. “The primary heat source in the tool is waste heat, followed by a heat pump and, if necessary, an electric boiler,” the academics said, noting that waste heat is prioritized because its temperature more closely matches the temperature requirements of domestic hot water.
Results show that scenario EE0 requires a 325 kW PV system, EE1 and EE2 300 kW, and EE3 265 kW. Waste heat can purportedly significantly reduce the component dimensioning of the PV-powered systems. On average, the dimensions of the battery storage system (BESS), the fuel cell, the electrolyzer, and the HESS are reduced by about 20%, 37%, 51%, and 28%, respectively. The reductions in component dimensions between EE0 and EE3 are about 33% for BESS, 41% for the fuel cell, 27% for the electrolyzer, and 22% for the HESS.
“Waste heat recovery from the fuel cell and the electrolyzer reduces the need for heat generation by other heat sources, which affects the electricity consumption when the heating is based on a heat pump,” the scientists explained. “As a result, the load profile of electricity changes, and both the peak powers and the energy demand of electricity are reduced.”
The team calculated that the 30-year lifecycle cost of the off-grid systems would be between €2.3 million ($2.5 million) and €4.3 million and concluded that “the cost is very high and unprofitable compared with a grid-connected system.” They also noted that special safety considerations must be taken into account if a HESS is used in a residential setting.

The report is an updated version of the Integral Infrastructure Outlook 2030-2050, which is a study produced by Dutch consultancies Berenschot and Kalavasta. It outlines four growth scenarios for a climate-neutral energy supply by 2050, based on four different policy outcomes.
The “regional scenario” forecasts the largest expansion of PV, up to an astonishing 180 GW of installed capacity. In its previous version, this scenario envisaged “just” 125 GW. The installed solar capacity would come from 58 GW of utility-scale PV and 125 GW of rooftop systems, of which 67 GW on commercial and industrial buildings and 58 GW on residential buildings.
This scenario is characterized by a high level of energy system electrification and a decline in industrial activity, with the country becoming self-sufficient in terms of power supply. Gas would still have a role as backup supply, or in the form of green gas from local biomass and green hydrogen from wind and solar generation. Wind is expected to reach 60 GW, while backup power would expand up to 20 GW.
Under the “national scenario,” the central government will take the lead in the energy transition, with utility-scale renewables to account for a larger share than distributed generation. Wind is expected to reach a total installed capacity of 92 GW, while solar would hit 172 GW, with backup power reaching 18 GW and hydrogen 15 GW.
The “European scenario” involves the theoretical introduction of a CO2 tax at the EU level. The Netherlands is expected to remain an importer of energy under this outlook, with a preference for clean energy of European origin.
Solar deployment is expected to reach 126.3 GW, of which 35 GW would come from ground-mounted solar plants. Total demand is expected to be much higher than in the regional and national scenarios.
The “international scenario” assumes a completely open international market, with a strong climate policy at the global level. The Netherlands would not be self-sufficient and would continue to depend on imports.
“Renewable energy is generated on a large scale at strategic locations worldwide,” the experts said, noting that solar capacity would reach 100 GW. “This means Netherland will mainly implement offshore wind, because this can compete internationally on price because of the favorable conditions in the North Sea.”
The researchers said that residential PV will be able to feed 55% of the maximum peak on the grid in 2040. Solar parks and other solar generators would account for the remaining 45%.
The Netherlands reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 16.5 GW at the end of June 2022, according to the most recent statistics released by CBS, the nation’s statistics agency. It also said the nation installed 3,803 MW in 2021 and 3,882 MW in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/07/cadmium-telluride-pv-windows-for-domestic-hot-water-production/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ROMANIA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 7, 2023",Cadmium telluride PV windows for domestic hot water production,"Photovoltaic Windows (PVW) has developed a domestic hot water system powered by cadmium telluride (CdTe) semi-transparent PV glass. It claims the system works off-grid without the need for an inverter or storage. The solution is especially suitable for apartment buildings and can reportedly be installed without approval from an electricity supplier or building permits.
The CdTe thin-film PV glass is manufactured by China-based Advanced Solar Power (ASP) and is available in transparencies of 10% through 90%. The 90% transparency glass has a nominal power of 8 W while the glass with 10% transparency has a nominal power of 76 W. The PV glass measures 1,200 mm x 600 mm x 7 mm, has a surface area of 0.72 square meters, and weighs 12 kg. The temperature coefficient is -0.214% per degree Celsius and the operating temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
“Depending on the available surface area, orientation, location, and the chosen degree of transparency, these systems can provide more than half of the domestic hot water needed by a family of 3 to 4 people for a year,” PVW’s administrator Adrian Baisan told pv magazine. “The operating principle of such systems is based on the fact that resistors (heaters) work equally well in direct current (from the photovoltaic windows) or alternating current (from the grid),” he explained. “This eliminates the need to convert the current produced by the photovoltaic windows into alternating current, as long as the domestic hot water requirement is not completely covered by the photovoltaic system.”
The company completed a pilot installation on the balcony of a high-story apartment building in Bucharest last December. The project was developed in two stages. The first stage included 3 PV glasses of different colors and transparencies and one small 15 liter/1.2 kW water heater. The second stage added 11 PV glasses, nine with 30% transparency and two with 10%, and one water heater with 80 liters/3 kW capacity.
“A system with 0.7 kW installed power would provide an overall economy of approximately €1,100 per year per apartment (for Bucharest), which is equivalent to the economy produced by a 3 kW to 4 kW system installed on a [residential rooftop installation],” said Baisan. “This is due to the prevention of hot water waste inherent to those who live on [apartments] upper floors, combined with reduced consumption of electricity due to the use of photovoltaic windows.”
An integrated automatic controller opens the possibility of heating the water with electricity from the grid when solar power is unavailable, although the system would then need to be grid-connected.
The pilot installation has been performing as expected, according to Baisan. He noted that south-facing windows have the best performance, while east- or west-oriented windows generate approximately 70% of the energy of south-oriented oriented windows. Systems installed in Romania’s far north would reportedly produce about 5% less energy than those in the country’s south.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/07/taiwanese-scientists-develop-high-concentration-photovoltaic-system-with-low-light-leakage/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TAIWAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 7, 2023",Taiwanese scientists develop high-concentration PV system,"A research team in Taiwan claims to have discovered the cause of inherent light leakage in high-concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) systems that use a Fresnel lens as a focusing lens.
The scientists said that HCPV systems combined with the Fresnel lens are able to absorb sunlight even under cloudy weather conditions and that, however, these devices suffer from light leakages.
“Fresnel lenses are designed to significantly reduce the weight of the lens so that it can meet the requirements of a sun-tracking system,” they stated. “However, unlike conventional lenses, non-smooth and non-continuous lens surfaces distributed in multiple segments may cause inevitable significant light leakage due to manufacturing errors such as the radii of curvature and draft angles of the fabricated Fresnel lenses.”
The researchers assumed the use of a Fresnel lens with a width of 129 mm and a thickness is 1.81 mm. They considered a focusing area with a size of 1.1 mm × 1.1 mm, a power ratio of focus of 63%, and a light leakage ratio outside the focusing area of 37%. They also measured the light energy in the light leakage area of Fresnel lenses with different structures under monochromatic light irradiation and used diffuse plates with varying penetration rates to mimic the outdoor conditions of different cloud layer thicknesses.
Based on the results of this simulation, the group was able to design an HCPV system that can reportedly offer good performance even under a cloudy sky. It includes a 2 × 2 Fresnel lens array on a box with two rotation dimensions that can be manually adjusted to face directly toward the sun at any time. The PV unit relies on a high-efficiency solar panel based on III-V materials at the focus point and polycrystalline solar cells placed around it.
“The light leakage from the Fresnel lens structure and the scattered light from the sunlight passing through the clouds can be directed to the polycrystalline silicon-based solar panel for power generation,” the academics said. “When the sky is clear, the light is concentrated on the high-efficiency solar cell, so the power generation efficiency is high. In a heavy cloud, the sunlight cannot be concentrated on the high-efficiency solar cell, so a conventional HCPV cannot effectively generate electricity, but this design can still generate electricity by polycrystalline solar panels.”
Through the simulation, the Taiwanese group was able to ascertain that the Fresnel lens may reach an illuminance of about 20,000 to 40,000 lx in the light leakage region, whether it is a sunny day or a cloudy day with different cloud thicknesses.
The research team presented the HCPV system in the study “Hybrid high-concentration photovoltaic system designed for different weather conditions,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
The group includes scientists from Taiwan's National Central University and the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.
“The proposed novel solar power system is useful for reaching optimal solar power generation under different cloudy skies,” they concluded.

“The DeLasol solar power plant is the largest PV facility in Serbia and an example of how by using solar energy we can simultaneously improve the security of electricity supply and environmental protection,” said Energy Minister Dubravka Đedović.
The facility has a capacity of 9.9 MW and occupies an area of 12.5 hectares. It uses around 18,000 bifacial modules provided by an undisclosed manufacturer. The project developer is Belgrade-based MT-Komex.
The company has not revealed how the solar power generated by the facility will be commercialized.
ProCredit Banka Srbija agreed to finance the project with €9 million ($9.8 million). The lender had previously financed two solar projects built by MT-Komex in Kladovo.
Serbia is currently targeting to deploy 8.3 GW of PV by 2024, according to a new plan recently drafted by the government.  Utility-scale PV projects could be built on 200,000 hectares of neglected, low-value agricultural land that could host 2 GW of solar, according to the draft.
The draft also envisages the construction of around 300 MW of PV plants, valued at €200 million, on land owned by state-owned power utility EPS, primarily on its coal ash dumps.

They shared their findings in “Suppressed phase segregation for triple-junction perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature.
The NREL has certified the cell’s quasi-steady-state efficiency as 23.3%.
“This is, to our knowledge, the first reported certified efficiency for perovskite-based triple-junction solar cells,” the academics said, adding that triple-junction perovskite solar cells have so far demonstrated a maximum efficiency of around 20%.
The team started by using the perovskite ABX3, which is made from a mix of different substances, including cesium, lead, tin, iodine, bromine, and small organic molecules. Its top layer is composed of mixed halide perovskites with a particularly high proportion of bromine (Br) and iodine (I).
“What happens in light-induced phase separation of these mixed perovskites is that the bombardment of high-frequency photons causes the phases that are richer in bromine to get separated from those that are rich in iodine,” said Dr. Hao Chen, co-lead author of the study. “This leads to an increase in defects and a decrease in overall performance.”
To overcome this challenge, the academics used solid-state magnetic resonance spectroscopy to simulate the effect of altering the composition of the crystals. They found that replacing the organic molecules for an all-inorganic perovskite structure and replacing cesium (Cs) with the element rubidium (Rb) suppressed light-induced phase separation (LIPS).
“We find that Rb, with a smaller cation radius than Cs, can be doped into the inorganic perovskite lattice and that the upper limit of Rb doping content is positively correlated with Br content,” the scientists said. “The around 2.0 eV [band gap] Rb/Cs mixed-cation inorganic perovskites with a larger degree of lattice distortion than their Cs-based counterparts show suppressed LIPS because of the decreased average interatomic distance of the [Cs or Rb]-site cation and I, and the increased energy barrier of halide ion migration.”
The triple-junction cells reportedly retained 80% of their initial efficiency following 420 hours of operation at the maximum power point.
The team includes researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada and Northwestern University in the United States.
