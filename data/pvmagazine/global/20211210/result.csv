We have now proven that RuggedCell alkaline technology, which is uniquely scalable to individual system deployments in the hundreds of megawatts, equals or betters PEM technology’s capability to handle variable power levels,” commented Hydrogen Optimized CEO Andrew Stuart. According to the company, the technology is a significant development away from low-current, low-power bipolar alkaline technology in the market. “These systems are inherently limited in their range of power variability and take several minutes or more to ramp up and down. Furthermore, like PEM technology, individual bipolar alkaline modules are limited to smaller scale output.”
French multinational utility company Engie and UAE-government-owned renewable energy company Masdar signed a strategic alliance agreement last week to explore the co-development of a UAE-based green hydrogen hub. “The two companies are looking to develop projects with a capacity of at least 2 GW by 2030, with a total investment in the region of US$5 billion,” reads the press release. The two companies will initially target local markets. They aim to expand capacity to create a giga-scale green hydrogen hub for the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). In September, Masdar, also known as the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, teamed up with Abu Dhabi Nation.
Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries and German energy company RWE are planning to install a hydrogen-fueled gas turbine based on renewable green hydrogen in Lingen, Germany. “At the site of its gas-fired power plant in Lingen, RWE intends to generate green hydrogen with electrolysers powered by renewable electricity. The company is planning to build a first 100-MW electrolysis plant in Lingen by 2024, which is to be expanded to 2 GW by the end of the decade,” the two companies wrote on Wednesday. Kawasaki wrote that it has developed two different types of combustion systems to achieve 100% hydrogen operation. “One is a diffusion flame, the other a Dry-Low-Emission (DLE) combustor. In the beginning, the diffusion flame combustor will be used for the H2GT- Lingen project. The diffusion flame combustor will use water injection to achieve low emissions. In a subsequent phase, the installed diffusion flame combustor will be replaced by a Micro-Mix DLE combustor (MMX-combustor).” In its group vision, Kawasaki wrote that it aims to achieve “standalone carbon neutrality in 2030 through independent initiatives centered on hydrogen power generation.” Kawasaki wants to transport 225,000 tonnes of liquefied hydrogen from abroad to Japan in 2030.
German engineering conglomerate ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions and Australian listed minerals company Infinity Lithium are collaborating to test out the feasibility of green hydrogen to power the lithium chemical conversion process. “The Memorandum of Understanding highlights the intention of both parties to apply technological advancements for green hydrogen energy applications for pyrometallurgical equipment relevant to lithium chemical conversion processes. The advancements have the potential to be integrated into both the San José Lithium Project and the Infinity GreenTech novel lithium hydrometallurgical conversion processes,” reads a press release published on Monday. The San José is located in the Extremadura region of Spain. “This global first application to an integrated lithium project will see pilot scale activities using the new tk BU Mining Hydrogen Burner installation in Germany to assess San José feedstock and the use of green hydrogen to power a rotary kiln.”
British gas distribution company SGN, Macquarie’s Green Investment Group (GIG), and ExxonMobil affiliate Esso Petroleum have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the use of hydrogen and carbon capture to help reduce emissions in the Southampton industrial cluster. “An initial feasibility study by SGN and GIG shows the annual hydrogen demand from the cluster, which is home to ExxonMobil’s Fawley complex, could rise to as much as 37 TWh by 2050, including the heating demand of 800,000 homes across the South of England,” wrote ExxonMobil on Wednesday. The feasibility study estimated that carbon capture facilities could initially capture approximately 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year, including from initial hydrogen production of around 4.3 TWh of hydrogen per year.
The government of South Australia, Swiss multinational commodity trading company Trafigura, and Euronext-listed multi-metals business Nyrstar, announced a joint investment to construct a commercial-scale green hydrogen manufacturing facility in Port Pirie, a regional city north of Adelaide. “The AU$5 million Front End Engineering Design study for the Port Pirie Green Hydrogen Project, jointly funded by Trafigura and the South Australian State Government, will commence immediately, with a final investment decision to be made by the end of 2022. If approved, construction will commence in 2023,” Trafigura wrote on Thursday. The AU$750 million project, if approved, would initially produce 20 tonnes per day (tpd) of green hydrogen for export in the form of green ammonia. The full-scale plant should produce 100tpd of green hydrogen at full capacity from a 440MW electrolyzer. At that stage, the project would target both the export and domestic markets. The oxygen produced would be utilized by the Nyrstar Port Pirie smelter. Nyrstar said that the Port Pirie Green Hydrogen Project would enable its business to take a significant step in improving its competitiveness in the international market for zinc, lead, and other metals. Trafigura said it would source 100% renewable energy.
The hydrogen hype is helping green hydrogen to become cost-competitive in the long run, wrote consultancy group Wood Mackenzie in its “Hydrogen costs 2021: getting ready to scale”, adding that the fall in electrolyzer prices will allow green hydrogen to “be competitive in 12 markets – those with the highest utilization rates and lowest renewable electricity prices – by 2030.” Bridget van Dorsten, a research analyst on Wood Mackenzie’s hydrogen research team, explained that Brazil and Chile are amongst the front-runners of harnessing cheap renewables to produce green hydrogen off-grid. “By 2050, 20 of the 24 countries in our analysis see very competitive green hydrogen costs,” she said. The analysis includes Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. Wood Mackenzie expects a significant drop in electrolyzer CAPEX by 2025. Costs are being driven down by economies of scale, new entrants to the market, greater automation, and increased modularity. Van Dorsten argued that cost drivers differ for different electrolyzer types. “Reductions for solid oxide electrolysers are set to be the most dramatic in the next six to eight years; but alkaline and polymer electrolyser membrane costs are forecast to fall between 35% and 50% by 2025.” Van Dorsten also noted that the global estimated electrolyzer manufacturing capacity was just 200 MW in 2019, but with 1.3 GW additional capacity in Q1 2021, it now stands at around 6.3 GW.
The “first” independent and voluntary hydrogen coalition was launched on Thursday by a group of scientists, academics, and engineers based in the U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands. “Policy-makers in the UK and EU are placing big bets on hydrogen’s role in the energy transition. While hydrogen has an important part to play, we’re concerned that an over-reliance on hydrogen will delay existing, cheaper and scalable solutions like electrification” said David Cebon, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, University of Cambridge, England. Members of the coalition aim to bring “concrete evidence back into the hydrogen debate, free from industry bias.” This will primarily be through briefings, access to data, and media events.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/10/defining-bipv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",Defining BIPV,"Reaching consensus on what building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is and what makes it different from conventional rooftop PV is one of the challenges that the emerging BIPV industry has to deal with if it wants to move from niche to mainstream.
With this in mind, a group of experts from the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) put together a report that seeks to bring together piecemeal developments from different regions into a clear set of standards, and clearly defined functions for different products, in terms of their roles as both construction materials and energy generators.
The report is titled Categorization of BIPV applications; and is available on the IEA PVPS website. “By taking into account the main technical subsystems of the multifunctional building skin, the main features in terms of function, performance, morphological, structural and energy-related aspects are organized into five levels from application categories to materials,” state the report’s authors.
The five categories defined in the report stem from those outlined in the IEC standard 63092-1, Photovoltaics in buildings – Part 2: Requirements for building-integrated photovoltaic systems. The IEC’s categories define different types of BIPV system, based on area of integration and accessibility from the inside of the building. IEA PVPS further breaks these down into ‘system’ – representing the entire construction unit, ‘module’ for the active elements in energy and construction, ‘component’ for the parts making up these elements, and ‘material’ for the basic material.
At system level, the report notes three main types of BIPV system, classified as roof, facade and external integrated devices. They further break each of these down into subsections – ‘roof’ for example is split into discontinuous roofing, continuous roofing and atrium/skylight. The report’s module level category is then divided into three, based on the transparency of the element.
By clearly defining the different system elements in this way, the report hopes to bring together the interests of both PV system designers and architects – one of the key challenges to the development of BIPV. “We aspire that this paper will be able to provide a first milestone to encourage an integrated perspective and an interdisciplinary effort at the core of the BIPV field and that it will overcome some current obstacles that are still obstructing effective exchange of innovation and cooperation among all the stakeholders,” stated the authors.

The research group collected data from a literature review and a survey of European stakeholders and found that the level of market acceptance may vary considerably between countries and stakeholders. “In all countries, the investment cost of the technologies is perceived as a barrier for adoption,” it explained, noting that two more factors reducing market acceptance are financial concerns and sociodemographic factors such as public perception and peer effects.
Buildings are key to our daily lives and significantly impact our health and wellbeing. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints, employing heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from their construction, use, and demolition phases. In Q4 2021, pv magazine’s UP Initiative focuses on the role solar and energy storage can play in greening the world’s urban spaces. Read our Urban Solar coverage
According to their analysis, for example, the barriers are mostly legal and organizational in Spain, while in Germany initial investment costs represent the main concern. “Economic concerns are perceived as the main barriers among public building owners and the general public,” the academics said. “Businesspeople perceive the greatest number of barriers including economic concerns, lack of information, trust, lack of business models and legal issues, while private building owners perceive the least number of barriers, which are only related to economic concerns.”
Many respondents stressed that installing a solar heat pump is now becoming particularly attractive as it increases the value of a property, as shown by another recent study from the University of Maryland. “This aspect should be promoted in communication for all countries,” the scientists said. On the other hand, for all countries included in the survey, the lack of proper business models, high upfront costs, and long payback periods are pointed out by the research group as the key barriers for wider adoption of heat pumps in combination with photovoltaics.
The findings of the survey, which was conducted in the frame of the SunHorizon project, were presented in the paper Social and market acceptance of photovoltaic panels and heat pumps in Europe: A literature review and survey, published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. “A goal of the SunHorizon research project is to combine innovative solar and heat pump technologies into technology packages that can unlock the potential for mass-customized, user-friendly, and cost-effective solutions for heating and cooling,” the paper reads.

“We have many other floating projects in Europe and we recently provided the structures for a large system in Poland,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine, noting that in the chosen location the minimum temperature may reach as low as 40 degrees Celsius and the snow period lasts for a long time.

The facility was built using the company's MRac G4N mounting structure that, in its basic version, can host solar panels placed in two rows. “According to the local conditions and customer requirements, we can provide multi-layouts, including one module-row design, double-row architecture, as well as symmetrical and multiple rows,” the spokesperson said.
The symmetrical facing array is said to be the preferred option to increase a PV project's installed capacity and maximize energy yield.

The system is suitable to incorporate solar panels with wafer sizes of 182 mm and 210 mm and with a tilt angle of 5 to 15 degrees.
The structure is comprised of High-density polyethylene (HDPE), a material that, the company claims, makes it resistant enough to operate without issues during the 25-year solar plant lifetime. The product comes with a 10-year product warranty and is offered with fixing kits to embed the cables and inverters.
The company usually recommends that project developers use anchor points under the water, but anchor points on the waterfront may also be used. “These floating structures are suitable for water surfaces like ponds, rivers, reservoirs, and also for off-shore PV applications,” the spokesperson said.
The system is currently being produced by the company at its facility in Xiamen with a capacity of up to 50 MW per month. The technology passed the Hunt Water Absorption Test, Anti-Aging Test, and Anti-UV Test, according to the manufacturer.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/10/ultra-stable-sodium-ion-storage-via-organic-electrode-materials/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",Ultra-stable sodium-ion storage via organic electrode materials,"Long touted as one of the most promising technologies for commercial storage use, sodium-ion batteries have the advantages of lower manufacturing costs and abundant, environmentally benign raw materials, compared to ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries. A research team at China’s Soochow University has come up with a solution to make this technology even more competitive in terms of sustainability and cost while improving chemical stability with the help of hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).
While they have attracted a lot of research interest by virtue of their great structural crystallinity, large surface areas, and porosity, HOFs’ potential in electrochemical applications has been elusive because of weak hydrogen bonds that would dissociate in solution, and eventually compromise the structural integrity.
The Chinese researchers have overcome this challenge by designing and introducing multisite hydrogen bonding. Namely, for the first time, 2D molecular sheets of HOFs were prepared using diaminotriazole linkers to form multi-site hydrogen bonds. The scientists have detailed their approach in the paper 2D Molecular Sheets of Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Frameworks for Ultrastable Sodium-Ion Storage, published in Advanced Science. 
Their product displayed excellent chemical stability and diminished solubility in common organic solvents and enabled an exceptionally long life of more than 10,000 cycles at 1 A g-1, far superior to other organic electrode materials. The researchers hope this technology may be used for large-scale stationary energy storage, where costs and battery cyclelifes are emphasized over energy density.
While the use of organic electrode materials would make sodium-ion technology even cheaper, the researchers say they have not evaluated the cost. “Our study is more like a proof of concept by showing the introduction of multi-site hydrogen bonding within hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks would dramatically increase the chemical stability and achieve a super long cycle life,” Yanguang Li, a professor with the Institute of Functional Nano and Soft Materials at Soochow University, China, tells pv magazine. “There is still a long way to go before the practical viability of this organic electrode material could be rigorously proven.”
The increasing number of research efforts is signaling that sodium-ion technology is coming to fruition sooner rather than later, offering the potential to relax supply constraints in battery raw materials. What is more, the technology's commercial breakthrough now seems imminent following the announcement from battery manufacturing heavyweight CATL earlier this year on the start of industrial production and plans to stabilize the industrial chain for its first-generation sodium-ion batteries by 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/10/u-s-trade-commission-recommends-extension-of-section-201-solar-tariffs/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",U.S. Trade Commission recommends extension of Section 201 solar tariffs,"From pv magazine USA
The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) issued its determination on the Section 201 tariffs on solar cells and modules, recommending a four-year extension of the solar tariff, with annual declines of .25% starting in February.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) noted that the tariffs, imposed by President Trump in January 2018, have not spurred enough domestic manufacturing to meet U.S. solar demand. And it is this capacity that is needed to help meet President Biden’s climate and energy goals. SEIA also pointed out that the tariffs also failed to create jobs, instead resulting in “significant” job losses.
SEIA president and CEO, Abigail Ross Hopper, commented on the proposal, stating that, “years of tariffs have not moved the needle nearly enough to justify the USITC’s recommendation”. Noting that President Biden has set a “bold vision” of becoming a world leader on clean energy, “extending these tariffs will hold us back from realizing that vision,” Hopper said. She urged the President to enact policy to grow U.S. manufacturing, and acknowledged that Senator Ossoff’s amendment in the Build Back Better Act is what she considers “the first investment our nation has made to truly incentivize domestic solar production after years of punitive import duties on U.S. companies.”
She implored the President to not make “the same mistake” as the previous administration. “It’s time to let these ineffective tariffs end and start a new era of American clean energy leadership,” Hopper concluded.
SEIA notes that since the Section 201 tariffs were imposed in 2018, the U.S. solar industry has “missed out on” more than 62,000 jobs, $19 billion in private sector investment, and more than 10 GW of solar deployment. Hopper cautioned that extending the tariffs will “worsen the supply chain bottlenecks that are already throttling America’s clean energy sector.”
The President will make a final decision on whether to extend the tariffs or end them, thereby potentially boosting U.S. clean energy deployment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/10/storing-solar-power-with-compressed-carbon-dioxide/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",Storing solar power with compressed carbon dioxide,"Italy-based Energy Dome has developed a modular, scalable system for utility-scale, long-term electricity storage based on compressed CO2. It claims that the system is a non-site-dependent solution for storing wind and solar power, as well as grid electricity.
“The concept is the same as compressed air energy storage (CAES) and liquid air technologies” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told pv magazine. “With the difference, however, that storing CO2 can be done by occupying less space than with compressed air and without the need for finding a cavern or implementing underground works.”
The reduced volume at ambient temperature, which is required by the technology on the high-pressure side of the system, is the “secret sauce” for the CO2 battery’s competitive costs and high performance, according to its creators. These main features depend on the fact that CO2 becomes liquid with ambient temperature and pressure of only 70 bars.
“Unlike CAES and liquid air technologies, our storage concept is non-site dependent and can be applied almost anywhere without having to deal with extreme cryogenic temperatures,” said Spadacini.
The system draws CO2 from an inflatable atmospheric gas holder, which the company named Dome, and stores it under a 70 bar pressure at ambient temperature in a high-density liquid state. When the stored energy is needed, the CO2 is evaporated and conveyed through a turbine that produces power. After this process is implemented, the CO2 goes back to the atmospheric gas holder to be used again for another storage cycle, without any emissions to the atmosphere.
“It is a closed-loop cycle and no CO2 is released in the atmosphere,” Spadacini said. “The system, on the other hand, doesn't need too much CO2 to work, I would say a few hundred tons would be enough for about 100 MWh of electricity.”
One of the Energy Dome’s main advantages, he said, is that this technology uses off-the-shelf components. There is no need for a new factory to be put up and running in order to have a plant built, nor extensive testing time of new turbomachinery or new chemical reactions.
The system's optimal charge/discharge cycle should range from four to 24 hours which, according to the company, makes it perfectly suitable for daily and intra-day cycling when used for energy storage by grid operators and utilities. Its round-trip efficiency can reach up to 80%. The system modular design enables the construction of facilities with a storage capacity of up to 200 MWh.
“We expect a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of our technology already below $100/MWh with the first commercial plant we are going to build. With wider deployment of our technology, we are aiming to drop the LCOS below $60/MWh in a few years’ time,” Spadacini said.
Energy Dome has recently raised $11 million through a Series A funding round and intends to use the proceeds for its first 2 MW/4 MWh pilot project in Sardinia, which it is developing in partnership with Italian utility A2A.
“This project will be tested for grid electricity storage in the first quarter of next year,” Spadacini explained. “But our technology is also intended for the storage of power generated by large-scale wind and solar plants.”
The company is targeting markets such as North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India and Australia.
“Our technology allows for worldwide deployment of competitive energy storage plants without any geographical limitations,” concluded Spadacini.

“The new power plant represents the first Hungarian utility-scale PV power plant in Photon Energy Group’s IPP portfolio that the Company will operate without a support scheme. The total annual production of the power plant is expected to be around 2.1 GWh, which corresponds to expected annual revenues of  €420,000 based on current forward prices for electricity baseload in Hungary in 2022,” the company said in a statement.
Given the current power price trend and the fact that in the first half of 2021, electricity prices were much lower than in the past months, Photon Energy said expected revenue for next year could be even higher. “Recent market developments and the outlook for European energy prices vindicates our market approach,” Photon Energy CEO, Georg Hotar, said. “The economics of our first European merchant power plant highlights the value embedded in our dynamically growing project development pipeline across the Central and Eastern Europe region.”
According to Hungarian renewable energy specialist, Ferenc Kis, changes occurred in the Hungarian grid connection process earlier this summer with direct financial implications imposed by obligatory bid bonds. “This coordinated grid connection capacity allocation on the country level will result in new network connection possibilities reserved previously by developers but also gives an emergency break option for the system operator if the PV capacity grows faster than the flexibility of the system,” he told pv magazine.
“The increased upfront costs of the capacity booking declarations, the reduced maximum capacities (20MW) of large power plants on the METAR auctions, and the withdrawal and re-announcement of the most recent renewable tender are all reasons why more projects are planned on a pure merchant basis, like the one in settlement inaugurated recently.”
According to Kis, the last three auctions have shown significant competition as the procurement exercises were up to five times oversubscribed, while the average bid prices fell by 28% to an average of €50.3/MWh.
The latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reveal that Hungary had installed 1.95 GW of solar by the end of 2020. New capacity additions hit 553 MW last year.

An Australian consortium has filed a patent for a new design for the high-temperature molten salt tanks used in thermal energy storage systems such as concentrated solar power (CSP) projects.
CSP systems use mirrors and receiving towers to gather and store the energy from the sun. The technology has had a turbulent history, however. It was initially hailed as a great solution, but was later wedged out by cheap solar PV, combined with issues that have detracted from its great advantage: dispatchability.
One of those hindrances includes the hot tanks for molten storage systems, as they have tended to leak due to thermal cycling and fatigue, resulting in substantial production losses for CSP projects.
Now, a consortium that includes Sydney-based Vast Solar – as well as CyD, Solar Dynamics, and Alia Energy Consulting and Critical Engineering – says that it has jointly developed a new tank design that addresses the issue, drawing on input from the Advanced Materials Team at the Australian Solar Thermal Research Institute (ASTRI), led by the Queensland University of Technology and Flinders University.
The consortium said it developed the new Flexitank design by carefully analyzing, understanding and learning from previous failures. The design increases the flexibility of the floor of the tank and mitigates the risk of failure associated with thermal cycles by absorbing the repeated expansion and contraction typically encountered in such tanks, the consortium said.
“Once we understood the tank failure modes and started testing the physical properties of the incumbent materials, we realised that flexibility is the key to overcoming thermal cycling and fatigue,” said Vast Solar CEO Craig Wood. “The economics of thermal storage are compelling, and we are delighted that our work will now deliver much needed reliability.”
Dominic Zaal, the director of ASTRI, said that the company is “confident” that the new Flexitank “will substantially improve the operation performance of CSP systems moving forward.”
Vast Solar
In May, Vast Solar called for expressions of interest from contractors to expedite its plans for a 50 MW hybrid power plant in Mount Isa, Australia. The project will combine solar PV, a large-scale battery and gas engines with concentrated solar thermal power technology.
Unlike traditional concentrated solar thermal power technology, which uses molten salt for heat transfer and for storage, Vast Solar has developed a low-cost, modular technology with integrated thermal storage that uses sodium for heat transfer and molten salt for on-demand storage, both of which create steam to drive a turbine.
The technology allows plants to be configured with four to 16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW. And it has been proven at Vast Solar’s 1 MW pilot plant in Jemalong, New South Wales, which has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018. The Jemalong solar farm sits alongside an operational 1.1 MW CSP pilot plant deployed by Vast Solar.
Robotic cleaning
Separately, Heliogen, a California-based CSP developer, held the first technical demonstration of its Installation and Cleaning Autonomous Robot and Utility Solution (ICARUS). It is a system of autonomous robots designed to clean heliostats, which are the reflective mirrors in CSP systems.
Heliostats reflect sunlight into a collection tower, where the light and heat is converted to electricity and usable thermal energy. Recently, the company partnered with Bloom Energy to produce hydrogen fuel.
Cleaning the heliostats can be expensive and labor-intensive. Historically, it was therefore only done every few months, said Heliogen. Now, the ICARUS robots can continuously clean systems to keep production levels high. The ICARUS system uses GPS, ultrasonic rangefinders, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors to operate fully autonomously.
The system can also deliver the heliostats from an assembly line or inventory location to the field, and install them with accuracy up to 2 cm, said Heliogen. It can work around the clock, day or night, with minimal physical labor. The robots can operate in both structured and unstructured environments and have built-in obstacle and structure avoidance systems.
“By taking advantage of huge boosts in processing power due to the advances of Moore’s Law, AI, computation, and computer vision, Heliogen aims to make solar energy more affordable than ever before,” said Bill Gross, the founder and CEO of Heliogen.
ICARUS will be deployed across Heliogen’s facilities by 2023.

India is recording robust growth in solar installations this year, even though developers face a range of market challenges, according to Mercom India Research’s newly released Q3 2021 India Solar Market Update. 
Higher raw material costs, severe volatility in the availability and prices of modules, power curtailment in several states, and high freight charges have all added to the difficulties that developers now face. However, India’s solar additions surpassed 7.4 GW in the first nine months of 2021, up 328% year on year, said Mercom India Research.
India added 2,835 MW of solar in the third quarter of the calendar year, up 14% from the 2,488 MW installed in the second quarter. Third-quarter installations soared by 547% year on year.
“Despite supply challenges, the Indian solar market is headed towards one of best years on record, and a complete turnaround from 2021, which was one of the worst years for solar due to Covid-19,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “We expect a strong 2022 despite the high price of components and uncertainties surrounding the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) related transmission issue in Rajasthan. An increase in GST, curtailment, and payment issues are adding to the challenges facing developers and constraining growth.”
The average selling prices of solar modules rose steeply in the third quarter. Prices of mono PERC modules surged more than 15% quarter on quarter, with supply constraints emerging after major manufacturers started cutting output in China. Freight charges peaked at around $9,000 per container in the quarter.
“Manufacturing capacity ramp-up continues at a brisk pace as domestic producers look to take advantage of the 40% basic customs duty scheduled to be imposed from April 2022. In the second quarter of next year, we can expect to see procurement strategies starting to change drastically as imports become expensive,” said Prabhu.
According to the report, module prices have now been increasing for six consecutive quarters – a trend not seen in the past 10 years. The current three-month period has also seen the largest quarterly increase in large-scale system costs, due to higher raw material and component prices.
