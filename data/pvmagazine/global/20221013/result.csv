Nine of those approvals were granted to solar projects with a total capacity of 44.74 MW.
The three remaining licenses were granted to natural gas, hydro, and coal projects. Hydropower has the largest approved project, with a 152.12 MW capacity, whilst the largest PV project accounted for 20 MW. According to the report, Pakistan’s power sector has grown to over 40,000 MW of installed capacity.
The regulator also issued 7,032 net metering licenses, likely only for solar projects, totaling 243.43 MW of installed capacity. The move came after the federal government issued a notice that net metered distributed generation facilities for solar and wind, up to 25 kW, no longer require generation licenses. Overall, Pakistan approved 288 MW of new solar capacity in 2021-2022.
Nepra is also set to raise the price paid by net-metered households to inject excess electricity into the grid from PKR 19.32 ($0.089)/kWh to PKR 9/kWh.
In May, the government authority launched a new model for Pakistan’s wholesale electricity market, the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) model. The aim of the model “is to introduce competition in the electricity market and provide an enabling environment where multiple sellers and buyers can trade electricity,” according to the website of the national Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA).
“The current market structure followed in Pakistan is the single-buyer model in which CPPA (as a single-buyer) purchases electricity on behalf of … distribution companies,” the authority said. “In CTBCM, there will be multiple buyer[s] and multiple seller[s], and the hourly electricity price will be determined by the economic forces of supply and demand.”
Nepra approved four power purchase agreements in the 2021-22 period, one of which was for a solar company. The report also notes that the regulator approved licensing regulations for microgrids, “with a vision to give access of electricity to the remote, far-flung areas of the country.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/13/african-payg-solar-companies-have-hogged-72-of-sectors-investment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COVID-19,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,ASIA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",African PAYG solar companies have hogged 72% of sector’s investment,"The latest biennial report into the global off-grid solar industry points to a post-pandemic recovery in sales of home solar systems, but also highlighted the stranglehold the seven biggest Africa-facing pay-as-you-go (PAYG) companies have on the sector.
The Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report 2022: State of the Sector document was published this week by the World Bank, Netherlands-based industry trade body Gogla, US membership group the Efficiency for Access Coalition, and Nairobi-based financial company Open Capital Advisors.
The report stated sales of, typically single-panel solar home systems (SHS') rose 10% last year from Covid-induced lows in 2020 to contribute $2.1 billion to a world market worth $2.8 billion in 2021 when the $700 million solar-powered appliance trade is included. Appliance sales – mainly of TVs in Africa and fans in South Asia – have yet to rebound from the pandemic, according to the study.
In funding terms, some 72% of the total backing secured to date for the “affiliate” off-grid solar businesses which submit their numbers to Gogla went to just seven companies, the report stated, with 26% shared between another 150 businesses.
The fact the big seven “seem to have overcome the pandemic,” according to the report's authors, is likely to unlock access to even wider equity backing and will see them drive a round of consolidation in the industry, after the acquisitions made by conventional big energy companies going into the Covid slump.
As an example, San Francisco-based d.light has secured $365 million to expand operations since the last off-grid solar report, in February 2020, via a special purpose vehicle from which investors will bank returns from the company's PAYG receipts. Chicago-based Sun King – formerly Greenlight Planet – this year landed a $260 million series D funding round led by the climate investment arm of New York private equity firm General Atlantic.
The other members of the big seven identified in the report are London-based Bboxx, France's Engie Energy Access, Dutch business Lumos, Nairobi-based M-Kopa, and Amsterdam's Zola Electric.
Those businesses garnered $243 million in loan backing last year, according to the study, and $70 million from share sales while the other 150 businesses in the Gogla database took out $52 million worth of loans between them, attracted $50 million in equity investment, and $9 million in non-repayable grants.
Most investment is still flowing into the more mature East African off-grid market, via the big seven although a bigger number of businesses were active in West Africa, albeit attracting less backing. The off-grid solar report – which this year will be split in two with a forward-looking outlook to be published later in October – said less data was available from South Asia because a prevalence of cash purchases there meant less outside investment was required, and because more companies were present which do not report their figures to Gogla.
The document highlighted industry developments such as the need to regulate the PAYG market and for companies to have e-waste disposal and recycling policies in place, notably after recent waste-related legislative changes in Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, and Nigeria. On that issue, the study highlighted the work of a company called Solaris which is giving spent automotive battery cells a second life in power packs for SHS'.
The Gogla-World Bank study also shed light on the problems caused by fast-expanding PAYG giants having been over-optimistic about their market reach and the ability of their lowest-income customers to keep up with payment plans. For instance, the authors said, the government of Rwanda is considering scaling back its aim of using off-grid solar to provide electricity access to 48% of its population by 2024, to 30%. Kigali could reportedly raise the ambition of using its conventional power grid to compensate, from 52% to 70% of the population by the same deadline.
The study hinted the phrase “off-grid solar” may soon become obsolete, with rising numbers of urban customers using solar-powered devices and power systems to compensate for grid deficiencies, opening up a huge new market for African solar companies.
And the 160-page publication also highlighted, again, how far the world remains from the goal of universal access to electricity this decade, with 90 million Nigerians lacking power, along with 72 million people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and 56 million Ethiopians.
With electricity access failing to keep pace with rising population numbers and an estimated 128 million people and 3.1 million businesses having missed out on solar power due to Covid, the report also skewered the claim made by Bangladeshi head of state Sheikh Hasina in March that her country had achieved universal access to electricity.
According to the World Bank, Gogla, Efficiency for Access, and Open Capital, only 96% of Bangladeshis had access to power when the first installment of the report was finalized, in August, leaving six million people without.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/13/methylammonium-free-perovskite-solar-cell-with-22-29-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",Methylammonium-free perovskite solar cell with 22.29% efficiency,"Researchers from Japan's National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) have fabricated a solar cell based on a perovskite material that doesn't contain methylammonium (MA) molecules. These molecules have intrinsic thermal instability and contribute to increasing the typical thermal instability of perovskite PV devices.
The scientists used pentafluorophenylhydrazine (5F-PHZ) instead of MA for the interfacial passivation of the 3D HaP perovskite layer and built a cell with a p-i-n device structure and an area of 1 cm2.
The device relies on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer based on nickel(II) oxide (NiOx), the perovskite layer, a layer made of [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid, which is also known as MeO-2PACz, an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60), and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.29%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.178 V, a short-circuit current of 24.51 mAcm−2, and a fill factor of 77.2%. A reference cell without the 5F-PHZ treatment achieved an efficiency of 18.10%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.096 V, a short-circuit current of 22.88 mAcm−2, and a fill factor of 72.2%.
“This improvement in efficiency is obtained with a small open-circuit voltage deficit of 0.338 V,” the scientists said. “Considering the little difference between the bandgaps of the control and 5F-PHZ treated HaP films, the open-circuit voltage enhancement is attributed to the reduction of non-radiative recombination.”
The solar cell was also able to retain around 92.52% of its initial efficiency after 500 h. The same device without the 5F-PHZ treatment was able to retain only 73.5%. “These results indicate that the device with 5F-PHZ treatment significantly improves the thermal stability which is benefited by interfacial halogen bonding modulation,” the academics stated.
They introduced the cell technology in “Interfacial Embedding for High-Efficiency and Stable Methylammonium-Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Fluoroarene Hydrazine,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
“We would like to develop our techniques with Japanese companies such as Sekisui, Toshiba,  Aisin,  Kaneka, and EneCoat Technologies,” researcher Dhruba B. Khadka told pv magazine.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/13/sodium-ion-battery-anode-made-from-toxic-hogweed/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,RUSSIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",Sodium-ion battery anode made from toxic hogweed,"Hard carbons appear to be one of the most suitable candidates for anode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of their electrochemical performance and relative ease of production. This class of materials can be obtained from a variety of precursors, and the most ecologically sustainable route is the synthesis from biomass.
Researchers from Moscow State University (MSU) and Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) have developed a high-quality anode material from an unlikely source – Heracleum sosnowskyi, a highly invasive plant, which is dangerous for humans and can cause skin burns but produces a large amount of green biomass in a short time.
“We thought, wouldn’t it be fun to take something as nasty and objectionable as hogweed and make something useful out of it,” said co-author Zoya Bobyleva of Lomonosov Moscow State University. “The thing about hard carbon materials, used in sodium-ion battery anodes, is you can make them from biomass of virtually any origin. No one has considered hogweed before. But it turned out pretty well.”
The hard carbon produced by the MSU-Skoltech team exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which is on par with the best reported results for hard carbons synthesized from other raw materials. As for the energy storage capacity, at about 260 mAh/g, the material falls short of the best results reported elsewhere — around 300 mAh/g. In addition, it  demonstrated capacity retention of 95% after 100 charge-discharge cycles in sodium half-cells.
In “Sosnowskyi Hogweed-Based Hard Carbons for Sodium-Ion Batteries,” which was recently published in Batteries, the researchers proposed a simple synthesis method that includes the pretreatment stage and further carbonization at 1,300 C. The new anode was demonstrated in full sodium-ion cells with NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode material.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/13/sundrive-lands-13-million-to-scale-copper-based-solar-tech/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",SunDrive lands $13 million to scale copper-based solar tech,"From pv magazine Australia
SunDrive, the Sydney-based startup working to replace expensive silver elements in solar cells with cheaper copper, has attracted the support of some of Australia’s most prominent renewable energy venture investors to help scale its low-cost, high-efficiency solar cell and manufacturing process.
The AUD 21 million Series A funding round was led by the CSIRO’s venture capital outfit Main Sequence Ventures and the federally funded Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), with the latter confirming it had invested $7 million through its innovation fund managed by Virescent Ventures.
The raise also includes existing investors Blackbird Ventures and software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures while former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Canva co-founder Cameron Adams also participated in the latest round.
SunDrive’s patented technology uses copper as the conductive material to pull the electrical current from the PV cells, instead of the industry standard silver. The technology has already produced solar efficiency world records, further expanding its commercial potential.
SunDrive’s use of cheaper more abundant copper instead of expensive silver shapes as a potential game-changer in the push to produce more efficient and scalable solar technology.
Worldwide, the solar PV industry consumes approximately 10% of the world’s silver and the manufacture of solar panels is estimated to account for 20% of total industrial demand.
“People in the scientific community have realized for a very long time that silver is unsustainable,” SunDrive co-founder Vince Allen said.
“The solar cells needed to decarbonize the world will need to be more efficient, cheaper and scalable than they are today. The use of silver is the common denominator and is holding back the rapid advancements needed to transition to a solar-powered electric world.”
Virescent Ventures managing partner Ben Gust said at nearly 100 times cheaper than silver and far more abundant, the switch to copper has the potential to improve solar panel uptake by driving down costs.
“Increasing panel efficiency and shifting to more abundant materials before constraints on silver and other materials limit industry growth is critical to improving the uptake of solar PV in Australia and around the world,” he said. “SunDrive’s technology has the potential to be the leading method for silver replacement in solar PV production.”
The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that solar PV generation capacity will more than double by the end of the decade, from approximately 739 GW in 2020, to more than 23%, or up to 2,550 GW in 2030.
CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said SunDrive’s technology has the capacity to not only revolutionize the production of PV cells but also play a key role in the development of a domestic solar manufacturing industry.
“The technology has the potential to revolutionize the onshore production of solar cells and the development of an Australian solar manufacturing industry,” he said, adding “improving sovereign manufacturing capability will increase Australia’s resilience to supply chain disruptions and further enable the uptake of solar PV.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/13/swedish-startup-offers-reusable-nickel-metal-hydride-batteries-for-renewables-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",Swedish startup offers reusable nickel metal hydride batteries for renewables storage,"Sweden-based storage system supplier Nilar International AB has started production of its ReOx reusable batteries, which can be refilled with gas to restore the original battery capacity.
The start of manufacturing activities followed an order received from Swedish renewable energy company Enequi.
“The order applies to a total of 800 batteries with associated software, for 100 units of Enequi's intelligent energy storage QuiPower Storage,” Nilar said.
“The modular Nilar battery supports a range of scalable energy storage applications to meet the energy needs of different types of commercial and industrial properties, home and residential applications as well as smart grid infrastructure applications,” the company's CEO, Erik Oldmark, told pv magazine. “It’s a good fit especially for those looking to combine multiple functionalities, such as time shifting, peak shaving, backup, frequency regulation, islanding, or uninterruptible power supply.”
The company is producing the storage systems at its factory in Gävle, Sweden, which it claims is powered by 100% renewable energy. According to the manufacturer, the natural aging process of the battery is reversible and the battery is reportedly able to operate at full capacity at least three times.
The battery consists of ten battery cells containing each a positive electrode, a separator, and a negative electrode. The cells are stacked horizontally on top of one another with a metal bi-plate in between. The outer plates act as current collectors for all cells in the module, which reportedly offers a volumetric density advantage of 10%.
The storage system is based on an electrolyte relying on nickel metal hydride (NiMH) that provides means for ionic conductivity in the cells, while occupying limited volume. The electrolyte can be regenerated and reportedly offers excellent ionic conductivity over a wide temperature range.
The company developed the device's positive and negative electrodes through a patented technique for the compression of dry powders and used a separator that acts as an electrolyte reservoir. The biplates are used to seal the cells and provide electrical contact between the cells themselves.
“In the Nilar bi-polar design, the current is perpendicular to the electrode and bi-plate surface, making the whole biplate area used for current transfer between cells,” the company said. “This substantially reduces resistance and optimizes uniformity of current distribution over the biplate and electrode surface.”
In the proposed system configuration, each battery pack contains up to 12 modules and every module contains 10 battery cells. The battery packs can be utilized with a maximum nominal battery voltage of up to 600 Vdc.
According to the company, the batteries are also easy to recycle and offer improved safety.
“Nickel, the main constituent active material, is easily recyclable without loss of quality and any residues are sent to the metal industry for reuse,” Oldmark said. “As the water-based, non-flammable electrolyte used in Nilar’s batteries is chemically stable, heat-generating reactions cannot occur between the electrodes. Unlike many other batteries, Nilar batteries cannot spontaneously explode or even short circuit internally. Moreover, there’s no risk of heat propagation, when one cell dangerously heats up followed by the next and the next.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/13/sunruns-residential-vpp-injects-1-8-gwh-into-grid-over-3-month-period/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",Sunrun’s residential VPP injects 1.8 GWh into grid over 3-month period,"From pv magazine USA
Sunrun recently completed its first successful season running a residential virtual power plant (VPP) in a wholesale capacity market.
In 2019, it won a bid into the independent system operator – New England (ISO-NE), the region’s grid operator and one of the largest wholesale electricity markets in the United State – to participate in a VPP with its home solar and battery storage systems connected to the grid. Sunrun won against centralized fossil-fuel power plants, which signified a shift to local, clean energy.
In a recent article, “Achieving a zero-carbon grid: Opportunities in virtual power plants,” Jigar Shah explained that a VPP is really an aggregation of distributed energy resource (DER) technologies. Solar homes with batteries can be connected to the grid, but can also support electric vehicle charging and grid-interactive appliances. What ISO-NE and other grid operators do in a VPP is to automatically adjust the DERs that are aggregated, so they provide clean energy, reliability, and grid services.
“VPPs not only open the grid to a whole new utility-scale, behind-the-meter supply, but also coordinate disparate DERs into holistic, demand-flexible resources,” Shah said.
The benefit to the operator is the ability to use that aggregated energy, meaning that they don’t have to invest in additional capacity and infrastructure to serve a peak load. And that peak load is going to increase as we move to all-electric. The benefit to the solar homeowner is that they can receive compensation for their service.
Sunrun reports that during the summer months of June through August, its New England VPP sent more than 1.8 GWh of energy back to the grid. Thousands of Sunrun home solar systems across New England exported excess clean solar energy during the peak demand window of 1p.m. to 5 p.m., effectively reducing overall energy demand and relieving stress on the region’s energy grid, while reducing reliance on fossil fuel plants. Additional benefits are a reduction in energy costs across the region, along with resilience at a time when some grid operators have to issue energy conservation warnings.
“It is tremendous that we are able to work with ISO-NE to integrate local home solar and battery systems into the wholesale markets, and we thank them for their leadership,” said Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun. “This is a wonderful example of radical collaboration and demonstrates the importance of every market operator leveraging local clean energy resources to solve capacity constraints and grid reliability. As more severe and frequent heat waves, arctic freezes and other climatic events continue to stress our nation’s grid, we strongly encourage grid operators, utilities and policy makers alike to leverage these amazing solar energy resources.”
In a report in August, ISO-NE detailed how home solar helped keep wholesale system demand below the average forecast throughout the July heat wave, despite the region’s heat index hitting 100 degrees or more. Now ISO-NE’s customers head into the winter months and heating season—a time when VPPs can demonstrate that local solar and batteries can deliver value to wholesale markets across the country and reduce grid costs for all.
