Silicon purified metallurgically through the ‘FerroSolar' process has been shown to achieve, on a conventional production line, up to 20.76% efficiency in multicrystalline cells made with upgraded metallurgical-grade (UMG) silicon. Such devices also significantly reduce the cost of purification and the environmental impact of manufacturing modules, which can have a 25% lower carbon footprint as a result.
However, UMG has to demonstrate it is able to follow the “moving target” of the conversion efficiency of conventional solar cells, a level which is continuously increasing. In recent years, the rate has been sustained at around 0.4-0.5% annually.
After the avenues for improvement of conventional cells – covered entirely by aluminum on the back surface – were exhausted, it was the leap to PERC technology that maintained increasing efficiencies, by replacing the aluminum with one or more dielectric layers pierced to make contact.
The first results obtained from PERC cells on UMG silicon were very promising, with average efficiencies of 20.1% plus or minus 0.6%, compared to 20.41% for conventional multicrystalline.
Those results were the basis for the ‘Cheer-Up' project somewhat tortuously constructed as an acronym from “low Cost, High-EfficiEnt and Reliable UMG PV cells. Part of the European Solar-Era.Net energy technology R&D network, the project is a collaboration between the Madrid-based Instituto de Energía Solar (IES-UPM), Spanish solar company Aurinka PV, the Nanophotonics Technology Center in Valencia and Turkey's Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications (GÜNAM), in Ankara.
The project aims to adapt PERC technology with slight variations in some of the industrial process steps to achieve 21% efficiency with UMG. By incorporating advanced processing technology, the material is expected to be capable of up to 22% efficiency. One such advanced technology, for example, is the passivation of contacts with an ultrathin oxide and doped polysilicon – tunnel‐oxide passivated contact, or TOPCon.
The Cheer-Up project will seek to demonstrate that with UMG, efficiencies similar to those of conventional materials can be achieved at lower cost and with less environmental impact. The researchers also hope to demonstrate UMG can be used to manufacture the most advanced cell structures.
“The approach is to make a TOPCon device on a p-type wafer in which the rear TOPCon structure would be made with boron-doped polysilicon, and for the front part we are evaluating the option of having a front phosphor emitter or a selective structure,” IES-UPM director Carlos del Cañizo told pv magazine, noting it would be premature to assess possible degradation. The work will be carried out next year in collaboration with German research body the Fraunhofer ISE. The team has so far obtained “remarkable results,” said Del Cañizo, with the three-year project having been under way for 15 months.

The most important steps to achieve the project's objectives include plasma nanotexturing – known as black silicon because it achieves such a low reflectivity the substrate appears black – and designing the thermal steps of the process to maximize the removal of impurities and improve the quality of the substrate, making it comparable with that of conventional polysilicon substrates.
“With regard to the characterization of the material, we have played with the conditions of the phosphor diffusion step and with those of the deposit of the dielectric layers in the back of the cell, and we have observed improvements in the quality of the material, measured in terms [of] lifetime, which exceed 300 microseconds, and in some cases have reached 600 microseconds,” del Cañizo said. “To get an idea of the meaning of these values, it must be taken into account that the simulations indicate that with lifetimes of 150 microseconds at the point of maximum power, we would already reach 21% efficiency in the cell.”
The research team is also studying the process conditions to drastically reduce the degradation some cell technologies experience with lighting and temperature when they are in operation, a phenomenon that can be regulated by controlling the amount of hydrogen that the rear dielectric layer diffuses towards the substratum.
Specifically, the researchers are looking at PERC's light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID), the scope of which depends on the starting material. The team is initially gauging how important it is for UMG, and is introducing changes in the manufacturing process – including hydrogen in the dielectric, firing temperatures and forward polarization – to reduce it.

With project partner the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE estimating technical potential in the mid double-digit gigawatt range from the 500 or so such bodies of water in Germany, the RWE Renewables clean energy developer arm of the German energy company will incorporate the results of a three-year testing period to help evaluate the generation potential of such sites in its domestic market and worldwide.
The German developer will also select the open-pit lake upon which Dutch installer Volta Solar will help construct four floating arrays, with a nearby, ground-mounted reference array included in the study. Each of the arrays will have a generation capacity of 30 kWp, a spokesperson for the Fraunhofer ISE told pv magazine this afternoon.
The Fraunhofer release said the PV2Float study, financed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, would evaluate the technical requirements of installing solar on such water surfaces, their economic viability, their ecological effects, and their acceptance by the public.
With German manufacturer Heckert Solar to supply “innovative PV module concepts” to the project, according to Fraunhofer ISE, the research body will conduct durability studies on the installations, and further develop modules as necessary. Fraunhofer staff will also examine floating PV regulation in Germany, drive participation by local stakeholders in the project, and investigate the business case of the floating systems.
Another project partner, the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg, along with Dresden-based geo and hydroscientific center the Institut für Wasser und Boden Dr Uhlmann, will investigate the ecological effects of floating solar systems.

Describing the project as a “new battery recycling process” without revealing any further technical details, the Swedish recycling business said London-based chemicals and sustainable technology company Johnson Matthey would add a process step which would see the 95% of the lithium-ion battery materials Stena said it will recover from each device “fully refined” for use in new products.
Stating construction will begin in “autumn,” Stena said the initial batteries to be processed would be collected at its 90 locations in Sweden and “eventually” in other countries where the business operates. Stena Recycling is part of the Olsson-family-owned Stena conglomerate, which includes the ferry company.
Quoted in a press release issued by the company today to announce the investment, Stena Recycling MD Fredrik Pettersson said: “We see a strong growth in the sale of electric vehicles where we need to meet our customers' needs to dispose of spent batteries in a safe and environmentally sound way. This major investment is part of our strategy to be a leader in the collection and mechanical processing of lithium-ion batteries to establish a circular cycle for batteries.
“We are now responding to market demand. We are proud to offer a circular solution for lithium-ion batteries. It will be a big win for the environment and for the life cycle of the batteries when we recover critical metals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, which are in short supply worldwide.”

The European industrial lobby group today issued a statement emphasizing the need to tighten up the requirements of the Simplification Decree published by the Mario Draghi government at the end of May, and which is currently being discussed in parliament.
With the legislation needing to pass into law this month, SolarPower Europe and Italian trade body Italia Solare have called for amendments to be added to further simplify a planning process which currently sees almost half of clean power facilities abandoned and the balance having to wait around six years for approval.
In a statement issued jointly by six industrial organizations, including clean power membership body ANIE Rinnovabili and electric industry group Elettricità Futura, SolarPower Europe chief executive Walburga Hemetsberger said: “The potential for solar PV is very high in Italy but this capacity will not be reached unless administrative hurdles are overcome. Removing permitting restrictions is a necessary step to speed up solar deployment and the process of transposing the RED II [EU directive] into national law is also a key opportunity to address the simplification of PV-systems repowering.” The second iteration of the Renewable Energy Directive [RED II], which sets EU clean power targets to 2030, was enacted in December 2018.
Solar groups say the Simplification Decree drafted as a condition of securing €68.9 billion of EU post-Covid recovery and resilience funding – and access to €122.6 billion of European loans – does not go far enough in slimming down a sluggish permitting regime.
Although the legislation offers support to agrivoltaics, industry representatives today said the package could prove “ineffective and inefficient” without further moves to cut the red tape associated with solar and wind farms.
The press statement said Italy will need 7 GW of renewables generation capacity per year to reach its 2030 carbon emissions reduction ambition and has achieved less than 1 GW annually “over the past few years,” thanks mainly to the restrictive permitting rules. At the current rate, said SolarPower Europe and its Italian peers, the nation will not achieve its 2030 targets until 2090.

The rewards, other than saving the planet, will amount to 15.4 million solar jobs by mid century as the sector leads the way in a renewables employment market that amounts to 38 million positions this decade and around 42.5 million in 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Those are just two of the headline solar-related predictions contained in the agency's 312-page World Energy Transitions Outlook report.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The study considers two future energy scenarios: business-as-usual and a system which could keep us within the 1.5C limit by reducing our 2010-baseline level of carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by mid century.
The document stresses the benefits to be gained if the world's governments can treble the rate of clean energy plant deployment this decade, to reach 10.7 TW of generation capacity in 2030, with the help of a global carbon price of around $75 per ton.
The renewables employment figures cited above compare to 18 million clean energy jobs by 2030, under the policies currently pledged around the world, and 23 million by mid century.
The investment costs appear daunting, according to IRENA, which said the $9.8 trillion currently pledged for renewables plants to 2050 needs to grow to $34 trillion. With plans in place to invest $43.1 trillion in fossil fuel facilities over the next 29 years, the study estimates that figure needs to come down to $15.7 trillion, with $24.2 trillion of the cash earmarked for polluting fuels needing to be switched to clean energy.
That the Abu Dhabi-based NGO is not calling for zero investment in fossil fuels by 2050 is bound to infuriate many. IRENA estimates 6% of the electricity generated in mid century will still come from natural gas, owing to the dispatchability of generation from gas-fired turbines, and 4% will be generated by nuclear facilities.
While renewables will have to account for the rest of the electricity generated, according to IRENA, as much as a third of the hydrogen to be deployed for industry; marine and aviation transport; plus seasonal clean power storage, will be blue – generated from natural gas facilities equipped with carbon capture and storage, a technology the report dubbed a “transitional solution” for countries heavily dependent on oil and gas.
While the report calls unequivocally for no new investment in coal, and for phase out from the polluting fuel to begin today in all nations, even the death of coal predicted as necessary this decade comes caveated with an exception for continued industrial uses.
If renewables capacities can hit 10.7 TW by 2030 – doubling the number of global solar jobs en route – a 90% clean electricity system in mid century will require 28 TW to be reached by that date, according to the report, with the help of $4.4 trillion per year in energy transition funding and including the roll-out of 5 TW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. Those electrolyzers, installed at a rate of 160 GW per year to 2050 – mostly after a post-2030 ramp up to around 400 GW per year – will offer 2 PWh of hydrogen storage capacity, which alone will feed demand for 22.7 PWh of electricity generation.
The world will also need 16 TWh of battery storage capacity by 2050 – more than 42 TWh if electric vehicle battery volume is included, according to the IRENA publication.
The private sector will drive the bulk of the investment needed, according to IRENA, offering 81% of the cash this decade and 83% for the following two decades, although the NGO stressed the vital role of public money in nailing down the conditions needed in diverse global markets to secure that speculative capital. It is the allocation of public money which will herd shareholders away from fossil fuel investment although that needs to be achieved with long-term, stable policies, IRENA added, in a note critical of the boom and bust nature of short-term instruments such as the U.S. investment tax credit legislation.
IRENA offered hope of what is possible in a section devoted to the renewables policies and ambitions which are already in place by pointing out the nations of Bhutan and Suriname have already achieved their net zero targets. Guesstimating every dollar spent on the energy transition will reap returns of $2-5.50 in the long run – mainly from public health and climate change mitigation benefits – IRENA again attempted to reinforce the urgency of the need to kick on.

Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) has closed a $163-million, five-year syndicated financing deal for a 300 MW solar plant in India. Developer Azure Power will build the plant in the Indian state of Rajasthan.
The latest transaction marks another milestone for MUFG, as it is the third renewables project financing in which it has acted as green structuring adviser. It has secured certification for a cumulative renewables capacity of 2.6 GW over the past six months.
MUFG also acted as lead arranger, hedging bank, and facility agent. It was recently among the 12 international banks that committed $1.35 billion in debt funding for Adani’s under-construction renewable asset portfolio. The revolving fund will initially finance the 1.69 GW hybrid portfolio of solar and wind projects to be set up through Adani’s four special purpose vehicles in the Indian state of Rajasthan.
“Having played leadership roles in a string of renewable project financings in India, we are even more convinced of the exciting prospects in the country’s renewables sector. We look forward to further harnessing our project financing and ESG expertise to support India’s sustainability aspirations,” said Colin Chen, MUFG’s head of ESG finance for the Asia Pacific.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/05/maoneng-planning-225-mw-450-mwh-big-battery-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 5, 2021",Maoneng planning 225 MW/450 MWh big battery in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Maoneng Australia has filed a development application for the AUD 112.5 million ($84.6 million) Gould Creek battery storage project in South Australia. It has said that the utility-scale battery will facilitate the rising penetration of renewables into the grid, while also providing stability for the energy market.
The developer has commenced the project’s notification period with the submission of its development application with the state government’s State Commission Assessment Panel (SCAP). The application proposes the construction of a 225 MW/450 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) on a 30-hectare site at Gould Creek, about 20 kilometers north of central Adelaide.
The Gould Creek BESS project, which would eclipse the recently expanded 150 MW/194 MWh ‘Tesla Big Battery’ known officially as the Hornsdale Power Reserve, will include approximately 240 shipping containers. Maoneng has not yet provided details about the chemistry of the batteries it intends to build, but it has said that the BESS will provide enough energy to support up to 40,000 households at peak hours.
An operations and maintenance building will also be constructed on the secured site, alongside a 33/220 kV substation. The Gould Creek project will connect to the high voltage 275 kV transmission grid via ElectraNet’s existing Para Substation, located less than 100 meters away from the proposed construction site.
The project, which is scheduled for completion in 2023, has already received support in principle from the state government. Department for Energy and Mines Chief Executive Paul Heithersay has said that the development can be considered “essential infrastructure” with the potential to benefit South Australia.
The development application report, prepared by engineering and energy consultancy firm GHD, claims that the project will be critical to ensuring the stability of the grid as it transitions to renewable energy.
“The proposed BESS represents a critical electrical infrastructure to the state,” the company said in the application documents. “As South Australia transitions to a greater share of intermittent renewable energy sources, grid stability facilities such as grid-scale batteries are required to ensure the safe and reliable provision of electricity. The system will support the safe and efficient operation of South Australia’s energy grid.”
The Gould Creek BESS is another addition to the growing list of big batteries in the pipeline for the National Electricity Market, including a 250 MW/250 MWh battery being constructed by energy giant AGL at the site of its coal-fired Torren Island Power Station in South Australia.
Data supplied by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows that financial commitments for new utility-scale battery projects in Australia increased fourfold between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of this year, from 150 MW to 600 MW. The CEC said at least 15 other large-scale battery storage projects have been announced this year, representing more than 6.6 GW of capacity and AUD 4.3 billion in investment.
That number is likely to increase with the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) proposing a new rule in April to bring new, ultra-fast frequency services into the National Electricity Market – services that will come largely from batteries.
The Gould Creek project builds on Maoneng’s Australian portfolio, which includes a deal to develop four large-scale batteries, each 50 MW/100 MWh in capacity in New South Wales, for energy giant AGL. The deal includes a 15-year contract that will allow AGL to call on capacity from the batteries at a fixed price. The batteries are expected to be installed by 2023.
That project adds to the 300 MW solar offtake deal Maoneng signed with AGL in December 2017, under which AGL sources energy from the 200 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm in southwestern New South Wales, among other solar projects.

A fold-out solar umbrella design that was inspired by NASA spacecraft and origami could bring clean energy to beachfront resorts this summer and beyond.
The “Parelio for Sammontana” design is a collaboration between innovation company Carlo Ratti Associati (CRA), architect Italo Rota, and gelato-maker Sammontana.
The fold-out array is meant to be deployed in the sun, shading beachgoers and generating PV energy that feeds attachable nebulizers and coolers underneath. This provides a way to keep beachgoers, their drinks and Italian ice cream cool on hot summer days.
The project was supported by a “transformable design” proponent, Prof. Chuck Hoberman of Harvard University. He worked with Italo Rota and MIT Prof. Carlo Ratti on the design. The modular system means that multiple umbrellas can be strung together, leaving it up to resorts to be creative with how they integrate the technology.
The umbrella is 8.2 feet high, has a 10.5-foot diameter, and includes panels over the entire top. A prototype is on display in the Porta Nuova district of Milan from June 12 to Aug. 8.
The solar umbrella is one of many ways designers are finding ways to integrate pv technology into unlikely spaces such as windows and blinds.
