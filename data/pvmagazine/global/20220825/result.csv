A key message they want to share is that not all products are created equal.
pv magazine met with Aldo Teixeira, the founder of Brazil’s biggest distributor, Aldo Solar, and a solar celebrity in the country, who said the company expects to experience 60 to 70% growth next year, in the worst-case scenario. Under the company's new CEO, Juliano Ohta, the distributor is focusing on educating solar integrators about the importance of quality and professionalism.
Ecori Solar, another top five Brazilian distributor of PV products, is offering certifications for integrators, and plans to only work with companies that meet its certification in the future. The company has a training center in Sao Paulo where it offers training courses.
The Brazilian solar energy association, ABSolar, meanwhile announced its own voluntary quality certification during Intersolar South America. Companies will be certified on three levels: most complete, intermedium, and meets basic requirements.
Both Aldo Solar and Ecori Solar predict demand for solar-plus-storage hybrid systems will grow in 2023, despite little market interest in storage at present given its high CAPEX – a figure of particular importance in Brazil. With Law 14.300 introducing a new net metering regime from January 6, 2023, storage may become more attractive for prosumers who would otherwise have to pay fees to inject excess energy into the grid.
Consulting firm Greener introduced a new study about utility-scale solar plants, reporting that 3.8 GW of projects are under development in 2022. Connection to the grid is still a concern for 48% of the companies interviewed, for whom storage may also prove a promising investment in the future.

Singapore-based developer Vena Energy has confirmed that its 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project in Queensland’s Darling Downs region had commenced full commercial operations after a successful 18-month testing and commissioning phase.
Vena Energy said on Wednesday that full operational dispatch rights of the Wandoan South battery have now been formally handed over to Australia’s biggest power producer, AGL Energy, as part of a long-term power purchase agreement.
Located near Wandoan in Queensland’s south-west, the project is the largest battery yet connected to the grid in the state and one of the largest in Australia. It has a capacity of 100 MW and can store up to 150 MWh of energy – equivalent to powering approximately 57,000 average-sized Australian households annually.
Owen Sela, the head of Vena Energy Australia, said reaching operational status for the project represents a “transformative milestone” for both the company and Australia’s renewable energy future with the battery expected to play a major role in improving grid stability and support the state’s shift to renewable energy.
“We believe that energy storage is the key in addressing the intermittency of renewable energy, and the Wandoan South BESS will play a pivotal role in the acceleration of Australia’s green energy transformation and contributing to climate change mitigation,” he said.
“With the largest utility scale battery in Queensland now operational, it will encourage more renewable energy generation and help manage the supply and demand balance in the national electricity grid.”
Vena Energy, which earlier this year reached financial close for stage two of the Tailem Bend project in South Australia last year, has indicated the Wandoan South BESS is just the first phase in the larger Wandoan South Project, which will eventually feature 650 MW of solar PV and 450 MW of energy storage capacity.
Sela said full operational dispatch rights of the Wandoan South BESS have been handed over to AGL which will now dispatch the battery on a day-to-day basis under a fixed long-term contract for 15 years.
AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said the battery will be capable of storing clean energy during times of low demand and dispatching it at times of low production or peak demand.
“During the day when renewables are online, the Wandoan South BESS is able to store this energy and then release it when the sun isn’t shining, the wind isn’t blowing, or other forms of generation are offline,” he said.
“This is important for providing security to the energy market and avoiding system constraints, particularly in areas like the Darling Downs with a large local load and the potential for a high renewable energy build over the coming decade.”
AGL said the battery will allow it to leverage excess solar generation in Queensland and provide capacity when renewable energy projects are not generating.
For AGL, the Wandoan battery deal is part of its strategy to substantially increase its flexible storage and generation capacity to support the transition from coal generation to renewables.
The energy giant has already commenced construction on a 250 MW/1 GWh battery being developed at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia and has secured planning approval for a 500 MW/2 GWh battery to be developed at the site of its coal-fired Liddell power plant in New South Wales.
AGL has also unveiled plans to build a 200 MW/800 MWh battery at Loy Yang A power station in Victoria, has received the tick of approval from NSW planning authorities for a 50MW/100MWh battery in Broken Hill, and has announced a deal with Maoneng Group to buy capacity from four 50 MW /100 MWh batteries in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/8MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/25/pervoskite-solar-cell-with-23-93-efficiency-via-new-moisture-treatment/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 25, 2022",Perovskite solar cell with 23.93% efficiency via new moisture treatment,"A group of scientists from the Huaqiao University in China has investigated the effects of moisture in the air on the intermediate and final perovskite films in solar cells and has proposed to use a controllable moisture treatment consisting of a series of nitrogen (N2)-protected characterization techniques.
“Many previous reports claimed that moisture could penetrate the bulk of perovskite film, destroy the organic-inorganic interactions, and generate the undesired lead(II) iodide (PbI2), resulting in the loss of photovoltaic properties,” they explained. “The disruptive effect of H2O on perovskite was ascribed to the irreversible hydration process, leading to the degradation of perovskite to  (PbI2.). However, when the dose of H2O was low, this hydration process was reversible, and the hydrated product could spontaneously dehydrate in a dry atmosphere.”
The researchers analyzed the effects of moisture by protecting and characterizing the metastable perovskite samples with various N2-filled cabins. They investigated, in particular, the evolution of wet perovskite films before and after moisture treatment by UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis), steady-state photoluminescence (PL), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
“We found that the humidified film can trigger the quasi-solid-solid reaction between organic salts and PbI2, realizing a rapid homogeneous distribution of the PbI2-organic salts complex,” they stated. “Consequently, the resultant perovskite films exhibited a more homogenous perovskite phase with larger crystal grains and higher crystallinity.”
They fabricated a 0.2 cm2 solar cell with perovskite films fabricated through a sequential two-step deposition process and obtained the PbI2 films by spin-coating the PbI2 solution onto substrates made of indium-tin-oxide and tin oxide (ITO/SnO2). The cell was based on a Spiro-OMeTAD precursor. Its efficiency and stability were tested under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. “Finally, we obtained a power conversion efficiency of approaching 24% (23.93%) with improved open-circuit voltage and fill factor,” they highlighted. “Moreover, the corresponding device can remain over 80% of initial efficiency after continuous 1-sun illumination of over 1200 h, showing robust operational stability.”
They described the device in the paper “Moisture-triggered fast crystallization enables efficient and stable perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in nature communications. “This work gives a feasible method for investigating metastable substances under protective conditions,” they concluded.

State-owned Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and National Hydroelectric Power Corp. (NHPC) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to set up a gigawatt-scale vertically integrated polysilicon-to-solar module manufacturing unit. 
“The MoU aims at leveraging the complementary strengths and capabilities of BEL and NHPC to cooperate and collaborate in conceptualization, structuring, and implementation of the gigawatt-scale vertically integrated solar manufacturing unit. [It allows] optimum utilization of resources, available assets, infrastructure and knowledge base of both the organizations [for the purpose],” stated BEL. 
BEL is India’s leading defense electronics manufacturer that has also established an infrastructure to manufacture mono-crystalline solar cells, mono-crystalline, and multi-crystalline solar modules. It has also installed solar plants across India and overseas.
NHPC, a hydropower producer, caters to clean energy development with its scope spanning concept to commissioning, operation and maintenance. In addition to hydropower, it has ventured into renewable energy projects, mainly solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid, floating solar, battery energy storage systems, and hydrogen.
“The MoU is a step in creating the required infrastructure on economies of scale for indigenous manufacturing of polysilicon to solar modules to reduce dependency on imports under Make In India and Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) exploiting the favorable policies of Govt. of India and other State Governments,” stated BEL.
Solar panels manufactured from this facility will be deployed to set up the rooftop and utility-scale solar power plants to achieve India’s renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030.

The German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has earmarked €10 million to support the deployment of solar modules with a power of up to 600 W on balconies, terraces, and facades.
Under the program, each household is entitled to receive a rebate of up to €500 ($496).
“The small systems with an output of up to 600 W that we want to support do not require approval, they only have to be registered with the energy supplier,” the government said in a statement. “This can quickly bring savings when electricity prices rise.”
According to estimates by the North Rhine-Westphalia consumer association (VZ NRW), in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, a balcony module, with an upfront investment of €350 to €500, can provide electricity with a current value of €54 per year. The payback period ranges from six to nine years. The prerequisite for this, however, is that the electricity is used entirely by the user.

The aerator consists of a 200 W solar panel, an aerator frame, an eight-leaf windmill for paddling water and restoring oxygen levels, a DC motor PG45 RPM working as a driving wheel, a buoy as a component lifter, and a box panel as a protective tool that uses the electricity network.
The motor is able to rotate the wheel automatically to produce air bubbles and work at certain hours during day and night. “When the engine is running, the power from the motor is drawn from the battery and passes through the controller,” the scientists explained. “When the charging voltage in the battery has reached a whole state, the controller will stop the electric current from entering the battery to prevent overcharging. So the battery life will be much longer lasting.” According to the researchers, the expected lifetime of the battery may reach up to 15 years.
The scientists are currently planning to improve the aerator with unspecified Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. “So that farmers can control and monitor the aerator from home using an integrated smartphone,” they stated.
Another research group in Malaysia recently suggested using floating PV coupled with storage to power energy-intensive aeration systems used in aquaculture projects. According to its estimates, the solar-plus-storage system is the most technically and economically feasible option among the other configurations for both day- and night-aeration scenarios

Toyota Motor North America announced it is partnering with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to construct, install, and test a 1 MW proton exchange membrane fuel cell power generation system at the NREL Flatirons campus in Arvada, Colorado.
The program is a 3-year, $6.5 million project funded by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, part of DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
The 1 MW system integrates multiple Toyota fuel cell modules to create a dispatchable stationary power system. In a previous partnership between the two, NREL demonstrated the use of an automotive fuel cell system to provide carbon-free power for a data center. This new test system is about 15 times the size of the previous test and is capable of both direct current and alternating current power output.
Toyota has been developing fuel cell technologies for over 25 years, largely in the light duty electric vehicle space. Toyota will provide the fuel cell modules and is partnering with systems integrator Telios for the design, balance-of-plant, and build of the system for delivery to NREL. Toyota developed a control system to manage operation of the modules and maximize efficiency and system life. Toyota said the system’s simplified design makes it a suitable candidate to be a drop-in replacement for conventional generators.
“Achieving carbon neutrality requires all of us to explore new applications of zero-emission technology, including how that technology will integrate with other systems, which the project with NREL will identify,” said Christopher Yang, group vice president, business development, fuel cell solutions, Toyota. “The application of our modules in deployments of this magnitude shows the scalability of Toyota’s fuel cell technology, whether it is a single fuel cell module for one passenger vehicle or multiple systems combined to power heavy-duty equipment.”
NREL will stress-test and push the operational boundaries of the system to identify performance limitations and degradation. The research project will also include an assessment of system performance when integrated with energy storage and renewable energy generation systems like solar and wind.
“We will study the scaling of PEM fuel cell systems for stationary power generation to understand what the performance, durability and system integration challenges are,” said Daniel Leighton, an NREL research engineer and principal investigator on the project. “This fuel cell generator system also creates a new megawatt-scale fuel cell research capability at NREL.”
The fuel cell generator is part of NREL’s Advanced Research on Integrated Energy Systems (ARIES) at the Flatirons Campus. The system includes a 1.25 MW PEM electrolyzer, 600-kg hydrogen storage system and 1 MW fuel cell generator. The fuel cell generator system will be installed this summer, and the full system will be commissioned later in 2022, said Toyota.
