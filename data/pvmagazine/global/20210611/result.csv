Germany-based HPS Home Power Solutions and Wohnwerke have developed a hydrogen-based electricity storage solution for residential applications.
Dubbed Picea, the new system will be sold under the brand Neubauten and will be first tested in a model house in Asperglen-Rudersberg near Stuttgart, which should prove the operational readiness and reliability of the system.
The system is planned to be linked to a PV system and to store power through power-to-gas hydrogen technology, which the manufacturer claims enables a year-round, CO2-free and independent power supply for one and two-family homes. The system also uses the entire process heat from energy generation, storage and usage to reduce the energy required to heat a home.
HPS Home Power Solutions states that the overall rate of utilization of its Picea system is at around 90 percent. In addition, it has a storage capacity of more than 100 times that of available residential batteries.
At the end of last year, Wohnwerke started commercial production of its self-sufficient energy storage system. A few days ago, HPS also announced a sales partnership for its Picea system with German company Energieinsel.

The first Energy Earthshot — Hydrogen Shot — seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per kilogram in one decade, the DOE said in a statement released on Monday. At the moment, hydrogen from renewable energy costs about $5 per kilogram. “The Hydrogen Shot establishes a framework and foundation for clean hydrogen deployment in the American Jobs Plan, which includes support for demonstration projects. Industries are beginning to implement clean hydrogen to reduce emissions, but there are still many hurdles to deploying it at scale,” the DOE stated, adding that its Hydrogen Program issued a request for information (RFI) on viable hydrogen demonstrations, including specific locations, that can help lower the cost of hydrogen.
Swiss energy company Axpo and Swedish-Swiss electrical equipment giant ABB committed to combining their technologies and skills for several projects related to green hydrogen in Italy. “The companies will work together to develop a pilot project in Italy which will research technologies along the entire green hydrogen supply chain and carry out production feasibility tests,” the companies announced Wednesday. “The letter of intent also covers mutual involvement in research and development projects funded by the European Union and support for green financing.” Axpo Italia's hydrogen strategy is taking shape. It recently announced its collaboration with the Italian services and consulting company RINA. “The initiation of this agreement with Axpo, with whom we have a long-standing collaboration, is a first step in exploring the potential of green hydrogen in Italy,” said Sergio Durando, head of ABB Energy Industries Italia. “We believe it is very important to collaborate with other players in the industry to make the transition to a clean energy future a reality.”
Germany’s gas transmission system operators Gascade and Ontras plan to set up a platform for the hydrogen industry in eastern Germany with an initial grid covering 475 kilometers of pipelines. “Around two-thirds of this transport system will be formed through the conversion of the existing natural gas infrastructure and a third through the addition of new H2 pipelines,” the companies said earlier this month. “This will produce an initial grid totaling 475 kilometers in length and interconnecting the production and consumption points in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Berlin.” The hub plan in eastern Germany made it onto the shortlist of 62 large-scale hydrogen projects selected for the €8 billion IPCEI program.
Pennsylvania-based Air Products and Texas-headquartered oil field services company Baker Hughes announced on Wednesday a global collaboration to develop “next generation hydrogen compression to lower the cost of production and accelerate the adoption of hydrogen as a zero-carbon fuel.” Baker Hughes will provide Air Products with hydrogen compression and gas turbine technology in several projects worldwide, including Canada and Saudi Arabia. “Our transformative hydrogen compression and gas turbine technology lowers the overall production cost for new energy frontiers such as hydrogen and is a strategic enabler for key projects,” said Rod Christie, executive vice president for Turbomachinery & Process Solutions at Baker Hughes. The Houston-based company has more than 2,000 hydrogen compressors operating around the globe. Its hydrogen portfolio includes “gas turbines that can burn methane gas and hydrogen blends from as little as 5% to as much as 100% hydrogen.” On Wednesday, Air Products also announced a partnership with the government of Canada and the province of Alberta: The multi-billion dollar plan to build a net-zero hydrogen energy complex “will make Edmonton, Alberta, the center of western Canada’s hydrogen economy and set the stage for Air Products to operate the most competitive and lowest-carbon-intensity hydrogen network in the world.”
Spanish-German engineering company and inverter manufacturer Siemens Gamesa published on Wednesday a white paper to drive down the cost of green hydrogen in the next decade, saying that it will reach price parity with fossil-based hydrogen between 2030 (onshore wind) and 2035 (offshore wind). This is conditional on the “appropriate policy frameworks and market mechanisms in place.” The company listed four requirements to deliver low-cost green hydrogen by 2030: an increase in renewables capacity; the creation of a demand-side market for green hydrogen; supply chain development; and building the right infrastructure in terms of logistics, storage and distribution. “The world needs up to 6,000 GW of new installed renewable energy capacity by 2050, up from 2,800 GW today to generate the expected demand for hydrogen (500 million tonnes, according to the Hydrogen Council),” Siemens Gamesa said in the press release.
Hydrogen Europe, an organization representing the interests of the European hydrogen industry, is calling for the inclusion of the maritime sector in the European Emission Trading System and for targets to be set on the demand of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. “The IMO discussions on the decarbonisation strategy are progressing but this must be accelerated in order to meet the European Green Deal objectives of carbon neutrality by 2050,” reads the executive summary of the paper, explaining why the EU should take the lead to promote a transformation of the maritime sector. The organization makes the point that since the lifetime of ships is high, the introduction of zero-emission vessels must start now.

The company wants to invest RMB10.8 million (around $1.67 million) in the factory and expand its capacity by 3 GW annually. The approval process is expected to be finalized within one month.
Chinese electrical meters provider Linyang Energy announced on Thursday it signed an agreement with EVE Battery, a China-based lithium-ion battery company, to set up a joint venture for the production of storage systems. The new joint venture will be created through an investment of RMB3 billion ($469 million) and is expected to have a battery capacity of 10 GWh. Linyang will take a 35% stake in the company, with EVE owning the remaining 65%. The production factory of the new company will locate in Qidong city, Jiangsu province, which is only around 60 km north from Shanghai.
Chinese state-owned lender China Development Bank (CDB) has allocated RMB500 billion ($78.1 billion) in special loans to support projects in the energy sector to help China reach its decarbonization targets. Around RMB100 billion are devoted to projects planned for 2021. The special loans will support a broad range of energy sources, including hydro, coastal nuclear, onshore and offshore wind, solar PV and hybrid wind-solar projects as well as storage, power transmission lines and pumped-hydro storage.
The delayed AGM to be held by state-owned manufacturer Luoyang Glass on June 28 will no longer vote on the proposal to spend RMB182 million ($28.5 million) to acquire a 60% stake in Qinhuangdao North Glass Co Ltd.

Alexandra Sdoukou, secretary general for energy and mineral resources at Greece’s Ministry of the Environment and Energy (Ypen), told pv magazine that a dedicated team has been set up to work on an energy storage framework this summer.
Academics from the National Technical University of Athens are driving the framework, which is expected to include policies for both large pumped hydroelectric energy storage systems and smaller battery storage systems, including behind-the-meter batteries.
“Following the recommendations of our energy storage team this summer, Ypen will prepare the country’s energy storage regulatory framework, aiming to make it a law within the third quarter of the year,” Sdoukou said.
She added that the ministry is also working on creating a subsidy scheme to support energy storage projects in Greece. It is within this scope that Greece aims to tender 700 MW of battery storage in 2021. She did not disclose the MWh figure.
700 MW battery storage tender 
Sdoukou said the ministry has not yet decided whether there will just be one main tender comprising 700 MW of battery capacity, or whether this figure will be auctioned off via a number of smaller size tenders.
The goal is to provide capital expenditure (capex) assistance for battery projects. Meanwhile, subsidies awarded via the tender mechanism will represent a top up for any income investors make on the electricity market.
Sdoukou declined to confirm whether the new subsidies will be a one off €/kWh payment or whether they will be linked to the batteries that have been able to inject electricity into the grid when it is stressed.
“We have addressed all these concerns,” she said, adding, “However, we prefer to provide these details later, when we have made our final policy decisions.”
Financing the tenders
In comparison, Greece’s secretary general has been very clear on the financing of the new scheme. The country’s Covid-19 recovery and resilience facility (RRF) comprises €54.5 billion, of which at least €10.4 billion will be invested in upgrading energy infrastructure, and the promotion of green energies and smart technologies.
To date, Greece is the only EU member state to sign an agreement with the European Investment Bank to co-manage up to €5 billion of Greece’s RRF.
“The energy ministry has allocated €450 million from Greece’s RRF to support specific storage projects, and this is going to be announced shortly,” Sdoukou said. “We plan to support the battery storage tenders with about €200 million specifically and we have assigned this subsidy plan to a Brussels-based legal service in order to make sure this support is in line with the EU’s state-aid rules and regulations.”
An energy storage webinar organized last year by Greece’s energy regulator suggested the country would need about 1,500 to 1,750 MW of new energy storage capacity to meet 60% of its 2030 electricity needs via renewable energy, which is in line with Greece’s national energy plan for 2030.
Energy storage projects alongside an electricity network expansion both within Greece and neighboring countries is deemed necessary for Greece to reach its 2030 electricity goals and phase coal out completely by 2025.
Greece’s government initially said in 2019 it would phase lignite out by 2028 at the latest, however this timeline has been scaled back to 2023 with the exception of one coal plant that will be converted to run on an alternative fuel source by 2025.

The analyst also explained, however,  that based on most data providers for this market segment, the price of polysilicon rose just 1% on June 9, following the SNEC trade show in Shanghai last week. “It looks like the threshold of pain has been reached for many end customers now,” the analyst explained. “Large utility-scale projects are already being pushed out into 2022.”
The market research company pointed out that the price hike for polysilicon was also the result of panic buying by manufacturers of wafers, cells and modules that, in the hope of hedging against further price increases, decided to buy as much polysilicon as possible, under what the analyst defines as a “hoarding impulse.”
According to its analysis, wafer, cell and module makers had two options to compensate for the polysilicon price increase by either accepting lower margins or passing the higher costs onto final customers. “Wafer manufacturers were able to pass the increase almost completely onto cell producers in the first quarter,” Bernreuter highlighted. “In April and May, however, the rally accelerated so rapidly that even wafer manufacturers had to give up some of their margins.”
Solar cell producers, by contrast, are described as the big losers of this market phase as they were able to raise the prices of their products by up to $0.017/W. “But that comes after a decrease of 1.2 cents/W in the first quarter; so they caught up by 2.9 cents/W in April and May,” the analyst stated.
As for module manufacturers, which also faced higher freight costs, they rose their price by up to 11% between January and May. The share of polysilicon in panel costs, however, increased to 35%.
The analyst concluded that the price spiral may be broken by the drop in final global demand. “If, however, lingering fears of lower polysilicon supply due to maintenance overhauls in the third quarter should flare up again, a new round of price increases could set in.”
*The article was amended to reflect that the share of polysilicon in panel costs increased to 35%, and not by 35% as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/11/where-appropriate-agrivoltaics-can-certainly-be-a-viable-and-meaningful-alternative-to-large-scale-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 11, 2021","‘Where appropriate, agrivoltaics can certainly be a viable and meaningful alternative to large-scale solar’","Agrivoltaics are raising big expectations inside and outside the solar sector. The combination of solar power generation and grazing livestock or growing vegetable crops began to be considered a viable option to develop ground-mounted PV facilities on agricultural land over the past two years and is seen by many as a possible alternative to conventional solar parks. However, the business models and technologies that are currently being developed across several countries have not yet ensured the required viability for the deployment of huge volumes of solar capacity, which are strongly needed for the world's decarbonization and energy transition.
According to Alexis Pascaris, a researcher in environmental and energy policy at the Michigan Technological University (MTU), agrivoltaics are a very practical and advantageous alternative to large-scale solar, specifically in places where there are land-use constraints or needs for rural economic development. “Each system is going to be unique and reflect the context of the community in which it is built, which differentiates agrivoltaics from the conventional approach to large-scale development,” she stated in a conversation with pv magazine. “Agrivoltaics takes conventional solar one step further – it entails partnerships between key sectors and thoughtful, long-term planning about managing our key resources.”
Agrivoltaics are reinvigorating the solar industry by providing a means to make tangible contributions to agriculturalists and host communities, all while increasing the world’s solar generating capacity, she added. “Where appropriate, agrivoltaics can certainly be a viable and meaningful alternative to large-scale solar.”

Considering the right proportion between agricultural and energy business and whether agriculture should be preponderant, Pascaris said that a 50/50 balance between both enterprises should be pursued. “I am personally inclined towards prioritizing the agricultural component of the system,” she explained. “The idea here is not to advance solar development at the expense of farmland.” In her view, there are many other surfaces upon which solar panels can be placed, but there are also many valuable benefits of superpositioning them above crops and livestock, including water retention and protection from heat stress, to name a few. “The idea is to create a symbiotic relationship between the agricultural activity and the solar array, as both benefit from the co-location.”
A clear definition of what agrivoltaics are is still missing, despite recent efforts to create guidelines, best practices and standards, and sometimes projects are described as pertaining to this new domain just because a couple of cows or sheep are grazing around the panels, or a few beehives are built close to the array. “The definition of agrivoltaics varies depending on who you ask,” Pascaris said. “Some use the term to be inclusive of all forms of co-location, while some are more particular about the distinctions between the different forms.”
Agrivoltaic systems intentionally strike a balance and harness synergies between agriculture and solar energy production and, in its truest sense, refers to the coexistence of crops or livestock with solar photovoltaics, she explains. “A robust agrivoltaic system wouldn’t just feature a couple of grazing cows or scattered plants, but would actively accommodate farming activity and be designed for maximum dual output of both electricity and agriculture.”
Comparing the costs between agrivoltaics and the conventional utility-scale solar business, Pascaris said that both economic models and existent applications tend to show an increase in hardware costs for agrivoltaic systems in comparison to a conventional ground-mounted array.
“The difference in cost can typically be attributed to the raised racking system or additional fencing, in instances where those infrastructure modifications are necessary,” she emphasized. “But these upfront investments in specialized hardware are eventually recovered as the agrivoltaic system produces a dual-revenue stream.”
The opportunities and barriers for agrivoltaics in the United States are described in the paper “Integrating solar energy with agriculture: Industry perspectives on the market, community, and socio-political dimensions of agrivoltaics,” recently published in Energy Research & Social Science and written by Pascaris and other researchers from the MTU and the US Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories.
“This study found that solar industry professionals perceive the potential for an agrivoltaic project to retain agricultural interests and consequently increase local support for development as the most significant opportunity of dual use solar,” the group of scientists point out. “This indicates that solar developers can play an active role in cultivating social acceptance of agrivoltaics through public engagement.”
According to their findings, solar developers and agricultural industry professionals are thinking about very different issues regarding the opportunities and barriers associated with agrivoltaics. “The different opportunities and barriers raised by these two different groups of actors highlight the potential for complex interactions in agrivoltaics decision making,” the paper notes. “If actors come to the table with divergence in their motivations, their concerns, and what they view as the opportunities and barriers, it may be more difficult for them to work together and ensure that each group has their needs and priorities addressed.”

One of the two projects, with a planned capacity of 24 MW/24 MWh, is expected to provide power to the following locations: S. Hithadhoo, S. Hulhudhoo-Meedhoo, Gn. Fuvahmulah, GDh. Thinadhoo, HDh. Kulhudhuffushi, B. Eydhafushi and Lh. Hinnavaru.
The second tendered battery, with a capacity of 16 MW/16 MWh, is planned for the locations of L. Atoll Islands, Lh. Naifaru, Dh. Kudahuvadhoo, GA. Villingili and Sh. Funadhoo.
Interested developers will have time until August 26 to pre-qualify for the tender's next stage.
“The Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) installations covered in this tender is supported through a US$23 million concessional loan to the Government of Maldives, allocated from Clean Technology Fund,” the ministry said in a statement.
Both projects will be developed under the umbrella of the World Bank's Accelerating Renewable Energy Integration and Sustainable Energy (ARISE) initiative, which is aimed at helping Maldives accelerate its transition to renewable energy sources.
At the end of 2020, the archipelago had about 15 MW of installed PV capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.
Despite these and other plans to develop renewables throughout the islands of the Maldives, the country still depends heavily on diesel fuel and is plagued by intermittent energy supplies and high costs. It is also particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, as rising sea levels continue to swallow up its coastline.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/11/investigating-all-manganese-flow-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 11, 2021",Investigating all-manganese flow batteries,"Flow batteries present an attractive alternative to lithium-ion in stationary storage, offering longer lifetimes and lower degradation. Since the batteries aren’t suitable for electric vehicles or consumer electronics, the market size is much smaller than lithium-ion. Flow batteries, however, are gaining market share in stationary storage projects designed to support regional grids and boost consumption of renewables generated power.
To date, most of these projects have relied on vanadium or zinc-bromine flow batteries. There is, however, a wealth of other materials with the potential to be used in flow batteries, and scientists are hard at work narrowing down those that offer the best potential for the highest performance, the lowest cost and the least environmental damage.
Manganese is a relatively cheap and abundant element, already to set to play an increasing role in lithium-ion batteries amid growing concerns over the supply chain and toxicity of cobalt and nickel. A group of scientists led by Germany’s University of Freiburg decided to investigate manganese for flow batteries, achieving some impressive results.
The group fabricated all-manganese flow batteries in a variety of configurations with different electrode materials, solvents and membranes. The best of these demonstrated an energy density of 74 watt-hours per liter and a cell voltage of 2.59 V. “Although further optimizations are necessary,” the group states, “this system represents a new and promising setup toward sustainable energy storage.”
The batteries are described in the paper Investigations toward a Non-aqueous Hybrid Redox-Flow Battery with a Manganese-based Anolyte and Catholyte, published in Advanced Energy Materials. The group notes that its ‘first try’ with manganese already exceeds the energy density of commercial vanadium redox-flow batteries, which have several decades of research behind them.
The promising performance comes with several caveats. In observing the batteries the group noted issues including high overpotential for manganese deposition, leaching toward the negative electrode, capacity fade and low energy efficiency, as well as what they describe as “cauliflower like” deposition, leading to the formation of an unstable manganese film. They also note that the battery’s area specific resistance would have to be dramatically reduced to develop a commercially viable battery.
With further investigation into different materials combinations, additives, and pre-treatment,s the group expects most of these challenges to be overcome, and states that performance should improve alongside this, with the tweaking of various parameters in the battery design.
“Compared to the benchmark vanadium redox flow battery system, the all-manganese flow battery has a higher energy density and is based on the cheap and abundant element manganese,” the researchers conclude. “Additionally, there is still a lot of room for improvements, making the all-MFB presented in this work an interesting field for further research.”

The dam separates the Krammer and Volkerak lakes from the Oosterschelde.
Energy cooperatives Zeeuwind and Deltawind are developing the plant, the first of 10 renewable energy projects to be built on government premises under the Hernieuwbare energie op Rijksareaal (Renewable Energy on Public Land) program that is being implemented in partnership with the state-run RijkSdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) agency, which manages the subsidy program for clean energy sources, and Rijkswaterstaat – the water management agency of the Netherlands, under the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.
The solar plant will be located close to the wind park, which hosts 34 wind turbines with a capacity of 3 MW each, and a lock used to avoid the exchange between the freshwater Volkerak and the brackish water of the Oosterschelde. “The lock must of course continue to function properly and the basins where the solar panels must be installed are essential for this,” the RVB said in a statement. “But water safety and water quality must also be ensured because nature and a healthy underwater environment are very important.”
The solar plant is expected to have a capacity of up to 50 MW, with commercial operations set to begin in 2023. It will likely be connected to the same connection point as the wind complex. The Netherlands‘ solar energy association, Holland Solar, the wind energy trade body NWEA and the association of energy cooperatives, Energie Samen, recently defined a model agreement to help the owners of large scale wind and solar power assets share the same connection point in order to avoid current grid capacity issues.
The Netherlands offers enormous potential for floating PV as it has approximately 52,000 hectares of shallow inland water surfaces to use. The Dutch Foundation for Applied Water Research (STOWA) recently published guidelines and tools for companies interested in developing floating PV projects across the water-rich country.

The introduction of derivatives in India’s short-term power market will make it easier for renewable project developers to enter into offtake arrangements with state-owned distribution companies (discoms), according to a new briefing note from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
“The launch of new financial instruments will enable developers to hedge their offtaker risk without requiring the signing of long-term contracts with discoms for the financial closure of projects,” said author Vibhuti Garg, energy economist, lead India at IEEFA.
Long-term (usually 25-year) power purchase agreements (PPAs) between power producers and discoms account for 88% of electricity transactions in India. PPAs provide investors with the certainty of power offtake over a long duration and de-risk them from price volatility. 
However, Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) currently has 15 GW to 16 GW of auctioned capacity waiting to be signed by discoms. This backlog of unsigned PPAs is now impacting the development of new renewable energy projects.
Discoms are struggling with huge financial losses and have become increasingly reluctant to enter long-term PPAs with renewable energy developers, as renewable tariffs hit a record low. Solar tariffs in India dipped to a new record low of INR 1.99/kWh at the end of 2020.
The electricity derivatives market in India will likely take shape in 2021. Under the proposed structure, the physical delivery of electricity will be separated from financial settlements. 
Garg sees the sale of power in the futures market as a positive step that will help hedge the offtaker risk and provide flexibility and certainty of supply to both discoms and developers. This would also help develop the price signal needed to incentivize supply into peak demand periods, which is the key to enabling battery deployments and demand response management. 
“Discoms with their power optimization tools can also participate in derivatives markets and hedge their risk. This will help discoms to lower their power purchasing costs and prevent them from being saddled with the inflexibility of long-term PPAs as electricity demand profiles change. Discoms will have the flexibility to buy power based on demand,” she added.
Under the proposed structure, long-term contracts in the physical (spot) market will be traded on power exchanges under the jurisdiction of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). In the financial (derivatives) market, contracts are set to be traded on commodity exchanges regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
The physical and financial electricity markets will complement each other, according to Garg.
“A spot market at power exchanges and the derivatives market will feed into each other,” she said. “It will be a virtuous cycle in which the derivatives market will establish forward prices, more participants will shift from PPAs to exchanges, increasing liquidity in derivatives and subsequently increasing liquidity in the spot market at power exchanges and vice versa.”
Financial products such as futures, options, and swaps don’t require the physical delivery of electricity. This opens up the market to hedgers, speculators, and other participants who can add liquidity without owning electricity assets.
“The financial market will increase trade volumes and will be lucrative for players including developers, discoms, open access buyers, traders, investors in the power sector and others who also have the ability to take on risk. It will also enable the sale of hybrid products. With an increasing share of renewable energy in the total generation mix, multiple products including wind, solar, and biogas, along with battery storage, are likely to see more demand,” said Garg.
The rollout of the financial market follows the launch last year of the Real-Time Market and the Green Term-Ahead Market.

A group of researchers from the University of Luxembourg and Uppsala University in Sweden has sought to address this challenge by reducing the amount of copper in the material. “There are many unanswered questions about pure-sulfide CIGS, as compared to its close cousin pure selenide CIGS,” Sudhanshu Shukla, who led the research, told pv magazine. “The former has received rather less attention due to the lack in performance and we believe that our work will spur interest in the field and bring attention to the fundamental photophysics of the material and efficiency enhancement.”
The researchers used a type of Cu(In,Ga)S2 with a bandgap of 1.6 electron volts for the cell absorber layer. According to them, this material with a lower copper content shows a significantly lower deficit for quasi‐Fermi level splitting (QFLS), which is a standard theoretical tool to describe the operations of a semiconductor device; and represents the maximum open‐circuit voltage a solar cell can achieve.
They fabricated a cell with a buffer layer made of cadmium sulfide (CdS) and a second device with a buffer layer based on zinc sulfide oxide. The latter exhibited a high open-circuit voltage of 920 mV and the highest efficiency of 15.2%. The former showed an efficiency of just 12.8%.
“The higher open-circuit voltage is due to the higher QFLS, i.e., better optoelectronic quality of the absorber, and due to less open-circuit voltage loss,” the academics explained, adding that the increased quality of the interface also played a role in this process, as it created a more suitable conduction band alignment with the Zn(O,S) buffer layer. “In addition, the larger bandgap of Zn(O,S) buffer layer enables absorption of higher energy photons resulting in a higher short-circuit current density, consistent with the photocurrent gain.”
The scientists add that existing processes used to manufacture CIG selenide thin films could easily be adapted for similar sulfide materials. “The process developed to produce commercial CIGSe thin-film solar cells can be translated to produce CIGS without requiring additional infrastructure,” Shukla explained.  “Companies like Avancis and Flisom are already making commercial large area CIGS modules and scalability is certainly possible.”
The solar cell is described in the paper Over 15% efficient wide-band-gap Cu(In,Ga)S2 solar cell: Suppressing bulk and interface recombination through composition engineering, published in Joule.

Enel Green Power Australia, a subsidiary of Italian energy giant Enel, will explore how to combine solar PV generation and agricultural production in a new research program to be undertaken at its Cohuna Solar Farm in northern Victoria.
The research project, which will assess the benefits of agrivoltaics in terms of operational efficiency and maintenance, will also look to increase the sustainability of utility-scale solar PV facilities. It is being rolled out at the 34 MW Cohuna Solar Farm in northern Victoria. The 82-hectare solar farm is still in the construction phase. Once complete, it will feature about 87,000 bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers.
Enel, in partnership with Agriculture Victoria, has already launched an agrivoltaics project at the site. It plans to identify the best pastoral farming plants that can coexist with solar panels and explore how the spaces between the arrays can potentially be utilized for agricultural production.
Miriam Di Blasi, Enel’s head of environment and impacts mitigation, said she is confident the design of the Cohuna Solar Farm will provide “best practices” for large-scale solar PV facilities throughout the world.
“These experiments will produce a huge amount of data that will be compiled in an atlas to support future decisions, enabling new plants to select the best farming solutions and related business models based on the solar technology, the local climate and the analyses of the social, economic and environmental context,” she said.
Much of the land near the Cohuna Solar Farm is home to sheep grazing operations. While ‘solar grazing’ is proving to be a popular form of land co-use for large-scale solar, other forms of agrivoltaics are emerging that support horticulture, viticulture, aquaculture and even cropping activities.
Di Blasi said the Cohuna agrivoltaics project will seek to identify what low-lying pastures and crops can be grown beneath the modules. Wheat, barley and canola are among the crops that are already being grown in the region. Members of the Agriculture Victoria team visited the Cohuna site in April, marking the beginning of the first phase in the research project, which Di Blasi said would be a 12-month “massive monitoring and data-gathering” process.
Di Blasi said the data will be used to identify the best plants for the conditions and sustainable agriculture production. This phase is due to be completed in May 2022, with the data to inform phase two of the project.
The Cohuna plant is the latest site to be added to the research project with Enel, which manages 49 GW at 1,200 sites in 32 countries. It is already exploring agrivoltaic opportunities at nine of its solar farms in Spain, Italy and Greece. Testing at the European sites began in January with the planting a number of vegetables, herbs and legumes.
Werther Esposito, country manager for Enel Australia, said the Cohuna project aligns with company’s focus of creating shared opportunities, and combining energy efficiency and the sustainable use of land.
“We’re proactively working with our local stakeholders to explore how we can contribute to building adaptive and resilient agricultural systems through diversified and sustainable use of land at our project sites,” he said.
The Cohuna Solar Farm is Enel’s second solar PV facility in Australia. Enel, in a joint venture with Dutch Infrastructure Fund, also owns the 275 MW Bungala Solar Farm, near Port Augusta, South Australia.

The cause of a fire on the roof of an Amazon Warehouse in Perryville, Maryland, has been deemed to be an issue with a rooftop solar system, according to Susquehanna Hose Co.
The State Fire Marshall has ruled the fire as accidental. No one was injured in the incident.
The fire, which caused an estimated $500,000 in damages, is the second such rooftop solar system fire to occur at an Amazon facility in as many years. In April 2020, the roof of an Amazon facility in Fresno, California, caught fire due to a section of 20 panels on the roof.
Across the country, solar system fires have been on the rise since 2015, when Lawrence Shaw, owner of Higher Powered, LLC, a company that does residential solar preventative maintenance (PM) in Arizona, reached out to the the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) to request the data on these events. While the USFA doesn’t specifically track solar fires as their own category, they are recorded and have risen steadily every year, from 25 in 2015 to 56 in 2018. Solar system fires are much more common in the southwest – specifically California, Arizona, and Nevada – but they are by no means a geographically limited phenomenon.
Shaw believes that regular infrared imaging of residential projects could cut instances of fire down immensely, as many of these instances are started by hotspots, small instances of failure, and thermal events that can be picked up by infrared imaging.

Everyone loves solar, right? Well, not always.
In our prior Solar 101 articles, we’ve covered everything from construction, finance, incentives, and net metering to how to vet a contractor. Subsequent articles will focus more on hardware and revenue streams.
Here, we will look at a few of the many “gotchas” that might upend your dream – or practical ability – to install solar panels. The examples here are only the tip of the iceberg. If you’ve had any weird happenings in your own solar dealings, please comment at the end of this article.
Nasty neighbors
The No. 1 strange thing to deal with is neighbors.
For many of us, this isn’t a revelation. The proverb “good fences make good neighbors” is known to have originated independently in several cultures. And as Ben Franklin said: “Love thy neighbor, yet don’t pull down your hedge.”
Your homeowner’s association (HOA) will be one of the first “strange” places that you may need to reach out to in order to verify rules related to having solar on your property. Your HOA is typically in place to protect the value of your property from neighbors who have different tastes than your own. Solar power is considered by many folks to be just such a different taste.
The most common HOA rule forbids homeowners from installing solar panels facing a street. This rule is in place in many HOAs in many states across the country.
Check to see if your HOA has any solar or aesthetics rules that might limit where you can install solar. If the HOA has rules against solar facing the street, then ask your contractor if you can install on a different roof surface. Keep in mind, however, that different roof surface angles generate different amounts of solar electricity, potentially affecting your payback period.
The next defense against an HOA is to build a “beautiful” solar power system. Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. To my eye, the Solaria system above is about as handsome as a standard solar system gets.
Unfortunately, some of your neighbors just won’t get it. For example, folks in North Carolina voted against a larger scale solar power project because they believed solar panels would ‘suck up all of the sunlight.’
When you install a residential solar power project on the ground, there’s a general requirement to get zoning approval, along with approval from neighbors in a town meeting. The best way to avoid a town meeting is to build solar power on your roof instead of on the ground.
Interconnection issues
Plugging your system into the power grid can sometimes present more of a challenge than you might expect.
There are plenty of locations already connected to the power grid that won’t allow a solar connection. An electricity utility recently informed this author that a customer’s home was too far from key power grid hardware, for example. The line’s voltage wasn’t strong enough to handle the solar system’s potential export to the power grid, the utility said.
Unfortunately, this is often a problem that cannot be determined until after you have spent money preparing and submitting one or more applications to the utility. Such an outcome could be a major setback, so you may want to take time to learn about interconnection issues before going forward.
In some places – especially Hawaii, but also hot solar markets like San Diego and Massachusetts – there is too much solar power.  If you’re the last one on your block to get solar, you might not be allowed to export any electricity to the power grid.
Political pressure
The energy industry is among the largest and most economically influential industries on earth. And even though each of us is looking to attach just one tiny solar power system to the largest machines in the world, plenty of folks out there see that as an attack on their bottom line. And they don’t like that one bit.
For instance, the U.S. federal government group that regulates the power grid – Federal Energy Regulatory Commission – recently stated it is probable that Alabama is violating the law by charging those who install solar power projects a capacity fee. Currently, anyone who installs residential solar power in Alabama will pay this fee, which has been in place since 2013.
Luckily, Kansas struck down a similar fee against solar power about a year ago. The fee had been proposed by utilities, approved by state regulators, and even affirmed by a lower court – despite a 1980 Kansas law explicitly forbidding such fees. All it took to shut down the proposed legislation was a reading of the “plain text” per the state supreme court judge.
One extreme example that might not affect residential customers directly – but we all should stay conscious of – is in Wyoming. The state is moving forward with a rainy day fund of $1.2 million, which it may use to sue states whose pro renewable energy laws have wounded their extraction business.
Natural dynamics
Nature is another dynamic to consider. For instance the quantity of dust, pollen, and other materials that fall on your solar panels varies broadly, and can even change every few miles.
Is the home near an industrial area? Watch out for dust. Near beautiful fields? Pollen. Near a pig farm? Sticky manure dust. Close to the beach? Beware falling quahogs.
Falling quahogs?
At left we see a Sunpower 315 W solar panel from a 2013 installation at a fishing harbor. The gulls collect the bivalve mollusk known as a quahog (the official shellfish of Rhode Island) from  waterways, and drop them on hard surfaces to crack open the shells and eat what’s inside.
Obviously, broken solar panels won’t generate much electricity. And we’re pretty sure quahog-caused damage isn’t covered under hail warranties.
