The multilateral development lender has issued the 30-year loan, which includes a five-year grace period, via its International Development Association (IDA) concessional funding operation. The credit line will pay for more than 31,000km of power lines, 157 electricity substations, and related infrastructure in the Dhaka and Mymensingh divisions of the country.
The program, intended to modernize Bangladesh's power distribution network, will also increase the climate resilience of grid infrastructure in 25 rural electric cooperatives covered by the operations of government body the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights.

The World Bank today said the soft loan, which takes its IDA spending in Bangladesh to more than $14 billion – including more than $1.8 billion for the power sector – would benefit around 40 million people.
The loan will finance a grid capable of hosting bi-directional flows of electricity – to support rooftop systems exporting excess to the grid – and information, while being resilient to climate and extreme weather events as well as cyber attacks. A supervisory control and data acquisition system will be incorporated into the upgraded network, as well as advanced metering infrastructure, according to the development body, which says it has invested more than $35 billion into Bangladesh in the form of grants and interest-free and concessional credit since the nation's independence in 1971.
The grid investment “will be paired with new and advanced technologies to help modernize and transform the electricity system,” the World Bank said.
Dandan Chen, World Bank acting country director for Bangladesh, said: “This program will help modernize and ensure [the] climate resilience of the distribution network, which is the backbone of a secure and reliable power system,” adding, the country's grid had been unable to “keep pace with the remarkable increase in electricity generation” in the last ten years.
The grid funding program was accompanied by a $15 million grant from the global, public-money financed Clean Technology Fund, of which the World Bank is trustee.

Despite being open to several power generation technologies, all the projects that were selected in the procurement exercise are relying on PV and have a combined capacity of 183 MW.
For the small PVPP category that includes installations between 300 kW and 1 MW, the final average price was HUF 21.26 ($0.065)/ kWh, while in the large PVPP group, with projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 20 MW, the final average price was HUF 16.15 ($0.049)/ kWh.
Including both project categories, the HEPURA expects to contract a total of 299 GWh.
For comparison, in the second auction held in February 2021, the HEPURA contracted 390 GWh. The lowest bid came in at HUF 16.18/kWh. For installations between 300 kW and 1 MW, final prices varied from HUF 21/kWh to HUF 23.03/kWh, while in the group including projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 49.9 MW, final prices ranged from HUF 16.18/kWh to HUF 17.97/kWh. The average final price in the first category was HUF 22.35 while, in the second one, it was HUF 17.22.
In the first pilot auction held in March 2020, the HEPURA awarded almost all the 131.9 MW capacity to solar projects. The final average price was HUF 24.81/kWh in the first category and HUF21.69/kWh in the second. The lowest bid of HUF 20.20/kWh was submitted for a 20 MW solar plant.

French energy giant TotalEnergies has commissioned France's largest battery.
Located at its Etablissement des Flandres facility in Dunkirk, in northern France, the battery has an installed capacity of 61 MW and a total storage capacity of 61 MWh. It is made up of 27 2.5 MWh containers designed and assembled by Saft, TotalEnergies' battery subsidiary, which develops advanced batteries for industry.
The project was secured by TotalEnergies through a tender held by French grid operator Réseau de Transport d’Electricité (RTE) in February 2020. The first 25 MW unit of the storage project was finalized in January 2021.
The battery is intended to provide the national grid with electricity, especially in winter, and to guarantee the security of the network by serving as a primary reserve.
“With the success of this project and Saft's expertise in batteries for energy storage, TotalEnergies intends to deploy its storage solutions in countries where the company is actively developing renewable energies,” said Vincent Stoquart, TotalEnergies' senior vice president of  renewables.

The EU executive approved the €1.4 billion plan, which will be partly financed by the nation's Recovery and Resilience Fund from the bloc, paid out as part of Europe's post-Covid recovery package.
Approving the scheme under EU state aid rules, the commission yesterday said the incentive on Crete would consist of premium payments to generators merely to bridge the gap between clean energy generation costs and wholesale electricity prices, with the premiums adjustable in line with technology costs on a “sliding” basis.
For the 46 other islands spread across all of the plan's 29 electricity networks, incentive payments will be determined by auction bidding by renewables developers.
The scheme is intended to supplant around 80% of the electricity generation across the 47 islands – none of which, except Crete, is connected to the Greek mainland – which currently depends on diesel and oil.
With Athens intending to incentivize renewables until it can get the islands connected to mainland grids, it is expected the program will drive the deployment of 264 MW of solar and wind generation capacity, on a hybrid project basis alongside energy storage systems, over the next four years.
At the start of the week, the commission also approved plans for public money to back a planned 680 MW/3.97 GWh pumped hydro storage plant at Amfilochia, in western Greece.
EU state aid rules, the commission said on Monday, will permit plans by Athens to provide a €250 million investment grant for the project being planned by the Terna Energy renewables business owned by Greek construction conglomerate GEK Terna. The government also plans to shore up the business case for Amfilochia with annual support funded by a levy applied to electricity companies.

The updated regulations, which originally came into force in 2014, will go into effect in January 2022.
“Under the new state aid rules, rooftop PV projects up to 1 MW, as well as 100% renewable energy community or SME-owned projects up to 6 MW, will not be burdened by competitive bidding processes. This empowers more European citizens and businesses to invest in solar, and accelerates the prosumer-led energy transition,” said Naomi Chevillard, senior policy advisor at European solar association Solarpower Europe.
In addition, the new CEEAG guidelines allow government and national authorities to hold tenders for specific technology applications, such as floating solar and agrivoltaics. By contrast, aid for fossil fuels would now be stopped or at least further restricted in the case of natural gas, in accordance with the EU Green Deal.
“As more member states look to solar and storage to decrease exposure to volatile gas-driven electricity prices, hybrid solar tenders introduced in the new subsidy rules will enable the growth of these technologies,” said Solarpower Europe policy director Claire Couet. State aid still plays an important role in investing in renewable energy, she added. “The new state aid framework grants much more flexibility to member states in designing their aid mechanism and importantly, provides the right toolbox for member states to deliver on the EU’s 2030 climate target of a 55% reduction of greenhouse gases.”
The new guidelines include sections on energy efficiency measures, aid for clean mobility, infrastructure, circular economy, pollution reduction, protection and restoration of biodiversity, as well as measures to ensure security of energy supply, subject to certain conditions.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/22/toshiba-claims-8-4-efficiency-for-transparent-cuprous-oxide-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 22, 2021",Toshiba claims 8.4% efficiency for transparent cuprous oxide solar cell,"Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba has announced an 8.4% power conversion efficiency for a transparent cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin-film solar cell. The result, the company claims, is the highest efficiency ever reported for any cell of this kind to date.
The cell was conceived for use in electric vehicles and high-altitude platform station (HAPS) applications. “The tandem solar cell offers the promise of more efficient solar modules by combining top and bottom cells that generate power at different wavelengths,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The record efficiency was achieved by reducing copper(II) oxide (CuO) and copper (Cu) impurities during the fabrication of the cell's Cu2O layer and, in particular, by carefully controlling the oxygen flow. These impurities are due to the reactive sputtering deposition method used in the manufacturing of the cell. “We used a transparent conducting oxide as the bottom electrode and fabricated a low-impurity Cu2O thin film by reactive sputtering using argon and oxygen,” the Toshiba research scientists stated.
The Cu2O thin films were deposited by reactive sputtering in mixed oxygen and argon atmosphere on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) on a glass substrate with TCO composed of double layers of antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) and indium tin oxide (ITO). “The ATO layer was chosen for its good electrical contact with the Cu2O layer,” the researchers further explained. “The thicknesses of the Cu2O thin films were varied from 2 to 5 μm.”
The cell was tested under standard illumination conditions and was found to have an efficiency of 8.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.13 V, a short-circuit current of 10.63 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.696.  The Cu2O thin films showed the highest transmittance with the lowest impurity ratio.
The scientists also conducted a device simulation analysis and found that the cell has the potential to reach an efficiency of over 10% by decreasing the surface velocity at p–n interfaces and increasing n-type carrier density at the n-layer. “With support from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Toshiba will continue research to achieve the 10% PCE target for top Cu2O cells,” the researchers said. “Toshiba is also cooperating with Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation in the development of large-scale Cu2O solar cells that are the same size as mass-produced silicon solar cells.”
The solar cell was described in the paper “Highly transparent Cu2O absorbing layer for thin film solar cells,” published in Applied Physics Letters (AIP).

The EU's executive body on Monday announced its approval, under the bloc's state-aid rules, of Latvia's extension of a scheme to partially exempt some businesses from making their full electricity-related surcharge payments.
Under the terms of the original exemption program, which ran from May 2017 to the end of last year, certain electricity-intensive industries exposed to international competition could avoid paying up to 85% of a surcharge levied by the state upon electricity usage, the proceeds of which are used to finance renewables.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
Latvia extended the scheme until the end of this year in a move which has now been rubber-stamped by the commission.
The extended program increased the number of industrial sectors which qualify for an exemption from the surcharge and also reduced the electricity-intensity requirements concerned, to help energy-intensive operations through the Covid-19 crisis.
The commission said this year's budget for the surcharge exemption program had been set at a provisional €7 million by the Latvian authorities.
The commission has also approved Austria‘s planned renewables incentive scheme, under state-aid regulations.
Vienna plans to hold technology-specific auctions to determine the level of premium payments acceptable to developers of solar, wind, hydro, biomass and biogas facilities. The payments are intended to bridge the gap between the wholesale electricity price and the actual cost of renewables generation and the authorities plan to review auction rules and technology-specific premium price caps, with the possibility of also holding mixed renewables tenders to include wind and hydro.
The scheme approved by the commission on Monday will run to the end of the decade, with top-up payments granted for up to 20 years. Austria estimates the program will cost €4.4 billion over the next ten years.
The nation is aiming to source all its electricity from renewables by 2030.

The 10 MW system in Heerhugowaard, a city in North Holland province, was delivered by Switzerland-headquartered Leclanche, which provided engineering, procurement and construction services, and Dutch energy storage specialist S4 Energy.
The new storage system features a combination of Leclanche’s lithium-ion battery tech coupled with S4 Energy’s Kinext flywheel storage system, to provide primary control power for frequency stabilization. It is designed to deliver 9 MW of power for frequency control with 1 MW dedicated to load displacement applications. pv magazine has asked Leclanche for the energy storage capacity of the project.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

It is the second utility scale project combining the two storage technologies on the Dutch grid. An initial S4 Energy-Leclanche project was deployed in Almelo, a city in the Overijssel province of the eastern Netherlands, to support frequency stabilization for Dutch transmission system operator Tennet.
The Almelo project combines 8.8 MW/7.12 MWh of lithium-ion batteries with six flywheels that add up to 3 MW of power. According to the project partners, the combination with fast-responsive flywheels reduces the energy throughput and number of cycles of the li-ion batteries and ensures an improved usage profile and longer system lifetime – to a minimum of 15 years.
The second grid scale hybrid storage system is joining the Dutch grid hot on the heels of the country’s largest battery to date. A 25 MW/48 MWh battery touted as the first large scale battery project based on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry in Europe, has been delivered by Finnish technology group Wartsila, it was announced this week.
The deployment of utility scale batteries in the Netherlands is particularly important given the serious network congestion warnings caused by the rapid growth of intermittent renewable energy capacity on the grid. Bottlenecks on the Dutch network have become so dire Tennet has considered offering large scale solar power generators incentives to reduce their output or power down entirely.
This year, grid connection issues in the Netherlands were laid bare by Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national and regional power network operators, in its updated congestion map for the high-voltage and medium-voltage grids, which showed areas experiencing increasing constraints for the deployment of large scale solar and wind plants.
“Grid capacity has already been greatly expanded by installing more transmission lines and transformer stations … however that is not fast enough as solar parks, for example, are being built faster than grid operators can build,” the association said. Deploying utility scale batteries is another way of addressing this issue.

U.S. energy company AES announced that it has acquired Pennsylvania-based solar developer Community Energy Solar, as well as Community Energy’s 10 GW project pipeline. The move is part of a greater plan for future company expansion efforts and the acquisition of Community Energy will bolster those efforts with a strong development pipeline and skilled development workforce.
Community Energy has developed more than 3 GW of solar and storage projects and opened the market for utility scale solar as the first to develop a 100 MW scale project in seven states. With the acquisition, AES’ U.S. renewables portfolio now includes 4.4 GW of operating assets and 5.7 GW of signed PPAs. In total, the merger brings AES' U.S. solar development pipeline to more than 40 GW.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
“AES is the ideal partner for us because of their conviction on climate, their industry-leading innovation and most importantly, their people,” said Brent Beerley, Community Energy CEO. “Having worked closely with the AES team over the past several years, we have found a deep alignment on values and culture which was essential to us. I am beyond grateful to our team, our board, and AES for this opportunity.”
In 2020, the University of Pennsylvania signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) for the creation of a 220 MW solar project, the largest in the state, set to be developed by Community Energy. The university is planning to purchase all the power produced at the two sites in Central Pennsylvania – equivalent to about 75% of the total electricity demand of the campus and the university’s health system – for 25 years at a rate competitive with conventional electricity prices.
In a separate development, Stem Inc, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven energy storage software and services company, announced that it has acquired Also Energy Holdings, a solar asset management software company. The deal will combine Stem’s storage optimization capabilities with AlsoEnergy’s solar asset performance monitoring and control software, which the companies hope will lead to a one-stop-shop solution for renewable energy projects.
In addition, Stem will offer its smart energy storage solutions to AlsoEnergy’s existing front-of-meter and commercial and industrial customers, who generally have limited storage attachment to their solar assets today, and AlsoEnergy will gain earlier visibility into solar-plus-storage projects through Stem’s extensive customer and partner network.
The two companies also believe the deal will provide significant opportunities to cross-sell and leverage each platform’s extensive customer base, with just 30% of AlsoEnergy’s customers also being customers of Stem. On top of this, the acquisition expands Stem’s global market presence, as AlsoEnergy currently provides performance, analytics, monitoring, and control solutions for roughly 32.5 GW of solar assets across 50 countries.
AlsoEnergy, as a company, is also no stranger to merger and acquisition activity. In 2018, AlsoEnergy announced its merger with Locus Energy, in a move that brought roughly 6.6 GW of project capacity to AlsoEnergy’s platform. This move marked AlsoEnergy’s first significant European expansion, as the company had largely operated in North America prior to the Locus Energy deal.
Through a third transaction, micro-inverter maker Enphase Energy Inc took over 365 Pronto Inc, an Arizona-based predictive software platform that matches cleantech asset owners to local and on-demand service providers.
The 365 Pronto software platform serves two sides of the market: the buyers, who are the asset owners; and the sellers, who are the service providers. For asset owners, the platform matches the attributes of their asset and scope-of-work requirements to a local, compliant, and qualified service provider.
For service providers, the platform matches the availability, location, and skillsets of their technicians with the requirements of a customer’s work order. The service providers include third-party installers that service residential and commercial solar, battery storage and EV charging stations. Hundreds of service providers have been qualified by the 365 Pronto platform.
The way 365 Pronto works begins with the buyer (an asset owner) placing a pre-priced work order. The platform then matches and dispatches a qualified service provider to complete the work order.
“We are pleased to welcome 365 Pronto’s customers, service providers, and employees to Enphase,” said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO at Enphase. “The company’s software platform will provide our installers the ability to service their own O&M contracts with an on-demand network of service providers. We are excited about this opportunity to improve the installer experience as we continue to expand our digital platform.”
This acquisition follows Enphase’s November acquisition of California-based ClipperCreek, which offers electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions for residential and commercial customers in the U.S.

India added 1.3 GW of rooftop solar capacity in the nine months to the end of September, a record volume for a nine-month window and a 202% rise on the same period of last year, according to Mercom India Research’s latest report on that segment of the market.
The July-to-September quarter, however, saw a 14% fall in new rooftop arrays, to 448 MW, compared with the preceding quarter's 521 MW.
Residential rooftop systems dominated last quarter, as they had done in the April-to-June window, with commercial and industrial arrays contributing 44% of the Q3 numbers and government systems 2%.
“The rooftop market is showing signs of recovery … back to pre-Covid levels,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Texan analyst Mercom Capital Group. “However, the rise in component costs and availability of materials is weighing heavily on the market, throttling growth. States have continued to put up restrictions on rooftop solar, making new development challenging.”
The Mercom report found India reached a cumulative 6.7 GW of rooftop solar capacity by the end of September. The state of Gujarat accounts for 26% share of that figure, followed by Maharashtra (with 14%) and Rajasthan (10%).
It was Uttarakhand, though, which registered the highest compounded quarterly installation growth, according to the Mercom report, with a rate of 35%, followed by Maharashtra (31%) and Haryana (29%).
With solar equipment costs having been rising steadily since the second wave of Covid-19 broke in India, the report noted prices had risen 3.8% in the first three months of the year, 3% in April-to-June, and 2.3% in the last three-month period. Rooftop system costs have risen 9% in the last 12 months.

This week, Victorian universities in partnership with company OJAS announced their plans to build a facility in Victoria to convert used PV modules to ‘value-added’ materials had progressed. Likewise, Reclaim PV announced new partnerships and drop-off locations as it prepares to grow substantially in 2022.
The University of Melbourne and RMIT University have partnered with the Melbourne-based company OJAS to develop an ‘upcycling’ facility that will reclaim valuable materials from PV modules including clean glass, silicon cells and polymers.
The project originally commenced last year, in 2020, after OJAS was awarded a $3 million federal government project grant. CEO Neeraj Das said a site lease in Victoria has been secured in June for the facility, and the European separation technology it plans to use to cost-effectively recover glass, silicon cells and polymer from PV panel waste will soon be tested and commissioned.
The upcycling plant, which the team says is the ‘first of its kind’, is expected to be up and running by the end of 2023. It will collect modules via a nationwide network and supply the recovered materials to downstream businesses for value-added products. The ambition is to roll out the solution across Australia.
Currently the project’s collaborators at the University of Melbourne and RMIT are looking to find “optimal applications” of these recovered PV components. According to their statement, research to date has found the fine particles of ground PV glass can be effectively used as a partial replacement for sand in concrete.
Massoud Sofi, the project’s research lead from the University of Melbourne, says this application can conserve raw materials used for concrete production and reduce its carbon footprint – which is astoundingly high, responsible for 8% of emissions globally. The research team are apparently now looking at developing specific applications of PV glass-based concrete materials too.
At RMIT, a team led by Ylias Sabri, is investigating whether the refined materials could be reused in solar panel production. They are also looking at the processing of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), a material with good radiation transmission and low degradability to sunlight.
South Australian company Reclaim PV Recycling is also gearing up to expand its operations which began this year with the launch of its first recycling facility in Adelaide. It recently welcomed three new network partners, RAA, Enerven and Tindo, two new drop-off locations, and two new recycling hubs in Townsville and Bundaberg in preparation.
It expects to collect more than 90,000 panels or the equivalent of 3,000 tonnes of PV modules in 2022. “These partnerships are an important step forward in the establishment of Australia’s first national solar panel recovery and recycling network, and importantly, offer Australians an easy way to arrange the responsible recycling of their end-of-life solar panels,” Director of Reclaim PV Recycling, Clive Fleming, said.
Notably, Reclaim’s partnership with Tindo, Australia’s only solar panel manufacturer, creates a full recycling loop for Australian-made solar panels.
Reclaim uses a recycling process known as pyrolysis – a thermal deconstruction technique that breaks down and pulls apart PV panels into their component parts by passing them through a high-temperature furnace. Upon completion of the thermal extraction process, the recovered components are sorted and placed into collection bins for delivery to materials companies, ensuring all recoverable materials are available for re-use.
Reclaim’s recycling facility followed Lotus Energy’s Victorian plant, Australia’s first, which began operating in May.
According to the International Renewable Agency, the value of materials from solar module recycling and upcycling will be worth around US$15 billion (AU$21 billion) by the year 2050.

California-headquartered Bloom Energy has announced that NTPC Limited, India’s largest state-owned energy provider, has selected its electrolyzer and hydrogen-powered fuel cell technologies for the nation’s first green hydrogen-based energy storage project.
Through this pilot project, NTPC will explore the potential of large-scale, off-grid hydrogen energy storage and microgrid projects at strategic locations throughout the country.
Bloom Energy will provide its solid-oxide, high-temperature electrolyzer to generate green hydrogen from renewable electricity produced by a nearby floating solar farm. The hydrogen will then be converted into carbon-neutral electricity without combustion through Bloom Energy’s hydrogen fuel cells to power NTPC’s Guest House, a nearby facility used by NTPC employees and guests.
The project is expected to start in 2022 in Simhadri, Visakhapatnam, India.
The initial collaboration between NTPC and Bloom Energy India is expected to lay the ground for future cooperation.

“Reducing carbon emissions is the number one priority in the fight against climate change, and green hydrogen will be critical to India’s decarbonization objectives,” said Venkat Venkataraman, executive vice president and chief technology officer, Bloom Energy.
“Bloom’s technology is well-positioned to help India transition to a net-zero, hydrogen-powered economy, and we are excited to collaborate with NTPC to bring the country’s first green hydrogen microgrid to life. The powerful combination of Bloom’s high-efficiency electrolyzers and fuel cells enables the highest possible round trip efficiency with green hydrogen for energy storage.”
Bloom Energy’s high-temperature electrolyzer is claimed to produce hydrogen more efficiently than low-temperature PEM and alkaline electrolyzers. As it operates at high temperatures, the Bloom Electrolyzer requires less energy to break up water molecules and produce hydrogen. Electricity accounts for nearly 80% of the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis. By using less electricity, hydrogen production becomes more economical and will accelerate adoption.
Bloom Energy Servers – solid oxide fuel cells that combine ambient air with a fuel source, such as natural gas, biogas, hydrogen, or a blend of fuels – produce electricity through a non-combustion electrochemical reaction, resulting in reduced carbon emissions, harmful air pollutants, and water use compared to grid alternatives. When hydrogen is used as a fuel source, Bloom Energy Servers emit zero carbon.
Bloom Energy is engaged with industry leaders to accelerate the global hydrogen economy, including projects related to producing low-cost, green hydrogen and utilizing nuclear energy to create clean hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/22/iron-flow-battery-pv-microgrid-for-fire-prone-california/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 22, 2021",Iron flow battery PV microgrid for fire-prone California,"From pv magazine USA
Utility-scale and commercial long-duration flow battery manufacturer ESS Inc. announced its iron flow batteries are being deployed by San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) in a microgrid project aimed at bolstering energy resilience and providing critical backup power to a fire-prone town in southern California.
The microgrid is planned to integrate an on-site solar array and is designed to provide backup power to several critical community facilities, including a health center, fire station, and key telecommunications equipment. When the microgrid is not in use, excess energy stored in the flow batteries will be exported to the California wholesale energy market. The project is pegged for activation in the first quarter of 2022.
A flow battery design is comprised of an electrochemical cell where a membrane separates two chemical solutions. Chemical energy and electricity are produced by exchanging ions across the membrane.
ESS said its iron-flow batteries have a chemistry that lasts 20 years or more with no capacity fade or degradation. This differs from conventional battery chemistries, which generally achieve a 7-to-10-year lifecycle before the need for augmentation. The batteries use earth-abundant iron, salt and water for electrolyte, foregoing the use of rare minerals like vanadium and lithium, which have some environmental concerns in their extraction processes.
ESS flow batteries present no fire, chemical or explosive risk, which means they can be deployed without suppression equipment, secondary containment, or hazmat restrictions. The company said its batteries, which range from 6-12 hours durations, can offer among the lowest levelized cost of storage (LCOS) available for battery energy storage.
Microgrid-based energy resilience projects are on the rise in tandem with the rise of extreme weather events and climate-driven catastrophes like the wildfires of California. The U.S. Department of Energy reports 575 active microgrids with a combined capacity of 4.25 GW.
Long-duration energy storage has also come under focus as more renewable energy is interconnected with the grid. The Long-Duration Energy Storage (LDES) council was launched at the international COP26 climate summit this November. The council said it plans to guide governments and grid operators on how LDES technologies will support decarbonization of the grid as the lowest-cost option to society.
Between 85 and 140 terawatt-hours of LDES deployment will be required to achieve a net-zero grid by 2040, according to the council’s projections. The council also estimates a need of 1 TWh of LDES deployment by 2025 to pace for decarbonization by 2040, as well.
The LDES Council comprises 24 tech companies, users, and investors. ESS CEO Eric Dressselhuys entered the council as a founding member.
These deployment projections would entail a $1.5 to $3 trillion investment. The council said renewable energy stored in these technologies could eliminate 1.5 to 2.3 Gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, or about 10-15% of global power emissions.
