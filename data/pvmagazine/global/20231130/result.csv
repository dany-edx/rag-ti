The developer submitted a development application to the Mauritanian Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mines this week.
The Megaton Moon will be built in several stages, with the first pilot phase being expected to be finalized in 2028 and the last phase in the 2033-35 period.
In addition, more than 70 million tons of desalinated water will be generated per year, which would triple what is consumed at the Megaton facility itself for the production of green fuel.
The project will also use more than 10 TWh of surplus energy to facilitate the development of a large-scale local agricultural industry in the desert, as well as a local supply chain, said GreenGo.
“Developing a project of this magnitude requires close collaboration with the supply chain and purchasing partners,” said GreenGo CEO Anders Heine Jensen. “The size of the project will attract local production of photovoltaic panels, wind turbine blades and electrolysis components, for which we are negotiating memorandums of agreement with the manufacturers.”
The project will be financed through a GreenGo Energy partnership, with unspecified top-tier investors in the field of green energy.
“Our unique business model is based on partnerships around the development, construction and financing of large project portfolios, which fit the needs and investment profiles of our clients,” said Jensen.
Session 9 | Dec 6, 11:45 am CET, Berlin | Hydrogen: Potential meets reality – where are the opportunities for solar industry
The hydrogen economy is coming, and it will be big. But when will the market develop, and what prospects will it open for the solar industry to increase revenues and find off-takers? We’ll dissect where hydrogen production works and why, where it falters, and where it’s commercially sound. We’ll dive into the heart of hydrogen production—the electrolyzers, and have a look at the different technologies, their expected cost degression, and whether colocation with solar plants is a reasonable opportunity. Finally, we explore PtX technologies, assess their development speed, and discover which electrolysis tech is gaining ground.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/30/greece-accepts-288-mw-of-applications-in-second-storage-tender/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"NOVEMBER 30, 2023",Greece accepts 288 MW of applications in second storage tender,"Greece is gearing up for its second competitive auction for standalone, front-of-the-meter energy storage facilities connected to the electricity transmission network. The auction is part of Greece’s 1 GW energy storage program.
The country announced its 1 GW energy storage program in the summer with three separate tenders featuring 400 MW, 300 MW and 300 MW of capacity. The first tender awarded 12 energy storage projects in August, with 411,79 ΜW of capacity in total. The second auction aims to award another 288,21 MW of storage capacity.
Investors who are interested in participating in the tender need to submit their applications by Dec. 22. The regulator will publish an initial list of qualified applicants on Feb. 8, allowing a few extra days for appeals over the list. The plan is to run the tender immediately after the appeal process has ended.
Greece's energy storage program awards two subsidies to winning projects: a reduced one-time payment of €100,000 ($109,000) per megawatt upon construction, serving as a capital expenditure subsidy, compared to the initial €200,000 per megawatt in the first tender.
Winning projects in Greece's energy storage program receive contracts for difference (CfDs) providing a guaranteed income for 10 years, with capped prices set at €115,000/MW per year in both the first and second auctions. Projects must be operational by the end of 2025, and investors are mandated to submit progress reports every three months to ensure timely construction.
The winning projects are expected to participate in the country’s energy markets, prioritizing the alleviation of network congestion to facilitate greater penetration of green energy. However, awarded energy storage projects are restricted from entering power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private investors and cannot terminate their CfDs before the end of the 10-year period.
Fierce competition
Greece’s 1 GW energy storage program is designed to be reliable and competitive.
To qualify for tenders, applicants must furnish three financial guarantees: a participation letter (€35,000/MW), a timely business performance letter (€150,000/MW), and a quality operation letter (€150,000/MW). Additionally, an application fee of €2,500 per submission to the regulator is required.
A 100% tender subscription rule fosters competition, requiring at least 576 MW of energy storage capacity to vie for selection to secure 288 MW. Investors are capped at a maximum of 100 MW in both the first and second tenders, necessitating an annual confirmation to the regulator for the entire 10-year CfD support period, verifying ownership below the specified limit.
The first tender in August resulted in an average price of €49.748/MW per year, while the lowest successful bid was €33.948/MW per year. The highest successful bid was €64.122/MW per year.
Helleniq Energy secured three projects (100 MW), Intra Energy secured another three projects (100 MW), PPC Renewables won two projects (98 MW), Energy Bank secured a 50 MW project, and Mytilineos Group's Aenaos won a 48 MW battery contract. In addition, Energiaki Tehniki secured a 7.8 MW project, and an 8 MW energy community project was also awarded.

EnerVenue, a US-based manufacturer of metal-hydrogen batteries capable of cycling up to three times per day, at two to 12-hour discharge rates, is launching of the EnerVenue Energy Rack. Each rack consists of integrated Energy Storage Vessels (ESVs) in 150 kWh and 102 kWh configurations.
“Our customers get complete flexibility to install and connect as many fully assembled Energy Racks as their energy storage use cases require—simple as that,” said Randall Selesky, CRO, EnerVenue.
The company reports that the solution includes EnerVenue’s next-generation ESV battery technology, custom battery management system (BMS) hardware, and the wiring and connections required for integration into customized containers or buildings.
The next-generation ESV battery, announced in September, is designed for large-scale renewables and storage applications. It reportedly has a 30-year, 30,000-cycle lifespan, with the manufacturer offering a 20-year/20,000-cycle warranty that guarantees at least 88% battery capacity remaining after that period.
EnerVenue claims its nickel-hydrogen battery technology can operate at temperatures between -40 C and 60 C, and that it can provide the promised cycles without degradation and at varying rates. The battery has an efficiency ranging from 80% to 90%, depending on the cycle rate, and its energy density per square foot is equal to, or better than lithium-ion batteries, according to the company.
The Energy Rack solution is designed for use in both 1000 VDC and 1500 VDC systems in either indoor structures or outdoor-rated enclosures. The Racks can serve as interlocking modules that can be connected inline or stacked up to three levels high.
EnerVenue notes that its nickel-hydrogen ESV technology does not have the thermal runaway risk of lithium-ion batteries. Another benefit is that the storage solutions are serviceable at a component level, which can lower maintenance costs, the company reports.
In March EnerVenue announced that it will open a one million square foot gigafactory on a 29-hectare site in Shelby County, Kentucky, where it will design, manufacture and test its nickel-hydrogen ESVs. The first phase of the project will provide 450 full-time jobs and is aiming for 1 GWh of annual production. EnerVenue says it expects to invest over $1 billion to expand to more than 20 GWh per year across its domestic manufacturing sites in subsequent phases. The company currently has manufacturing facilities in Fremont, Calif.
EnerVenue Energy Racks are now available to order and will begin shipping in 2024.
Session 8 | Dec 6, 10:30 am CET, virtual | All about storage: Price, materials, tech, and new revenue
As the energy storage sector continues to grow and mature, understanding costs and revenue opportunities is the highest priority for many stakeholders. As lithium-based batteries continue to dominate the sector, the outlook on costs, materials, and technology remains the key question. In addition, we will also explore the most attractive markets and revenue opportunities for BESS in Europe, beyond the wins in transferring energy from generation to times of demand.

He told pv magazine that a lack of manpower and too many permits are causing the delays.
“There are a lot of documents that you need to secure and each document takes time and it takes people,” he said. “There is a lack of people that are that are knowledgeable in these kinds of projects.”
Meštrović said that one undisclosed project his company is developing submitted its first round of government regulatory approvals in 2019, and four years later, ENCRO has now started construction. “Four years is considered good in Croatia,” he said, adding the usual wait time for wind-based projects is a decade. “The European Commission says everything needs to be up and running sooner.”
The European Commission’s EU Renewable Energy Directive states renewable energy project permits must be allocated within two years.
This is not the first time Croatia has been out of step with European Commission regulation. In February, the European Commission referred Croatia, as well as Hungary and Portugal, to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for not turning the EU Renewable Energy Directive into national law. The European Commission said it was requesting the countries be penalized with financial sanctions as they were “failing to enact EU rules promoting more renewable energy in Europe.” In April the Commission deferred Croatia's case to be settled at a later late.
pv magazine asked the Croatian government's Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development, the department responsible for awarding renewable energy permits in Croatia, about the average wait time for utility-scale solar projects to reach finalization and how many of these projects are tied up in red tape. We did not get a response.
Croatia recorded 182 MW of solar installed capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Elizabet Škrobo is the media and communications manager at Renewable Energy Sources of Croatia – the southern European country’s leading renewable energy association – and said these numbers reflect Croatia’s “solar revolution”.
According to the lobby group’s internal data, Croatia is on track to reaching 418 MW of installed capacity by the end of the month, with 2 GW of solar projects in the pipeline, she said.
The Mediterranean country receives a lot of sunny days, with solar data firm Solargis showing the country, specifically the coast, receives high levels of irradiance. But Škrobo is concerned that the sector’s growth is being impacted by “obstacles” such as securing construction permits and grid bottlenecks, she said.
“The waiting time for solar is amongst the worst in Europe when it comes to waiting period for the utility-scale to be connected to the grid,” she said. “The grid is almost at full capacity too. Expansion of the grid is behind. It's lagging.”
Renewable Energy Sources of Croatia is compiling a list of all of Croatia’s grid bottlenecks – called RES Simplified, Škrobo said – and will present the data to the Croatian government by the end of the year. The aim of the document is for the government to be able to see problematic areas and improve connection through infrastructure.
Croatia's promising solar market is due to the climate, wide public appetite for installing rooftop solar and the 25% value-added tax for solar products being slashed last year, she said. The Croatian government adopting a legal framework for the installation of agrisolar this year was another boon for the industry, Škrobo added, with these legislative changes making an impact on the sector.
“Croatia produced as much electricity from the solar panels just in two months in July and August as we did with as all solar panels in the past year produced,“ she said. “But we can do better.”

Once the deal closes, which is expected for mid-2024, BP will control all of Lightsource BP. The company paid £254 million ($321 million) for the stake, according to the announcement.
BP said it will scale up Lightsource BP’s PV operations with the acquisition and will “target double digit equity returns.”
“BP intends to use Lightsource BP’s world-class capabilities as a developer of cost-competitive utility-scale onshore renewable power to help meet its own demand for low carbon power,” the company said.
“This integration is expected to underpin and de-risk delivery of BP’s targets for its transition growth engines – in hydrogen, EV charging and biofuels as well as in power trading.”
BP executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath said the purchase will allow for BP to meet the increasing demand for low-carbon power from “transition growth engines.”
BP first invested $200 million in Lightsource – subsequently named Lightsource BP – in 2017 for a 43% stake in the company. In 2022 BP bumped up its share to 50%.
Lightsource BP completed its first utility-scale solar installation in 2016. Since then, the company has launched more than 16 renewable energy projects in the United States alone, with Lightsource BP announcing last year it wanted to pursue a project in New Zealand.

The initiative, called the Solar for Schools Programme, aims to get Ireland in-line with meeting its climate targets and help schools reduce their energy bills, said the Department for Education, the ministry responsible for spearheading the initiative.
The Irish government said the school’s panels will be connected to the grid and can share energy with neighbors during periods of closure, such as school holidays.
Schools are expected to save an estimated €1,200 to €1,600 ($1,311 to $1,748) per annum through the scheme, with the project’s first phase to be completed by the end of May.
The Irish government said it wants to use the program to “encourage more companies to enter the installer market.” There are roughly 550 non-domestic and domestic solar installers registered with the national energy agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.
The Irish government said a budget for Schools for Solar has not been released as it is commercially sensitive. The first batch of schools – from 11 areas – will be invited to apply from today and the remaining 2,400 will be invited over the next year in scheduled phases, the Department of Education said.
“The phasing of the programme will ensure a managed and steady flow of work for solar PV contractors,” the announcement reads. The Irish government schools must seek three installation quotes and the government will pay for one.
Meanwhile, earlier this month the Irish government published its “Energy Security in Ireland to 2030” report. The document said the country was on track to securing 8 GW of solar installed capacity by the end of the decade. It came after Conall Bolger, CEO of the Irish Solar Energy Association (ISEA), recently criticized the government's Renewable Electricity Support Scheme to pv magazine for having “high rate” of project attrition.
The International Renewable Energy Agency said that Ireland recorded 135 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of last year, according to its most up-to-date estimates.
But according to another report by ISEA, around 680 MW of solar power has been deployed across 59,888 generators in Ireland as of July 2023. Most of this capacity originates from seven large-scale plants surpassing 5 MW totaling 349 MW, the group said.

They said this is the first long-term deployment of submerged solar cells in a realistic oceanic environment.
“Our work presents the first longitudinal study of photovoltaic cell performance in the marine environment that spans location, time, and depth,” researcher Collin A. Krawczyk told pv magazine. “We highlight novel methods of data collection in the marine environment, using animal hosts as vehicles for water column profile measurements. Based on our power results and energy predictions, solar power could feasibly provide all, or a significant portion, of the daily energy required by many marine wildlife telemetry modules.”
The academics said the electricity requirements of microelectronics applied in marine data loggers and other devices have fallen sharply in recent years, which makes PV a feasible power supply option.
To test their approach, the team attached special monocrystalline mini solar modules to four adult female northern elephant seals. The mammals make an ideal sensor platform for subsurface water profiling, as they average 2.9 dives per hour to depths of more than 400 meters and have migration patterns ranging from southern California to the North Pacific Ocean.
The scientists connected the mini PV panel to a device that measured and recorded the current-voltage relationship, in addition to a SPLASH10 tag that recorded the seal's location, orientation, temperature, and depth. Unique names were given to each device: Kilo, November, Oscar, and Lima.
“The deployment of these devices began in late February of 2018, and both November and Oscar returned to the initial deployment location in early May of 2018. Kilo performed a much longer deployment, returning in early June of 2018,” the researchers said. “During this extended deployment, Kilo filled its on-board memory. Lima's results were corrupted by a device malfunction during deployment.”
After recovering the modules, the academics had to perform extensive post-processing on them. They had to calibrate a time lag between the tags and the current–voltage devices and perform a curve fitting process for the latter. They also had to use a method that estimates the short-circuit current of a flat panel based on their tilted observed results. That is the module that was mounted to the head of a diving animal, and their panel-tilt angles were typically non-zero.
They found that maximum power averages as a function of depth are presented at up to 22 meters deep.
“Past 22 meters, our data became reliant on our low irradiance curve estimations, and the data here had very little medium/high irradiance curves,” they said. “At 5 meters depth, results show a 70% to 85% reduction in surface relative power, depending on the tag. While Kilo saw a higher reduction in power than November and Oscar, the reduction in power for November and Oscar at 15 and 20 meters was of roughly 84% and 90% reduction, respectively. At 15 meters, we found that there was an 85% to 95% reduction in available power, which increases to a 90% to 98% reduction at 20 meters.”
The researchers described their experiment in “Trans-oceanic subsurface photovoltaic performance,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. They come from Northern Arizona University and the University of California, Santa Cruz.

The installation will be one of the first projects of this size to be connected to the South African state-owned power utility's transmission network.
Soventix said in a statement that construction of the first 342 MW phase of the project will begin from the first quarter of 2024.
“The scope and planning of this project will pave the way for other developers and IPPs to connect projects of this size to the network in the future,” said Soventix.
The project was developed under the South African Renewable Energy IPP Procurement (REIPPP) program of the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy.
For operational reasons, the company split construction into three stages. In July 2022, the rights to the first phase of the project were sold to South African operator Solar Africa, which is expected to either resell the completed project or generate green electricity certificates.
Soventix is developing phases two and three of the project, ultimately bringing it to 1 GW. The company has also developed agrivoltaic tests during different phases to collect data.
The De Aar power plant is based on single-axis solar tracker technology. Soventix said it plans to evaluate opportunities to couple the project with sheep farming, the most widespread agricultural activity in the region.

French renewable energy producer Unite, fresh from announcing a 10 MW solar aviary project in October in Brinon-sur-Sauldre, France, is now gearing up to build 10 additional PV aviaries with a cumulative capacity of 127 MW of solar.
The company said it plans to complete four of them in spring 2024 and the remaining six in January 2025. The projects were secured in the most recent tender by French regulator CRE for commercial and industrial PV.
“We co-construct each project with our partner breeders, in order to adapt them to the specific constraints of the site and their breeding,” said Xavier Permingeat, director of PV at Unite. “This concept of collaboration is essential for us, as is gaining the support of all the stakeholders in the project.”
Unite will construct PV aviaries for poultry farms to generate renewable electricity, provide shaded areas, and enhance flight space for animals. The solar plants will incorporate structures and nets to prevent the intrusion of migratory birds, reducing the risk of disease transmission to livestock.
Established in 1985, Unite has more than 60 operational power generation sites, with 120 under development, amounting to 1.6 GW of capacity. Initially focused on small hydroelectric power plants, the company has since diversified its portfolio over the years.
“This activity gives us a valuable territorial anchor because we have been present for decades in the regions and local residents know us,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine in October. “However, given the increasingly significant constraints imposed on projects on French rivers, we have decided to continue our activity in small hydroelectricity, but at a less sustained pace. We will build one power plant per year, so as not to lose our know-how, and at the same time, we are making a real change of scale in solar.”

“The calculated practical efficiency potential of 39.5% for a perovskite silicon tandem device under standard measurement conditions (STC) can serve as an input for future research and development studies which are required for a better understanding of the full system prior to the commercialization of the promising tandem solar cell technology,” the research's corresponding author, Oussama Er-raji, told pv magazine.
“In this work, we extensively characterized a fully-textured perovskite silicon tandem solar cell to determine its performance losses,” said co-author Christoph Messmer. “By implementing the extracted device characteristics in a Sentaurus TCAD simulation model, we obtained a reproduction of the experimental device’s optical and electrical characteristics. Subsequently, by alleviating one step at a time the loss constraints, the simulation model identified the impact of each loss channel on the efficiency.”
Sentaurus CAD is a multidimensional simulator capable of simulating the electrical, thermal, and optical characteristics of silicon-based devices. It is also used to simulate the optoelectronic characteristics of semiconductor devices such as image sensors and PV cells.
In the study “Loss Analysis of Fully-Textured Perovskite Silicon Tandem Solar Cells: Characterization Methods and Simulation toward the Practical Efficiency Potential,” published in RRL Solar, the research team said it investigated voltage, current, and fill factor deficiencies in a fully-textured perovskite silicon tandem solar cell based on a 20 nm thick indium tin oxide (ITO) recombination layer placed between the top and bottom cells.
The subcell relied on a 630 nm thick perovskite absorber with an energy bandgap of 1.67 eV, a carbazole (2PACz) layer, a 20 nm thin tin oxide (SnOx) buffer layer, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on a buckminsterfullerene (C60), an ITO window layer, a silver (Ag) metal contact, and an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2). “The fully-textured perovskite silicon tandem solar cell delivers a stabilized 26.7% PCE when operated at a fixed voltage close to the maximum power point,” the researchers said.
The scientists conducted their comprehensive loss analysis on the tandem device considering high series resistance, current mismatch in the subcells, high nonradiative recombination losses, and band misalignment at the interface between the perovskite absorber and the ETL.
They identified the most significant loss mechanisms at the perovskite/C60 interface (−4.6%), in the series resistance (−2.9%), and in light management (−2.1%). “By reducing the origins of these losses one step at a time, we calculated the efficiency improvements by cumulatively mitigating the characterized loss channels, ultimately reaching a practical efficiency potential of 39.5% for this device architecture,” they explained.
The researchers also noted that the 39.5% efficiency threshold may be exceeded only by changing cell architecture, eventually by replacing C60 with a more transparent ETL and finding more transparent alternatives to the ITO layers. “Despite the fact that this analysis shows a quite idealized scenario when solving the device limitations, it is still useful to assess the ‘ideal' efficiency boost for each limitation,” they stressed.

“Gross surface area means the surface area occupied by the panels includes the relevant physical areas that cannot be used for other purposes except that of operating the plant,” said a GSE spokesperson.
The definition and estimate of the Used Agricultural Area comes from The Italian National Institute of Statistics.
“It complies with what was published on their institutional website in the latest agricultural census of the year 2021,” the spokesperson said.
The definition is contained in the census glossary.
“Used Agricultural Surface (UAA) is a surface used for agricultural purposes by the company which includes arable land, woody agricultural crops, permanent meadows and pastures and family vegetable gardens, regardless of ownership of the lands,” said the document. “It includes both outdoor and protected surfaces.”

Utility-scale renewables in Australia are in dire straits, with a new Clean Energy Council report saying that 2023 is shaping up as “the worst [year] for large-scale renewable energy investment” since it began tracking data in 2017.
It seems that Australia’s large-scale segment is falling into a similar pattern to hydrogen of yesteryear – awash with grand announcements, but with very little getting off the ground. The Clean Energy Council said that just six large-scale projects, totalling 509 MW, have been financially committed so far this year. Between 5 GW and 7 GW would need to be financially committed every year to reach Australia’s target of 82% renewable penetration by 2030, it added.
Large-scale renewables in Australia have faced compounding issues in the years since 2020, when the nation’s Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme was achieved. The problems culminating this year include difficulties securing equipment due to high global demand, soaring insurance premiums and associated project costs, project planning and grid congestion, dropping margins as a result of ever-lowering midday wholesale energy prices, and staffing difficulties. Against this backdrop, project owners are struggling to secure offtake agreements that can properly reflect their costs.
While the third quarter has been particularly dismal, CEC said that all three quarters of 2023 so far rank in the bottom five for lowest new capacity commitments since 2017.
All of this exemplifies how badly needed the federal government’s Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) is. While the scheme has been floating around for the last year, it initially looked to back just 6 GW of “dispatchable” renewable energy, largely storage. Last week, the scheme was massively broadened to encompass 9 GW of storage capacity and 23 GW of variable renewable generation, for a total of 32 GW nationally.
While the need for storage is acutely being felt in Australia as solar duck curves become so pronounced that balancing the grid is a precarious juggle, the stark downturn in investment of renewable energy generation projects are clearly also a problem for the nation’s transition. This probably factored into the federal governments decision to not just use the scheme to support storage, but also large-scale generation projects.

The scientists explained that previous studies focused on the validation of a specific step of a given model chain, and said their work, by contrast, considered the whole model chain and the impact of the combination of different models on the accuracy of the final results.
“This study aims to contribute to filling up the literature gap in solar irradiance modeling considering high-latitude locations and irradiation on eastwards and westwards vertically oriented PV surfaces,” they explained. “By reviewing the state-of-the-art decomposition and transposition models, 29 decomposition and 25 transposition models are chosen for detailed evaluation through model chains.”
The group tested its approach on an east-west oriented vertical bifacial PV system located in Turku, Finland. It implemented the modeling in six steps consisting of data acquisition, review of existing solar decomposition and transposition models, implementation of the models’ library, initialization of the model chains, experimental validation, and inter-model chain comparison.
The academics considered 725 possible combinations of the decomposition and transposition models for both sides of the PV installation.
The performance of these models was then compared to that of benchmark models used to estimate the solar irradiance on inclined surfaces. They also created a dataset with the data required to initialize the model chains considering solar zenith and azimuth angles, air mass, and angle of light incidence, as well as to validate their results.
Through its analysis, the research team came to the conclusion that identifying a single model chain that can perform the best, regardless of the system orientation, is a difficult task at high latitudes. “Model chains optimally operating for the East side of the panel achieve a different level of accuracy when modeling solar irradiance impinging on the West side,” it added.
The researchers recommended using two different model chains for the front and rear sides of the vertical PV system.
“Models from the families of Yang and Perez should be preferred for the solar decomposition stage when assessing the West side of the system,” they said referring to models adopted in previous literature. “Erbs models and Perez family of models should be preferred for the solar decomposition stage when assessing the East side of the system.”
They also added that the so-called Hay and Steven transposition models should be preferred for the west and east sides of the system, respectively.
They introduced the new methodology in the study “Validation of model chains for global tilted irradiance on east-west vertical bifacial photovoltaics at high latitudes,” published in Renewable Energy. The research group includes scientists from the University of Turku and the Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) in Finland.
“To enhance the accuracy of the results from solar analysis, there is a need for a metamodel-based approach that can apply different model chains according to a parameter, such as the angle of incidence or the geometry of the investigated surface,” they concluded.
Other scientists from the University of Turku in Finland have recently created a new method to calculate performance loss rate (PLR) in vertical bifacial PV systems. This metric is commonly used by project developers to assess the expected power output of a PV system over its installed life.
The same research group unveiled in July a methodological workflow to boost electricity yield in bifacial vertical PV systems that are connected to low-voltage (LV) grids located at high latitudes and have different panel locations, orientations, and technologies.

Six advocacy groups have challenged California's process to evaluate pathways to 100% clean electricity by 2045 for failing to maximize cost-effective front-of-the-meter distributed generation.
The groups propose an approach they call the “Max DG Pathway,” which would maximize cost-effective solar on the built environment, including warehouses, shopping malls, schools, parking lots, irrigation canals and highway rights-of-way. They have said that several studies have evaluated the technical potential to deploy solar on such sites.
The groups backing the proposal include The Climate Center, Center for Biological Diversity, Local Government Sustainable Energy Coalition, and Vote Solar. They submitted comments to three state agencies that are evaluating pathways to achieve the state’s clean electricity goal.
On sites in the built environment with suitable solar exposure, a “small-to-medium-size” utility-scale solar array could be deployed, probably with co-located storage, the groups say. Each solar array on the built environment would have its own front-of-the-meter (FTM) utility interconnection, even if it is physically located on the premises of an end-use customer.
The sizes of these arrays “would generally be appropriate for distribution-system interconnections,” the groups said. The solar developer could earn revenues through a power-purchase agreement with a load-serving entity, or through some other business model.
Maximizing cost-effective FTM solar and storage, the groups said, could supply a substantial amount of renewable electricity without triggering land-use concerns or other sources of public opposition, while reducing the costs of transmission upgrades and providing valuable local benefits.
Those local benefits include resilience benefits from incorporating FTM solar plus storage as grid-forming resources in community microgrids, the groups said. The resources could be developed under local, municipal or tribal ownership models “that help build community wealth and advance energy justice.”
