“This clearly shows that we have learned to value them as we go. We have also learned to value the off-grid utilization architecture in parallel,” said Ajay Mathur, Director General of the International Solar Alliance, while speaking at the South Asia Forum for Distributed Energy (SAFDE), organized by GOGLA, with support from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India and Good Energies Foundation. 
Gogla’s global off-grid solar market report is based on sales data from off-grid solar and energy-efficient appliance manufacturers affiliated to GOGLA. It states that of 5.2 million units sold in H2 2022, 3.2 million were sold as cash products and 2 million via pay-as-you-go (PAYGo). Product-wise sales included 3.11 million portable lanterns, 1.08 million solar home systems, and 1.01 million multi-light systems.
Sales of solar home systems, comprising all products of 11 Wp and higher wattage, hit 1.08 million units in the second half of 2022, 69% more than in the previous six-month period. 90% of all solar home systems sold between July and December 2022 were on a PAYGo basis.
As per the report, sales of solar energy kits in India have been declining as the product mix is evolving away from traditional off-grid products like lanterns and plug-and-play kits towards weak-grid products. Nonetheless, lanterns and other off-grid solar solutions remain relevant for the Indian market for outdoor usage, as a backup to the grid, or as a primary source ahead of the grid. 
Sales of off-grid solar energy kits in India in the second half of 2022 stood at 432,200 units. Solar home systems accounted for less than 1% of total sales.

It will install 35 MW of capacity in cooperation with the ABCD-Horizon consortium, which includes Swiss energy company Aventron, BG Consulting Engineers, and Cargo Sous Terrain.
Dhp Technology said its systems will use proprietary technology to retract and extend solar panels based on weather conditions, so they can be retracted based on hail storm forecasts.
“Thanks to the lightweight construction and the patented folding mechanism, wide distances between supports and great heights of up to 6 meters above the ground are possible,” the company said. “This keeps the traffic routes free for large vehicles and goods.”
The structure houses lightweight, glass-free solar panels with folding capabilities, interconnected by cables and built with stainless steel and special plastic, with a rust-resistant coating. The company said the modules maintain performance consistency and experience no mechanical stress during extension and retraction, matching conventional panel performance.
The 45 arrays will primarily supply electricity to EV charging stations, while excess power will be sold to Averton and three other Swiss energy suppliers: Primeo Energie, Stadtwerke Winterthur, and Energie Wasser Bern. Construction will start in early 2024, with all projects to be finalized by 2027, according to the consortium.

They explained that building P2G facilities may reduce PV curtailment, while improving grid stability and increasing PV acceptance rates. They also noted that the proposed algorithm adopts the point of view of policymakers, as it looks more into maximizing the penetration of PV systems into the grid, and less into actual costs.
“We are currently considering expanding the model to account for financial aspects such as initial investment costs, operational and maintenance costs, and anticipated return on investment,” the research's lead author, Yeong Geon Son, told pv magazine. “Through such expansions, we anticipate being able to more accurately assess the overall financial value and efficiency of PV-P2G projects.
In the study “Systematic planning of power-to-gas for improving photovoltaic acceptance rate: Application of the potential RES penetration index,” which was published in Applied Energy, the Korean group emphasized that the new algorithm can also benefit independent power producers, as it can help them achieve a more precise knowledge of the capacity for their P2G system, which in turn might prevent overestimation of the system size needed, thus saving money for the investors.
In the proposed system configuration, the P2G system is assumed to be for hydrogen production and to utilize surplus power from the PV plants to energize electrolyzers.
The algorithm works in three different steps: first, it calculates the renewable energy saturation point (R-SP); then it calculates the P2G saturation point (P2G-SP); and finally uses these values to derive the Potential PV Penetration Index (PRPI), an indicator of available energy per capacity input.
“When a general optimization system is applied, the capacity of the P2G facility is derived as one of the multiple solutions that satisfy the maximum PRPI, unless constraints involving complex mechanisms are applied,” the team explained. “However, as proposed in this paper, a P2G facility with an extreme PRPI cannot be an appropriate capacity.”
It also highlighted that, when the algorithm considers the capacity of the P2G facility, the PRPI is reduced by 0.02 and the capacity of the P2G system itself is reduced by 65% at the R-SP. Furthermore, it also ascertained that midpoint and worst R-SPs also slightly reduced PRPI, with the required capacity of the P2G facility being also significantly reduced. “This can be considered an excellent plan, taking into account the high equipment cost of the P2G facility,” it stated.
The academics stressed that system planners should select a PRPI that does not exceed the PG-SP and said the algorithm should then determine the capacity of PV and P2G facilities to achieve the desired PRPI. “It is crucial to determine the appropriate PV capacity before planning P2G facilities,” they specified.
According to the paper, the novel algorithm has the potential to be applied to other renewable resources, among them wind turbines. “In future research, we plan to expand the cases, apply the proposed method to various renewable sources, including PV and wind turbines, and conduct in-depth analysis on the indices for each power source,” they concluded.

After five years of partnership, French energy company TotalEnergies has bought the remaining interest in independent power producer Total Eren, increasing its stake from nearly 30% to 100%.
TotalEnergies will not fully integrate Total Eren into its renewables business. The transaction follows a strategic agreement between the two companies in 2017, which allowed TotalEnergies to take full control of Total Eren after a period of five years.
According to figures provided by the two companies, Total Eren is valued at €3.8 billion. The acquisition of the 70.8% stake represents a net investment of around €1.5 billion. The integration of Total Eren is expected to result in an approximately €160 million increase in the net operating income of TotalEnergies' Integrated Power segment in 2024.
Total Eren currently operates 3.5 GW of assets globally and possesses a diverse portfolio of more than 10 GW of solar, wind, hydroelectric, and storage projects across 30 countries. This includes nearly 1.2 GW under construction or in advanced stages of development.
TotalEnergies will leverage Total Eren's operational 2 GW assets in liberalized markets, notably in Portugal, Greece, Australia, and Brazil. In addition, TotalEnergies said it will capitalize on Total Eren's expertise to develop projects in countries like India, Argentina, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.
Total Eren has also initiated green hydrogen production projects in North Africa, Latin America, and Australia. These projects will continue under a new partnership, led by an entity known as TEH2 (80% owned by TotalEnergies and 20% by the Eren group).

The Australian arm of China-based Chelion Renewables Group has confirmed that the integrated components of its Matrix CAIO battery cabinet have been granted Clean Energy Council (CEC) approval for sale in Australia.
The Matrix CAIO, according to the company, has a 95% roundtrip efficiency and a flexible, modular design that allows customers to choose between a number of customisable options such as power conversion system (PCS) size, solar connectivity and backup for all ongrid or offgrid scenarios.
Chelion said the modular rack system can accommodate 90 kW of bi-directional AC-DC inverter capacity, or up to 120 kW of DC-DC PV inversion, or a combination of PCS, PV, and static transfer switch for a “truly hybrid system.”
“The CAIO can also be strung in parallel, with an external power conversion system for customers requiring up to 452 kWh of storage,” the company said.
The Matrix CAIO features an intelligent energy management system, fireproofing and HVAC temperature regulation. The IP65-rated cabinet measures 1,450 mm x 2,000 mm x 1,100 mm and weighs in at 700 kg. It has been designed for easy deployment on an external slab to reduce installation costs.
Chelion said the CAIO offers scalability for various applications including peak shaving and load shifting for large commercial businesses, support for microgrids and community battery applications, contingency frequency control services, and supplying backup power.
Chelion Australia Chief Executive Officer Craig Nalder said the CAIO enables businesses and communities to embrace renewable energy sources, effectively reducing their operational expenses.
“These systems enable business owners to store excess solar energy during the day for use during peak hours or during power outages, ensuring emergency power supply and reduced reliance on the grid,” he said.
Chelion said the first Australian installations of the Matrix CAIO have already commenced in New South Wales.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/24/monolithic-perovskite-perc-tandem-solar-cell-with-23-7-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 24, 2023",Monolithic perovskite-PERC tandem solar cell with 23.7% efficiency,"A research group in the Netherlands has fabricated a monolithic perovskite-PERC tandem solar cell that utilizes a new type of tunnel recombination junction (TRJ) based on indium tin oxide (ITO), nickel(II) oxide (NiO), and carbazole (2PACz).
They explained that usually TRJs are based on ITO and 2PACz alone, and that the addition of the NiO layer is intended to reduce electrical shunts in the perovskite top cell, due to the inhomogeneity of the 2PACz layer on ITO.
The group deposited the NiO layer through atomic layer deposition (ALD), which they claim largely improves the uniformity of coverage of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of the TRJ.
The researchers built the top perovskite cell with the proposed TRJ, a perovskite absorber, an electron transport layer based on buckminsterfullerene (C60) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, an ITO electrode, a silver (Ag) metal contact, and an antireflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
“The SnO2 is fabricated on a C60 layer, which is needed to prevent the direct interaction between the ALD precursor and the perovskite layer that can reduce the device performance,” they explained.
The academics tested the performance of the cell under standard illumination conditions and compared it with that of a reference device with a TRJ based only on ITO and 2PACz.
The test showed that the reference cell was able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.689 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.6 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 76.9%, while the device based on the novel TRJ reached an efficiency of 23.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.705 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.0 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 77.2%.
The Dutch team explained that, despite the slightly lower efficiency, the cell using the new TRJ technology offers the advantage of the uniform coverage of the SAM and narrower device efficiency distribution, which it said will be highly beneficial when scaling up to larger cell sizes. “When ALD NiO is introduced between ITO and 2PACz, the spread of the device performance decreases, and the cells operate uniformly across different devices within a batch and from batch-to-batch,” it stated.
The solar cell tech is described in the study “Atomic layer deposition of NiO applied in a monolithic perovskite/PERC tandem cell,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The researchers come from the Eindhoven University of Technology and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).

The scientists described an HHP as a system combining an electrically driven air-to-water heat pump with a gas-condensing boiler (GB), and said these devices would be particularly suitable for older dwellings equipped with high-temperature heat emitters.
“During the coldest weather periods, when greater heating loads occur together with associated poorer EHP performance, HHPs offer the possibility to switch to GB mode, which may be more favorable in such conditions,” they explained, adding that HHPs usually operate in EHP mode when the external temperature exceeds 3 C. “The use of the GB mode may also offer certain advantages over EHP mode when domestic hot water (DHW) is required, often at temperatures exceeding 50 C.”
Using an energy simulation model, the group analyzed the performance of an HHP in a residential building retrofit scenario involving both the heating system and the building envelope. It then compared the performance of the HHP with that of a reference EHP and fossil fuel heating systems under different envelope retrofit measures and operational boundary conditions.
They validated the model in a south-facing house located in Dublin. It was built in 1999 and retrofitted with low-temperature aluminum radiators between 2014 and 2015. The building has a floor area of 160 m2, a floor height of 2.5 m, and a total external wall surface area of 139 m2.
They considered three different retrofit scenarios: a base case scenario taking into account the original construction; a minimal retrofitting scenario based on the retrofit implemented between 2014 and 2015; and a deep retrofit scenario assuming that the building is renovated according to the current Irish national guidelines. “For all scenarios, the heating system was normally operated so as to maintain an average internal temperature of 20 C with a 0.5 C dead band at all times,” they specified.
They conducted their analysis assuming an HHP combining an 8 kW electrical heat pump with a 33 kW gas boiler. It can operate in three different modes: 1 – When the external temperature is below 2 C the gas boiler provides the entire thermal load; 2 – When the external temperature is over 2 C the electrical heat pump provides the entire thermal load; 3 – The heat pump and the gas boiler operate together when the external temperature is over 2 C and the required water temperature is over 45 C.
Their simulation considered oil, natural gas, and electricity prices at €0.088($0,095)/kWh, €0.069/kWh, and €0.21/kWh, respectively.
The researchers found that all hybrid heat pump scenarios achieved slight energy savings compared to the respective electric heat pump scenarios. They also ascertained hybrid systems were competitive in terms of carbon emissions per unit floor area. “Between 41% to 80% of the heating system capital cost can be recovered for all scenarios with reference to an oil boiler system,” they stated, noting that the economic performance of HHPs is strictly dependent on electricity and gas prices.
They presented the novel heat pump concept in the study “Technical and economic assessment of a hybrid heat pump system as an energy retrofit measure in a residential building,” published in Energy and Buildings. The research group comprises academics from the Dublin City University and the University College Dublin in Ireland, as well as from the University of Sassari in Italy.
