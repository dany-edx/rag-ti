Portugal relied solely on renewable energy last weekend, particularly wind and hydroelectric power, to meet electricity demand. It generated 172.5 GWh of renewable electricity and consumed 131.1 GWh between Friday night and Monday morning.
Wind contributed 97.6 GWh, hydroelectric 68.3 GWh, and photovoltaics 6.6 GWh, while exporting surplus power to Spain and taking advantage of favorable weather conditions.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Portugal boasts an installed renewable energy capacity of 16,329 MW, with over 7,500 MW from hydroelectric, approximately 5,500 MW from wind, and around 2,536 MW from PV.
In August, Portugal’s Ministry of the Environment awarded 5 GW of grid-connection permits, mainly for PV projects. All selected projects are expected to become operational by 2030.

The generators create a microgrid to power an intelligent storage system.
Each WindBox, which consists of a 1,500 W wind turbine and two 800 W solar modules, can produce up to 2,000 kWh of wind energy and up to 800 kWh of solar per year. The compact systems share the same inverter and battery, reducing costs. With a roof area requirement of 4 square meters and dimensions of 2.1 meters x 1.6 meters x 2 meters, they are robust, capable of withstanding winds up to 180 km/h, temperatures down to -15 C, and operate silently.
The Idec Invest Innovation group, the business angel Antoine Fuentes, and their investors EIT InnoEnergy and Vinci Energies, have recently invested €2 million ($2.1 million) in Wind my Roof.
Wind my Roof has also installed eight prototypes on the roof of a building in Rouen, Normandy, and plans to carry out four other projects in France between now and the end of the year. It is also working on installing Wind Boxes in Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany.

India's solar module exports to the United States will rise until 2025, but they will then decline due to the IRA and domestic manufacturing policies in America and Europe, according to a new report by IEEFA and JMK Research.
“With annual global solar installations forecast to reach at least 1 terawatt (TW) by 2030, it is clear that there will be no dearth of PV demand in the future,” said Vibhuti Garg, director of South Asia for IEEFA. “Thus, Indian manufacturers must focus equally on domestic and international markets. Indian PV products will also need to compete in global markets with other large PV manufacturing countries in terms of quality and scale.”

Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners is looking to fund and develop a major polysilicon manufacturing plant in Townsville, in the Australian state of Queensland. The proposal would see Quinbrook set up alternate supply chains for the solar and battery products it purchases.
For the project, Quinbrook is partnering with Queensland company Solquartz, which has also been allocated a site at the Lansdown Precinct to develop a metallurgical silicon metal processing plant. The co-location of these facilities, Quinbrook said, will “enable Solquartz to accelerate and integrate its project into Quinbrook’s larger polysilicon manufacturing facility.”
This polysilicon manufacturing facility would ultimately source silica quartz from around the Townsville region and process it to manufacture polysilicon wafers for use in solar panels as well as battery technology. The proposed capacity of the polysilicon manufacturing plant has not been made public.

The Instagram channel “Solar da Depressão” has a mission to highlight the most significant installation errors in the Brazilian rooftop PV market. It has already amassed more than 62,000 followers.
It is also sponsored by 12 companies interested in ensuring the quality of services provided by Brazilian integrators.
The channel humorously showcases mistakes in PV installations, while emphasizing the importance of choosing reputable companies committed to safety and quality standards.
The page's creator, who prefers anonymity and uses the moniker “The Masked Man,” began collecting photos and videos of subpar installations from WhatsApp groups. He aims to educate customers about the significance of selecting companies dedicated to quality and safety standards.
During the recent 360 Solar event in Florianópolis, “O Mascarado” – the creator of Solar da Depressão – discussed his reasons for launching the channel in a conversation with pv magazine.
“I told my clients, ‘Price is not everything, so be very careful because not just anyone can execute a quality photovoltaic project and strictly follow the technical standards and best practices in the sector',” he said.
To preserve the photos and videos stored on his phone, he set up an amateur Instagram account specifically to share them with clients.
“It was a completely unpretentious thing because I spent a lot of time looking for that video of the guy stepping on the module. The idea was just to show it as a warning to customers about the risk of hiring unprepared companies,” he said. “If you have a budget that is much cheaper than the market standard, you need to be careful. What I suggest is a survey of the facilities that the company has already carried out.”

“The name Solar da Depressão was the first one that came to mind and when I searched, this account was available, so I didn't think twice,” he said. “I also didn't ask people to follow the account and I didn't spend money to boost the channel. Everything happened organically and unexpectedly.”
Common errors
The Solar da Depressão channel receives photos and videos sent by its followers almost daily. The most common mistake is for installers to step on the modules during installation.
“I always say that one of the great advantages of solar energy is that the modules have a 25-year warranty and when you step on them, it is impossible to remove the internal microcracks,” said the engineer. “When you go to claim the warranty, the first thing that is done is mapping using a thermal camera that immediately identifies the footfall.”
The channel's creator cited an example in which an inverter was incorrectly installed outside a residence, exposing it to weather conditions and potential theft.
The channel started in 2020 and gained its first sponsor, Canadian Solar, after a year and a half. The creator then started wearing a mask for anonymity during live interactions to protect the identity of installers and maintain a clear focus on preventing mistakes in the solar sector.
The page now has 26 sponsors with annual contracts, including companies such as JA Solar, Sungrow, and Solplanet. Its creator, an engineer with an MBA and more than 15 years of experience in large infrastructure projects, has become a managing partner in a solar energy integrator firm that has completed more than 11 MW of projects.
“O Mascarado” has told pv magazine about the main errors that lead to Solar da Depressão posts:
1 – No technical visits before closing a contract
2 – Not reading the manufacturer’s manual
3 – Making corrections to roof structures
4 – Lack of prior structural assessments for rooftops
5 – Incorrect locations for inverters
6 – Inverters installed incorrectly
7 – DC/AC device in the same panel/conduit
8 – Lack of planning for circulation/maintenance areas
9 – Walking on PV modules
10 – Wrong choice of inverter technology
11 – Installations with constant shadows

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/01/california-curtailing-more-solar-than-ever-before/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",California curtailing more solar than ever before,"From pv magazine USA
Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.
As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.
In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.
CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.
The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.
CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.
As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.
Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “duck curve” model.
The phenomenon of the “duck curve” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation (mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand (late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.
The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.
The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “duck curve” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.
The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.
However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.
“The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets,” said the EIA. “Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’s neck.”
Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive. 
“PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants,” said DNV.
In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.

The company claimed in a press release that this is the world's highest efficiency for a stacked solar cell that combines a tandem double-junction solar cell and a silicon solar cell. The result is said to break the world record of 32.65% that Sharp achieved under a project supported by Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in 2022.
“The prototype solar cell module has achieved high efficiency by efficiently converting light of various wavelengths into energy by a new structure which has compound two-junction solar cells on the top layer and silicon solar cells on the bottom layer,” the manufacturer said.
“Additionally, the thickness of the tandem double-junction solar cells can be reduced to less than one-third that of conventional triple-junction solar cells, reducing material costs.”
The cell has a double-step junction of indium/gallium/phosphorous and gallium arsenide as the top layer and silicon as the bottom layer.

Hoymiles, based in Hangzhou, China, has released a series of microinverters for the North American commercial and industrial solar sector. The HMT-2000-4T-NA series of microinverters can be paired with up to four solar modules. 
The three-phase microinverters are designed to accommodate high-powered PV modules, and support peak power output of up to 2,000 VA. The maximum DC input current is 16 A. They offer a CEC peak efficiency of 96.5%. 
The devices have two maximum power point trackers (MPPT) and an MPPT voltage range between 16 V and 60 V. 
Designed for the North American grid, the microinverters are compatible with three-phase Delta network configurations. The microinverters are designed to support up to four solar modules, typically ranging from 400 W to 670 W or more each. Hoymiles said the four-module design makes the inverters a fast and cost-effective option. 
The devices can be connected to the S-Miles Cloud platform, enabling module-level monitoring and remote operations and maintenance. They contain a Sub-1G wireless connection, offering communication stability and real-time monitoring capabilities. 
The inverters also feature rapid shutdown devices and an isolated transformer for safety. The enclosures are IP67-rated for outdoor use. They are cooled by natural convection with no fans. 
“[The microinverter] offers unmatched performance, efficiency, and safety, and we are confident it will redefine the standards for commercial and industrial solar installations in North America,” said Rocky Gao, chief executive officer, Hoymiles US. 
In September, Hoymiles introduced new single-phase hybrid inverters for the North American market, designed for residential and small commercial solar-plus-storage projects. The inverters come in sizes ranging from 3.8 kW to 11.5 kW output power.

The Denver-based clean energy advisory company came to this conclusion by testing samples from 16 countries over eight years.
“EL testing of more than 300,000 PV modules at 148 sites has shown that 83% of the sites had line cracks, 78% had a soldering anomaly, and 76% had complex cracks,” the report said. “The most surprising finding was the recent massive increase in microcracks.”
According to the report, published yesterday, CEA experts found that about 29% of the sites were impacted by edge-ribbon cracks, as well as 81% of sites with half-cut cells. There was an exponential growth of microcrack cases in the first half of 2023, with line and complex cracks both growing 47% compared to a year earlier, the report said.
CEA said roughly 55% of the sites had unwanted substances or debris that were not present within the module, and 52% had cell-to-edge glass defects. The report said that 45% of the sites had glass stains and encapsulant defects, while 41% had stringing wire/ribbon offpad defects.
Additionally, the survey found 41% of sites had cell-to-cell defects and laminate bubbles.

Inverted perovskite cells have a device structure known as “p-i-n”, in which hole-selective contact p is at the bottom of intrinsic perovskite layer i with electron transport layer n at the top. Conventional halide perovskite cells have the same structure but reversed – a “n-i-p” layout. In n-i-p architecture, the solar cell is illuminated through the electron-transport layer (ETL) side; in the p-i-n structure, it is illuminated through the hole‐transport layer (HTL) surface.
The novelty of the research consists of a “co-adsorbent strategy that disassembles high-order clusters”, which the scientists said had the effect of homogenizing the distribution of phosphonic acid molecules to minimize the interfacial recombination.
“We studied about the agglomeration tendency of the current best phosphonic acid-based SAM through computational study, and we approach to mitigate these agglomeration phenomena. Partially we also used light management strategy to improve photocurrent,” Somin Park, the paper’s lead author, told pv magazine.
In the paper “Low-loss contacts on textured substrates for inverted perovskite solar cells,” published in nature, the group said it was able to effectively apply ultra-thin, so-called self-assembled monolayers (SAM), made of organic phosphonic acid molecules to the textured interface surfaces in an inverted perovskite cell architecture, with the texturing being optimized for light management.
Park added that the light management of the textured substrates combined with the uniform coating delivered the expected results, which the team was “very excited” to see.
The encapsulated version of the device achieved 24.6% efficiency and retained 95% of its peak performance in accelerated aging tests at 65 C and 50% relative humidity for over 1,000 hours of maximum power point tracking under 1-sun illumination.
The technique could eventually be applied to other types of solar cells. “We anticipate that our insights into the adsorption mechanisms of molecules on textured substrates can be easily applied to other perovskite solar cell architectures, like multi-junction devices, advancing both efficiency and stability forward,” said Park.
The research, a result of a collaboration between the labs of Edward Sargent’s group at Northwestern University and Michael Grätzel at the , has reportedly produced “one of the most stable” perovskite solar cells with a high level of efficiency.
The researchers come from Northwestern University, the University of Kentucky and North Carolina State University in the United States, as well as Switzerland's École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the University of Toronto in Canada, and China's Peking University.

New Mexico-based CSolPower LLC is partnering with Sandia National Laboratories to research and develop the use of landscape gravel as a thermal energy storage medium for intermittent sources of generation like solar and wind.
The system is comprised of rocks held in a bed that are heated or cooled with air to store thermal energy. Sandia’s researchers said the gravel from landscaping companies can be successfully used for the system without requiring extensive washing or preparation.
Sandia designed a small 100 kWh test project at its National Solar Thermal Test Facility. PV panels are installed at the site, which is being tested for its ability to store intermittent generation.
“One of the advantages of thermal energy storage in rocks is that it can be built anywhere,” said Walter Gerstle, co-founder of CSolPower. “It can be commodified and doesn’t require extensive permitting. We believe it can be implemented more quickly and economically than other approaches.”
The rock bed is a long-duration energy storage system, a category of energy storage that has introduced creative solutions like gravity-based storage, rusted iron pellets, and thermal bricks.
Sandia tested the bed by charging it with heated air greater than 900 F (482 C) and maintained that temperature for up to 20 hours. The system was successfully discharged, and Sandia said the performance of the system has been in-line with modeling and predictions. The lab said prototype testing will continue until June 2024.
CSolPower said it intends to make the product ready for utility-scale use, but first it will develop small-scale versions.
“A natural approach is to store excess electricity generated during the day as heat, and then use it to heat water and homes at night,” said Gerstle. “This is an example of the small-scale use of this storage option.”
If the current phase of testing is successful, several greenhouses in northern New Mexico are prepared to use the rock bed storage in another pilot project.
“Instead of curtailing solar energy production, we would store it and use it during cold nights to keep the greenhouses warm enough to grow plants year-round,” said Gerstle.
The project is financed by the Technology Readiness Gross Receipts Initiative. Sandia’s economic development department administers the tax-funded program, which enables New Mexico businesses to work alongside scientists and engineers from Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories.

Solar PV capacity, in particular, needs to hit at least 5,400 GW by 2030 – a 4,345 GW increase from 2022, IRENA said in the report.
The Paris Agreement, dubbed by the United Nations as a “legally binding international treaty on climate change”, was adopted by 196 countries and enforced in 2016. The goal is to hold the global average temperature increase to below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.
IRENA said in the report that as it currently stands the deployment of energy transition technologies is “insufficient” to achieving Paris Agreement goals. An acceleration of renewable energy deliverables over the next decade is crucial to determining whether global warming can be limited to 1.5 C, the document said.
“Global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from the record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022,” the report said. The pathway to achieving this is the “urgent” increase in variable renewable energy (VRE) in electricity generation from 10% in 2021 to 46% by 2030.
The acceleration would need to cover energy supply, end-use sectors and technology. It would also involve the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions, the report said.
Wind installation figures need to reach 3,500 GW – comprising 3,040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore – to limit warming to 1.5 C. This is 2,141 GW more than what was recorded in 2022. Hydropower also needs to grow by almost 17% from 2022 levels, reaching 1,465 GW, the report said.
IRENA acknowledges different countries and regions will deploy renewable energy generation at varying speeds, with barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential and market maturity affecting the pace of development. The global PV market will also be dominated by G20 countries in the next decade, the report said, and they will need to reach 4,530 GW installed capacity. Non-G20 countries must surpass 900 GW by 2030.
The report, titled “Tripling Renewable Power and Doubling Energy Efficiency by 2030: Crucial Steps Towards 1.5 C,” was published online this week.

The commitment hinges on the condition of large-scale solar projects providing an appropriate level of community benefit, the government document said.
Scottish Renewables, the country’s leading renewable energy association, has published a press release welcoming the news. The organization said the target would be included in the government’s upcoming Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan.
Helen Melone, senior policy manager at Scottish Renewables, said in the press release that these targets were what the association has been long calling for, but added that there must be a “clear plan with key milestones” showing how to get there.
Planning should cover targets for commercial rooftop, domestic rooftops and for utility-scale, ground-mounted solar, she said. “And it must ensure that Scotland’s public sector harnesses the full solar energy potential of its buildings by 2030.”
In January, the government published its Draft Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan – its roadmap for the country to achieve its “climate change ambitions,” according to a government website. It is expected the final copy will be published “in 2023,” according to the draft plan. pv magazine has asked the Scottish government when the final plan will be published but has not received a response.
The Scottish government wants to achieve more than 20 GW of low-cost renewable generation capacity by 2030, the draft policy states. But unlike other renewable energy sources, such as onshore wind, it does not include specific solar installation targets. The draft foreshadows that the final version will have these PV-specific milestones.
According to Scottish Renewables, as of the first quarter of 2023, onshore wind accounted for 9 GW of the country’s total installed capacity, which is well over half of the 14 GW of total installed capacity. PV recorded the lowest installed capacity at only 522 MW.
The Draft Energy Strategy and Just Transitions Plan, however, shows the government’s appetite to increase installed solar capacity.
The November issue of pv magazine, due out next week, is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
“We see a strong role for solar thermal, as well as domestic and commercial solar PV combined with battery storage systems – which have the potential to help reduce consumer bills,” said the draft plan.
The draft document said the government’s 2020-25 Climate Emergency Skills Action Plan establishes a framework for creating and supporting the PV workforce, which is reportedly experiencing a “skills gap” for installation and maintenance. The draft also mentions the government’s ambition to introduce an exemption for plant and machinery used in onsite renewable energy generation storage, made available from April 2023 until March 2035.
Update: An earlier version of this story did not have the 4-6 GW ambition by 2030 confirmed by the Scottish government. The article has been updated to reflect that this claim and commitment has been verified by the government.

The scientists integrated the cells onto the AlSat-1N 3U CubeSat satellite, which was launched from India into a 661 km × 700 km orbit on September 26, 2016.
We are very pleased that a mission designed to last one year is still working after six,” said the research's lead author Craig Underwood. “These detailed data show the panels have resisted radiation and their thin-film structure has not deteriorated in the harsh thermal and vacuum conditions of space.
The researchers built the cells using an ultra-thin space-qualified cerium-doped alumino-silicate cover-glass developed by photonic products provider Qioptiq Space Technology (QST). They deposited the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and thin-film CdTe layers onto this substrate via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD).
“The industry leader then and now, for CdTe manufacturing, is First Solar Inc. who utilize High-Rate Vapour Transport Deposition (HR VTD),” the academics emphasized. “It is assumed, by the authors, that any future large-scale adoption of CdTe directly on cover-glass would employ this HR VTD mature manufacturing process with its inherently lower production cost than MOCVD.”
The cell was designed with an aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) front contact, a zinc oxide high resistive transparent (HRT) layer, a cadmium zinc sulphide (Cd0.3Zn0.7S) n-type window layer, an arsenic-doped cadmium telluride (CdTe:As) p-type absorber, gold (Au) contacts, and a 100 μm thick QST glass.

Tested on earth, the cell achieved an average power conversion efficiency of 12.1%, an open-circuit current of 788 mV, a short-circuit current density of 28.0 mA·cm−2, and a fill factor of 76.4%.
In orbit, the cells endured temperature cycling between +85 C and −40 C without significant change in performance or sign of delamination, according to the research team.
Their I–V measurements showed, however, that the devices suffered a significant degradation of shunt resistance. “We ascribe this to the diffusion of gold from the back contact into the CdTe layer forming micro-shunts along the grain boundaries,” they specified. “Any future demonstration of the CdTe TFSC technology will require a new back contact architecture to be developed to realise the true potential of these cells for spaceflight.”
Their results are presented in the paper “IAC-22-C3.3.8 Six years of spaceflight results from the AlSat-1N Thin-Film Solar Cell (TFSC) experiment,” published in Acta Astronautica. “The findings could pave the way for commercially viable solar farms in space,” the scientists stated.
The research team includes academics from the University of Surrey and Swansea University in the United Kingdom, as well as the Algerian Space Agency (ASAL). Scientists from the University of Surrey designed the instruments to measure the cell performance in orbit, while the Surrey Space Centre and the ASAL designed the satellite. Researchers from the University of Swansea's Centre for Solar Energy Research developed the CdTe cells.
