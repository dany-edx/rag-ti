Germany's Bundestag has approved today a whole set of new energy regulations, including a new version of the country's renewable energy law, known as the EEG 2023, that will lead to some increases in solar feed-in tariffs.
The new provisions will introduce several changes to the PV sector. One of the most significant is the introduction of two separate feed-in tariffs. Owners of rooftop PV systems can now decide to accept a smaller feed-in-tariff and use some of their rooftop power themselves or receive an additional remuneration on top of the standard feed-in tariff if they feed in 100% of their rooftop power.
The scheme was introduced to incentivize full rooftop utilization for solar PV. Hitherto, the support mechanism motivated homeowners and businesses to scale their  PV systems according to their own consumption, leaving vast rooftop areas unused.
For PV systems up to 10 kW, for example, the price will be raised from €0.0693 ($0.0760)/kWh to €0.0860/kWh. Owners deciding not to use any of the electricity themselves will receive the full feed-in bonus of €0.048/kWh. The combined remuneration comes in at €0.134/kWh.
PV systems ranging in size from 10 kW to 40 kW will see their tariff increase from €0.0685/kWh to €0.0750/kWh, while prices for solar arrays between 40 kW and 750 kW will be raised from €0.0536/kWh to €0.0620/kWh.
Following earlier criticism, the government decided to slightly reduce the full feed-in bonus. The tariff for PV systems up to 10 kW will drop from €0.0687/kWh to €0.0480/kWh and the rate for installations ranging in size from 10 kW to 40 kW will decline from €0.0445/kWh to €0.0380/kWh. Furthermore, the government reduced the tariff for solar projects with capacities of between 40 kW and 100 kW from €0.0594/kWh to €0.0510/kWh and for installations ranging from 100 kW to 300 kW from €0.0404/kWh to €0.0320/kWh.
They also introduced the option for individuals and businesses to deploy two different PV systems on a single property. This gives owners the chance to register one system as a partial feed-in system and to use some of that solar power themselves. With a second PV system, they can utilize the entire rooftop space and receive the full feed-in bonus. This measure could be particularly beneficial to farmers that could, for example, register a 15 kW system for self-consumption and a 70 kW full-feed-in system. The prerequisite for this is two separate meters for both systems. The changes to the EEG 2023 also introduce tax simplifications and faster grid connection proceedings.
Furthermore, the new provisions established that the size limit for energy communities will be raised from 1 MW to 6 MW and that grid connection for rooftop PV will be made via a web portal operated by the grid operator.

EU development finance institution (Edfi) Electrifi this week announced it had invested $4 million in shares in Canadian pay-as-you-go home solar company Solar Panda.
The EU body revealed Dutch impact investor Oikocredit had invested the same sum in the company, which has already supplied more than 200,000 off-grid solar home systems in Kenya since 2018.
Edfi Electrifi said the $8 million investment would see solar rolled out for more than 100,000 new households and would also enable Solar Panda to finance “further expansion in sub-Saharan Africa.”
Solar Panda, which is based in Toronto and also manufactures the solar home systems, said the fresh backing will ensure it eventually installs 8.4 MW of renewables generation capacity.
Quoted in a press release issued by Edfi Electrifi this week, Andy Keith, founder and CEO of Solar Panda, said: “I’m very proud of the growth and success our team has been able to achieve over the past four years and, with nearly 1 billion people in the world without access to electricity, we feel we are just getting started.”

The storage facility is located in the area of an unspecified power plant operated by Vatajankoski and has 100 kW of heating power and 8 MWh of energy capacity. It is embedded in a 4 m x 7 m high steel container and is able to store electricity in the form of heat for several months at temperatures ranging between 500 and 600 C.
“The construction of the storage went well, especially considering that the solution is completely new,” said Polar Night Energy CTO Markku Ylönen. “We managed to get everything in order despite some challenges and a short delay. Now the sand is already hot.”
Vatajankoski uses the heat provided by the storage to prime the waste heat recovered from their data servers which are intended for high-performance computing. “Depending on the season, the temperature of the 60-degree waste heat from the servers must be raised to 75 to 100 degrees before it is fed into the district heating network,” Polar Night Energy said in a statement.

The company said the size of the system may vary from tens to thousands of cubic meters and be located either in a cylinder, as for the project in Kankaanpää, or underground, reserving minimal space from the often highly valued square meters on construction sites.
The system uses common dry sand without any special treatment as the storage medium and works with pipes containing air. When this air is heated up, it is pumped through the pipes and reaches the sand, which is in turn heated up to up to 600 C.
Similar systems were recently developed by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Magaldi Green Energy, a unit of Italy-based dry bottom ash handling system provider Magaldi Power Spa.

Some 66 solar projects secured 15-year contracts-for-difference (CfDs) in a procurement exercise hailed a success despite undershooting its capacity targets.
The government had aimed for 12 GW of new clean energy generation capacity and secured “almost” 11 GW, and fears that the £10 million ($11.9 million) budget for solar and onshore wind would not attract the desired 5 GW proved accurate.
Industry representatives had warned allocating that figure from the £285 million total purse was too little and the biennial exercise – which will become annual from 2023 – attracted 2.2 GW of solar, at a strike price of £0.046 ($0.055) per kWh, plus 887 MW of onshore wind for £0.042.
Under CfDs, applicants competitively bid to secure the lowest guaranteed strike price for the electricity they generate. Renewables plants receive the wholesale electricity price for the power they produce and when that figure is below the strike price agreed through the auction tender, the government will top up the difference. When the money received from the wholesale market for the clean electricity is higher than the strike price, the generator will hand the difference back to the government.
The solar projects commissioned ranged in scale from a 6 MW second phase of the Oulton Solar Farm in eastern England to multiple 49.99 MW sites. Cleve Hill Solar Park, in southeast England, was the only outlier, with 112 MW of its planned 350 MW capacity securing a CfD.
Three of the 66 solar projects awarded CfDs are based in Wales and three are in Scotland. Some 251 MW of the CfD solar capacity is due to come online in the 2023-2024 fiscal year with the balance due the following year.
The auction also secured almost 7 GW of offshore wind capacity (at a £0.037/kWh strike price), almost 600 MW of remote-island wind turbines (£0.046), 40 MW of tidal stream generation (£0.179), a 32 MW floating offshore wind farm (£0.087), and a 30 MW incinerator equipped with combined heat and power technology (£0.046).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/07/one-third-of-global-pv-manufacturing-capacity-is-at-medium-or-high-risk-of-bankruptcy-iea-says/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 7, 2022","One-third of global PV manufacturing capacity is at medium or high risk of bankruptcy, IEA says","The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revealed that more than 30% of the integrated companies operating in the solar module manufacturing business worldwide are at medium or high risk of bankruptcy.
In the Special Report on Solar PV Global Supply Chains, the agency stressed that only 15% of these manufacturers are at high risk of bankruptcy and that in 2018 their share was around 28%. As for polysilicon suppliers, around 11% of them are currently at a high risk of bankruptcy, while another 49% are estimated to have a medium risk. “Owing to high polysilicon prices, the bankruptcy risk of polysilicon businesses dropped considerably in 2021,” the report reads. “A return to low polysilicon prices could, however, reverse this change.”
According to the IEA experts, the support that the Chinese government is awarding to polysilicon manufacturers in the form of financing and subsidies makes this market segment particularly vulnerable from a financial point of view. “For instance, the largest polysilicon company posted net losses between 2018 and 2020 despite government support,” they state without naming the producer. “From a security-of-supply perspective, consistently poor financial performance within and across the solar PV value chain reinforces supply chain vulnerability to bankruptcies and underinvestment, which can reduce its resiliency, raise prices and limit PV deployment.”
The agency warned about possible changes in subsidy regulations for the PV industry in China, claiming these may lead to higher bankruptcy risks, even for the most competitive manufacturers. “Should competitive companies go bankrupt, this could lead to broader price increases and supply impacts, in addition to loss of the subsidy,” the report says.
The paper also describes thoroughly the main vulnerabilities of the global PV supply chain while highlighting the need for a wide geographical diversification of the industry. “China has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for solar PV, with multiple benefits for clean energy transitions,” the IEA analysts emphasize. “At the same time, the level of geographical concentration in global supply chains also creates potential challenges that governments need to address.”
According to their estimates, the world will almost completely rely on China for solar panel production through 2025. “Based on manufacturing capacity under construction, China’s share of global polysilicon, ingot and wafer production will soon reach almost 95%,” they note. China’s Xinjiang Province currently accounts for 40% of global polysilicon manufacturing, the report points out. “This level of concentration in any global supply chain would represent a considerable vulnerability; solar PV is no exception.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/07/no-let-up-in-sight-for-polysilicon-price-hikes/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",MAX HALL,"JULY 7, 2022",No let-up in sight for polysilicon price hikes,"Amid continuing problems for Chinese polysilicon production, one analyst has predicted the price of the solar panel input material will “soon” breach CNY 300 ($44.70) per kg.
The latest bulletin issued by the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA) reported the poly price has risen 25% since the start of the year, to hit an 11-year high of CNY 291/kg in early July.
A recent fire at a production base and planned maintenance at five factories – on top of the ongoing Covid-19 and logistics disruption – prompted the in-country consultant to reverse the prediction it made in June that prices would fall back to CNY 220/kg in September and CNY 190/kg in December. That outcome, the AECEA said this week, is now “rather unlikely.”
While solar manufacturers have previously made much of their ability to pass price rises on to customers, hikes of 18%, 12%, and 8% in the price of solar wafers, cells, and modules, respectively, since the start of the year may have altered that dynamic. The AECEA cited a module procurement order which had included a price ceiling of CNY 1.98 per W of generation capacity and suggested other developers may follow suit.
That prospect, in turn, is prodding module makers “roughly a dozen … among them several first-tier companies,” according to the analyst, to consider pausing factory production.
So much for a voluntary production hiatus. Solar companies might also face the prospect of enforced closures for a second winter running, AECEA reported, if the upstream solar factories wanted by provincial governments to hit climate carbon scorecard targets set by Beijing drive up electricity consumption.
Provinces are already trying to attract factories by linking production investment to solar project capacity awards, as the Indian government has done.
In terms of the polysilicon price, the AECEA predicts supply will remain tight until the end of September. The nation added an impressive 23.71 GW of solar generation capacity in the first five months of the year, prompting the China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute to expect “up to 100 GW” this year. The AECEA, however, stuck to its expectation of 80-90 GW, thanks to the price turmoil.
The consultant re-emphasized Chinese dominance of solar production by referring to recently published statistics by the China PV Industry Association which indicated the country produced 98% of the world's silicon wafers in 2021, and 85% of the combined global output of polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules.
One company, TCL Zhonghuan, churned out around a quarter of the world's solar wafers in 2021, the AECEA added. Ongoing plans to ramp up poly production mean China is likely to replicate its wafer dominance in that segment of the supply chain in the “not too distant future,” according to the industry commentator.
On the technology front, the analyst predicted China will host 15-20 GW of mass-production heterojunction solar fabs in 2022, with only 3 GW of it for R&D purposes. Yunnan province, the AECEA reported, has predicted commercially available products will have a conversion efficiency of more than 25% by 2024.
While perovskite solar is yet to have a similar impact, the analyst pointed out the decision by battery company Catl to invest in the technology could prove a game-changer.

The main benefit is that the facility or community can function as a true off-grid array or attached to the grid. Setups include the grid-tied, grid independent and islanded – while smart controls can switch configurations to the most advantageous through price and demand monitoring, depending on the quality of data available.
Microgrids that use advanced control technology to manage generation and demand optimize between on-site generation, storage, and the grid, with smart monitoring of power prices to make automated decisions.
Microgrids can also optimize for self-consumption, minimize costs, carbon footprint optimization, or even to surpass net-zero energy, and so on, with solar a key input for flexible microgrids.
For businesses, maximized solar production and self-consumption provides obvious benefits in revenue, reductions in emissions, and further demonstrates meaningful environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies for stakeholders.
On the consumption side, a facility with grid-connected solar but without storage can see times when a grid connection fails, resulting in lost solar production. Microgrids therefore provide control, flexibility and resilience to distributed energy resources operating together as a system.

Microgrids cover multiple features which can be attractive to stakeholders, but any one issue may be enough: be it when a solar installation already exists or is being considered, when energy resilience and uptime is critical, when energy use and rates are high, or when the grid is unreliable. Microgrids have been deployed in applications ranging from corporate and academic campuses, right through to R&D facilities, data centers, industrial facilities, hospitals, military bases and more.
Off-grid facility microgrids are the most common across the globe, found at remote sites such as mines or industrial sites and isolated accommodation like resorts. Off-grid communities such as islands, or remote townships, are also a proven area.
Business models for operation include the customer-owned, microgrid as a service or pay as you go, and stakeholders must consider system design and devel-opment, commissions, service, support, and funding. Microgrids are becoming highly considered for facilities where climate change risks are rising, such as coastal areas and those prone to flooding, storms, and rapidly changing weather.
Off-grid solutions require durable, flexible inverters that are capable of optimizing and handling rapidly changing inputs and demand. Growatt’s SPF 5000 ES offers resilience: it can utilize multiple power sources such as PV, diesel generation, grid and battery.
While supporting diverse electrical loads it can operate with or without a battery, but is compatible with both lithium and lead acid batteries, and also integrates a built-in MPPT charge controller for battery charging. The wide maximum PV input voltage of up to 450 VDC, could effectively reduce the cable cost and there is no need for an additional combiner box.
Parallel scaling is supported as well, with single-phase or three-phase operation of up to six units with 30 kW max capacity.The system offers flexibility to support PV and the grid jointly, while prioritizing each and being remotely monitored through WiFi or a GPRS dongle.
The SPF 5000 ES can be coupled with Growatt’s AXE Lithium Battery, a low voltage modular battery system that uses lithium iron phosphate battery cells (LFP) for maximum safety, offering 5 kWh per module.Up to 10 modules can be linked into a single cluster for 50 kWh of storage, and a maximum of eight clusters can be joined to create 400 kWh of stor-age.
The module design is stackable, and uniquely designed to connect via the stacking mechanism, without any additional cables to join batteries in a single cluster. Each weighs 45 kg, with an IP20 rating, and up to 60 A charging/discharging current.
A single SPF 5000 ES can handle as much as 6 kWp PV input, and simultaneously supply a load with full power rat-ing and charge a battery without an additional solar charge controller (SCC). An SCC is usually required as an addition to the inverter to allow battery charging and supply to a load from a PV system. The system provides users with the smart management to configure multiple modes to satisfy different appli-cation scenarios such as peak shaving, maximizing solar consumption or power backup.

In particular, they achieved an efficiency of 30.93% for a 1 cm2 solar cell based on high-quality perovskite layers from solution on a planarized silicon surface and an efficiency of 31.25% on a cell of the same size and fabricated with a hybrid vapor/solution processing technique compatible with a textured silicon surface.
“These results constitute two new world records: one for the planar and one for the textured device architecture,” they specified, noting that both efficiencies were certified by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). “The latter approach provides a higher current and is compatible with the structure of current industrial silicon solar cells.”

The research team did not disclose technical details on how they improved the efficiency of both devices.
“These high-efficiency results will now require further R&D to allow their scaling up onto larger surface areas and to ensure that these new cells can maintain a stable power output on our rooftops and elsewhere over a standard lifetime,” said CSEM researcher Quentin Jeangros. “Our results are the first to show that the 30% barrier can be overcome using low-cost materials and processes, which should open new perspectives for the future of PV,” the researchers added.
The previous world record — of 29.8% — had been achieved by scientists from the Helmholtz Center Berlin (HZB) in Germany in November 2021. This result improved upon the previous world record achieved by perovskite developer Oxford PV in December 2020, when the UK-based company announced a power conversion efficiency of 29.52% for its perovskite/silicon tandem device.
EPFL researchers achieved 29.2% efficiency for a tandem solar cell with fully textured silicon measuring 1 cm2 in April. This result was confirmed by Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE. “A big challenge will be developing solar cells that can remain stable on our rooftops for more than 25 years. But the higher efficiency we demonstrated without changing the front texture will be very attractive for the photovoltaics industry,” said EPFL scientist Christophe Baliff at the time.

Lithium-ion batteries dominate the market for electric vehicles and home energy storage due to lower cost, higher performance, and lower weight compared some alternatives, but the main challenges are safety and sourcing of materials. The safety risk of lithium ion is thermal instability, a condition that can lead to a thermal runaway.
Over the past several years lithium-ion batteries have been known to explode in laptops, cell phones, and to cause fires in large energy-storage facilities. Sourcing of the battery materials, which include lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite, is also a challenge as the materials often come from conflict-prone areas like the Congo. These challenges have led some manufacturers to seek alternatives. pv magazine USA spoke with Ryan Brown, CEO and co-founder of Salient Energy, a manufacturer of zinc-ion batteries, and he explained that Salient’s mission is to develop a battery that mimics the performance of lithium-ion while using abundant materials that come from conflict-free areas, and that do not pose a safety risk.

Brown acknowledged that lithium-ion is the best at energy for the weight and that manufacturers have done well to reduce cost, but safety remains an issue. He said, for example, recent fires in Tesla vehicles are caused by thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. “When used in home energy systems, safety is also a top priority,” Brown said.
Zinc-ion batteries are a non-flammable option, due to their water-based chemistry, Brown noted. He said that the zinc-ion energy storage systems have the same power, performance, and footprint as lithium-ion systems, “so they are a true alternative to lithium-ion.”
One advantage to zinc-based batteries is that they can be manufactured on the same lines as lithium-ion, which keeps manufacturing costs low. As far as safety goes, “safety is the killer advantage,” said Brown. “What we’ve done is we’ve made a zinc battery that works the same way lithium ion works. We have zinc reacting on both sides, so we don’t have to store the reactant in electrolyte.”
Target market
The main application market that Salient is targeting is stationary energy storage. “Residential yes, but ultimately we want to be in the shipping containers.” With the main advantage being safety, Brown sees the zinc-ion battery as a viable alternative for batteries that need to be placed indoors, such as in apartment buildings. “A city is not place to put energy storage outdoors, and with California mandating that apartments must have energy storage, zinc-ion is a safe solution.”
To demonstrate the safety of zinc-ion batteries as a residential energy storage solution, Salient Energy is partnering with Horton World Solutions (HWS) a sustainable homebuilder that is installing the batteries in 200K homes that it is constructing in the Dallas Fort Worth area as well as across the Sunbelt. Construction on these homes will be underway by Q4 of 2022.
Domestic supply chain
Salient’s batteries are made up of a zinc, a pH-neutral zinc sulphate electrolyte, and a manganese oxide-based cathode, all of which are abundant are mined and processed in North America, allowing Salient to source materials from a domestic supply chain. While Salient is based in Nova Scotia, in early 2022 the company opened an office in Oakland, Calif. A team of 7 engineers based in Oakland are currently focused on developing and improving Salient’s residential battery systems, the same system used in the HWS demonstration.
For now, Salient is manufacturing batteries at its Dartmouth, Nova Scotia facility at a small scale of around 100 batteries per month, but the company is in the process of ramping up production at this facility to the pilot scale (1000s of batteries per month) to support pilot projects in the residential space.

The UK government's Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis) has published the results of its latest public opinion survey into clean power and a majority of respondents signaled willingness to consider rooftop solar “in the next few years.”
With 30% of the 4,367 homeowners polled in spring definitely open to solar, and 29% probably set to consider it, some 6% of those questioned said they already had rooftop panels.
The 1,921 respondents who said they were open to installing solar for the first time were asked what motivations they might have for doing so. Some 85% said they would go solar to reduce energy bills; 56% to be less dependent on the grid; and 38% to give them the ability to be paid for exporting excess electricity to the grid. Some 16% of those questioned said they would buy panels because of ease of maintenance and 15% said solar had been recommended to them.
Of the 2,907 people asked what sort of measures would encourage them to install rooftop solar, 76% said better incentives, and 45% specifically mentioned a higher payment for electricity exported to the grid. Some 38% of respondents said more general information about solar might persuade them to sign up and 28% specifically cited guidance on local planning procedures, with 24% saying they might opt for solar as part of a community initiative.
The findings of the survey also appeared to demolish the idea of a nation opposed to having big solar sites nearby, based on the ‘nimby‘ (not-in-my-back-yard) principle.
Of 4,369 respondents asked whether they would be happy to have a solar farm “built in their local area,” 54% said yes and 27% had no strong feelings either way, with only 7% of those polled saying they would be unhappy with such a development. A further 8% indicated such a site would not be viable near their home, with a significant bias towards respondents in London on that matter.
Perhaps less surprisingly, only 45% of the over-65s said they would be happy to have a solar project nearby, compared to 54% of 45-year-old to 64-year-olds.
Apart from the obvious wider clean energy and emission-reduction benefits of big solar, 57% of the 2,363 respondents who had indicated happiness to have a solar field nearby said it was because it would reduce the UK's dependence on foreign energy, with Beis noting the survey was carried out with Russia's invasion of Ukraine under way.
Some 39% of those asked why they backed big solar said it would mean cheaper energy; 34% said it would bring economic and community benefits; 30% said it would bring jobs and the same percentage cited cleaner air.
Of the 361 people who said they would be unhappy to have a solar park nearby, 61% said it would be unsightly; 56% said it would have a negative impact on flora and fauna; and 35% feared it would reduce house prices. Some 33% said it would lead to less reliable energy supply; 26% and 24%, respectively, cited an adverse effect on the community and the local economy; and 14% objected to the cost of energy generation at such plants.
The survey also asked 845 people why they would not consider solar for their homes.
Some 63% of those respondents said panels were too costly; 26% said they would be unsightly; 18% said the UK did not receive enough sunlight; 16% said panels would not be viable on their home; and 11% said it was because they were considering moving house.
Commenting on the survey results, Chris Hewett, CEO of trade body Solar Energy UK, said: “These results are another ringing endorsement of the UK’s fast-growing solar power sector. Whether slashing home energy bills, powering warehouses, or mounted on land managed for sheep and wildlife, it is no wonder solar power has won the backing of British people. These figures also show how out of touch some MPs are with the public on solar farms. There are no more-popular and low-cost ways to generate power than solar and wind.”
While the Beis survey highlighted solar as the most popular renewable energy source, with 87% of respondents indicating support, the government's other ‘low-carbon energy' messages appear to be cutting through.
While 45% of respondents were opposed to fracking for shale gas, versus 17% in support, some 44% of those questioned backed carbon capture and storage – versus 7% against – and the numbers were 37% versus 14% for small nuclear reactors. Some 48% of respondents were in favor of developing nuclear fusion energy, with 3% against.

Typically, when solar panels are evaluated, traditional metrics like efficiency, cost, levelized cost of electricity, and reliability are used as major benchmarks. As the global economy shifts to adoption of renewable energy, carbon emissions reduction must be kept under focus as a central goal of sustainable development.
Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are keeping that focus, and recently published new work in Joule that takes solar module assessment to the next level. The studies homed in on “embodied” energy and carbon, which is the sunk energy and carbon emissions involved in manufacturing a PV module. The team also evaluated energy payback periods, or the amount of time that it takes a solar array to generate the same amount of energy that was used to produce it.
“Green technologies are awesome, but as we are working to scale them up to an incredible magnitude, it makes sense to take a close look to see what can be done to minimize the impact,” said Samantha Reese, a senior engineer and analyst in NREL’s Strategic Energy Analysis Center.
In the report, the team evaluated two major types of solar cells: crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe). “We combined life-cycle analysis with materials science to explain the emission results for each technology and to examine the effects of future advances. We want to use these results to identify areas where additional research is needed,” said Reese.
The report found that applying a cost to carbon could result in a $0.02/W to $0.04/W advantage in CdTe versus traditional silicon cells.
By looking at present-day carbon efficiency on the grid in countries that manufacture solar, the researchers found that a cleaner grid in specific regions can lead to half as much emissions as other regions that use more dirty technologies like coal to power the grid. And, though silicon-based solar cells currently dominate the market, emerging thin-film PV technologies like CdTe and perovskites provide another path to cutting carbon intensity in half again.
“If we want to hit the decarbonization goals set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as much as a sixth of the remaining carbon budget could be used to manufacture PV modules,” said NREL researcher Matthew Reese. “It’s a massive amount of manufacturing that has to be done in order to replace the energy sources being used today.”
Recently, Maxeon Solar Technologies announced the milestone of exceeding the energy payback period 100 times over the 40-year life cycle of its Maxeon 3 series of solar panels and an energy payback period as little as 47.5 days.
“One of the big strengths of PV is that it has this positive feedback loop,” said Nancy Haegel, center director of NREL’s Materials Science Center. “As we clean up the grid—in part by adding more PV to the grid—PV manufacturing will become cleaner, in turn making PV an even better product.”
