French tech company Q Energy France has switched on an agrivoltaic installation for hop growth on 1 hectare of land in the town of Luçon, France.
Breweries use hops in beer production. The climbing plants can grow up to 8 meters in height. The agrivoltaic system consists of two mounting systems hosting 52 bifacial solar modules. The system has been operational since March.
“This is an innovative and complex prototype that combines agricultural viability and solar power generation while winning the support of all stakeholders,” said Céline Spitzhorn, solar director for Q Energy France.

The pilot project's results will be validated by the Chamber of Agriculture of the Pays de la Loire region. It will monitor the PV system's performance, as well as climatic, soil and light conditions. It will also assess the overall efficiency of the systems and their ease of operation.
The capacity of the pilot plant could be expanded to a total capacity of 20 MW on an area of approximately 35 hectares. In addition to producing electricity, the project will supply hops to the 24 microbreweries in Vendée, and ultimately reduce reliance on imported hops.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/01/solar-module-price-increases-to-affect-returns-on-4-4-gw-of-indian-solar/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 1, 2022",Solar module price increases to affect returns on 4.4 GW of Indian solar,"From pv magazine India
Solar developers in India face cost pressures due to rising cell and module prices, even as supply chain issues begin to ease, according to a new report by ICRA.
Prices of mono-PERC modules have increased by more than 40% to $0.27 to $0.28 per watt over the last 18 months. This has mainly been driven by disruptions to operations across the Chinese solar value chain and the spike in the cost of polysilicon, which is a key input for module producers. 
In addition, the increase in solar PV cell and module prices, along with the imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported cells and modules, is leading to cost pressure for solar power projects awarded over the last 12 to 18 months.
While the bid tariffs have increased from the lows of INR 1.99/kWh in December 2020 to INR 2.2/kWh to 2.5/kWh, the extent of the increase in bid tariffs remained lower than what ICRA estimates is necessary to mitigate the increase in module prices,” said Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president of ICRA. “The risk of moderation in returns is significant for projects aggregating to 4.4 GW awarded over the past 18 months, wherein the tariffs are below INR 2.2/kWh.”
Modules for projects awarded after April 2021 must be sourced from domestic manufacturers under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM). As most domestic manufacturers do not have backward integration beyond cells, their dependence on wafer and cell imports will likely continue over the medium term. 
As a result, international pricing trends for polysilicon and wafers/cells could remain a key thing for solar power developers in India to monitor. Given procurement of modules from domestic manufacturers as required under ALMM notification and use of imported cells by such manufacturers, an increase of $0.01 in cell prices would require a 5 paise to 6 paise increase per kilowatt-hour in bid tariffs to maintain the same level of returns, said ICRA.
Given the fixed and single-part tariff under the power purchase agreements for solar power projects, the uptrend in interest rates also remains a challenge for developers. It will put additional upward pressure on bid tariffs. Vikram V, vice president and sector head-corporate ratings at ICRA, estimates that an increase of 150 basis points in the interest rate could lead to up to a 20-paise increase in the bid tariff, assuming that other factors remain the same.
Despite the cost headwinds, he said, solar tariffs will remain highly competitive for the state distribution utilities, compared to the marginal cost of procurement from thermal stations, which are at the bottom 25% of the merit order dispatch of electricity. The variable cost of procurement from these coal-based power plants is more than INR 3.0/kWh across key Indian states.

Based on a competitive tendering procedure, the scheme applies to new green hydrogen production facilities, including extensions of green hydrogen production capacity. Project submissions will close on July 31. The maximum amount of state aid to be granted is €50 million ($52.3 million) per company per investment project. “The implementation of projects eligible for funding under this aid scheme aims to install green hydrogen production capacity of at least 100 MW in electrolysis plants by Dec. 31, 2025, producing at least 10,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually from renewable sources,” said Romania's Ministry of Energy.
Air Products and a subsidiary of Gunvor Group have signed a joint development agreement for an import terminal in Rotterdam. The import terminal is expected to start operations in 2026. “The signing of the agreement is an important step toward an investment decision that will be taken as the companies gain confidence in the regulatory framework, permitting process, and funding support,” said the US industrial gas company. The green ammonia will be converted to hydrogen and distributed to European markets – primarily the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. “Green ammonia is not only a hydrogen carrier and a feedstock for the chemical industry, but it's also an important renewable fuel for the shipping sector,” said Allard Castelein, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam. “First-mover projects like this will make Rotterdam Europe's foremost Hydrogen Hub.”
European Energy has signed a contract to deliver green hydrogen from the first half of 2023 to Port of Esbjerg, Denmark. “The green hydrogen will be used in a fuel cell to generate fossil free power to vessels in the port,” said the Danish energy company.
The Dutch Ministry of Defence plans to deploy 33 hydrogen-powered vehicles by September. The first nine went into service this week. “The fuel is available at 15 filling stations in the Netherlands. With a full tank, the car has a range of 500 to 700 kilometers,” said the Dutch government.
The European Commission has launched the application process for the Alliance for Zero-Emission Aviation. The EU-funded alliance aims to help the bloc to introduce electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft.

According to a recent industry note from ROTH Capital Partners Managing Director Phil Shen, US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) has detained a large shipment of materials from an unnamed Tier 1 solar module supplier.
Shen said a shipment of quartzite, a raw material in polysilicon production, was seized as part of the enforcement of the recently-enacted Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) ROTH said that CBP has demanded documentation showing the source of the quartzite.
The issue of quartzite documentation is an especially tricky one. ROTH said that none of the module vendors appear to have quartzite documentation, and noted that two of the leading suppliers, Wacker and Hemlock Semiconductor, are not in a position to provide such information. It is possible that it is information the companies could provide, said Roth, but doing so would take time and put other shipments to the United States in jeopardy.
Passed in December 2021, the UFLPA seeks to ban imports of all products from China's Xinjiang region unless the products are not be connected to forced labor. Xinjiang is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, which is an essential material in conventional solar modules. And there are concerns that implementation of the UFLPA would severely disrupt what has already become a strained solar supply chain.
While roughly half of the world’s polysilicon does not come from Xinjiang, it is difficult to trace where every single manufacturer gets all of their polysilicon from. There could also be potential for entire factories to be “contaminated” by a relatively small mix of Chinese polysilicon in an otherwise non-Chinese mix.
The US Department of Homeland Security’s June 30 strategy to prevent the importation of goods mined or produced using forced labor under the UFLPA was initially seen as a best-case scenario for the solar industry. But with other at-risk  companies left off the list of banned imports, this detention casts a shadow on that notion.

The development of semitransparent solar cells that can transform windows into active power generators continues to progress. A team of Australian researchers have produced next-generation perovskite cells with a conversion efficiency of 15.5%, in order to increase the stability of “solar windows,” while allowing more natural light to pass through.
The researchers, based at Victoria’s Monash University and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), had previously developed semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PeSCs) that allowed 10% of visible light to pass through, while simultaneously achieving a 17% power conversion efficiency. Non-transparent silicon rooftop cells operate at about 20% efficiency.
The same team, led by Professor Jacek Jasieniak from Monash University’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, has now developed new formulations of cells that use a combination of caesium and formamidinium in the initial perovskite composition. Power conversion efficiencies of 15.5% and 4.1% have been achieved this way for different prototype cells, with average visible transmittance of 20.7% and 52.4%, respectively.
While the power conversion rates are lower than previous results, Jasieniak said the amount of visible light being passing through the cells is now approaching levels suited to glazing, which increases their potential to be used in a wide range of real-world applications.
“This work provides a major step forward towards realizing high efficiency and stable perovskite devices that can be deployed as solar windows to fulfill what is a largely untapped market opportunity,” he said.
The researchers said the caesium and formamidinium ST-PeSCs also demonstrated excellent long-term stability when tested under continuous illumination and heating. The research results, recently published in Advanced Science, show that the caesium and formamidinium based ST-PeSCs maintained 85% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 1,000 hours under continuous illumination. This makes them attractive candidates for scalable device manufacturing.
While the use of solar glazing in real-life applications is in its infancy, it is increasingly being considered by developers. Victorian architecture firm Kennon, for example, recently announced plans to clad an eight-floor building in Melbourne with a “solar skin.” And West Australian solar-glass developer ClearVue also recently signed a deal to complete its first commercial installation in the United States.
Separately, ClearVue said earlier this month that it had signed a letter of intent with LabReal to install its transparent solar glass technology at an office building in Atlanta, Georgia. The project will use 250 square meters of ClearVue PV glazing. The project is now in the final stages of planning, with construction expected to start during the fourth quarter of 2022.
ClearVue Executive Chairman Victor Rosenberg said the project is the company’s first commercial installation in North America. It will serve as a reference site to secure larger sales in the region.
“The ClearVue technology represents a paradigm shift in the way glass will be used in building construction,” he said. “Glass will no longer be just a component of construction, but also a renewable energy source and a key element in construction decarbonisation efforts – both for refurbishments and for new builds. The Atlanta project will demonstrate this and provide a key reference site for the company in this target territory.”

“Our new software ensures better early-phase project insight,” COO Even Kvelland told pv magazine. “It allows developers to identify specific sites such as, for example, industrial land or pasture, while enabling preliminary capex and [levelized cost of electricity] estimations and technical analysis.”

The software analyzes factors such distance to the grid or substations, topography, soil depth, and solar radiation. It considers terrain with a maximum slope of 12 degrees and can obtain topographical heatmaps, while defining whether an identified surface is cropland, wetland, forest, or a protected area.
In addition, it helps with project sizing. “The user can also draw and see the potential size in MW while drawing,” Kvelland said. “When a developer finds a suitable site, it should use the tool to test various analyses of different systems, then it should contact the owner of the land. In some regions, we do have the name and contact details of the landowners to make this process faster.”
The cloud-based software-as-a-service solution is automatically updated with new features and new data, said  the company.
“The tool typically looks at lots of different data per site and is able to perform quick energy and economic analysis of different technologies on the site,” said Glint Solar CEO, Harald Olderheim. “It is also able to detect existing PV plants as well as other energy plants like wind, coal, and hydropower.”

The software system uses Amazon Web Services for heavy calculations and to store large amounts of data.
“We have created our own energy production analysis in cooperation with Norway's Institute for Energy (IFE) based on a variety of satellite data and databases around the world,” Olderheim said. “The software works globally, but it varies what kind of data we have for different countries. Most of our features work globally, while for some data layers the system works country by country.”

Haryana-based Sanvaru Technology has revealed that it will more than triple its lithium battery manufacturing capacity in India to 400 MWh per year.
The company currently has a 125 MWh/year facility in Sonipat, Haryana, where it makes lithium batteries for the solar storage and electric vehicle segments. Its expansion plans are now underway, and its next factory will be built in Haridwar, Uttarakhand.
“We expect our revenues to cross [$22 million] this year, as we have received letters of intent for orders,” Sunil Bhatnagar, international business director for new and emerging technologies at Sanvaru Technology, told pv magazine.
Bhatnagar said the electric vehicle market is expanding, with two-wheelers and three-wheelers leading sales. For four-wheelers, the electric bus market is quickly emerging as a mode of mass rapid transportation. Another potential segment is e-tractors, which are good for exports, but the domestic market is also coming up now, said Bhatnagar.
In line with current market trends, Sanvaru’s focus is on lithium batteries for EVs. On the solar side, it mainly makes high-voltage energy storage systems. It also makes some batteries for applications such as medical equipment and e-cycles.
“[An] e-bus battery is also in the pipeline, as it’s quite similar to e-truck batteries. Another vertical which is coming up is megawatt-level containerized solutions, where Sanvaru is working on many fronts,” said Bhatnagar.
Sanvaru has a supply base that spans all of India. It also exports batteries to neighboring countries and markets in Africa.

“Our storage heaters are specially designed to work on grid-connected PV installations, using surplus power to produce sustainable heating,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The company offers the heaters along with its patented Solar Manager technology, which can purportedly detect solar power surpluses in real time.
“The whole package is compatible with any grid-connected photovoltaic array,” the spokesperson said. “The heaters can be configured to operate exclusively for the utilization of the surplus PV electricity and, if needed, it will top up the load of the equipment using the off-peak hours to provide heating during the set comfort hours.”

The company offers two different storage heater products. The first device, Ecombi SOLAR, can provide a constant release of heat during the day. It is available in four versions, with power outputs ranging from 975 W to 2.6 kW, and storage capacities from 7.8 kWh to 20.8 kWh. All the models have a charging time of eight hours and Class I insulation. The weight is between 61 kg and 148 kg and the maximum size reaches 111 cm x 73 cm x 18 cm.
The second system, Ecombi ARC, is available in three versions with outputs of 1.6 kW, 2.4 kW, and 3.2 kW, and a storage capacities of 12.8 kW, 19.2 kW, and 25.6 kW. The charging time is eight hours for all devices and the insulation is also Class I level.
“This product offers heat by natural transfer at the desired hour through a fan,” the spokesperson said. “It can adapt the power to the available surpluses.”
The products can work as backup systems or as main household heating systems.
“In the first case, the storage heaters use only a part of the available solar power surplus and help reduce the consumption of the primary heating system,” the spokesperson said. “In the second case, the devices store all available surplus in the form of heat and use grid electricity only to complete the necessary load and provide the required comfort.”
Elnur Gabarron said that its system is compatible with all PV installations and inverters on the market.
“We usually work both with external installers specialized in the installation of residential PV systems, as well as installers of electric heating,” said the spokesperson.
The company claims the system is ideal for households with high power consumption profiles.
“The storage heaters are designed for people that spend a lot of time at home, such as the elderly or people who work remotely from home,” the spokesperson said. “The investment varies depending on the number of heaters. The Ecombi SOLAR costs €455 ($475) plus added-value tax (VAT) and the Ecombi ARC €851 plus VAT.”

“We fabricate the perovskite sub-cell conformally on the damage-etched front surface to mitigate the negative impacts of rough c-Si substrates, thus preventing shunt paths across carrier transport layers, absorber layers, and their interfaces in relevance,” the scientists said, noting that they followed a standard wafering and etching process that is commonly used in the PV industry.
They said this strategy benefits from the synergetic effects of the functional layers and interfaces, while minimizing the shunting probability during device fabrication.
They built the 1cm2 cell with a dense hole transport layer based on nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) with a thickness of 10 nm. The research group said this minimizes the likelihood of pinholes that can result in shunt paths. PolyTPD, which is an excellent hole transport layer material and an electron-blocking material, was used to passivate the interface between NiOx and the perovskite film, with the aim of reducing the cell's overall voltage losses.
The researchers used the vacuum flash method to ensure a homogeneous growth of the perovskite films and fabricated an electron transport layer made of tin(II) oxide (SnOx), which was deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD). They also equipped the cell with an anti-reflection (AR) coating based on silicon dioxide (SiO2) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which purportedly serves as a barrier layer for better stability.
Through ray tracing and device simulation, the academics found that both reflection loss and resistive loss at the subcell level can be optimized to minimize overall power output losses. The measurements also showed that the tandem cell can achieve a power conversion efficiency of 27.6%.
“There is also room for improvement in reducing the parasitic absorption loss,” the researchers said.
They presented their findings in “27.6% Perovskite/c-Si Tandem Solar Cells Using Industrial Fabricated TOPCon Device,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. The research group includes academics from Australian National University, the Beijing Institute of Technology in China, and Chinese module manufacturer JinkoSolar.
“The methods discussed above could help in the commercialization of low-cost and efficient perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells,” the scientists said.

In “Enabling Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FPV) Deployment,” the researchers considered both the long- and short-term combination of the two energy sources. In their proposed system configuration, the hydropower facility would rely on a grid interconnection capacity that equals its installed capacity. The floating PV array, meanwhile, would be 50% of the nameplate capacity, with its tilt angle set at 11 degrees.
The scientists considered PV curtailment on an hourly, daily, and seasonal basis. They said that the hybridization of the two energy sources could provide benefits from the plant level to the system level.
“Actual hydropower plant flexibility can vary significantly by reservoir size, number of generator units and their characteristics, environmental constraints, and within seasons,” they explained. “For the purpose of our study, we assumed that hydropower was only constrained by available water and a ramp rate.”
They found that the combination of floating PV and hydropower could reduce solar curtailment. “At a system level, the cost optimal operational decision is to maximally utilize low-to-zero marginal cost resources by dispatching solar and conserving hydropower resources for later in the year if the hydropower is flexible enough to do so,” they said.
Floating arrays connected to hydropower facilities could also generate more electricity, thanks to curtailment reduction.
“At the diurnal scale, results suggest that full hybridization could lower generator
operations and maintenance costs and reduce cycling for gas-fired generation by taking advantage of more hydropower flexibility,” they said. “At the seasonal scale, results suggest that hybridizing FPV leads to more optimal use of water resources with hydropower generation reduced in the wet season to conserve water for use during the dry season.”
Looking forward, the NREL researchers said more work is needed to assess system costs.
“This kind of analysis would require more spatially and temporally resolved data, as well as a production cost model that can model at a sub-hourly timescale,” they said.
A similar study was published last year by a research group from the Islamic University of Technology, in Bangladesh. They showed that the two energy sources could be perfectly optimized and that PV could compensate for water shortages during the winter, while hydropower could compensate for poor yields from the floating array during monsoon season.
Scientists have conducted several studies in recent years on the combination of the two technologies. Past NREL research showed that linking solar with hydro in a full hybrid system configuration at every hydroelectric facility in the world could result in the deployment of 7,593 GW of combined generation capacity.
