The refueling stations will be designed and developed with German consulting firm FEV. The company wants to contribute to the acceleration of the adoption of hydrogen as a main source of fuel for the light to heavy hydrogen mobility sector. “First Hydrogen will also offer fuel-cell-powered supercritical CO2 extraction systems that will allow users to operate the systems in remote locations where there are no electrical power grids available, or the electrical power is unstable,” the company said in a statement. “This already developed supercritical CO2 extraction system is fully operational and can be monitored and supported remotely by the company’s in-house fully integrated software operating system.”
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda and the Indonesian Minister of Energy Arifin Tasrif signed a memorandum of cooperation (MoC) on energy transition on Monday for the joint development of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology in Indonesia. As reported by the Indonesian ministry, the partnership includes the development and deployment of hydrogen, ammonia fuel, carbon recycling, and CCS/CCUS. Minister Tasrif also called on other international partners to invest in Indonesia's energy transition plans. The MoC is part of a wider trend as Asian countries seek stronger cooperation on energy and climate. Also on Monday, Minister Hagiuda announced the new ASIA-Japan Investing for the Future Initiative, aimed at providing the direction for economic cooperation in Asia, with a view toward the post-pandemic era, the Japanese economy ministry said in a statement.
Britain’s gas grid is set to start blending hydrogen around the country from next year, wrote the Energy Networks Association (ENA), adding that the aim is to deliver 20% hydrogen to homes and businesses around the country from 2023 as a replacement for up to a fifth of the natural gas currently used. “The companies are also calling for the UK government to double its domestic 2030 hydrogen production target from 5 GW to 10 GW, to ensure that as much hydrogen as possible is produced from sources here in the UK,” ENA wrote on Thursday. Blending is subject to a final decision by the government, which it will make in 2023, as per the UK government's hydrogen strategy.
The Metropolis of Montpellier has changed its ecological mobility transition plans, presenting an alternative to the hydrogen plans for its bus fleet. The decision was taken because some municipalities were “concerned by the project”. The new plan scraps the two-year-old project for 51 hydrogen buses in the French city. “The hydrogen technology is promising, but we were helped on the investment and not on the operation. It would be six times more expensive than with electric buses. So, for the moment, we give up on hydrogen buses, we will see in 2030 if hydrogen is cheaper,” commented Montpellier Mayor Michaël Delafosse, as reported by the local press.
California start-up H2 Clipper plans to build airships that simultaneously transport hydrogen and use it as a lighter-than-air gas to provide the aircraft with lift. Its airships will also use hydrogen fuel cells to power their engines. “While the project is still at the concept stage, the company says that thanks to modern aeronautical design, stronger and lighter-weight materials, and modern fabrication techniques, their airship will be faster, safer, and more efficient than its predecessors,” Singularity Hub reported earlier this month. The company was recently selected to take part in an accelerator run by software major Dassault Systems. On Tuesday, the company added that Ángel Gurría, the former secretary general of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), had joined its advisory board. “H2 Clipper’s mission and technology for 100% carbon-free transport of freight and hydrogen are precisely the kinds of disruptive breakthroughs the world requires to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and to avoid climate catastrophe,” commented Gurría. The airships would deliver hydrogen ten times faster than a ship, wrote German automotive supplier Schaeffler Group, commenting on the project.
German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp has rebranded its electrolysis business and is aiming to sell new shares in an initial public offering (IPO) this year, most likely in spring. “A stock exchange listing would make it possible for the capital market to apply a market value to the business and the IPO proceeds could be used to finance further growth,” Thyssenkrupp wrote on Thursday. The company hopes to receive €600 million ($687 million). According to Reuters, the plan envisages a free float of up to 25%. Previously known as Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers, a joint venture with Milan-based Industrie De Nora, the unit has been renamed Thyssenkrupp nucera. It will keep its focus on alkaline water electrolysis technology. The company has over 600 projects, 240,000 electrolytic cell elements produced and over 10 GW of electrolyzer capacity installed. “It is our aim to become the number one technology leader for large-scale industrial green hydrogen production in the alkaline water electrolysis market,” commented Denis Krude, CEO of Thyssenkrupp nucera. According to the company, the worldwide hydrogen market is expected to grow sevenfold by 2050. Half of the hydrogen projects announced in 2021 will use electrolysis technology, corresponding to 93 GW of electrolysis capacity.
Milan-based Snam, Europe's largest energy infrastructure operator, and Tenova, Italian developer and provider of sustainable solutions for the green transition of the metals industry, signed an agreement to conduct joint strategic studies and market analysis to implement specific infrastructure and metals production systems by using green hydrogen. Snam will provide its expertise in hydrogen technologies and transport, whereas Tenova will contribute through its know-how in combustion systems for reheating and heating treatment, and in electric arc furnaces. Tenova's combustion systems can work through a blend of natural gas and hydrogen in variable percentages, and up to 100% of hydrogen.
In Greece, Motor Oil and Public Power Corporation have entered into a memorandum of understanding agreement to carry out, through a joint venture scheme, investment projects related to the country's green hydrogen sector. “The participation of Motor Oil in the joint scheme will be 51% while that of Public Power Corporation will be 49%,” the oil company wrote on Thursday. The joint venture will focus on projects for the production and storage of green hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/14/fluence-quantumscape-partner-on-solid-state-lithium-metal-energy-storage/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 14, 2022","Fluence, QuantumScape partner on solid-state lithium-metal energy storage","German and U.S.-owned energy storage heavyweight Fluence has entered into a multi-year agreement with U.S. battery start-up QuantumScape to introduce solid-state lithium-metal battery technology in stationary storage applications. The deal has made Fluence the first non-automotive company to partner with the start-up.
The agreement, which reserves batteries produced by QuantumScape’s pre-pilot production facility, QS-0, will see the companies work together to validate and test QuantumScape’s solid-state battery cells for use in Fluence’s proprietary stationary storage products. The companies expect to enter into a large-scale supply agreement during their collaboration.
“Fluence’s technology-agnostic platform is also particularly suited to early adoption of next-gen technologies like this that have the potential to increase the adoption of stationary storage,” said Manuel Perez Dubuc, CEO of Fluence.
Solid-state battery tech holds the promise of higher energy density, reduced charge time and improved safety compared to their liquid-filled cousins, li-ion batteries. But the hard part about making a working solid-state battery is to simultaneously meet all the requirements in terms of density, charge, lifespan, wide operation temperature range and cost.
In 2020, QuantumScape claimed it had made this happen and reported breakthroughs in the solid-state lithium-metal technology, including increasing energy density by 50% to 100%. At the time, the 10-year-old start-up was already backed with $1.5 billion from a long list of investors, including Volkswagen and the Bill Gates-led Breakthrough Energy Ventures, among others.
The company’s solid-state design uses no manufactured anode. Namely, as the battery charges, the lithium moves from the cathode through aceramic separator and deposits between the separator and an electric contact plate, forming an anode of metallic lithium in situ.
QuantumScape uses a proprietary solid-state ceramic separator, which is touted to be capable of meeting the key requirements of high conductivity, stability to lithium metal, resistance to dendrite formation, and low interfacial impedance. These are the key requirements to make a lithium-metal anode with zero excess lithium, which in turn enables high energy density, fast charge, and long life.
The ceramic separator also enables the use of a customized catholyte material, better suited for the voltage and transport requirements of the cathode, according to QuantumScape.
The ceramic itself is non-combustible, making it safer than conventional polymer separators, which are hydrocarbons and can burn.  It uses earth abundant materials with a continuous-flow manufacturing process, which could make it cost-effective at commercial volumes.
The company says its single layer cells were tested to over 1,000 charge-discharge cycles and have maintained approximately 90% capacity. The energy density of its cells stands at 1,000 Wh/L.
“While we have historically focused on automotive applications, we believe our battery technology is broadly applicable and can play a role in other sectors contributing to a lower-carbon future,” CEO Jagdeep Singh said.

The solar cell's perovskite film was passivated with different isomers of phenylethylammonium iodide, which increase the energy barrier of the 2D perovskite formation and prevents the bulky organic cations from entering the perovskite lattice even at elevated temperatures.
“These isomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms in space, determining the probability of 2D perovskite formation,” the researchers explained, adding that the isomers showed a comprehensive passivation effect and suppressed non-radiative recombination and improved interfacial charge extraction.
The mini module was designed with an active area of 26 cm2 and reached a power conversion efficiency of 21.36% under standard radiation conditions. It also exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 10.30 V, a short-circuit current of 2.71 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 76.40%.
“This is one of the highest efficiencies reported so far for perovskite solar modules,” the Lithuanian group specified. “The high module performance originates from the good uniformity of the perovskite layer, the reduced trap density, and suppressed interfacial recombination.”
The device was also found to offer operational stability of over 1000 h.
A full description of the passivation technology can be found in the paper “Tuning structural isomers of phenylenediammonium to afford efficient and stable perovskite solar cells and modules,” which was recently published in nature communications. “This study demonstrates that altering functional groups and chemical structures should be an effective strategy to develop novel organic cation passivators with continuous and stable passivation effect, which may pave the way for scaling up perovskite photovoltaics to sizes of commercial relevance,” the authors of the study concluded.

“Israel's agri-tech segment is already well known for many years, and also its innovative solar and energy tech segment,” Eitan Parnass,  the director of Israel's Green Energy Association, told pv magazine. “So it is a natural move from our government.”
Selected projects will be awarded a fixed tariff ILS 0.2091 ($0.06.708)/kWh over a 23-year period. Solar power generation will have to be associated with agricultural activities such as orchards, field crops, flowers, spices and vineyards. The agrovoltaic facilities will be spread through regions such as the Golan Heights, Mount Hermon, Mateh Yehuda, the Jordan Valley, the Eilot region, the Springs Valley, the Upper Galilee, and the Negev desert.
“This is a pilot tender that will benefit Israeli agriculture by maximizing farmers' profits, preserving agricultural land and combining agricultural activities with promoting our energy goals,” said Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Oded Forer.
The Israeli government wants to test electricity generated from solar power facilities on arable land. The country has been developing and testing agrivoltaic systems to allow electricity to be generated from solar panels above crops. Such facilities will generate about 100 MW of power on different types of farmland at 100 locations in Israel, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of Energy said in a joint statement.
The facilities will focus on reducing high radiation and transpiration and streamlining irrigation. The plan is another step related to a government decision to increase the target for electricity generation from renewable energy to 30% by 2030.

The device can be connected with four modules in an approach that the manufacturer defines as “4-in-1,” which enables the deployment of a larger number of solar panels by reducing the number of microinverters used. These devices differ from string inverters, as they have four independent connections and the output of each panel is tracked and converted individually.
“The 4-in-1 design enables 4 MPPTs in a single microinverter, thus saving 40-50% of the costs compared with similar solutions,” the spokesperson went on to say. “The module-level monitoring also makes it super easy to check power generation status and simplifies maintenance.”

The micro-inverter measures 331 × 218 x 34.6 mm and weighs 4.7 kg. Its nominal MPPT efficiency is 99.8% and the California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency is 96.5%. It also features a maximum output power of up to 2000 VA, which the company said is a new benchmark for the industry.
The new product has a maximum input voltage of 65 V and an MPPT voltage range between 16 and 60 V. It can be used with solar modules ranging in power output from 400 to 625 W.
The inverter also features natural convection cooling, IP67-rated protection, and independent MPPT and monitoring. “Our latest high-powered microinverter solution lowers costs and expands the applicability of microinverters in industrial and commercial scenarios,” the spokesperson stated.
In early December, Hoymiles successfully completed its initial public offering with the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE). The Hangzhou-based company offered 10 million shares at a price of RMB557.8 (US$87.8) per share. The capital raised through this IPO is estimated to be RMB5.58 billion (US$879 million).

The 530,000 square meter facility will manufacture high-tech lithium-ion batteries for the global automotive and energy storage industries.
According to project proponents, the gigafactory will have capacity to deliver up to 60 GWh of batteries by the end of the decade. As outlined in the project plans, first revealed last year, the facility will be built on a small local airport in Coventry and be production ready by 2025.
The West Midlands Gigafactory, a public-private joint venture between Coventry City Council and Coventry Airport Ltd, will create up to 6,000 new highly skilled jobs directly alongside thousands more in the wider supply chain in Coventry, Warwickshire, and the surrounding region.
Coventry Airport was the obvious location for the gigafactory given its proximity to a mature automotive supply chain and skills ecosystem. The region, also described as the UK’s automotive heartland, already hosts automotive manufacturers, including Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin Lagonda, as well as taxi maker London EV Company, which is owned by China's Geely.
“We have the location, people and supply chain expertise developed in the automotive and battery sectors over many years to make us the perfect location for a gigafactory,” said Cllr. Jim O’Boyle, cabinet member for jobs, regeneration and climate change at Coventry City Council. “The next step is to secure an investor to ensure that the wider automotive and battery ecosystem in Coventry and the West Midlands continues to contribute towards increased economic growth, job creation and skills development.”
The site will be 100% powered by renewable energy. According to project proponents, the West Midlands Gigafactory will feature one of the UK’s largest rooftop PV arrays to operate the factory paired with on-site battery storage facilities. No further details on these systems have been specified.
Further boosting its green credentials, the gigafactory will adopt a net zero transport and logistics strategy. Thanks to excellent access to the UK’s motorway network as well as electrified road and rail options, the facility plans to save 7 million miles of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) traffic on roads annually.
On top of that, the West Midlands Gigafactory says it will pursue “industry leading ‘cradle-to-cradle’ approach”, which will allow the plant to both manufacture new batteries and recycle used ones.

The application now offers the possibility of evaluating the viability of ground-source heat pumps, which are also known as geothermal heat pumps. These systems use shallow-ground energy to achieve space heating and cooling and are able to transfer heat to and from the ground.
“Through the REopt web tool, users can now simulate the impact that converting conventional heating and cooling systems to geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) may have on on-site consumption of fuels and electricity, utility costs, and CO2 emissions,” the research institute said. “Additionally, users can leverage REopt’s existing distributed energy resource models to study the impact and interaction of a GHP retrofit with solar photovoltaics, batteries, combined heat and power, and other technologies.”

According to NREL, the web tool models consider the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating, electricity and fuel costs, and specific climate and geotechnical conditions, among other factors.
“The REopt web tool models each of these variables and site priorities – and how they all interact – to enable facility owners, technology vendors, and policymakers to identify site-specific needs and opportunities,” it said.
Researchers from Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT) recently outlined a series of control methods for domestic hot water (DHW) heating produced by a ground-source heat pump, in combination with a rooftop PV system, in Nordic climates.
A lack of proper business models, high upfront costs and long payback periods are the key barriers to enabling the wider adoption of solar-powered heat pumps, according to another recent report. Other factors reducing market acceptance are a lack of information on the technology and socio-demographic factors such as public perception and peer effects.

On the first trading day the Tk 100 (US$1.16) per unit priced bond received commendable response from the investors and traded between Tk 99.50 and Tk 110 and finally closed at Tk 101 at the Dhaka Stock Exchange and at Tk 104 at the Chittagong Stock Exchange. Some 3.44 million units of the bond changed hands on the day.
Investors of the bond will receive a minimum 9% return that could reach as high as 16% with various others incentives to be given by the issuer company.
Presently banks pay below 6% interest to the depositors, thus the Green Sukuk Bond has become an attraction for both long-term and short-term investors after it started trading.
With the funds raised by issuing green bonds, local conglomerate Beximco Group is financing two solar PV power plants: the 200 MW Teesta Solar Limited in Rangpur district and the 30 MW Korotoa Solar Limited in Panchagarh district — both located in the northern part of the country.
Its Chinese partners, TBEA Xinjiang Sunoasis Co. Limited and Jiangsu Zhongtian Technology Co. Limited, are also investing in the projects.
The government will buy solar power from the two plants for a period of 20 years at the rate of US$0.16/kWh.
Salman F Rahman, private sector affairs adviser to the prime minister in Bangladesh, said at the inaugural trading session of the bond that many of institutions were now coming forward to issue bonds to raise funds for various development projects.
In the future the government’s mega infrastructure projects also can be financed by issuing bonds, he said.
Presently, Bangladesh’s renewable energy generation capacity stands at 777.43 MW while a number of large and medium-scale plants are under construction and at approval level. Rooftop solar is also getting a huge response from industrialists with large buildings.
The government has prepared a roadmap to generate 40% of the country’s total electricity from renewables by 2050 through aggressive efforts.

Projections from Brazilian solar energy association ABSolar indicate that in 2022, newly installed PV capacity may reach 12 GW, including 8.9 GW from distributed generation, which includes all PV systems not exceeding 5 MW in size, and 3.2 GW from utility-scale solar.
If this growth materializes, Brazil's cumulative PV capacity would increase from 13 GW at the end of 2021 to around 25 GW at the end of this year. In the distributed generation segment, the cumulative installed power would rise from 8.3 to 17.2 GW and in the large-scale sector from 4.6 to 7.8 GW.
Of the BRL 50.8 billion ($9.1 billion) in investments expected for this year, distributed generation would account for around BRL 40.6 billion.
With the new installations carried out this year, the photovoltaic sector is expected to generate more than 357,000 new jobs in Brazil.
The largest share of these jobs is expected to come from the distributed generation of solar energy, which will likely be responsible for more than 251 thousand jobs this year.
“We project very robust growth in solar energy this year, driven by the high cost of the electricity bill and the benefits provided to consumers as a definitive solution to guarantee electricity supply at competitive prices,” said ABsolar Chairman Ronaldo Koloszuk. “Photovoltaic technology has become increasingly popular in the country, reaching all consumer classes and causing a multiplier effect in Brazilian society.”
In early January, the Brazilian authorities introduced new rules to ensure that PV systems below 5 MW in size would still be eligible for net metering tariffs until 2045. A grid fee for prosumers will go into effect from 2023, but the economic profitability of rooftop PV and small solar parks is expected to remain high. The strong growth for 2022 will also be the result of the introduction of this grid fee starting from January 2023.

In a new paper, “Are big and small solar separate things?: The importance of scale in public support for solar energy development in upstate New York,” Cornell University researchers say that public support for solar wanes when system sizes and site locations are taken into account.
Data from a Cornell mail poll shows support for rooftop solar at 4.37 out of five, and support for distributed community solar at 3.94. “Large-scale solar” had a rating of 3.04, which is just above the survey’s mean. Interestingly, at the time of the survey, large-scale solar power plants had not been built in the region that was polled.
The authors quoted residents who spoke at town meetings, as well as individuals who followed up on their mail card polling. Many residents took the time to explain that they do, generally, support solar. Respondents frequently approved of rooftop solar, but took exception to large-scale solar. For this reason, the researchers decided to separate solar into three distinct categories and to poll respondents with more specific questions based on a solar project’s scope.

Rooftop solar was defined as being individually owned and sized according to onsite electricity use. Community solar was defined as a distributed asset, generally smaller than 50 acres, and based on subscription. Utility-scale solar may be owned either privately or by a corporation, and was defined as being larger than 100 acres. Utility scale was also required to be “grid connected for long-distance transmission.”
Data presented by Pew Research suggests that there is very strong support for solar power on a national scale. However, this information also reveals that support for solar has fallen in recent years. Anecdotally, this decline in support aligns with a marked increase in large-scale solar power development.
Delving a little deeper into the data, we find very strong support for rooftop solar. In all regions, slight plus strong support for rooftop solar is above 80%. And while community solar development shows broad support around 60% to 80%, the western region reported nearly 20% opposition to community solar.
Opinions on utility-scale solar provide a stark contrast from those on rooftop solar. In the western region of the state, large-scale solar actually found more opposition than support.
Despite the opposition, opinions on large-scale solar development were considerably more nuanced when residents considered siting locations. Support increased dramatically for siting on landfills. Unfortunately, the places that garnered the most support for utility-scale solar are typically too small to build utility-scale solar. Although landfills offer 60 GW of untapped capacity in the United States, that volume represents a small fraction of the multiple terrawatts of capacity we need.
These polls give politicians some insights into how they should direct their efforts when suggesting future legislation. The numbers tell the story: Rooftop solar has strong support and significant potential – hundreds of gigawatts – certainly enough to support our power grids.

The Port of Newcastle, Australia, has positioned itself as a leader in the transition to renewable energy, as its operations are now powered entirely by green energy.
Newcastle has signed a deal with Iberdrola for a retail power purchase agreement (PPA) that provides the port with large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) linked to the 113 MW Bodangora wind farm near Dubbo, New South Wales.
Port of Newcastle Chief Executive Craig Carmody said that the move is part of a plan to decarbonize the business by 2040 and delivers upon sustainability commitments set in 2020.
“In achieving 100% renewable energy at Port of Newcastle we are showing tangible evidence of just how committed we are to driving sustainability in every aspect of our business,” he said. “Port of Newcastle’s 100% renewable power deal directly supports the development of renewable infrastructure and will deliver significant environmental improvements at the port.”
As the largest port on Australia’s east coast, with approximately 4,400 ship movements per year, the Port of Newcastle is also rated as the largest coal port in the world, exporting an average of 165 megatons of coal a year. Carmody said by switching to being powered by 100% renewables, the port has reduced carbon emissions by almost 5,000 cubic tons, which is equivalent to taking 1,000 cars off the road or planting 80,000 trees per year.
The renewables achievement comes after the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) said a AUD 3 million ($2.2 million) feasibility study would be conducted into the development of a 40 MW green hydrogen hub at the Port of Newcastle. The study, partially funded through AUD 1.5 million from ARENA and to be led by the Port of Newcastle and Macquarie’s Green Investment Group, will determine whether the project is deemed to have sufficient potential.
The study will also investigate the potential to scale up green hydrogen production for export, leveraging the port’s existing domestic and international supply chain links. While stage one of the project is underpinned by a 40 MW electrolyzer, the study will also consider the future staged scale-up of an electrolyzer to around 1 GW, with the ability to produce up to 150,000 tons of green hydrogen per year for domestic and export use.
“Port of Newcastle is working to realize projects now that will drive the diversification of our business and the Hunter Region over the next 10, 20, 50 years and beyond,” said Carmody. “We are committed to continuous improvement in line with our Environment Social and Governance (ESG) Strategy and carbon emission reduction targets and look forward to what we can achieve in 2022.”
Iberdrola’s renewable power deal with the Port of Newcastle is the second PPA it has secured for the Bodangora Wind Farm. The company said a PPA for electricity and LGCs for 60% of the facility’s electricity generation is already in place with Energy Australia until Dec. 31, 2030.
The transaction affirms Iberdrola’s position as a major player in Australia’s renewable energy market. With more than 800 MW of operating capacity, 453 MW under construction and a development pipeline of over 1 GW, much of its focus has been on wind energy, with seven operational wind farms totaling over 670 MW, but Iberdrola, which acquired Infigen Energy in 2020, has in recent times turned its attention toward solar and energy storage.
In September, it purchased the 190 MW Avonlie Solar Farm project near Narrandera, in southern New South Wales, and is developing the 320 MW Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park (PAREP) in South Australia. The AUD 500 million project will combine 210 MW of wind with 107 MW of solar to generate an estimated 900 GWh of renewable energy annually, enough to power about 180,000 Australian households each year.
Iberdrola also operates the 25 MW/52 MWh Lake Bonney battery energy storage system in South Australia and has entered into a user agreement with transmission network operator TransGrid in relation to the 50 MW/75 MWh Wallgrove Grid Battery in New South Wales.
