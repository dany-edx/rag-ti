The leading European PV lobby group said that this should include a “ban” on solar products made from “forced labor.”
The ESMC claims to have made the comments in response to the European Commission recently adopting a legislative package that addresses significant challenges in the wind power industry. These issues include insufficient and uncertain demand, slow and complex permits, lack of access to raw materials, the commission explained in a press release. The package includes an initiative set up to expedite projects, auction support and facilitated access to EU financing.
The Brussels-based organization is calling for a three-pronged package to “safeguard” the solar PV manufacturing industry from “existential challenges.” This is caused by “external supply pressures” and the need to meet European manufacturing targets, it said.
The package should also include “emergency measures” to prevent module producers from going bankrupt. This is because some major PV module producers are contemplating “decisive decisions” by the middle of November about the closure of production facilities or relocating their manufacturing to other regions, said the ESMC.
The first measure aims to safeguard the “off-take” of European-produced PV projects. The legislation would reserve a portion of the market for domestic products, with the ESMC estimating the target could start at 10% by 2025. The figure would be ramped up to a goal, for example, 40% or 40 GW of PV manufacturing capacity by 2040.
The second prong would ensure European supply chain “resilience”. The legislative mechanism would be established through yearly benchmarks and “mandatory” guidelines.
The final piece of the package would be the “ban” of solar PV products made with forced labor. “Leverage the existing Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List to prohibit PV products produced with forced labour in the EU market,” the ESMC said.
“The ongoing legislative proposal in the EU goes in the right direction but even once adopted the implementation could take at least 18 months – we cannot tolerate forced labor in the EU market, and this should be prohibited without any delay.”
The US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) went into effect in June 2022. It prohibits imports of goods into the United States that has been manufactured with forced labor in China, especially from the Xinjiang region, the US Department of Homeland Security said on its website. Xinjiang is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, which is an essential material in conventional solar modules.
In 2022, the EU Commission proposed a ban on products made with forced labor in the EU market. The commission estimates 27.6 million people are involved in forced labour across the globe. In September, the European Parliament Market and Trade Committee said it would continue working on this proposed legislation.
If it is proven that a company has used forced labor, all import and export of their related goods would be halted at the EU’s borders and companies would also have to withdraw goods that have already reached the EU market, the press release said. These items would then be “donated, recycled or destroyed.”

The vehicle can travel 80 km/h in sunny conditions without using any battery power.
The car is participating in the 3,000 km World Solar Challenge – an internationally lauded solar car race. The competition started on Oct. 22 in Darwin, Northern Territory, and will run until Oct. 29, with the finishing line in Adelaide, South Australia.
In a press release, the students explained the car uses 4 square meters of monocrystalline silicon solar panels. Under dark conditions, the car is battery-powered and can travel more than 400 km at 60 km/h. The car's speed tops 120 km/h.
“The car is a result of a year's work,” said team manager Alexandr Ebnöther in a promotional video clip. “We were a focus project that started very small with freelancers investing their free time into it. The conditions in Australia are different than Switzerland, and although we design the car for the Australian roads and its heat and sun – there are things we can not anticipate.”
The car weighs 188 kg, with most parts made from carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP). Glass-fiber-reinforced polymers (GFRP) have been used for the canopy, as it is lightweight while maintaining dimensional stability, according to the students.

The data, which compiles project developers’ total global output as of the third quarter of 2023, shows that a growing number of projects are being built in Spain.
“The recent pace of deployment in Spain is sensational,” Wiki-Solar founder Philip Wolfe said. “This is almost entirely unsubsidized projects – showing how competitive solar has become.”
There are 546 solar plants operating in Spain, producing roughly 20.8 GW of energy as of the third quarter, according to Wiki-Solar. Major project developers operating in the Mediterranean country include Enel Green Power, run by Spanish utility Endesa, as well as independent power producers such as X-Elio and Naturgy.
According to Wiki-Solar, this means that Spain is closely following PV’s three big international players – China, the United States and India, with project developers reaping the rewards.
“Spain held [the] top position in the world between 2007 and 2011 on the back of its generous feed-in tariff scheme,” the report said. “When this was controversially dismantled, the country slid down the table to No. 7 in 2017-18. It is now back up to No. 4 with a lot of clear water ahead of the chasing pack led by Germany.”
Wiki-Solar acknowledges that there will be “some omissions” from the top 19 developer listings. This is because the website's database only records roughly 88% of projects. It said that its figures could be understated by an average factor of 1.1.

Over the last decade, Southeast Asia experienced a rapid surge in solar installations that, in some countries inexorably lost momentum due to a lack of grid capacity and uncertainty around tariffs and offtake agreements, notably in Vietnam and Thailand. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines, have managed more continuity and have remained reasonably attractive to specialized renewable energy players despite much slower progress. Overall, progress in many Southeast Asian countries is still hampered by changing local content requirements, opaque permitting, and traditional energy market structures – especially for less specialized market players. Plans for grid interconnection, balancing, and easier energy trading still need to accelerate.
Facing these issues, Southeast Asia’s PV and energy storage industry is similar to the rest of the world. German and Spanish markets have seen sharp rises then painful cuts before some kind of recovery. The main ingredients for making or breaking PV project investment are actually pretty similar across the globe.
Land constraints
Countering land scarcity with technical and business model innovation is key. Agrivoltaics, dual use on fish ponds or shrimp farms, floating PV, and rooftop solar carry the benefit of potential revenue stacks, leveraging synergies from aspects such as shading, increased stakeholder acceptance, or even a fast track to permitting.
These approaches are technically viable and commercially attractive, as shown by Singapore’s 60 MW floating solar farm on the Tengeh Reservoir, that went into operation in 2021. Now it needs efficiency and scale. But that’s not new or disruptive – that’s already becoming the new normal.
Battery storage
Adding battery energy storage systems (BESS') is gaining traction as a success factor. While battery storage systems add complexity and risk, portfolios containing BESS' reap the benefits of additional revenue streams, value from increased grid stability, and energy autarky. Australia, for example, is seeing XXL battery projects that are attracting debt and equity alike. In Germany, there is a residential hybrid revolution happening with 1.2 GW/1.9 GWh of battery capacity installed in German buildings in 2022 alone. Again, no news to an experienced player but heading into the curve.
Human resources
Skills shortages are one of the biggest challenges in the renewables industry today. Enabling flexibility in work location and patterns has already become standard. A route into shared ownership and a more equitable sharing of risks and rewards weighs more than paying above-market salaries. Self-ownership of career paths and the freedom to develop new ideas and skills are increasingly seen as just being part of an honest company culture.
But how does this work when volatile investment environments hamper consistent staff development, as happens in Southeast Asia? Well, since hiring is a real bottleneck, companies need to differentiate and the right approach to career development and reward sharing is a key factor in attracting talent.
Nowadays, environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG), and sustainability-related legislation, are constantly moving forward. Everyone needs to prepare for further amendments – not only to avoid fines for non-conformance but also to anticipate reputational risks affecting shareholder value or even disruption to supply chains.
In Southeast Asia, the adoption of ESG and climate related legislation is driven by pressure from employees, international standards, and requirements from investment funds. Singapore is investigating whether climate-related disclosure should be mandatory from 2025.
So, while this is still “new-ish” today, there is a short window of time to develop a leading position in sustainability for solar and BESS' if started now. Benefits include improved access to land, permits, and stakeholder acceptance, as well as improved interest rates, since “green” investments are more likely to achieve a premium. This is where we start getting ahead of the curve.
Nature-based solutions
The real next big thing is investment in nature-based solutions (NBS') and biodiversity projects. How are these related to renewables? Improved biodiversity is an existing attribute for renewable energy development, if done right, and shows the industry can easily incorporate nature-based solutions. It’s a developer's business, requiring land suitable for a specific concept, generating revenues for attractive financing, and operating long-term with potential exit options.
NBS' and biodiversity projects can be scalable in countries with functioning ecosystems, as the Lestari Capital fund is demonstrating in Southeast Asia, successfully developing safe havens for rainforests, mangroves, and swamps, and earning performance-based payments over 25 years while incorporating local communities into the concept. The good news is that NBS projects are becoming financially more attractive, with carbon trading and biodiversity credit markets emerging, in the United Kingdom, for example.
So how to start? With solar, this is easy and everyone should be proactive about it. For example, by adding impactful and measurable biodiversity concepts and reserving space for the preservation or regeneration of ecosystems on solar farms – instead of simply maximizing energy yield. Staying ahead of the curve means developing a strategy to find, develop, and manage areas with ecosystems that can be restored. Having revealed the next big thing, now it is time to act.

The 460 kWp system in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, can produce 125 cubic meters of clean water per hour.
“The project was initiated shortly after the Russian attack on Ukraine started, as the main drinking water pipelines supplying water to Mykolaiv were bombarded,” Boreal Light CEO Hamed Beheshti told pv magazine. “Mykolaiv has a serious water salinity challenge due to its coastal lines and saline rivers, so we applied our solution that was originally designed for developing countries.”
The system features 560 W monocrystalline PV modules installed on fixed-mounting brackets. The brackets are divided into five units and can each produce 25 cubic meters of clean water per hour. The source water is up to 13,000 parts per million in terms of salinity. Beheshti said the system was split into five units for “security reasons” and “higher” project resilience.
The system does not use any batteries. Instead of energy, it stores clean water for later use. If there is fluctuating radiation from the sun, the system’s control mechanism distributes the voltage between three pumps to maintain constant pressure in the pressure tube. Pressure tubes operate as filters for reverse osmosis purification processes in desalination plants.
However, on days of heavy cloud cover, the machine can switch to a three-phase 480 VAC supply from the grid.
The German company said water production costs approximately EUR 0.22 ($0.23) per cubic meter, with a minimum system lifetime of 25 years. Regular maintenance involves replacing desalination components like membranes and prefilters every four to five years.
Beheshti said that during the two-week installation process, the city was hit by two missile strikes, with one of them landing near the installation site. Despite these challenges, Beheshti said he hopes the project can ease some of the “devastating challenges” the war has wrought on the local community.

Solarday, a Milan-based manufacturer of EU-branded modules, is undergoing a corporate reorganization and is redefining its business plan. According to the new business strategy it presented this week, there will be a focus on customer services and participation in direct investments for the realization of PV systems, with the Italian and international pipeline now being defined.
“We will participate directly as financiers of medium- to large-scale projects,” said Marco Vergani, Solarday’s sales and marketing director.
He told pv magazine that the company wants to work with the supply chain and possibly replace investment funds. Solarday will also participate in projects that use branded products through capital injection and equity.
The company said it has already entered into joint venture, co-development and joint implementation project agreements in Italy and abroad.
“Solarday will enter the SPV's equity up to 20%, as for the remaining financing needs the company will use different types of financial instruments that will differ based on the type of project,” Christian Ciliberto, Solarday's COO and CFO, told pv magazine Italy.
Prices for PV modules are at unprecedented levels despite raw material costs in China stabilizing. Panel manufacturers must adapt and remain flexible, and anticipate unexpected developments, said Vergani.
“Right now we are experiencing a period of overstock. We are getting good results because we have focused on the production of revamping modules, for powers from 230 to 290 W that almost no one is producing nowadays,” he said. “And that unfortunately has become very useful at this time, especially following the weather events of the last few months.”
Solarday is also launching its own branded inverter portfolio. The new range of inverters will be hybrid, battery-equipped models manufactured by an unidentified inverter supplier in Asia, to specifications defined in Italy. Vergani only said that the supplier is one of the world's nine major inverter manufacturers.
The new series of inverters aims to cater to four main market segments. Eris is a single- and three-phase hybrid residential line, ranging from 3 kW to 12 kW, while Vega is an Eris-compatible storage solution consisting of low- and high-voltage battery modules with storage capacities up to 80 kWh.
Jupiter is the company's classic inverter line for commercial applications, with sizes ranging from 20 kW to 36 kW, with the hybrid version launching in 2024. Mars is the line for commercial and industrial applications, with sizes of 50 kW, 100 kW and 110 kW.
However, the company's new commercial and industrial strategy requires new funds.
“The company has changed from Srl to Spa because it is looking for major investments to be able to expand the production part,” said Vergani.
Solarday, which was founded in 2004, was taken over by new owners in 2014. According to its current management team, the company has experienced “significant growth” since then.

The researchers used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells that was developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium,  for simulating and modeling the solar cell performance.
The solar cell design comprises a zinc oxide (ZnO) transparent conductive oxide (TCO) window layer, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a CdTe absorber, an electron reflected-hole transport layer (ER-HTL) based on cuprous oxide (Cu2O), and upper/top and back contact materials made of aluminum (Al) and nickel (Ni).
In the proposed cell configuration, both the AI upper/top contact and the Ni back contact provide a low-resistance electrical connection and the ZnO window layer, which reduces light reflection, serves as a TCO layer, thus increasing cell efficiency. The back metal contacts act as the electrode responsible for collecting and transferring electrons generated to the external circuit by the absorber layer.
“To achieve the best performance, it is recommended to set both the acceptor and donor densities for the absorber and buffer layers at 10 cm3,” the scientists emphasized. “These densities can be achieved with a window and buffer layer thickness of 100 nm and an absorber layer thickness of 2500 nm.”
Simulated under standard illumination conditions, the PV device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 31.82 %, an open-circuit voltage of 1.4811 V, a short-circuit current of 28.682434 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 74.91%.
“This level of PV efficiency outperforms other research reports by a significant margin,” the group stated. “Additionally, the proposed structure exhibits a high level of photon absorption, with nearly 100 % quantum efficiency at visible wavelengths.”
The solar cell design was introduced in the study “Effect of various layers on improving the photovoltaic efficiency of Al/ZnO/CdS/CdTe/Cu2O/Ni solar cells,” published in the Journal of Alloys and Metallurgical Systems.

California-based CMBlu said it has secured a $106.7 million equity investment from global infrastructure group Strabag SE to scale its long-duration energy storage technology. 
CMBlu’s product combines advantages of both redox flow batteries and solid-state batteries. Its Organic SolidFlow product offers independent scaling of power and energy without sacrificing energy density. 
The technology is built on safe, abundant, and recyclable materials, said the company. Its energy storage devices do not rely on conflict or rare materials. 
CMBlu is currently developing multiple pilot projects in the United States and Europe to demonstrate its technology. It has active projects with WEC Energy Group in Wisconsin, Salt River Project in Arizona and several sites in Europe. 
While former redox flow batteries use metals, the company’s Organic SolidFlow batteries use carbon-based molecules for its electrolytes. The company said certain carbon-based molecules naturally can oxidized and reduced or charged and discharged. These molecules are essential elements in the “redox” reactions that power all living cells.

They looked at how soiling may affect the performance of PV panels in optical and electrical power. “We have also conducted an economic analysis in regards to soiling, but we have not published it yet. The findings indicate that the economic loss depends greatly on the individual location,” research co-author Christos Markides told pv magazine. 
The study is based on 60 samples collected from a soiling station in Muscat, Oman.
“Estimating the energy yield from real PV installations remains challenging due to an over/underestimation of soiling losses. Soiling losses strongly depend on particle size, shape and their associated spectra which significantly impact PV performance,” the paper stated. ”In this work, we present results from an extensive outdoor experimental testing campaign of soiling, apply detailed characterization techniques, and consider the resulting losses.”
In the paper, “Characterisation of soiling on glass surfaces and their impact on optical and solar photovoltaic performance” recently published in Renewable Energy, Markides and his colleagues explained that the samples tested were made of low-iron glass coupons. These coupons are commonly used within the solar industry for encapsulating the top layer of a PV module. Glass samples were collected by the end of each month during 2021 and in two seasonal periods in the wet and dry season. For each collection period, the researchers gathered four samples, of 0, 23, 45 and 90 degrees, respectively.
The samples were then sent to London for optical transmittance testing. The analysis showed that the relative transmittance of the horizontal samples decreased by 65% in the wet season, 68% in the dry season and 64% in the entire year.
“In comparison, the vertical coupons showed a relative transmittance drop of 34%, 19% and 31%, respectively,” the research group added. “The average relative transmittance decrease across all tilt angles was 44%, 49% and 42% for wet, dry and one-year coupons, respectively.”

Based on those results, the researchers calculated the expected electricity loss at a standard test condition of 1,000 W/m2 radiation and a temperature of 25 C with a monocrystalline PV module.
“The relative transmittance reductions measured on the horizontal wet-season, dry-season and full-year samples correspond to predicted relative reductions in electrical power generation by 67%, 70%, and 66%, respectively,” they added. “Based on a local tilt angle of 23 degrees, the relative transmittance losses are estimated at around 30% per month, resulting in an equivalent relative PV power reduction of around 30% per month at the studied location.”
The scientists then used X-rays and electron microscopes to characterize the soil particles. As all the glass samples were located in the same place, the scientist assumed that their soiling would have the exact material characterization. They therefore analyzed only horizontal glass coupons for the wet and dry seasons and the entire year.
“According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) findings, the full-year horizontal soiled coupon has a variety of minerals such as silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate, calcium magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, iron carbide, and aluminum silicate,” they emphasized. “The elemental map emphasizes the chemical compounds reported by the XRD analysis. Silicon (Si) is the most dominant element, while the rest are carbon (C), oxygen (O), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe).”
The researchers also found that the dry season sample had more PM10 particles – these are particles with a diameter of less than 10 μm – than the wet season sample. “It was also shown that natural cleaning due to periodic rains can eliminate the accumulation of larger particle but not of smaller ones,” they explained in the paper.

Stanwell has signed a 15-year, 380 MWp power purchase agreement (PPA) with Acciona Energia to purchase the entire output of the Aldoga Solar Farm, which is being developed about 20 kilometers northwest of Gladstone, Australia.
Construction of the AUD 500 million ($313.9 million) solar farm, which has approvals in place to reach 600 MWp of capacity, is expected to start in the coming months. Acciona said it will be completed before the end of 2025.
Stanwell CEO Michael O’Rourke said the energy will be used to power the Central Queensland Hydrogen Hub (CQ-H2), which is being built near the solar project.
Stanwell is part of a consortium of Australian and Japanese energy companies that is developing the CQ-H2 project, which will initially involve the installation of up to 640 MW of electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen for domestic use and exports, commencing in 2028. The project will ultimately be scaled up to more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity.
“Stanwell has set out an ambitious strategy for what we will achieve as a business between now and 2035 and a key component of our strategy is to drive the development of Queensland’s hydrogen industry,” O’Rourke said. “Our agreement with Acciona to secure the output of the Aldoga Solar Farm is a key milestone for us, as the Central Queensland Hydrogen Project undertakes its front end engineering design (FEED) study and progresses to final investment decision.”
