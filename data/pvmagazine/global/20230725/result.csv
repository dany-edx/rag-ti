The group – which also includes Dredging, Environmental and Marine Engineering NV (DEME), marine offshore specialist Jan De Nul and Ghent University – said the project's main contractor, Equans, is now carrying out final assembly.
The group says it built the array’s floater with an unspecified type of lightweight carbon fiber material, which presents potential benefits for offshore use, but is not often used in harsh marine conditions. Optical embedded fibers and sensors attached to the structure will assess whether the material’s structural integrity (vibrations/fatigue) is in line with the numerical models and results obtained from the ocean wave tank and wind tunnel tests.
The consortium, which also has the support of Ghent University, plans to collect data from the floating plant for a year to advance the development of offshore photovoltaics on a large scale.
“It is important not only to minimize the attachment of excessive marine growth to the floater to maintain its buoyancy,” the group said. “Specific tests will be conducted to assess combining the floater systems with mussel cultivation and oyster farming, which present specific challenges.”
The project will collect data on the impact of waves, rain and salt spray on various solar module technologies with different configurations. The companies also want to assess the effects of different angles of inclination caused by waves and wind on energy yield. They also want to evaluate the effectiveness of necessary protective measures for the solar modules against seawater and bird droppings.
Tractebel is also testing another offshore solar project in the North Sea. The group, which includes DEME, solar installer Soltech NV and Ghent University, installed a €2 million ($2.2 million) array near an aquaculture farm and offshore wind project.
Expectations for this new application are high. Offshore PV in combination with wind farms on the high seas could enable the use of multiple locations and existing infrastructure for electricity.
In a study published in 2020, scientists from Utrecht University in the Netherlands claimed that offshore PV plants could be more productive than ground-mounted arrays, after running a simulation comparing a North Sea project to a conventional system at the Utrecht Photovoltaic Outdoor Test field. The Dutch government says it plans to commission 3 GW of offshore PV by 2030.

With 760 million people worldwide still without access to electricity, it is of great importance that utility scale solar and storage projects can be installed in regions with little renewables capacity and limited energy access.
The exponential growth of PV in the last decade is undeniable with the International Renewable Energy Agency estimating global solar capacity more than doubled between 2017 and the end of 2021, to 843 GW. But that growth has not been evenly spread. Of the 195 countries recognized by the UN, fewer than 50 have 1 GW of solar generation capacity. China, the US, Japan, Germany, and India account for 69% of the world’s solar. Africa and South America, which together occupy a third of global landmass, have less than 4%.
To deploy solar successfully in new markets, we must learn from past mistakes. More than four decades ago, plans were laid to install solar-powered water pumps in developing countries. Numerous projects failed despite high-quality equipment that was appropriately specified, manufactured, and installed.
A lack of supporting infrastructure, trained maintenance technicians, access to spare parts, and follow-up visits were to blame. Although solar can be counted on as a source of electricity, and DC-powered pumps are reliable, some of the systems dropped into such regions cannot be expected to carry on functioning without issues.
The same was true of solar-powered vaccine refrigerators planned for remote, unelectrified villages by several programs in the 1980s. Ultra-efficient fridges were deployed alongside solar and energy storage systems in a program sponsored by NASA, the Pan American Health Organization and the now-defunct Solar Power Corporation division of Exxon Enterprises. It installed some of them in health clinics in Guyana, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Ivory Coast, and The Gambia.
While many performed vital service, failures of any kind were not addressed by program support, ongoing monitoring, and intervention. It takes more than equipment deployment to succeed.
To ensure the success of future solar deployment in the developing world, we could consider a few key steps.
In terms of manufacturing quality, experienced buyers often engage third-party inspectors to audit component factories. That could mean leftover, under-inspected products for inexperienced buyers, so consider a quality assurance plan for key components that rivals state-of-the-art programs.
To address the question of installation quality, be prepared for a possible absence of well-trained local technicians and support personnel. Meticulous construction and commissioning oversight by highly trained and experienced staff is essential. Commissioning can be carried out concurrent with construction and should include full-system tests, including verification that monitoring systems and sensors are working properly.
To ensure an all-encompassing support approach that bridges the gap while a local or regional solar and storage ecosystem develops, an upfront operations plan is recommended for at least a year, until the project accumulates a favorable track record. Suppliers play a pivotal role by storing spare parts locally, identifying and collaborating with local contractors, and establishing flexible warranty terms. These measures ensure ongoing technical assistance and troubleshooting in the early stages.
As noted in a report by Vera Songwe, Nicholas Stern, and Amar Bhattacharya – about financing climate action projects – these programs may face a higher hurdle rate due, in part, to greater financing cost. That provides all the more reason to take the extra steps to ensure a project is successful.
Drawing upon past lessons, we should not underestimate the challenges of establishing a solar power plant and keeping it operating safely and within specifications – especially when a project is unprecedented in a region, or lacks the infrastructure and resources that many of us take for granted. A comprehensive plan that genuinely addresses the points raised above is highly recommended – essential, as far as I’m concerned – to ensure success.
Many countries still bear the remnants of solar projects that failed to fully live up to expectations. Today’s renewable energy developers and financiers have the opportunity to learn from the past and positively affect the lives of millions. Clean Energy Associates’ core purpose is to “create a better future.” Bringing the benefits of solar power at large scale to the entire globe is an essential element of our collective “better future.”

“We are planning to produce ourselves. At first manufacturing during build-up is at partner site until we reach enough volume for our own line using the principle of mass customization,” Marc Meuris, Enfoil CTO, told pv magazine, adding that the startup had already shipped some products.
Enfoil’s CIGS foils will be made to order based on customers’ design specifications. Lengths of over 10 meters can be ordered. The power conversion efficiency is 17%. It weighs just under 2 kilograms per square meter, measures less than 2 mm thick, with a bend radius of  over 10 cm.
“A wide array of applications will be possible, such as integrating the solar cells on swimming pool covers or roof tiles,” Meuris said in a statement. “Currently, we mostly focus on the logistics sector, aiming to integrate our materials on roofs and sidewalls of trucks to power their sensors and track & trace systems. It would save the battery, and under abundant sunlight, the battery could even be charged.”
The material is compatible with injection molding, thermoforming, lamination, and gluing. Service includes feasibility and integration of the final products.
Enfoil received a startup grant of €150,000 (165,600)  for its proof of concept from the European Research Council. The company is a spinoff of Hasselt University and Belgian research institute imec.

“Phase-change acoustic conversion offers great potential for a clean and efficient cooling technology, that may be powered by a hybrid source of either electricity or, more importantly, heat,” the research's lead author, Guy Ramon, told pv magazine. “Use of acoustics greatly simplifies device construction, reducing the need for moving parts, and the presence of phase change dramatically increases the power density of these devices, while utilizing sustainable materials.”
The acoustic-driven system utilizes a binary mixture of an inert and a reactive component as the working fluid that undergoes condensation and evaporation during the thermoacoustic cycle. Atmospheric air is used as the inert gas, while water or isopropanol was utilized as the reactive component.
The heat pump consists of a loudspeaker, a resonator, and a thermoacoustic core placed inside the resonator. The core includes a cold heat exchanger, a stack, and an ambient heat exchanger.
“The length and diameter of the resonator are 0.88 m and 47 mm, respectively, and the stack is a piece of 600 cells per square inch ceramic honeycomb with a length of 95 mm,” the researchers explained. “The ambient heat exchanger is a plate-fin type, with a spacing of 2 mm and fin width of 0.7 mm.”
The system incorporates a cold heat exchanger made of 0.5 mm-thick nickel-chrome wire and is embedded within a 3D-printed skeleton. It is used to provide the heat load into the system, which is in turn driven by a loudspeaker at the resonant frequency of the system, which is 86 Hz.
The system works in four steps. Initially, the mixture of the reactive component and the inert gas moves toward the low-pressure region. Then the lowered partial pressure drives the evaporation of the reactive component carrying latent heat with it. In the third step, the mixture undergoes the reverse processes of the first two steps and the reactive component condenses on the solid, transferring the latent heat. Finally, the acoustic power is consumed in order to pump heat against the temperature gradient.
The research group compared the performance of the heat pump with that of a reference device with no phase change. It found that the heat pump may achieve a coefficient of performance (COP) of over 40% with an air-isopropanol mixture at a concentration of 0.8.
“Our experimental results show that a larger cooling power and a higher COP can be obtained with phase change when the temperature difference is below a critical value, which verifies that the phase change enhances thermoacoustic heat pumping,” it stated. “However, when the temperature difference is increased to exceed the critical value, the performance becomes worse than the equivalent classical thermoacoustic heat pump, because the time-averaged mass flux reverts its direction and carries heat against the heat pumping direction.”
The novel heat pump concept was presented in the paper “Environmentally-sound: An acoustic-driven heat pump based on phase change,” published in Energy Conversion and Management. “The patented technology is now entering the initial stages of commercialization,” Ramon stated, adding that further investigation is still required for the proper realization of its full potential.

The 187 KW installation will cover nearly 10% of the overall consumption of the MSA facility, which is located in Châtillon-sur-Chalaronne, Ain department, France.
The PV system is removable, as its PV modules are placed and ballasted on the ground. CVE said the assembly required only 10 months of work, compared to 24 months for a traditional installation.
“This solution … has greatly facilitated the validation stages within the MSA group,” Christophe Laurent, Maintenance and Infrastructure Manager at MSA, said. “Our group insurer was able to give the green light quickly.”
Businesses that have a land reserve with no short-term use can utilize these small PV plants to produce part of their electricity for a limited period of time. Beyond this date, they can choose to extend their contract or stop it in order to use the land for other purposes.
“In this case, CVE, which owns the fleet of panels, dismantles them and reinstalls them at another customer,” said Pierre de Froidefond, co-founder of CVE. “Today we have five other projects of this type under development and multiple requests.”

The Bui Hydro-Solar PV Hybrid (HSH) project, sited at the country’s hydroelectric dam in the Banda district of the Bono region, is serving to reinforce the steady supply of electricity, no matter the season or weather conditions.
The hydroelectric dam has an installed capacity of 404 MW from four generating units, including three 133.33 MW Francis Turbine Units and a smaller 4 MW turbine.  Huawei’s FusionSolar Smart PV Solution was selected for the Bui HSH project to provide string inverters and energy storage solutions to ensure a stable supply of clean power. The solar power system can augment and preserve the Bui reservoir hydro scheme even during periods of drought, when the water supply is low and the hydropower cannot run. Huawei’s energy storage system (ESS) balances electricity supply and demand, regulates peak generation, and smooths out output fluctuations.
The first phase of the project consisted of the development of a solar PV facility, a control room, and 4G Enterprise Long-Term-Evolution (eLTE) technology. The initial 50 MW Solar plant – which was officially launched and connected to Ghana’s National Interconnected Transmission System (NITS) in April 2021 – resulted in the doubling of the country’s grid-connected solar energy and is expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 47,000 tons per year. Additionally, the Bui Power Authority (BPA) installed 5MW floating solar plant on its reservoir, which is the first of its kind in the sub-region. The entire project is expected to total 250 MW of solar power.
As part of the digital transformation of the dam, Huawei deployed a 1.8 GHz total demand distortion (TDD) eLTE broadband trunking solution, utilizing a miniaturized core network, a single base station, multiple radio remote units (RRUs), and an indoor distribution system. This allowed coverage of both indoor and outdoor working areas, encompassing the dam, roadways, generator rooms, and employee living areas. Engineers can easily communicate in real-time, even at great depths underground, using the “Push to Talk” function. Video calls between engineers and supervisors have increased productivity and problem-solving efficiency, reducing the timeframe for resolving issues in record time.
Huawei's ESS leverages smart digital technology to facilitate seamless network connectivity while offering easy maintenance, secure performance, and high-density lithium batteries that optimize space utilization. This solution further enhances Ghana’s grid stability, reliability, and power supply efficiency.
Ghana’s National Energy Plan aims at having renewable, clean energy sources contribute 10% of the nation’s energy needs by 2030. Huawei's solution not only helps them on the way to that goal, it also supports the transformation of the Bui hydropower station into a safe, efficient, and intelligent power production system. Moreover, it enhances site safety, operational efficiency, and lays the groundwork for future intelligent solutions like water level detection and flow monitoring. The Bui hydro-solar project will serve as a role model for other projects in the country, as well as for countries across the African continent.

This price was 17% lower than that of the previous Monday and the lowest since June 6. But most sessions of the third week of July registered price increases. As a consequence, on Friday, July 21, the weekly maximum settlement price of €28.85/MWh was reached. This price was 11% higher than that of the previous Friday. However, the average for the third week of July was still 1.8% lower than the previous week.
The increase in demand for electricity production, due to high temperatures and the decrease in wind energy production, exerted its upward influence on TTF gas futures prices in the third week of July. However, European reserve levels are high and gas supply from Norway increased after completion of maintenance work.
Regarding CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, on Monday, July 17, the weekly minimum settlement price, of €86.49/t, was registered, which was 0.2% higher than the previous Monday. In the third week of July, the futures prices registered an upward trend. As a consequence, on Friday, July 21, the weekly maximum settlement price of €91.43/t was reached. This price was 6.3% higher than the previous Friday and the highest since the fourth week of June. Expectations of a lower offer in the auctions of August exerted an upward influence on prices in the third week of July.

“Our solution could be used in all geographical locations, although it is specifically designed for low-income people,” the research's lead author, Anuradha Tomar, told pv magazine. “It may help bridge the gap in low-budget farming applications as one unified package for simultaneous triple use of land for enhanced food, PV energy yield, and managing agro-sector with limited water access.”
In the paper “Sustainable photovoltaic based protective environment controlled farming technology as economy boosters for agro-sectors,” published in Smart Agricultural Technology, the researchers said that the key feature of the proposed system is microclimate control, which is achieved by considering multiple environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, photosynthesis, CO2, moisture level, ventilation, irrigation, and fertigation.
The system prototype measures 2,400 mm × 1,700 mm × 2,365 mm, can accommodate 24–28 plants, and has a total volume of 5.57 m3.
It consists of a housing that the researchers dubbed add-on module hardware (AOMH), a solar panel, a battery, step-down DC-DC converters, system power devices, automation, and sensor elements. For climate control, it also comprises a water pump, a ventilation fan for CO2 assimilation, sprinkler foggers, and drop irrigation solenoids. The PV panel has a glass sheet as a refractor and reflector. It provides power for low heat-trapping, temperature control, and energy generation.

“In view of ensuring enough photosynthesis within shortwave color range radiation (wavelength 400–700 nm), PV energy generation (700 nm-1 mm), net thermal energy (sum of radiated, refracted, convicted, and conductive) towards inside PV_PECF, and outgoing longwave radiated; energy from soil/plants should always be adjusted dynamically as per crop requirements,” the scientists explained.
The adjustment is implemented via an energy equilibrium state monitoring index (E2SMI) based model, which reportedly starts appropriate load action at the optimum triggering point. “It is attempted for the adequate counteracting impact of external non-linear weather variations,” they emphasized. “It supports sufficient energy savings in the process of internal climate control and so increases the return of investment (ROI).”
The Indian group validated this system configuration for one complete crop cycle of tomato crops and compared these results with those of a reference cycle of open-field farming. “The leaf area index (LAI) is observed as 1.44 to 1.58 times higher than that in an open field and the ROI is increased by 9.24%,” it further explained. “The MPPT integrated AOMH could provide an average combined additional energy gain of 10.32% compared to one without an AOMH module.”
The researchers concluded by saying that ROI may be further improved in proportionately bigger systems. “The reference parameters/values considered for the presented work are initial values to start with and thus need fine-tuning based on crop yield and experience in nearer future,” they pointed out.

Seng signed an agreement with Slovenian utility Holding Slovenske elektrarne (HSE) for the construction of the plants along the highway, as well as several PV projects in the Primorska and Karst regions. Overall, the arrays will have a combined capacity of around 20 MW.
“Electricity consumption is increasing year by year, while Slovenia's self-sufficiency is falling for the third year in a row,” said Slovenian Minister for the Environment Bojan Kumer. “This is also why Slovenia needs more intensive investments in renewable energy sources. We want to make the procedures for deploying renewable energy facilities in these areas simpler and faster.”
Large-scale PV has thus far struggled to gain much development traction in Slovenia, with only a few projects being announced in recent years, due to restrictions on land use. The difficulty of identifying suitable surfaces has pushed developers to become creative.
Other countries are currently seeking to develop PV projects along highways in order to maximize land use. These include Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, South Korea, Israel, and France.
Slovenia could potentially add 258 MW of new solar capacity in 2022, according to new figures from the Slovenian Photovoltaic Association (SPA). The country installed 194 MW of solar in the first three quarters of 2022, according to its distribution system operator, SODO. Almost all capacity was added in the residential sector.
The SPA estimates that the country will reach 724 MW of cumulative capacity by the end of this year. The analysts said they also expect demand from the residential sector to continue to grow in 2023.

Austrian energy supplier Burgerland Energie has started building a 300 MWh storage project based on the “Organic SolidFlow” technology developed by Germany-based specialist CMBlu.
The system is based on high-performance organic energy storage molecules. The material used is lignin, which can be sourced as a by-product from pulp mills. It is filled into two separate tanks and combined for a biochemical reaction in a special unit.
The material is organic, non-flammable, non-explosive, and can live through more than 10,000 charging cycles. The flow battery system has a multi-cell stack design and is only really suitable for stationary storage applications, but it is easily scalable to the gigawatt level.
The project is located in Schattendorf, Burgenland, eastern Austria, and is connected to a hybrid photovoltaic wind power plant. With the construction of the storage facility, the technology will be used in the field for the first time.
“One could have made it easy for oneself and rely on lithium-ion storage,” said Burgerland Governor Hans Peter Doskozil. “But that would not have fitted in with our attitude that we want to generate energy from natural and fair resources. Storage solutions, where we accept the exploitation of mines and other continents, are not the social image that we will accept in the course of an energy transition. That's why we chose a research collaboration with CMBlu to achieve and build a European model.”
Stephan Sharma, CEO of Burgenland Energie, said the goal is to supply electricity from wind and sun around the clock. He also warned that there is always the danger of under and over-coverage with a lot of photovoltaics and wind power on the grid.
“To compensate for this for an energy-independent system, we need a storage volume of around 300 MWh by 2030,” he added.
The storage system is tested directly at the hybrid power plant. Burgenland Energie completed the 15 MW photovoltaic system at the beginning of the year. The “Organic-SolidFlow” battery connected to the solar park is initially located as a “battery lab” in a 40-foot, air-conditioned and location-independent container. The other batteries will then be installed at different locations.
CMBlu was among the winners of the 2018 pv magazine Annual Award for its organic flow battery tech.

Reduced shunt resistance is associated with multiple forms of module degradation and failure, including hotspots and potential-induced degradation.
A group of scientists led by Ireland’s University College Cork looked to further investigate the relationship between shunt resistance and other electrical characteristics of a solar cell, such as maximum power, fill-factor, open circuit voltage and short circuit current – with the aim of developing a model that can spot cell degradation before it has advanced to the point of causing major performance loss or safety issues.
The group worked with multicrystalline silicon solar cells, designing a system that allowed them to place a resistor between the p and n junction of the cell, and thus control its shunt resistance. The experimental setup is described in full in the paper “Experimentally derived models to detect onset of shunt resistance degradation in photovoltaic modules,” published in Energy Reports.
After testing five cells under various combinations of shunt resistance, illumination and other factors, the group found that maximum power, open circuit voltage, and fill factor were all directly affected by changes to the shunt resistance, while short circuit current was not affected. The work shows that once shunt resistance decreased to around 100 ohms per square centimeter, corrective action needs to be taken.
Using the figures from its experiments the group developed models to detect decreasing shunt resistance. “These models can be easily applied to detect the onset of critical PV degradation or failure caused by shunt resistance degradation and are suitable for implementation in online condition monitoring systems,” the group said.
The group also suggests that future work could move towards classifying module degradation based on the calculated shunt resistance loss.

The launch of the Bungarribee Community Battery at Blacktown in Sydney marks the start of an Endeavour Energy trial that aims to transform the way solar energy is stored in neighborhoods with a high concentration of rooftop PV, and to also cost effectively increase the amount of clean energy that goes into the grid.
The battery trial, which is expected to continue for at least 12 months across the Endeavour network, will involve 10 community batteries with a total capacity of up to 640 kW, serving about 350 customers.
Endeavour Chief Executive Officer Guy Chalkley said the initiative promises to change the way residents consume and store energy, leading to “substantial” cost savings and a more stable energy grid during peak times.
Chalkley said the community batteries will deliver direct benefits for customers and community, helping residents to harness, share and reuse the green energy collected from rooftop solar, whether they have solar, own their home, or are renting.
“It is an exciting innovation that will see our customers both be a part of, and benefit from the energy transition, whether they have rooftop solar or not, and whether they own their home or are renting,” he said.
The first of those batteries has now gone live with residents in Bungarribee able to ‘rent’ a portion of the community battery to virtually store and access neighbourhood solar energy for AUD 15 ($10.50) per month. They will then receive payments for the energy they store and/or use.
Endeavour said households connected to the battery can store up to 4 kWh of solar energy a day. A measurement device will record how much energy a participant has stored, and credits will be applied against their energy usage that day.
The company estimates that participants with solar will receive a payment of between $120 to $220 per year, and non-solar customers will earn between AUD 80 to AUD 120 per year.
Origin Energy will serve as Endeavour’s retail partner, providing the platform for customers to participate in the trial and will orchestrate the energy stored in the battery including dispatch to the wholesale market.
Endeavour, which owns, maintains and operates the electrical distribution network supplying 2.6 million people in households and businesses across Sydney’s Greater West, Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands the Illawarra and the South Coast, said Bungarribee is the ideal site for a community battery with 95% of households in the area having already installed rooftop solar.
