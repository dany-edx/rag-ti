Germany's Paxos has partnered with the TH Köln University of Applied Sciences to develop a solar roof tile that could be used to generate electricity and heat at the same time.
The photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) tile's appearance barely differs from conventional roof tiles, which could make them attractive for homeowners. Paxos and TH Köln fabricated a tile prototype to test its temperature, walkability, high resistance to environmental influences, and safety. They also analyzed the glass to minimize optical losses through reflection or scattering.
They tested the prototype in a testing facility equipped with microinverters and an air heat pump.
“Thanks to the adjustments we made to the actual roof tile, the physical properties and also the energy yield have been significantly improved. The system was thus ready for continuous use under real conditions,” explained Christian Dick, project manager at TH Köln.
Performance tests started under real conditions in October. The system shows comparable values in terms of electrical performance as a reference system with conventional, elevated solar modules.
“An air duct for cooling the solar cells was integrated into the solar roof tile, which improves the working point, just like the rear ventilation in conventional systems,” Dick said. “Our data shows that correspondingly comparable electrical performance is to be expected. According to him, initial data also showed an increase in the coefficient of performance of the heat pump by around a quarter, depending on the heat requirement and the prevailing weather conditions.
TH Köln said the results show that the solar roof tile can also make a contribution to the heating supply of a building, increasing the overall efficiency of the system.
“Many roof areas in Germany are not used to generate energy – this would be an important building block for the success of the energy transition,” said Julian Münzberg, a project manager at Paxos. “We would like to create an offer for the listed building and for people who have previously avoided solar because of the optics.”
Paxos has already sold the patents for the solar roof tile to an undisclosed photovoltaic manufacturer. It will take over series production. Paxos is also behind the PV roof tile that Meyer Burger will sell and is currently putting it into series production.

The construction contractor said the new facility is 100% powered by a 670 kW rooftop PV array and hydrogen fuel cells. The hydrogen is provided either by external suppliers or via a 30 kW electrolyzer energized by excess solar. The hydrogen is stored in two 900 Nm3 tanks. The facility will mainly make temporary steel structures for offshore wind farms.
Plug Power has announced an agreement with FreezPak Logistics to provide fuel cells, hydrogen storage, and fueling infrastructure to nine additional sites and nearly 400 lift trucks. “Plug will support 11 customer sites across the US, including the three sites already in operation,” said the company. It has also teamed up with Olin Corp. to build a 15-ton-per-day hydrogen plant in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. The Louisiana plant joins Plug Power's national network of hydrogen plants in various stages of planning and construction in New York, Tennessee, Georgia, Texas, and California.
Tokyo Institute of Technology researchers have developed a chemically stable catalyst for the synthesis of ammonia from green hydrogen, improving metal nitride complexes by introducing aluminum into the lanthanum nitride (LaN) lattice. La−Al metallic bonds (La−Al−N) prevent lanthanum atoms from reacting with moisture. “The catalytic activity did not degrade after exposure to air and moisture,” wrote the researchers in “Approach to Chemically Durable Nickel and Cobalt Lanthanum-Nitride-Based Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis,” which was recently published in Angewandte Chemie. They aim to address rare-earth nitride complexes' chemical sensitivity to air and moisture to improve their catalytic performance. The La-Al-N support – along with the active metals, such as nickel and cobalt (Ni, Co) – was able to produce NH3 at rates similar to that with conventional metal nitride catalysts. “Kinetic analysis and isotopic experiment showed that La−Al−N is responsible for N2 absorption and activation despite substantial Al being introduced into its lattice because the local coordination of the lattice N remained largely unchanged,” said the researchers.
Air Liquide, Chevron, LyondellBasell, and Uniper have announced plans to collaborate on a joint study that will evaluate and potentially advance the development of a hydrogen and ammonia production facility along the US Gulf Coast. 
Nikola has revealed plans to develop up to 60 hydrogen dispensing stations by 2026, by taking advantage of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). “The act is expected to provide significant benefits to Nikola through production and investment tax credits, direct pay provisions, and other incentives that are expected to lower the cost of hydrogen,” said the company.
Baker Hughes has invested GBP 12 million ($13.54 million) in Levidian, valuing its business at GBP 130 million. “The cash injection will enable the further scale up of Levidian's business, including both LOOP, Levidian's decarbonization device, and graphene production capacities at its Cambridge headquarters,” said the company.
The Belgian government has proposed a revision of the country's federal hydrogen strategy. The planned proposed modifications include plans to establish a national hydrogen council.

According to a document in the Turkish official journal, the solar module manufacturer has four years to build the factory, which will produce everything from silicon ingots to finished panels. The support package also includes value-added tax (VAT) exemptions and custom duty exemptions for imports of raw materials.
Smart Solar Technologies owns and operates a 1.2 GW solar panel factory in Gebze, around 65 km southeast of Istanbul, according to its own website. The facility produces bifacial monocrystalline PERC modules with half-cut cells.
“These incentives provided by the state are not actually a facilitating factor for investment,” Solarbaba's founder, Ates Ugurel, told pv magazine. “If we examine in detail, all incentives are given after the investment is completed and the production facility is opened. But of course, it will provide financial comfort for the investing company in the medium and long term.”
Kalyon Solar Technologies currently runs a 1 GW vertically integrated solar module factory in Turkey. The $400 million vertically integrated fab was inaugurated in August.

The government said it hopes to allocate around 13 GW of new renewable generating capacity in procurement exercises to be held up to 2027.
Around 4.5 GW of the planned capacity will be assigned to PV plants with capacities above 1 MW, while another 4.5 GW of capacity will be used for solar arrays below 1 MW in size. The auctions will also aim to support the deployment of 3 GW of onshore wind capacity, 180 MW of hydropower capacity, 300 MW of agricultural biogas, and 660 MW of landfill gas.
In auctions to be held this year, the Polish authorities hope to contract 34.08 million MWh with a budget of PLN 14.37 billion ($2.9 billion). The government will auction off 89.9 million MWh with a budget of PLN 40.78 billion in 2023, and 44.58 million MWh with a budget of PLN 17 billion in 2024.
The Polish authorities aim to allocate 75.9 million MWh in the 2025 auctions and 76 million MWh of capacity in 2026, with respective budgets of PLN 31.0 billion and PLN 24.8 billion. In 2027, the government will 76 million MWh with a budget of PLN 28.8 billion.
The government said that the renewable energy auctions it has held thus far will enable the deployment of around 11.5 GW of new generating capacity. In the latest auctions, held in December, the Polish Energy Regulatory Office allocated around 870 MW of PV capacity.
Poland's installed solar capacity surpassed 10 GW in May and is expected to reach 12 GW by the end of this year, according to a new report by the Institute for Renewable Energy (IEO). So far this year, the Eastern European country has installed around 3.3 GW of new PV systems. The Polish PV market is expected to grow strongly in the current decade, reaching 30 GW of installed capacity by the end of 2030, according to the IEO.

It relies on two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (RPP), which are known for their excellent stability.
The scientists said they were able to achieve a “highly ordered” passivation layer by gauging the deposition rate of the RP phase perovskite, which has a direct influence on its crystallographic orientation.
“We demonstrate the use of a highly oriented butylammonium RP perovskite as a surface passivation layer with bottom-up growth on the bulk perovskite absorber layer via vacuum deposition,” they explained. “In this process, the crystal formation time directly affects the crystallographic orientation of the passivation layer.”
They built the cell with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA), methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite layer, the RPP passivation layer, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a zinc-oxide (ZnO) layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
They said the 2D perovskite layer passivates the bulk perovskite defects and promotes charge transport efficiency. The champion cell designed with this configuration achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.4%, which the academics described as the highest ever achieved for perovskite solar cells formed by vacuum deposition.
They described the cell in “A vertically oriented two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper phase perovskite passivation layer for efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science.
“Our findings provide a new perspective toward further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells by mitigating nonradiative recombination pathways in perovskites,” they said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/21/underground-heat-exchanger-to-cool-down-solar-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 21, 2022",Underground heat exchanger to cool down solar panels,"Researchers at the University of Alcalá in Spain have developed a cooling technique for solar modules that uses an underground, single–phase, closed-loop heat exchanger circuit that acts as a natural heat sink.
“Our analyses, made for various types of residential and commercial installations, show that the system is economically viable with investment amortization periods that range between five and 10 years,” researcher Ignacio Valiente Blanco told pv magazine.
The cooling technique involves the application of a heat exchanger onto the back side of a solar panel to remove excess heat. This heat is transferred underground by a coolant fluid that is refrigerated by another U-shape heat exchanger introduced in a borehole at a depth of 15 meters, filled with natural water from the aquifer in the underground.
“The cooling system needs extra energy to activate the pump of the coolant,” the researchers explained. “As it is a closed-circuit, the potential energy difference between the bottom of the borehole and the solar panel does not impact the power consumption of the cooling system.”
The scientists tested the cooling system at an off-grid PV installation, which they described as representative of a typical solar farm with single–axis tracking systems. The array consists of two 270 W modules supplied by Spain's Atersa. They feature a temperature coefficient of –0.43% per degree Celsius. 
The heat exchanger of the solar panel is mainly composed of a set of six plastically deformed, flattened U-shaped copper tubes, each measuring 15 mm in diameter. The tubes are all thermally isolated by polyethylene foam and are connected to common 18-mm-diameter inlet and outlet collectors. The research group used using a constant coolant flow rate of 3 l/min or 1.8 l/min per square meter of solar panel.
The experiment showed that the cooling tech could reduce the operating solar module temperature by between 13 C and 17 C. It also improved module performance by around 11%, which means that during an entire day, the cooled panel would provide 152 Wh more than its uncooled counterpart, according to the study.
The academics introduced the cooling system in “Efficiency Improvement of Photovoltaic Solar Modules by Cooling Using an Underground Heat Exchanger,” which was recently published in the Journal of Solar Energy Engineering.
“With the necessary investment, the system is perfectly usable in conventional installations,” said Valiente Blanco.

It said the new product is suitable for large-scale arrays abnd rooftop solar applications. It is certified according to the IEC61215 and 61730 standards.
The Lion series includes five different panels with power ratings of 375 W to 395 W, and efficiencies ranging from 20.59% to 21.68%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 44.2 V and 45.2 V and the short-circuit current is between 10.78 A and 11.06 A.
The panels feature a junction box with an IP 68 rating and a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy. Both sides of the modules are covered with 2.0 mm tempered and low iron glass. They have an operating temperature of between -40 C and 85 C, and a temperature coefficient is -0.24 % per degree Celsius.
The panels can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V. The manufacturer offers a 30-year power output guarantee for 91.25% of the initial yield.
“With bifaciality factor up to 90% (compared to 70% industry standard modules), Lion modules gain up to 20% more energy yield, in low-light conditions, in the morning an evening hours and with cloudy skies,” the manufacturer said. “Owing to N-type technology the power losses are considerably decreased and there are No PID & No LID effects delivering lowest LCOE.”

The transformation of the Thorpe Marsh thermal power station, which has been disused since 1994, would use its 1.45 GW connection to the UK National Grid to get power from North Sea wind farms into the network.
“Thorpe Marsh’s existing grid connection and its proximity to where much of the energy that will be produced by the east coast’s growing portfolio of wind farms will come ashore makes it an excellent location for this project,” said Lewis Stokes, senior community relations manager at Banks Group.
The first phase of the project would be to progressively remove and reclaim the power station’s former ash disposal area. Banks Group is set to begin public consultations over the plans in the coming months. If approved, the project is expected to break ground in 2024.
In other news, independent energy specialist Balance Power and renewables developer TagEnergy have partnered to build, own and operate 500 MW of battery energy storage system projects across the United Kingdom.
An investment of more than GBP 300 million ($335.7 million) will be required to deliver the projects over the next four years.
The partnership will see TagEnergy become the majority owner of the projects, expanding its current portfolio of more than 300 MW of ready-to-build or under-construction battery projects. The agreement will also deliver Balance Power’s first operating energy storage projects.
Earlier this month, Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) and UK renewable energy company Tyler Hill Partners created a platform to develop, build and operate up to 1GW/2GWh of battery energy storage system projects in the United Kingdom.

Volt Solar Tile, a Leeson Group subsidiary, says its Australian-designed building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roof tile has the highest wattage of any solar tile on the global market, with a maximum power output of 115 W and a solar efficiency of up to 19.3%.
Peter Leeson, managing director of Leeson Group and the director of Volt Solar Tile, said the Volt Planum and Lodge mono PERC solar tiles are the first in the world that can generate the same amount of energy as a standard PV panel.
“It’s the highest efficiency solar tile in the world to date,” he said. “We’ve reached 19.3% efficiency. “With Volt, we’ve made solar tiles affordable and accessible for homeowners who want clean and affordable energy to power their homes.”
Leeson said Volt has designed the “highest wattage, highest quality, and lowest cost solar tile available … Volt solar tiles are a quarter the cost of its competitors’ integrated solar roofs and half the cost of other solar tiles systems … a 5 kW Volt system costs AUD 12,000 ($7,510) fully installed after STC (small-scale technology certificate) rebates. We’re coming close to or meeting the price of your premium quality solar power systems but it’s obviously a lot more than your standard systems.”
The Volt Solar Tile range includes the 115 W Planum module, which has an 18.8% solar efficiency and the 105 W Lodge solar tile with 19.3% efficiency. Both tiles benefit from metal wrap-through (MWT) cell technology and a busbar-free design, which decreases the shading area by up to 3%.
The tiles, which weigh in at 10 kg, feature a black aluminum frame, matte-black glass, and a built-in cable containment system to eliminate the need for live cables. The solar tiles are designed to tie in with adjacent roof tiles and feature their own drainage channels and gutters.
They are backed with a 30-year performance warranty and 15-year product warranty. They have already secured TUV certification and Volt said it is waiting on certification from the Clean Energy Council (CEC) for its approved product list. Leeson said the plan is to eventually move production from China to Australia.
“By late 2023 we’re hoping to have assembly set up and operating here in Australia,” he said. “From there, we will be looking at setting up an actual manufacturing plant here. The aim is to be financially closing on a manufacturing plant in 2024 and at the end of 2024, start of 2025 actually be making the solar modules here.”
The Volt solar tiles will be officially launched at the All-Energy Australia event in Melbourne next week, but Leeson said they are already available in Australia, with the first installations expected to commence in the coming weeks.
Leeson said that distribution agreements will open opportunities for the solar tiles to be sold in 85 countries, including Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. These countries will provide Volt with an initial potential market of 250 MW per year, said Leeson.

According to Law 72/2022, the developers that won Portugal’s solar auctions in 2019, 2020 and 2021 will see their remuneration go up in line with inflation.
In 2019, French developer Akuo won a project with a solar tariff of €0.0147 ($0.014)/kWh. This marked a new world record at the time. In 2020, the record was broken again, with a winning bid of $0.0132/kWh.
The Portuguese government will also introduce a 12-month extension of the period in which selected projects can sell electricity at spot market prices, instead of the awarded tariff. The law says that the “financing of these projects was unfeasible,” due to the war in Ukraine, the scarcity of raw materials, rising equipment prices, and global inflation.
Other measures introduced promise to speed up solar installations in the country. The licensing of projects will be simplified, with projects below 1 MW of capacity to be exempted from licensing decisions. Instead, they will only be subject to a control procedure at the municipal level.
Projects bigger than 1 MW will no longer have to submit construction feasibility studies. Project owners should receive answers within eight to 30 days after the submission of paperwork. The local authorities will also be compensated at a rate of €13,500 per megawatt of solar installed in their area. The government’s environmental fund will pay for the incentive from Jan. 1, 2023.
