According to the company, the carport can host all types and sizes of solar panels. “We started developing the system a few years ago when the average size of the solar modules was 1,755 mm x 1,038 x 35, mm and power output was 300 W,” said Yordanov. “Nowadays, our carport system can host modules with dimensions of up to 2,280 mm x 1,133 mm x 35mm.”
The panels can be installed on the carport with a tilt angle ranging from 5 to 30 degrees and in either a landscape or portrait configuration.

The carport is made with aluminum alloy of the type AL6005-T5 and relies on a longitudinal sink rail that is able to catch water from the horizontal gap between the solar module. “To keep the water out of the sink as much as possible the solar panels are installed at a distance of 1 mm,” Yordanov stated “The fixed way of the solar panel is designed to be fixed from the bottom of the module itself with a customized clamp, which makes installation easier.”
The system is scalable in a MW-sized configuration. “We use rail connects and rail slices which allows more solar modules to be installed,” Yordanov explained. “Each carport can host a different number of modules, depending on the project's size and characteristics.”
The system can be grid-connected, linked to storage, or used for the recharging of electric vehicles. “The cost of a basic system hosting two vehicles ranges from $1,300 to $1,350,” Yordanov concluded.

The plan includes the construction of 40 new on-shore high-voltage stations across all Dutch provinces.
The company said that more grid capacity is needed to address the continuous growth of wind and solar energy, as well as that of electromobility and heat pumps. “The capacity of the power network must be doubled over the next 10 years in order to meet the climate ambitions and the sharply increasing energy demand in the Netherlands,” it said in a statement.
The new plan is part of an overall scheme that also comprises investments of €9 million to expand the country's off-shore grid capacity and enable the connection of new wind farms located in the North Sea.
The company, which also operates in Germany, currently operates the 380 and 220 kV high-voltage grid throughout the Netherlands and its interconnections with neighboring countries. The Dutch government, which is considering privatizing Tennet, is convinced that a cross-border operator can become a driving force for the Netherlands to emerge stronger from the energy transition, as an increasing share of electricity from renewable energy sources must be transported over greater distances.
In January 2019, Tennet and Enexis warned for the first time there was very limited capacity for more solar in the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel. Three months later, the two companies said they would boost the connection capacity available for solar over the next few years, particularly in the country’s less densely populated east.

Located at the 600 MW Reuter-West coal-fired power station in Berlin, the facility is scheduled to come online in April 2023.
“We actually have an optimal fossil free and future-proof way of providing heat for our Berlin customers,” the company said. “When there is a surplus of wind energy available this surplus can be converted via the power-to-heat plant on site and then stored in the buffer.”
The plant is 45 m high and has a capacity of 56 million liters. It will store district heating water at a temperature of 98 C and, according to Vattenfall, will use renewable electricity coming from the grid.
A 400 m pipeline will link the storage tank to four pumps ensuring that hot water reaches the tank. “If hot water is added at the top, the same amount of cold water is taken out at the bottom,” the utility said on its website. “So only the quantity ratio between hot and cooler water in the storage facility changes but not the total amount of water.”
At the beginning of July, Vattenfall began filling the tank for the first time and used partially desalinated and degassed water to reduce wear and tear in the Berlin city heating network. Filling operations should last approximately two months.

In this kind of PV device, which is also known as Schottky junction solar cell, the band necessary for charge separation is provided by an interface placed between a metal and a semiconductor. In the proposed device and ideal band structure, the discrepancy in the work function (WF) between one of the electrodes and the semiconductor separates the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. “Once the generated carriers travel to the opposite electrode, power generation can be realized,” the scientists explained.
WS2 is a member of the family of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which the scientists said are ideal for near-invisible solar cells, due to their suitable band gaps in the visible light range and highest absorption co-efficiency per thickness.

In the development of solar cells, the researchers sought to avoid interface impurity that they said may be the cause of undesired surface recombination, which would, in turn, reduce the separation efficiency of carriers at the interface barrier, thus affecting the device's open-circuit voltage.
The ITO–WS2 junction was fabricated by sputtering ITO on quartz substrate and the WS2 monolayer was grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). ” The work function of the transparent ITO electrodes was modulated by a thin metal film coating without sacrificing the high transparency of ITO,” the group said.
The solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency that is 1,000 times higher than that of a reference device using a normal ITO electrode. “Large-scale fabrication of the solar cell was also investigated, which revealed that a simple size expansion with large WS2 crystals and parallel long electrodes could not improve the total power (PT) obtained from the complete device even with an increase in the device area,” the academics said, noting that the cell has the potential to achieve transparency of 79%.
They presented the cell technology in the paper “Fabrication of near-invisible solar cell with monolayer WS2“, published in scientific reports. “These findings can contribute to the study of TMD-based near-invisible solar cells from fundamentals to truly industrialized stages,” they said.

Indian developer Acme Group has announced plans to invest INR 52,474 crore ($6.61 billion) to build a green hydrogen and green ammonia project in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
It signed the initial agreement with the state government during the Tamil Nadu Investment Conclave. The project will produce green ammonia through the ammonia synthesis loop process with electrolysis-based hydrogen.
Acme will build a 5 GW solar PV plant to power 1.5 GW of electrolysis capacity for green hydrogen production and 1.1 million tonnes of ammonia synthesis loop.
“This will be the largest such plant in India and perhaps one of the largest in the world. It will produce green hydrogen and ammonia, which will help de-carbonize sectors such as fertilizers, power, refining, and steel, among others,” said Acme Group Chairman Manoj K Upadhyay. “The project requires four ingredients – solar radiation, access to port, availability of land and skilled resources. Tamil Nadu offers all of these.”
Sandeep Kashyap, COO of Acme Group, said, that the company is willing to work with the government to help build the project, in addition to “an ecosystem of smaller units.”

The last set of figures published by the International Renewable Energy Agency indicated the central Asian nation soared from just 4 MW of grid connected solar capacity at the end of 2020 to 104 MW a year later.
The project announced this week by Total Eren will almost double the latter figure single-handedly, with the developer rating the site as having 131 MW of peak generation capacity.
The Tutly solar project, around 100km west of Samarkand, is Total Eren's first to consist entirely of bifacial panels, the developer said in a press release.
The solar field is expected to generate 270 GWh of clean power annually, enough to satisfy the needs of 140,000 Uzbeks, Total Eren said, and created 300 construction jobs and 15 permanent roles.
Uzbek president Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed a deal with Total Eren to develop the project in October 2018, during a visit to France, alongside the Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade of Uzbekistan and state utility National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan.
The power company has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement as off-taker of the electricity to be generated by Tutly.
Financial close on the project was reached in August 2021 with EU lender the European Investment Bank providing a €43.7 million loan and the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and French state-controlled development financier Proparco each adding loans of around €21.8 million.
French power company TotalEnergies has a 25% stake in Total Eren.
Engineering, construction, and procurement services for the site were performed by the Metka EGN unit of Greek business Mytilineos SA.
Commenting on the obstacles overcome during development of the site, Total Eren executive VP and head of business development Fabienne Demol said: “Despite many unexpected challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the increase in solar module prices, and [in] transportation costs, we are proud to have delivered on our commitment today.”
The Uzbek government wants to install 12 GW of solar and wind power capacity by 2030 so a quarter of its power will come from renewables by that point.

A research team from Oregon State studied the potential of agricultural land to generate solar electricity to power electric vehicles along the state’s highways. They found that agrivoltaic systems placed in adjacent proximity to the highway can be useful in rural areas, which is also where electric charging stations are most needed.
The study, recently published in Scientific Reports, looked at how agrivoltaic technology can be used to improve EV charging infrastructure to reduce range anxiety, which is the worry about making it to the next charging point.  In their analysis, the team envisioned a scenario that had the highest traffic demand and the lowest photovoltaic generation, and the results showed that agrivoltaics could play a role in charging station infrastructure development.
In the study, a total of 231 rural highway access points were identified that had sufficient land area to service EV charging stations with energy generated by agrivoltaic installations. These areas are indicated with black circles Figure 1.

The team discovered that to meet the conservative estimate of EV charging station demand at 86% of highway access points through Oregon, 12,000 acres (18.75 square miles) of land would be required. Of the 231 highway access points identified for agrivoltaics, 220 (95%) have a distance between them that is less than 17 miles. The researchers looked at earlier research conducted in Croatia that indicated that people have less range anxiety if charging stations are less than 3.1 miles apart. And other research shows that gas stations tend to be 2.5 to 18 miles apart. The Oregon State team used this range as a basis in their scenario.
Based on the number of vehicles registered in the state of Oregon and how much carbon they emit each year, the team estimated that the potential for carbon reduction through agrivoltaic-powered EV charging stations is about 3.1 million tons or the equivalent to 673,915 vehicles removed from the road each year, if their approach were fully implemented.
Overall the Oregon researchers showed that servicing rural EV charging stations with agrivoltaics next to the highway is feasible, requiring only 3% of total land supply to power 86% of rural highway access points throughout the state.
As rural areas often lack the grid infrastructure to support charging stations, agrivoltaics enable the shift in energy production to the point of use. Oregon currently has 670 EV charging stations, and the researchers’ scenario adds another 231 charge points located in close enough proximity to reduce or eliminate range anxiety. Additionally, the team estimates that implementation of this approach could reduce annual carbon emissions from passenger vehicle use in Oregon by 21%.

Maxeon Solar Technologies, a major PV module producer based in Singapore, revealed the results of a third-party energy payback performance evaluation of its Maxeon 3 panels in its 2021 annual sustainability report. 
Energy payback is the period required for a renewable energy system to generate the same amount of energy that was used to produce the system itself. The assessment considers the cumulative energy demand over all the life cycle stages of solar panels and considers local grid efficiencies for different global locations. 
The test found that Maxeon 3 solar panels had an energy payback period ranging from 0.13 to 0.45 years for ground mounted modules, and 0.27 to 0.92 years for a residential rooftop system. For ground mounted panels, the energy payback period can be as little as 47.5 days. 
Spread over the 40-year performance warranty on the panels, the energy output exceeds the input more than 100 times over its lifetime, marking a significant milestone for the sustainability of PV technology.
“Maxeon strives to maintain its sustainability leadership position in the solar industry by continuing our development of more efficient, sustainable and longer-lasting panels that can ensure easy access to solar for all. As more countries and corporations pledge to achieve net-zero emissions, renewable energy will play a pivotal role in enabling this transition. Maxeon is delighted to be a key player in the race to achieving net-zero by supporting the growing demand for solar energy coupled with social and governance best practices.” Jeff Waters, Chief Executive Officer of Maxeon Solar Technologies
Sustainability Report 2021
Maxeon shared in its 2021 sustainability report that it delivered 899 MW of clean energy in 2021, namely its solar panels. The company’s impact led to over 52 million tons of carbon emissions abatement that year.
It committed to decreasing both the energy intensity and carbon intensity of manufacturing its panels from 2020 levels by 10% in 2025 and 20% in 2030. It also seeks to cut water use by 5% and waste creation by 20% by 2030.
For social goals in its ESG report, the company reported an industry-leading low rate of workplace safety incidences, and it has zero cases of non-compliance with human rights laws. It seeks to boost its traceability even further by 2025 by putting its supply information on blockchain, making supplier data is available within 4 hours of inquiry.
In 2021 the manufacturer introduced the Air panel, a thin, flexible module designed to adhere to low weight load bearing commercial roofs, which the company said represents a 4 GW market unserved by traditional solar panels that are too heavy for such structures.
The panel manufacturer also announced it joined the Singapore Low Carbon Network as an inaugural member as part of PwC Singapore’s Asia Pacific Centre for Sustainability Excellence. It formed new partnerships with Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore and National University of Singapore for continued advancement of its technology.
“With less than ten years left to meet the UN’s 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, renewable energy will be a key engine powering both Singapore’s and the world’s decarbonization agenda. We warmly welcome Maxeon Solar Technologies to the United Nations Global Compact and look forward to working alongside them to take decisive action for the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Esther Chang, Executive Director, Global Compact Network Singapore.
