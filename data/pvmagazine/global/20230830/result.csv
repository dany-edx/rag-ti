India will add 20 GW of annual renewables capacity in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. This is 33% more than the 15 GW per annum installed in the previous two fiscal years, according to CRISIL Ratings. Around 16 GW of the 20 GW total in the current fiscal period will be solar capacity.  
The analysts stated that the robust pace of implementing renewable energy projects during the current and upcoming fiscal years will be supported by a substantial project pipeline, amounting to 50 GW (86% solar and 14% wind) as of June 2023.
Several driving factors contribute to this, including the resolution of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) issue, the deferral of the requirement to procure modules from the Approved Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) list, declining PV module prices, and simplified access to both debt and equity capital.
Renewable energy growth is anticipated to be upheld over the medium term, facilitated by favorable policies, substantial investor interest, and sound financial profiles. These factors will contribute to the stable credit quality of companies operating within the renewable energy sector, as observed within the CRISIL Ratings portfolio.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/30/australia-launches-600-mw-2-4-gwh-tender/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 30, 2023",Australia launches 600 MW/2.4 GWh tender,"From pv magazine Australia
The tender will target 600 MW of dispatchable capacity with the equivalent of four hours of duration, or 2.4 GWh, across Victoria and South Australia.
The bids are among the first to be launched as part of the federal government’s Capacity Investment Scheme, which was unveiled last year. The scheme will underwrite new zero-emissions storage in Australia, including big batteries, hydrogen, and pumped hydro, to incentivise and accelerate projects as coal plants rapidly retire.
The scheme will see the federal government pay revenue shortfalls based on a pre-agreed floor value, guaranteeing projects baseline income. If revenues exceed an agreed price ceiling, the government will take a share of profits.
In terms of the Victorian and South Australian bids, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) will conduct the two-stage tender process. In a joint release, the federal, South Australian and Victorian governments noted the draft term sheets and detailed tender timelines will be released in the coming weeks, with registration for the tender to open in September.
Projects that have reached Final Investment Decision since the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) was announced in December 2022 are also eligible for support, the governments noted.
Projects will be assessed on their ability to support reliability at the lowest cost while ensuring increased capacity is delivered in both jurisdictions. The announcement also pointed out the states are interconnected, meaning both jurisdictions will benefit from storage on either side of the border.
The Victorian and South Australian tender appears to have been fast tracked, with the federal government formerly flagging announcement dates in October.
This tender is additional to an expanded tender currently running in New South Wales. In June, it was announced that a partnership between New South Wales and the Commonwealth governments would boost a 380 MW firming tender, organised as part of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, to 930 MW. The more than doubling of the tender target came as a result of Commonwealth Capacity Investment Scheme funding, underwriting an additional 550 MW of firmed capacity for New South Wales.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
Overall, the Capacity Investment Scheme is seekingto unlock an estimated AUD 10 billion ($6.6 billion) in private and public sector investment in new dispatchable storage and generation across Australia.
The national rollout of the Capacity Investment Scheme in 2024 will include more auctions in Victoria and South Australia.

World4Solar, a Nevada-based company, has developed a freestanding solar canopy for residential use.
The HelioWing is available in two base models: HelioWing 5 with 7.38 kWp and HelioWing 7 with 9.84 kWp. The canopy design can be customized with features like storage capacity or a carport with a built-in electric-vehicle charger. The modular energy systems come preassembled and preconfigured.
World4Solar said that the canopy should take a certified installer about six hours to install on a prepared foundation.
“We are excited about the trend for self-sustaining and energy efficient power for multi-unit residential and commercial installations,” says Marc Hofer, CEO of World4Solar. “Our contemporary décor design fits in with all environments, and its weatherproof solar covered roof provides lighting, shade and rain protection where needed.”

The HelioWing can be used grid-tied or off-grid. When connected to the power grid, in certain utility markets the system owner may be able to earn credits for the clean energy generated and exported. To operate off-grid, or to store electricity for later use, battery packs are available that can store energy up to 25 kWh or up to 100 kWh with an external battery module.
Two available Level 2 chargers per unit work with all electric vehicles and add 25 miles average of range per hour of charging.
HelioWing is waterproof rated and has an average 20-year life span. The system comes with a 10-year warranty.
World4Solar will be exhibiting at RE+ 2023 Expo, Sept. 11 to 14, 2023, in Las Vegas in the Kern Solar Structures booth #4161.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/30/google-to-sell-rooftop-solar-mapping-data/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 30, 2023",Google to sell rooftop solar mapping data,"Google announced it will sell application programming interfaces (API) datasets for the solar industry, empowering business operations with large, interactable data for understanding rooftop solar potential.
The Solar API contains key building, rooftop, shading, and panel configuration data covering over 320 million buildings in 40 countries, with the goal of helping accelerate the transition to clean, renewable, solar energy. The company said it expects to drive up to $100 million in revenues from sales of its API in the first year alone.
“By using the Solar API, solar businesses can improve the customer experience for interested property owners, create reliable project proposals without requiring an on-site visit, and expedite the overall installation process,” said Google.
Google is known in the solar industry for its Project Sunroof, a free application that helps homeowners understand their estimated bill savings potential for installing rooftop solar. The new Solar API builds on years of collaboration with industry leaders to develop datasets that fit their business needs.
The Solar API includes 3D dataset access for individual building data as well as for aggregated data for all buildings in a particular city or county.
Included in the Solar API is a Buildings Insights endpoint, which provides details of a building’s location, dimensions, and solar potential. It contains information like the size and slope of the roof and the modeled energy production of a rooftop array.
The API also contains a Data Layers endpoint, which produces granular details on raw solar information for the area surrounding a building. Data layers include shading and obstructions and the roof layout to assist detailed system placement and layout. The data can be used to create custom solar proposals and by software-as-a-service developers to automate the design of more efficient arrays.
A pilot project user and Solar API customer Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) used the API to create Suncle, an online rooftop solar energy simulation.
“By inputting an address, homeowners can locate their residence on the map, and adjust their electricity bill and solar installation size as they wish. They can find out installation costs, local subsidies available, cost savings, break even point, and how much impact their solar installation could have on reducing CO2, all in a few seconds. To get these figures without Suncle, they would need to have installers visit their house,” says Masami Jenkins, director, environment & social business design lab, TEPCO.
More information can be found on Google’s Solar API webpage and the related documentation page. A demo of the product can be found here.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/30/greenpeace-notes-widespread-greenwashing-among-fossil-fuel-companies/,"POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 30, 2023",Greenpeace notes widespread greenwashing among fossil fuel companies,"A new study published by Greenpeace found widespread use of misleading numbers and strategies in reporting on emissions and climate impacts among 12 of the largest oil companies with headquarters in Europe.
The study, titled Dirty Dozen: The climate greenwashing of 12 European Oil Companies, looks into financial statements published by six of the world’s largest oil companies – Shell, TotalEnergies, BP, Equinor, Eni, Repsol, and another six smaller players that still play a major role in the energy supply of their respective European markets – OMV, PKN Orlen, MOL Group, Wintershall Dea, Petrol Group, Ina Croatia.
These companies have enjoyed huge revenues over the past year, with their 2022 profits increasing by an average of 75% over the previous year. Despite this, new investments made by the companies increased on average by just over half that amount – 37%. And 92.7% of these investments were made in the continued extraction of fossil oil and gas.
This comes in spite of the common claim among large fossil fuel companies that higher profits are necessary to provide the means to finance a transition to renewable energy, which Greenpeace describes as “like eating more to have the energy for the diet.”
All 12 of the companies in the studies produced at least 98% of their energy in 2022 from fossil fuels, with an average of just 0.3% from renewable sources. And those which are making any investment in “low carbon” technologies are focused on offsetting and carbon capture – two strategies whose effectiveness in reducing emissions is in serious doubt.
The study also finds that while most of the companies involved have made a public commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, none has anything resembling a coherent strategy in place to achieve this.
“…no major oil company can show a comprehensible plan for a “net zero” in 2050. There is, if at all, a slow start in the 2020s, which is then miraculously supposed to lead to a rapid transformation after 2030. In other words, the solution to the climate problem is postponed to the future or to the next CEO,” the report stated.
The report also noted a range of strategies used by some of the 12 companies that seem designed to mislead the public over their commitment to emissions reduction. From creative definitions of what constitutes “low carbon” for investment, to simply misleading visual layouts – such as Shell placing “conventional fuels” in fourth place on a list of its energy portfolio, despite these accounting for more than 90% of its energy production.
Greenpeace calls for various measures to be put in place to change this situation, placing efforts to reduce demand for fossil fuels at the center of its proposal. “Similar to the coal sector, the focus should therefore be on a rapid economic and political downsizing of the oil and gas sector, on skimming profits, avoiding stranded assets and, above all, on a rapid reduction of oil and gas demand,” they state.
The report calls for a comprehensive demand reduction strategy to be put in place at EU level, including a ban on short distance flights and promotion of zero-carbon fuels in long distance aviation, noting that “The benefits of these new fuels must be independently confirmed in a life-cycle approach in order to exclude, for example, the use of biofuels, which can cause high climate damage along their production chain.”
Other industries earmarked for action include marine shipping – which also requires support for alternative clean fuels, and the petrochemical industry which should see restrictions on per capita consumption of plastic materials.
Greenpeace also states that, in combination with demand reduction, these measures can be accompanied supply side measures such as windfall tax on profits, a ranking of the most environmentally damaging fossil fuel supply chains, and a stop on exploration of new oil projects across EU territories and the North Sea.
Further, the report calls for increased regulations on international oil companies, including a general ban on advertising and much tighter reporting definitions to address greenwashing in public statements.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/30/new-model-to-assess-effects-of-shading-on-crops-in-agrivoltaic-projects/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 30, 2023",New model to assess effects of shading on crops in agrivoltaic projects,"An Italian-Swedish research team has investigated the impact of shading created at ground level by different agrivoltaic system configurations, which the scientists said is necessary for accurate crop yield estimations.
They noted that previous research has been mostly interested in assessing the impact of shading on solar module production or global horizontal irradiance (GHI) distribution, while their study is mostly intended to analyze the effects of shading on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and crop yield.
“The developed model can be used as a starting point for accurately estimating crop yields at any location under the most common agrivoltaic system designs,” they explained. “It considers the agricultural part of agrivoltaic systems and can be integrated with existing PV power models to analyze crop yield and power production.”
Via the Matlab software, the scientists created a model that considers three different agrivoltaic system configurations: with fixed structures; with single-axis trackers; and with double-axis tracking systems. They then utilized the PVsyst and SketchUp software to validate the shading factors of the proposed model, claiming that both tools alone are not able to calculate beam and diffuse shading factors on the ground.
The group tested the model at three different sites in Europe: Lanna in Sweden; Estrees-Mons in France; and Klingenberg in Germany. It calculated PAR by decomposing it into its diffuse and direct components. “This decomposition of PAR is critical in AV systems due to the variable shadings caused by the panels on the crops, creating a non-homogenous PAR/diffuse PAR distribution during the day,” it further explained.
The testing showed, the scientists said, that the proposed model exhibited “high accuracies” compared to PVsyst and SketchUp. “The light homogeneity and PAR reduction could vary significantly depending on AV system configurations, from 86 % to 95 % and 11 % to 22 %, respectively,” they further explained. “The two-axis AV system showed the highest light homogeneity and lowest yearly PAR reduction in Lanna. The light homogeneity index was 95.15 %, and the annual PAR reduction was 11.01 %.”
The researchers emphasized that the model could be easily adapted to other types of agrivoltaic system layouts.
Their findings are described in the study “Direct and diffuse shading factors modelling for the most representative agrivoltaic system layouts,” published in Applied Energy. The team comprises academics from the Mälardalen University in Sweden and the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Italy.
Other researchers at Mälardalen University recently investigated how to optimize electricity yields in agrivoltaic installations with vertically mounted bifacial PV modules. They developed a techno-economic optimization model that purportedly outlines the ideal design parameters for an agrivoltaic vertical PV system by combining climatological data with figures on expected solar power generation, shading distribution, water for irrigation, and agricultural yield.
Other scientists from Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore have also recently investigated different shade depth treatments on soybeans grown under an elevated agrivoltaic system in Monticelli d'Ongina, Italy.

They warned, however, that a series of challenges associated with high temperature requirements may represent a considerable barrier to their deployment.
“Retrofitting existing buildings with heat pumps is challenging, as temperature requirements for space heating and domestic water heating are significantly higher than in new buildings,” the research's lead author, Manuel Lämmle, told pv magazine. “Moreover, the existing heat distribution and transfer system should be ideally re-used. These systems sometimes have to be adapted to make them heat pump-ready.”
The scientists explained that the novelty of their work consists of a systematic analysis of the relationship between operating temperatures and HP performance based on data from field measurements. “The overall objective is to quantitatively assess the influence of heat source temperatures, maximum HP supply temperatures, and heat sink temperatures using statistical methods,” it explained.
The group stressed that HPs are currently not particularly suitable for reliably supplying heat at elevated temperatures above 60 C. In MFHs. however, required temperatures often lie between 60 C and 70 C, which means HPs have to work close to their water temperature operating limit (WTOL).
The academics highlighted that there are several HPs such as several brine/water or water/water models that can reach a WTOL of 65 C, as well as several outdoor air HPs that also achieve a WTOL of over 70 C.
“This leads to the conclusion that, while 80 % of HPs in the market are limited to temperatures below 60 C, there are 135 models available achieving temperatures of 70 C or higher,” they stressed. “Given the recent market trends toward R290 systems, it is likely that this distribution will see a considerable shift toward higher WOTL in the coming years.”
The group analyzed the performance of 58 HP systems installed in existing buildings considering HP type, specific heating demand, building type, year of construction, and heat-transfer system. It found that HPs may be successfully integrated into existing buildings, provided that careful planning is implemented on a case-by-case basis.
“Although existing buildings – especially when the existing radiator system is reused – require higher supply temperatures, the room temperature is not affected in properly dimensioned systems,” Lämmle explained. “Heat pumps are able to supply the required supply temperatures, although at a lower efficiency than with floor heating systems.”
According to the research team, there are several factors that should be taken into account to further reduce HP deployment. These are: economies of scale; standardization of heat pumps and systems; more experience in designing, optimizing, and operating the more complex and sensitive systems; and new technologies such as propane heat pumps and PVT collectors.
The academics described the model in the paper “Heat Pump Systems in Existing Multifamily Buildings: A Meta-Analysis of Field Measurement Data Focusing on the Relationship of Temperature and Performance of Heat Pump Systems,” published in Energy Technology.

The researchers said in “Experiences from seasonal Arctic solar photovoltaics (PV) generation- An empirical data analysis from a research infrastructure in Northern Finland” – which was recently published in Renewable Energy – that they conducted an analysis of solar PV data from an experimental setup situated in Oulu across four seasons between 2021 and 2022.
The system consists of 24 solar panels – 12 deployed vertically and 12 installed in a typical rooftop configuration with tilt angles ranging from 23 to 46 degrees. All panels have an output of 275 W, rely on 60 monocrystalline cells, and have an efficiency of 18%.
According to the report,  the best overall months for generating PV in the Finnish Arctic are June and July, while the best season is spring. In the winter season, the vertical PV outperformed the rooftop ones by 98.36% and in the autumn by 30.25%; while in the summer the rooftop panels outperformed the vertical one by 30.44% and in spring by 20.2%.
“Extreme weather and climatic conditions, significant variations in the day lengths leading to polar nights and days, sub-zero temperatures, snow, and significant seasonal temperature variations characterize the Arctic and subarctic regions,” the researchers stated, adding that the collected data provides accurate insights for future investments and improved predictability of the solar simulations.
As for the preferred tilt angle for the rooftop PV throughout the two years, the research has concluded that 28 degrees was the optimal one. According to the researchers, the panels with that tilt generated 3% more power than the others, in an annual comparison.
“It proved the increased potentiality of solar PV panel at this tilt angle to capture the maximum irradiation during the spring and summer seasons,” the paper explained. “The additional advantages of retaining lower tilt angles in the Arctic are the lesser mutual shading losses when the solar panels are in multiple rows, one behind another, allowing snow clearance at much faster rates.”
