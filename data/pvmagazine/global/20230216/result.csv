The National Grid said in a provisional auction document that a total of 5.78 GW were procured. Of the 6.12 GW of capacity in the auction, 94.42% of projects secured agreements for making supplies available at short notice.
The auction cleared at GBP 60 ($73.07)/kW per year on Tuesday, representing the second-highest clearing price thus far, after the record-breaking price of GBP 75/kW per year recorded last year. Battery energy storage projects accounted for 10.9% of the total awarded capacity, followed by 2.6 GW of gas-fired power plants and 1.4 GW of nuclear capacity.
About four-fifths of the capacity procured in the auction across 269 capacity market units (CMU) was from existing power assets, the auction results showed. Battery storage projects won 74 contracts, and most of that will come from newly built projects. Only 60 MW of the 627 MW of awarded capacity will come from existing generating CMU. Of the new build capacity that won contracts, 54%, or 568 MW, came from batteries, up from just 261 MWlast year.
Nearly a half of all battery projects have one-hour durations, while about 40% are two-hour systems. The list of winning storage developers includes Alkane Energy, Conrad Energy, Gore Street, Gresham House, Gridserve, Harmony, Infragreen, Pivot Power, Pulse Clean Energy, SMS Energy Services, SUSI Storage, and Tagenergy UK.
Britain’s key capacity auctions are usually held about four years in advance of the delivery date, in so-called T-4 auctions. Up to 15-year contracts are available for new-build capacity in these auctions, while existing capacity can only secure one-year contracts. Other auctions for a smaller amount of capacity, the so-called T-1 auctions, are usually held a year before delivery, with only one-year contracts up for grabs.

“The damage caused to PV systems by snowfall over the four years is equivalent to the power output of residential solar panels for approximately 75,000 households,” NITE said, noting that the combined capacity of the affected systems is approximately 30 MW.
NITE recorded 43 cases of snow and ice-related accidents in residential PV systems between 2018 and 2021. It said that the accidents often involved damage to the module frames. NITE noted that in some cases, the systems were deployed at a tilt angle of less than 0.6 degrees, which makes it more difficult for snow to slide off the panels.
The institute urges PV system owners to conduct regular site inspections, use surveillance cameras, and implement snow removal at early stages. They also suggest the creation of snow removal plans. 
“Creating a budget for snow removal may be a good move before project planning,” said NITE, which was presented much of its data in an open-access database.
In 2021, scientists at the University of Alberta in Canada presented a new set of parameters to improve short-term models to forecast the impact of snow on PV installations. The parameters include the warming effect of irradiance on the backs of panels, thermal capacity, and irradiance through snow.

The commission is requesting the imposition of financial sanctions on the three member states for failing to turn the EU Renewable Energy Directive into national legislation.
Member states were required to incorporate the EU directives into national law by June 30, 2021. In May 2022, the commission said it sent reasoned opinions to Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Portugal, and Romania for failing to provide it with “clear and precise information in relation to which national provisions transpose each provision of the directive.”
It also sent provisions to Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg for having “only partially notified” national measures. The commission gave each country two months to comply with the transposition obligation.
“To date, Croatia, Hungary, and Portugal are the only three member states who have failed to notify any correlation table or explanatory document specifying where they have transposed each provision of the Directive. Therefore, the Commission is referring these member states to the Court of Justice of the European Union,” the European Commission said in a statement.
According to EU law, the European Commission can refer member states to the CJEU and request financial sanctions if they fail to comply with the reasoned opinion within the stipulated deadline.
The Renewable Energy Directive, adopted in 2018, provides a legal framework for the development of renewable energy in electricity, heating, cooling, and transport over the current decade. It sets an EU-level binding target for 2030 of at least 32% renewable energy and includes measures to ensure support for renewable energy is cost-effective. It also calls for simplified administrative procedures for renewable energy projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/16/uk-must-act-now-to-embed-solar-in-energy-transition/,"COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",UK must act now to embed solar in energy transition,"The UK government must pull out all the stops and take every opportunity to invest in the nation’s renewables infrastructure. To keep pace with the rest of the world and meet UK net-zero targets, we must implement a systematic, technology-agnostic approach to accelerate the energy transition and create a level playing field for all renewable energy technologies.
This is especially needed to address the biggest roadblock on our journey to net zero, which is the energy consumption needed to heat and cool buildings and required for industrial processes. These activities account for roughly half of global energy demand. Of that, only 10% is met through renewables.
Given the size of the issue, a detailed strategy and clear targets for sector-by-sector decarbonization are needed.
Naked Energy
The UK’s historic lack of consistent policy or deployment targets have led to sluggish adoption of renewable energy. At Naked Energy, we design and manufacture solar thermal collectors to decarbonize heat.
Deployment of solar thermal is much lower in the UK than in our European neighbors. Germany has 10 times more – and Austria 25 times more – solar thermal capacity per citizen than the UK. In Italy, solar thermal adoption grew 83% in 2021, owing to the government’s 110% “superbonus” tax deduction. The dramatic increase in Italy’s solar thermal adoption is proof businesses and consumers are eager to drive the energy transition forward – all that’s needed are the right conditions to enable a bottom-up approach.
A national target of 11 GW of solar thermal this decade would put the UK on par with today’s EU average and would mean annual growth of 26%. This is a tall order, of course, but possible through grant schemes such as the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme, which has done so much to reduce emissions at UK public bodies; and the revival of the Green Homes Grant, which was axed after just six months and which offered households up to £5,000 ($6,030) to fund insulation, and £10,000 for low-carbon heating.
Reliable and long-term funding for renewables infrastructure will dramatically increase investor and business confidence, encourage the development of innovative green technology, and eventually help those struggling to pay energy bills as well as protecting the country from future shocks.
In the residential sector, simple regulatory measures would go a long way.
Stringent building regulations to ensure new-builds meet the highest energy efficiency standards and have renewable energy technology – including photovoltaics, solar thermal, and heat pumps – installed, will benefit tenants and landlords alike.
The 2025 Future Homes Standard, which will come into effect that year, must be adhered to by including solar energy as a key means to meet decarbonization targets; and building energy performance certificates should be updated to include details on how well-installed, low carbon technology is performing.
Last but not least, green consumer finance and mortgage products that reward investment in properties with solar technology will also drive much needed change.
The impact of solar heat goes beyond individual buildings. Solar district heating is a powerful demonstration of how entire communities can decarbonize through large scale infrastructure. These networks can provide 90% to 100% of the energy needed for hot water and space heating when paired with seasonal storage technology such as pit thermal energy storage systems. That technology involves a large, insulated body of water which can be heated and, in Denmark, solar district heating is so successful it meets 60% of the country’s thermal demand. Systems have also been installed in Austria and Germany.
Solar district heating networks not only provide cost-efficient heat generation, they significantly reduce stress on local power grids, enabling green electricity to be efficiently used for other applications.
Of course, solar technology will not deliver the energy transition alone.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts renewables for heat generation will grow around 15% globally to 2027. To meet net zero targets, however, they should grow by around 27%. There is a lot to do.
The level of investment needed is significant. However it’s no coincidence the United States implemented the Inflation Reduction Act last year and the European Union is now formulating a Green Deal Industrial Plan to strategically support local industry.
The energy transition provides a huge opportunity to build domestic supply chains, revitalize national industries, and mitigate the worst effects of climate change.
Solar thermal should be an integral part of this journey for the United Kingdom. The IEA expects the number of solar thermal systems will grow from 250 million today to 1.2 billion in 2050, and says they will directly contribute to the roughly 250,000 green jobs anticipated in Europe this decade.
The bill for not reaching net zero could be as much as $178 trillion over the next 50 years, according to a study from the Deloitte Centre for Sustainable Progress published last year.
Getting the UK back on track with its peers won’t come cheap, especially when we’re playing catch-up. We are already seeing the cost of inaction in previous decades and we can’t let that happen again.

“Our latest product is aimed at the marine market, targeting sail and power boats with limited space where weight, functionality, and looks are important,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “We've designed a panel, the seaLeaf, with integrated hardware, but also have panels with interchangeable mounting kits designed to withstand the marine environment.”
The Canadian solar manufacturer said the seaLeaf has a rigid carbon-fiber foam foundation instead of glass. It measures 1,073 mm x 575 mm, is 9 mm thick, and weighs 2.5 kg. The curved solar panel includes two quick-release clamps installed 50 cm apart. These can purportedly attach to any one-inch rail and rotate 180 degrees to track the sun.
The new module has an open circuit voltage of 22.9 V, and a short circuit current of 6.35 A. It uses 32 SunPower Maxeon GIII Premium ME3 monocrystalline solar cells with 25.1% efficiency. The junction box is sealed and potted, uses two Schottky bypass diodes, and has IP67 protection. The device includes a 3-meter marine grade 14 AWG round cable with a plain end for simple bulkhead gland installation.
“The majority of our supply chain is North American sourced, and our panels are entirely designed and assembled in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, [Canada]” said the Lightleaf spokesperson.
The seaLeaf costs $650 and comes with a three-year workmanship, and five-year power output warranty. Leightleaf has previously developed carbon fiber solar panels for the RV market, but it has mainly targeted small trailers with limited space.
“The nature of the panels allows them to be mounted while in transport and removed/deployed when parked,” said the spokesperson.

While most research has historically focused on thermal solar-assisted heat pumps, the academics noted that “the use of photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) solar collectors is expanding, which may be exploited by heat pumps, with benefits for both systems.”
The team only focused on vapor-compression heat pumps and PVT-SAHP systems for water heating or cooling – the most common application in buildings. They said they only considered water-based flat plate PVT collectors because they “are the most efficient PVT technology and the most feasible for HVAC systems.”
The academics classified the PVT-SAHP systems according to the way heat pumps use solar energy. There are direct-expansion systems (DX), where the PVT collector is used as the heat pump evaporator, or indirect-expansion systems (IDX), where a heat exchanger is interposed between the PVT and the heat pump. These can be further differentiated between single-source configurations, where solar energy is the only heat source for the heat pump, and dual-source systems, where there is another heat source in addition to solar.
Single-source direct-expansion PVT-SAHP systems are an efficient, simple solution for water heating, according to the study. Its applications for cooling are however limited, due to the lack of an additional, cold, source like air or geothermal. Experimental work shows an average coefficient of performance (COP) between 2.7 and 7 for such systems, registered during experiments in favorable environmental conditions.
The absence of an intermediate heat exchanger makes their construction easier and lowers costs. However, using the PVT collector as the heat pump’s evaporator makes the system vulnerable to variable solar radiation.
“Therefore, complex control strategies under unstable weather conditions are necessary, as well as the use of a variable-speed compressor,” the scientists said.
They noted that it is crucial to choose a refrigerant that fits the needs of both the PVT collector and the heat pump, to ensure that the wet refrigerant does not enter the compressor. Dual-source indirect-expansion PVT-SAHP systems, on the other hand, could address many shortcomings of these systems above, but they might be less efficient. These systems report average COPs of 2.3 and 4.5, but the measurements were taken in longer-term experiments.
“The principal advantage of IDX-PVT-SAHP systems is the more stable heat gain from the solar side, since the refrigerant evaporates in a water-to-gas heat exchanger under more stable conditions,” the researchers said.
They said that the separate heat exchanger also allows for the shortening of refrigeration lines, reducing refrigeration mass with economic and environmental gains. The systems also allow for a more flexible configuration and the extra heat source increases the heat pump's output. This opens up the possibility of adding thermal water storage on either the heat pump side or user side.
The second heat source makes dual-source indirect-expansion PVT-SAHP systems the better solution for cooling. They are a comprehensive solution to cover all building thermal needs, including heating, cooling, and domestic hot water.
“Those systems are also more suitable to be coupled with ground-source heat pumps, which are very popular in heating-dominating regions,” the researchers said.
They claimed that flat-plate PVT collectors with direct lamination of PV cells over roll-bond absorbers guarantee the best compromise between efficiency, reliability, manufacturing complexity, and cost.
“The integration with heat pump systems is confirmed to enhance both electric and thermal performances due to the active cooling, which is relevant in both direct- and indirect-expansion system configurations,” the academics concluded.
They shared their findings in “Photovoltaic-thermal solar-assisted heat pump systems for building applications: Integration and design methods,” which was recently published in Energy and Built Environment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/16/bifacial-thermophovoltaic-cell-for-waste-heat-recovery/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",Bifacial thermophovoltaic cell for waste heat recovery,"Scientists from the Technical University of Madrid have developed a bifacial thermophotovoltaic (TVP) cell for grid-scale energy storage and residential applications.
“Bifacial TPV cells allow for the conversion of radiant heat to electricity at lower temperatures than conventional monofacial designs,” researcher Alejandro Datas told pv magazine. “Therefore, they could be used for industrial waste heat recovery or thermal energy storage systems that operate at lower temperatures.”
He said TPV systems usually operate at temperatures above 1,200 C, which is necessary to make the TPV conversion efficient. “The use of bifacial TPV cells in these systems would allow the operating temperature to be lowered, allowing the development of smaller systems,” Datas added.
In a TPV cell, a thermal emitter emits photons and directs them toward a closely spaced TPV cell made of a low-bandgap semiconductor.
“Within the cell, photons with wavelengths shorter than that of the semiconductor bandgap are absorbed and produce electron−hole pairs,” the researchers explained, noting that electrons and holes are collected in a separate electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL), which results in the generation of an external current.
The thermal emitter harvests thermal radiation from both sides, with outband photons being transmitted through the cell and reabsorbed in the emitter, while also eliminating optical losses at the mirror/cell interface.
“As the cell is illuminated from both sides, the cell is able to produce twice the power than conventional monofacial TPV cell designs,” the group said, adding that the edges of the cell are attached to highly reflective tubes equipped with a fluid intended for cooling.
“By cooling the cells from the edges, it is possible to keep them at a relatively low temperature, provided that the cell size (width and thickness) is properly designed to accommodate the high lateral heat fluxes that are expected, especially when the emitter temperature is high,” the scientists explained.
They said the device can achieve twice the power density of “conventional” monofacial thermophotovoltaic devices without increasing the system costs.
“This means that the cost of generated power can be half that of conventional devices,” Datas said.
The academics presented the system in “Bifacial Thermophotovoltaic Energy Conversion,” which was recently published in ACS Photonics.
“Bifacial TPV cells are appealing for developing practical high-efficient and low-cost TPV devices for power generation in an extended range of heat source temperatures,” they concluded.
The same research team introduced a latent heat thermophotovoltaic (LHTPV) battery in March. The device uses renewable electricity to melt low-cost metals such as silicon or ferrosilicon alloys to produce and store latent heat, which is in turn used by a thermophovoltaic generator to produce power. The scientists said the device could store electricity at a cost of €10 ($10.7)/ kWh for a 10 MWh system.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/16/australian-researchers-reveal-new-way-to-split-saltwater-into-hydrogen/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",Australian researchers reveal new way to split saltwater into hydrogen,"From pv magazine Australia
Researchers from RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, have developed a new way to split seawater into hydrogen and oxygen, without the need for desalination and its associated costs, energy consumption, and toxic byproducts. They incorporated a catalyst composed of nitrogen-doped porous sheets developed to work specifically with seawater.
The new approach, devised by a team in the multidisciplinary Materials for Clean Energy and Environment (MC2E) research group at RMIT, uses a catalyst composed of nitrogen-doped porous nickel molybdenum phosphide sheets. The method, detailed in a lab-scale study that was recently published in Small, relies on the presence of large pores in the sheets to increase electrical conductivity while the presence of metal-nitrogen bonds and surface polyanions increases the stability and improves anti-corrosive properties against chlorine chemistry.
The researchers said the catalyst sheets displayed “remarkable performance,” catalyzing full water splitting at 1.52 and 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 in 1 m KOH and seawater, respectively.
“Hence, structural and compositional control can make catalysts effective in realising low-cost hydrogen directly from seawater,” the team concluded.
Lead researcher Nasir Mahmood said the new method overcomes some of the hurdles associated with seawater’s salt-rich nature.
“The biggest hurdle with using seawater is the chlorine, which can be produced as a by-product. If we were to meet the world’s hydrogen needs without solving this issue first, we’d produce 240 million tons per year of chlorine each year – which is three to four times what the world needs in chlorine,” Mahmood said. “There’s no point replacing hydrogen made by fossil fuels with hydrogen production that could be damaging our environment in a different way. Our process not only omits no carbon dioxide, but also has no chlorine production.”
While other experimental catalysts have been developed for seawater splitting, PhD candidate Suraj Loomba said the RMIT research team had focused on producing highly efficient, stable catalysts that can be manufactured cost-effectively.
“Our approach focused on changing the internal chemistry of the catalysts through a simple method, which makes them relatively easy to produce at large-scale so they can be readily synthesised at industrial scales,” he said.
The latest edition of pv magazine is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
Mahmood said the technology had promise to significantly bring down the cost of electrolyzers – enough to meet the Australian government’s goal for green hydrogen production of $2 per kilogram, to make it competitive with fossil fuel-sourced hydrogen.
“Our method to produce hydrogen straight from seawater is simple, scaleable and far more cost-effective than any green hydrogen approach currently in the market,” he said. “With further development, we hope this could advance the establishment of a thriving green hydrogen industry in Australia.”
A provisional patent application has been filed for the new method and the researchers said they are working with industry partners to develop the technology. The next stage is the development of a prototype electrolyzer that combines a series of catalysts to produce large quantities of hydrogen.

RoyPow Technology is displaying its new “all-in-one” residential battery energy storage solution at Intersolar North America this week in Long Beach, California. The company brings more than 20 years of manufacturing experience in renewable energy and battery energy storage systems.
The latest product, RoyPow SUN Series, is a lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) home battery sporting up to 15 kW of power and 40 kWh of capacity. It has a maximum efficiency of 98.5%.
The high-power battery is a true whole-home solution, the company says, as it is able to back up larger home appliances like air conditioners, dryers, and pool pumps. The high-capacity storage is designed to offer homeowners an opportunity to maximize solar energy self-consumption, avoiding value loss from exporting energy to the grid.
Like many battery offerings today, the SUN Series is modular and stackable, allowing for what is reportedly an easy design and installation. Battery modules can be stacked from 5.1 kWh to 40.8 kWh. Up to six units can be connected in parallel, delivering up to 90 kW output.
The battery is IP65 rated, resistant to dust and moisture, and is UL certified for safety. The LFP chemistry negates the need for cobalt in the battery, a mineral tied to conflict mining and higher rates of battery fires in traditional lithium-ion batteries. The company reports that the switching time is less than 10 milliseconds, which makes the battery safer, but also allows for automatic energy transfers for on- or off-grid use without power disruption.
The SUN Series battery is paired with its namesake app, which can be used to monitor solar production in real time. The app enables preference-setting for optimizing energy independence, outage protection, or savings. The system can be controlled with remote access and instant alerts.
The new product will meet the emergent needs created by “the trend of rising energy costs and the need for greater energy resilience in the face of increasingly frequent grid outages,” said Michael Li, vice president at RoyPow Technology.
Li said the company will continue to develop products in the renewable energy storage space, targeting commercial and industrial solutions, vehicle-mounted and marine applications, and more.
RoyPow is based in China's Guangdong province, with manufacturing centers in China and subsidiaries in the United States, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa.

If confirmed, the growth would represent a 53.4% increase compared to 2022, when new global solar additions hit 228.5 GW.
This year, solar demand will be particularly strong due to decreasing PV panel prices. In addition, a high number of projects that were delayed in 2021 and 2022 for supply chain issues are now gradually going online, said TrendForce.
The Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for most of the installed capacity this year, with around 202.5 GW of projected demand. China, Malaysia, and the Philippines will lead this growth.
Europe is predicted to account for 68.6 GW of the total, with Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands taking the lead. The Americas will likely deploy about 64.6 GW, said TrendForce. The Middle East and Africa will jointly deploy 14.9 GW of new PV installations this year, up 49.5% year on year, according to the research firm.
China will be the largest market this year with 148.9 GW of expected demand, followed by the United States at 40.5 GW, India at 17.2 GW, Brazil at 14.2 GW, Germany at 11.8 GW, Spain at 11.4 GW, and Japan at 8 GW, said TrendForce.
