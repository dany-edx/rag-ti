It said that interested developers have until Dec. 30 to express interest.
The auction scheme will be configured as a contract-for-difference (CfD) scheme. The authorities will award 15-year power purchase agreements to the selected developers.
According to Energynomics, the Romanian authorities will hold the first auction before the end of June, with up to 750 MW of solar and 750 MW of wind capacity to be allocated. The facilities should be at least 5 MW, without a size cap.
“According to Romania's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), the first CfD round for at least 1,500 MW of capacity is supposed to be organized in [second half of] 2023 and the second in [the first half of] 2025, for an additional 2,000 MW,” Mihai Balan, the executive director of the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association (RPIA), told pv magazine in November.
“It is a milestone in our NRRP that we have the first capacities supported by this mechanism up and running by 2026. Initially, we were expecting the scheme to be presented to the public at the end of this year, but now, with the current situation on the energy market and the fact that we are steadily heading toward a regulated market, it is safe to say that we will see the details early 2023 at best.”
The latest print edition of pv magazine – hot off the press this week – visits Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and includes coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.

“We analyzed the loss mechanisms still present in the solar cell and find that simple series resistance issues could be solved and bring the devices up to 8% efficiency.” researcher Rasmus Nielsen told pv magazine. “It is yet to be determined whether these killer defects are of intrinsic or an extrinsic nature, but improving the optoelectronic quality of selenium is definitely the only way to push this type of solar cell beyond 10% efficiency.”
The scientists built the device with a tin oxide (FTO) substrate, an electron transport layer made of zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO), a selenium absorber, a molybdenum oxide (MoOx) layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact. They said that characterization of the selenium material properties – such as doping concentration, lifetime, mobility, built-in voltage, and photoluminescence quantum yield – partially solved the typical voltage deficit of selenium solar cells.
“Our results indicate that improving the bulk material properties of selenium is probably necessary to further advance the performance of selenium solar cells,” they said.
Under 1 sun illumination, the solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 5.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 991 mV, a short-circuit current density of 10.0 mA cm −2, and a fill factor of 52.4%. The measurements also predict the device may reach a pseudo efficiency of 7.98% and a pseudo fill factor of 80.4%.
The researchers said the optimal thickness of the selenium absorber in the proposed cell configuration would be 400 nanometers. They presented their results in “Origin of photovoltaic losses in selenium solar cells with open-circuit voltages approaching 1 V,” which was recently published in Journals of Materials Chemistry A.
“We discourage other scientists from continuing their efforts in optimizing the device architecture, as we find the by far biggest loss mechanisms is in the heart of the photo absorber itself, namely bulk defects,” Nielsen said.

The Finnish developer will use the funds to build an underground pumped hydro storage station at a former zinc and copper mine owned by First Quantum Minerals in Finland. Mining activities will be completely shut down by the end of this year.
“The storage unit will participate in the electricity spot markets, as well as in electricity balancing markets,” the commission said in a statement. “The storage unit will effectively substitute in the grid electricity generated by high-cost gas-fired units with low-cost, clean electricity available notably during strong renewable energies generation conditions.”
Finnish energy company EPV Energy joined the project in early 2021. The pumped hydro station will have a capacity of 75 MW/530 MWh and generate between 60 GWh and 160 GWh of electricity per year. The Pyhäsalmi Mine is the deepest base metal mine in Europe, at a depth of 1,444 meters.
“This energy storage project, if implemented, would bring excellent flexibility to EPV’s future energy system,” the company said. “Several studies have already been carried out on the feasibility of the energy storage project, and EPV Energy has contributed to them by carrying out market forecasts of renewable energy and providing background information on rock engineering in collaboration with its partners.”
Sevo is developing the project under the Calilo initiative, which was launched in 2019 to oversee the redevelopment of the Pyhäsalmi Mine. According to the project's website, the storage facility should be built in three years and its operational lifetime should at least 50 years.

Germany has allocated 609 MW of solar capacity in its latest tenders for ground-mounted PV projects. The procurement exercise was undersubscribed, as the authorities originally planned to allocate 89ß MW. As part of the procurement exercise, the authorities awarded about 152 MW to developers of 32 projects along highways and railways.
The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) agreed to review 117 project proposals with a combined capacity of 677 MW. The tender concluded with a final average price of €0.0580/kWh, up slightly from €0.0510 in the last procurement round. Bids ranged from €0.0520/kWh to €0.0590/kWh.
The southern state of Bavaria secured the largest amount of the allocated capacity, with 307 MW spread across 60 projects. It was followed by Baden-Württemberg, which secured 67 MW at 13 sites, and Brandenburg with 66 MW across seven projects.

The company will invest around CNY 10 billion ($1.43 billion) in the project.  In November, Linyang Energy commissioned a 10 GWh lithium iron phosphate battery factory in Jiangsu.
Daqo said on thar it will soon move forward with the construction of a 100,000-metric-ton (MT) production base in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. The CNY 9.2 billion project is the second phase of a 200,000 MT polysilicon hub it is developing in the area. The company said its overall production capacity will reach 305,000 MT by the end of next year.
Shangji Automation said that a fire broke out at its new factory in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, where it plans to produce wafers and solar cells. The fire started last Friday afternoon and was extinguished after five and a half hours. Five people were killed and two were injured. The local authorities have set up a team to investigate the cause of the accident. The company said the fire will delay the construction of the factory, but will not have an impact on its current wafer capacity and operations.

“Our work gives a first demonstration of how a perovskite/silicon tandem cell can be combined with a water electrolyzer system,” researcher René Jannsen told pv magazine. “To make this into a successful commercial product many steps still have to be taken. This involves upscaling the technology, addressing stability in greater detail, and use of more earth-abundant catalysts in the water-splitting reaction. ”
The scientists built an electrochemical (EC) flow cell with an active area of 4 cm2 and a two-compartment design. For the tandem solar cell, they combined a perovskite top cell and a bottom cell based on a silicon heterojunction architecture. They said the electrochemical and photovoltaic cells were wire-connected into an integrated solar-assisted water-splitting system.
“The design that we have used has been tested on the lab scale of 1 cm2,” Jannsen said. “In principle, this can be extended to larger areas, but in that case, some of the deposition methods need the be adapted.”
The top cell is based on a perovskite known as K0.05Cs0.05(FA0.79MA0.21)0.90Pb(I0.79Br0.21)3 with an energy bandgap of around 1.67 eV. They deposited the perovskite layer via atomic layer deposited (ALD) and applied magnesium fluoride (MgF2) as an anti-reflecting coating. They developed the device with a substrate made of glass and an indium tin oxide (ITO), a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60), the perovskite layer, and a hole transport layer made of carbazole (2PACz).
The research team used plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) to place a nickel oxide (NiO) interlayer between the two cells and an ITO substrate as the interconnection layer. They designed the bottom cell with a conventional design based on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon layers with the addition an ITO substrate and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The champion tandem device built with this configuration achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.80 V, a short-circuit current of 17.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.78. According to the researchers, this system configuration is able to achieve a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of over 21%.
“This STH efficiency is the highest reported for systems operating at approximately 1-Sun equivalent light intensity, and among the highest reported across a variety of combinations of EC and PV systems,” they explained.
They described the system in “Efficient Continuous Light-Driven Electrochemical Water Splitting Enabled by Monolithic Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials Technology.
“We are interested to collaborate with commercial partners who are interested in making this a technology,” Jannsen said. “The current design with the use of metals like indium (in the top electrode of the tandem cell), and platinum and ruthenium in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts needs replacement by more earth-abundant and cheaper alternatives. Examples of such materials are known, but we have not yet tested these.”

The 162 MW Columboola Solar Farm in the Australian state of Queensland has started commercial operations, with EPC contractor Sterling & Wilson announcing that the project has achieved successful HP2 (Hold Point 2) completion and is now exporting up to 115 MW of clean energy into the grid. The solar farm is expected to commence commercial operations for its full capacity in early 2023.
The Columboola Solar Farm features 410,000 bifacial solar panels mounted on single-axis trackers. When it achieves full capacity, the solar farm will generate approximately 440 GWh of clean energy per year, or enough to power the equivalent of 100,000 households.
The project, which is owned by South Korea-based investment manager Hana Financial Investment, is backed by a long-term power purchase agreement with state-owned utility CS Energy. CS Energy will buy 100% of the site’s output, on-selling to its large commercial and industrial customers. Among the beneficiaries of the 10-year PPA is a group of universities including Griffith University, Central Queensland University and Queensland University of Technology (QUT).
Griffith University Chief Operating Officer Peter Bryant welcomed the start of commercial operations, saying all five of the university’s campuses will use power from the Columboola Solar Farm, which will provide 50% of the university’s energy needs.
“Griffith uses about 60 million kWh annually, contributing to around 70% of the university’s total carbon footprint,” he said. “It will also help us achieve our commitment of halving our 2010 emissions by 2030 and then to net zero emissions by 2050.”
Bryant added that projects like the Columboola Solar Farm are vital as universities are major consumers of electricity and have a relatively small geographic/rooftop footprint making it difficult to install enough solar or other renewable sources of power on campus.
“Off-site renewable generation via long-term power purchase arrangements means we can source renewable power when on-site options are insufficient to meet our needs and also provide essential market support for investment in new renewable projects across the state,” he said.
QUT Vice-Chancellor Professor Margaret Sheil said the Columboola Solar Farm will supply the university with enough renewable energy to cover 50% of the requirements at its Gardens Point and Kelvin Grove campuses.
Sheil said the tailored retail contract would provide QUT with a pathway to achieve full carbon neutrality on total electricity consumption, reducing the university’s carbon emissions by an estimated 20,000 tonnes per annum.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the project will play an important role in the state reaching its target of 70% renewable energy by 2032, and 80% by 2035.

SEI Logistics’ portable, folding solar panels and battery solution are designed for use by the oil and gas industry, where off-grid power is needed in remote and extremely cold locations. The portable panels come with a battery housed in a case, specially designed for cold and harsh environments.
While most batteries don’t perform well in permafrost areas, SEI Logistics found a manufacturer of military- grade cases used for transporting and storing missiles, which the company uses for its batteries. The cases house the batteries as well as heaters to keep them warm.
SEI Logistics uses lithium-ion batteries with a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) heater. When the temperature outside drops, more of the power from the panels goes to the heater that warms the batteries, it says.
The foldable module design of the solar panels was developed so that the off-grid solution could be easily transported and set up anywhere. According to SEI Logistics, technical challenges included how small and light the structure could become without compromising sturdiness and performance, and how to reduce the number of components without leaving panels vulnerable to high winds.
After extensive experimentation, the designers realized that once new custom-designed hinges were used, bulky gas springs were no longer required, and that if they increased the panels’ proximity to the ground, they performed exactly the same in wind tunnel testing.
Canada has committed to reducing carbon emissions while safeguarding an economy that depends greatly on natural resources. The country recently released 2022 Fall Economic Statement, which introduced investment tax credits (ITC) for clean technologies and clean hydrogen that will help spur the transition to net-zero energy and make Canada more competitive with the United States.
The clean-tech tax credits will be offered to those who invest in net-zero technologies, battery storage and clean hydrogen. The new 30% Canadian tax credit will apply to investments in renewable energy generation and storage, as well as in as low-carbon heating and zero-emission industrial vehicles. The Canadian government also plans a tax credit for hydrogen production, the design of which has yet to be determined.
“While the IRA will undoubtedly accelerate the ongoing transition to a net-zero North American economy, it also offers enormous financial supports to firms that locate their production in the United States – from electric vehicle battery production, to hydrogen, to biofuels, and beyond,” the government said in the economic update. “Without new measures to keep pace with the IRA, Canada risks being left behind.”
One of the primary sources of investment that the Government of Canada gives to businesses and organizations operating in this sector is the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) program. This tax incentive for innovation allows businesses to claim back expenses incurred on research and development activity. This is made up of a combination of federal and provincial funding. Not every cost associated with R&D can be included in a claim, however, the main qualifying expenses include staff costs, salaries, materials, as well as payments to contractors and third parties.  Catax Canada, a specialist in tax incentives for scientific research and experimental development, helped secure the funding.
“When you’re faced with overcoming challenges as great as these are, having access to this kind of funding is invaluable. Knowing we can rely on SR&ED has completely energized our whole approach to innovation,” said Eric Little, founder and CEO of SEI Logistics. “The benefits it brings mean we’re investing more in R&D than ever before.”
This article was amended on December 14, 2022 to note that Catax Canada helped secure the funding.

kWh Analytics, a climate insurance firm, says in its 2022 Solar Generation Index that solar assets are broadly performing below expectations. The report incorporates data from industry collaborators and kWh Analytics’ proprietary Heliostat database. 
On average, projects constructed after 2015 have generated 7% to 13% less electricity than P50 production estimates. P50 means there is a 50% chance in any given year that production will be at least a specific amount. If an array has a P50 production level of 500 kWh, it means that on any given year there is a 50% chance that production will be at least 500 kWh. 
The report concluded that as the gap between actual and expected generation grows, underperformance risk jeopardizes investor returns and the industry’s ability to achieve sustainable growth. 
“Underperformance affects investors and lenders critical to the success and growth of solar projects,” said Jason Kaminksy, chief executive officer of kWh Analytics. “As an industry, we must collaborate to find ways to course-correct in order to ensure the industry’s long-term financial health.” 
The average performance of projects constructed last year represented a minor improvement compared to 2020. In general, projects built since 2015 are performing worse than those constructed in the early 2010s relative to their P50 estimates. 
The kWh Analytics report showed that since 2019, projects with capacities greater than 50 MW have performed worse relative to their P50 estimates than projects in the range of 1 MW to 50 MW.
The underperformance trend is a nationwide phenomenon, said kWh Analytics. Under 10 years of operational data, average lifetime performance ranged from 5% to 10% below initial P50 estimates across the seven regions. Over the years, performance continues to decline in each region. The only outliers in 2021 were the Northwest and Southeast regions, which improved by 1% and 2%, respectively.
“It is imperative that we continue to support the long-term success of the renewable energy sector,” said Kaminksy. “To de-risk investments into zero-carbon assets and encourage resilience throughout the industry, sponsors and lenders should consider accurately priced risk-transfer products, be wary of aggressive production forecasts, and be collaborative with stakeholders to encourage data sharing.”
The report also evaluated system performance based on project capacities and mount types. It did not find any underperformance trends isolated to any specific groups of projects.
