The new factory will have an annual capacity of 2.4 GW and will produce exclusively bifacial 182 mm HJT cells based on the company's cell tech featuring a power conversion efficiency of 25.26%. This result was confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin, Germany.
According to the PV module maker, its champion cell is second only to the HJT cell developed by Japanese chemical company Kaneka in 2017. That 180 cm² crystalline silicon device, which featured heterojunction and back-contact technology, achieved 26.63% efficiency.
Huasun is currently operating another 500 MW module factory in Xuancheng.
In September 2022, the company signed an agreement with the eastern China unit of state-run Power China to supply 10 GW of heterojunction modules from 2022 to 2025. It also announced plans to invest in 7.5 GW of heterojunction lines and placed a corresponding order with Chinese heterojunction equipment supplier Maxwell.
The new capacity is expected to go online in 2023.

It uses propane (R290) as the refrigerant.
“Our specialist trade partners in Germany have repeatedly approached us with requests for such a solution,” Dror Peled, deputy division manager at Mitsubishi Electric, said in a statement. “With our Ecodan models with the R290 refrigerant as a monoblock variant, we are now offering our customers entry into the renovation market with relatively high flow temperatures based on a natural refrigerant.”
The R290 Ecodan monoblock will be available with heating capacities of 5 kW, 6 kW, and 8 kW. There are also plans to expand the model series with higher heat outputs of up to 14 kW in the coming years, Mitsubishi said in a statement.
The heat pump can purportedly produce hot water up to 75 C with external air down to -15 C, or up to 65 C for air temperatures of up to -25 C.
“Compared to conventional devices, this represents a significant expansion of the areas of application,” Mitsubishi claims, adding that for optimal energy-efficient operation, the recommended flow temperature is 55 C.
The new device is designed as a monoblock system with the option to add a hydro module as an internal unit or a buffer tank for hot water storage with a capacity of 200 or 300 liters.
Mitsubishi is selling the heat pump exclusively as a monoblock due to special safety requirements for heat pumps using propane as the refrigerant for residential applications.
“A closed refrigeration circuit operates in the outdoor unit, which requires no intervention during installation,” the manufacturer said. “The outdoor and indoor modules are connected via water-carrying pipes. In addition, the compressors and existing safety precautions within the heat pumps have been structurally adapted so that both the safe installation and operation of the new units can be carried out safely.”

“We produce this series in low carbon footprint factories with reduced material consumption, where the metal interconnect ribbon is eliminated, the encapsulant and cell are thinner, the silicon content is reduced by 40%, and the module’s lead content is reduced by more than 60%,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Nova modules feature a nominal power rating of 420 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.1%. The open-circuit voltage is 34.5 V and the short-circuit current is 12.2 A.
The new product measures 1,812 mm x 1,096 mm x 30 mm and weighs 20.8 kg. It has an operating temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C, and an IP 68 enclosure. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The company offers a 35-year power output guarantee for 86% of the initial yield.
The Belgian solar module supplier has also announced plans to build a 500 MW solar module factory at an unspecified location in Belgium.
“We are already in active negotiations with local government officials to start the production by the end of the first quarter of 2024,” the company said in a statement, adding that it also plans to build another module manufacturing facility in Georgia. “The total capacity will exceed 5 GW by the end of 2025.”
Belinus has factories in China and Vietnam with has a combined annual production capacity of 2.2 GW. However, it has yet to provide any details about the exact locations of the Asian facilities.

US-based Zendure has unveiled new residential batteries for use with balcony solar panels. The storage system supplier said that the SolarFlow plug-and-play battery storage systems are compatible with all balcony PV modules paired with micro-inverters, with outputs of up to 800 W. The capacity is 960 Wh, but up to four batteries can be stacked in series, which means that the total can be increased to up to 3,840 Wh.
The company said it wants to offer the storage systems as a complete package, with solar modules and micro-inverters, in addition to the ability to retrofit existing plug-in solar devices. The batteries are based on lithium iron phosphate technology and can be connected to existing devices with an MC4 connector.
By storing excess solar power from the PV balcony system, consumers can save up to 32% of their annual energy costs through intelligent battery management, the manufacturer said. The system's scalability reportedly makes it ideal for households with nightly power consumption levels of two to 4 kWh.
The systems have metal exteriors and are waterproof, according to IP65. They can also be placed on balconies, terraces or in gardens, according to Zendure. Operators can also use an app to control their PV systems and check the charge levels of the batteries.
Zendure will initially sell the SolarFlow batteries via its website, followed by sales on Amazon.
“Deliveries of the first battery storage systems will begin a few weeks after the start of pre-sales,” a Zendure spokeswoman told pv magazine.
Zendure says it wants to begin sales of the new products in April.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/16/when-will-the-world-be-fossil-free/,"GEOPOLITICS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",,"MARCH 16, 2023",When will the world be fossil free?,"It’s difficult for anyone to predict an exact end date for fossil fuels for two big reasons. The 20th century fossil fuel economy is still casting a long shadow, given all the companies, sectors, national revenues, jobs, and infrastructure built around it.
Image: Downing LLP
And we are at the mercy of geopolitics. Look at the profits recently announced by both listed and national oil companies, plus the world’s largest coal miner, Glencore. These were not achieved through efficient operation by managers, game-changing products by researchers, or effective strategic direction by boards, but simply by the impact of war on commodity prices and the related reopening of coal mines in Europe and Asia.
Indeed, on an engagement call about climate change with a French power utility in December, I was reminded of the low carbon superiority of nuclear versus the UK’s reversion to dirty coal for baseload power. Nuclear, however, has always experienced a love/hate country-level relationship in its role in ending fossil fuels, going back to the 20th century. High costs – which small, modular reactor technology may overcome – the risk of military crossover; safe waste management; and major accidents which have been occurring with some frequency since Britain’s own, with Windscale in 1957, have plagued the industry.
Given this position, at the start of 2023, will the vast remaining reserves of hydrocarbons across the planet, in places like China, Indonesia, Russia and India, really be left in the ground and become “unburnable” or stranded assets? Maybe.
One of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) most recent outlook scenarios considers that fossil fuel generation will peak by the middle of this decade. Individual days when countries met all their consumption entirely from renewable power were first achieved, and reported, in 2019 and are now extending towards longer periods of time. Country-level targets for renewable power are continuing the upward trend which pre-dated the war in Ukraine. In mid-2021, the EU announced its Fit for 55 plan – a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (versus a 1990 baseline) by 2030, including an aim to have solar and wind power make up at least 40% of the power mix. The global stocktake of nationally determined contributions due at November's COP28 climate change summit, in Dubai, may meet the Paris Agreement’s original objective of naming and shaming countries not doing enough to reduce their emissions compared to their peers.
And of course the same war that has led to regression towards fossil fuels has simultaneously advanced energy security and green transition strategies in three noticeable ways. Firstly, through energy efficiency measures at home. Secondly, there has been further interest in renewable power and clean technology by policymakers – led by the US' Inflation Reduction Act and closely followed by subsides for green industry from Brussels as well – as well as by asset owners and managers. These moves include battery storage, as the technology advances, and other ways of overcoming the intermittency of solar and wind.
Thirdly, there is the gas supply. More liquefied natural gas facilities and contracts are being signed and there is wider usage of gas as a transition fuel or to ramp up when there are spikes in demand, through peaker power plants. Although still a fossil fuel, gas has a lower carbon content than coal, giving it the nickname “the cleanest dirtiest fuel.” The EU agreed when including the “operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using fossil gaseous fuels” as a “sustainable” activity that mitigates climate change in its controversial investment taxonomy, subject to gas meeting certain criteria. The key questions are, how long will this transition last and what is too long? World Energy Outlook scenarios by the IEA provide some guidance but, again, we’re back to the difficulty of predicting an exact end date for all fossil fuels.
All this explains why key indicators of progress on decarbonization – such as the State of Climate Action 2022 report from Washington-based nonprofit the World Resources Institute, progress updates from public body the UK Committee on Climate Change, and the IEA's World Energy Outlook – show progress in some areas, and none in others. The same is true for corporates, with the 10 benchmark indicators of the Climate Action 100+ investor engagement initiative – ranging from targets and net zero to green capital expenditure and lobbying – of the world’s biggest emitters showing mixed progress.
And so, for the foreseeable future, fossil fuels and renewable power appear set to continue their co-existence.

“Now that we have the consent, we will start to prepare a tender document with detailed specifications,” a York Minster spokesperson told pv magazine. “We will then be able to proceed to procurement and in due course appoint a contractor to do the installation.”
The spokesperson noted that the process will take a few months. The 199 solar panels will be placed on the roof of the South Quire Aisle, originally dating back to 1361, and are expected to generate a minimum of 75,000 kWh of power per year.
Churches mostly use energy during the day, which makes them ideal buildings for solar panels. York Minster will also install a storage system to maximize self-consumption in the evenings.
“As well as contributing to meeting daytime power demand, surplus power generated by the panels will be stored in underground batteries and used to power the cathedral’s evening services and events,” York Minster said in a statement.
UK researchers recently launched a feasibility study to assess the economic viability of rooftop solar arrays on Bath Abbey, another UK cathedral. They said that solar projects on historical buildings might require high upfront investments, but their profitability can be ensured by proper project design.

Acciona Energia has revealed that it is using fiberglass from the blades of used wind turbines to manufacture the torsion beams of horizontal solar mounting structures.
The pilot project applies a micronizing process to out-of-service wind turbine blades. The Spain-based solar developer said that this technique reduces the size of the fiberglass to microns – mostly through mechanical transformation techniques.
“The resulting powder is very versatile and can be used as a recycled raw material in the manufacture of new products,” said Acciona Energia.
The company combines the fiber powder glass as a filler through a subsequent process, together with resin and a reinforcing fiber. It then heats this into a mold, in order to produce a profile with the desired geometry and length.
Acciona Energia is testing the results of the mounting structure in the Extremadura I-II-III PV plant in Badajoz, Spain.
“In the medium term, we will have commercial solutions,” said Asun Padrós, innovation project manager at Acciona Energia.

The scientists said the new result improves on the 25.8% efficiency they achieved for the same kind of cell in December 2022.
“The device with an active area of 9 cm² has an open-circuit voltage above 1,880 mV,” CEA-INES said, noting that the improvement on the device, which is based on a p-i-n configuration, was also due to “shading correction.” It did not reveal any additional technical details.
Enel Green Power is betting on an n-type heterojunction (HJT) cell with an efficiency of 25.5% for its new 3 GW solar module factory now under construction in Catania, southern Italy. It recently said this could result in module efficiencies above 24%. From 2026, Enel Green Power plans to offer even more efficient solar modules based on tandem silicon-perovskite cells. The final products will reportedly reach efficiencies of around 30%.
CEA-INES and Enel Green Power have jointly developed DC/DC maximum power point trackers (MPPT). They said they are now also working on high-efficiency bifacial PV panels. In addition, they claim to have achieved a power conversion efficiency rating of 24.47% for a gallium-doped p-type heterojunction silicon solar cell in March 2022.
The current issue of pv magazine focuses on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
In August 2020, they achieved an efficiency of 25.0% for a heterojunction solar cell with an active surface of 213 mm2, based on a M2 silicon wafer format. With this result, the two parties had improved upon their previous record of 24.63%. The method was based on heterojunction processes developed between Enel and INES, using manufacturing equipment provided by Switzerland's Meyer Burger.

The Australian unit of Philippines-based clean energy company AC Energy said it is working through various “hold points” with the 400 MW first stage of the New England Solar Farm. The project forms part of a massive solar and energy storage project under development near Uralla, New South Wales.
ACEN Australia Chief Executive Officer Anton Rohner said the first stage of the solar farm is now progressing through its hold-point testing process. The project was granted formal approval to send power to the grid by the Australian Energy Market Organisation (AEMO) in December. Rohner said the first stage is expected to be generating at full nameplate capacity of 400 MW in the coming months.
“We’re going through the commissioning process as we speak,” he said. “We are approximately 100 MW today and … you’ll see us ramping up to full production over the next four to five months.”
The New England Solar Farm is being developed in two stages. It will eventually include a 720 MW solar installation combined with a 50 MW/50 MWh big battery, which has the scope to be scaled up to 200 MW/400 MWh.
The construction of the first stage of the big battery has already commenced. ACEN expects a financial investment decision to be made on stage two of the solar farm later this year, with construction to begin before the end of 2023. Once the entire 720 MW project is complete, it is anticipated it will produce 1,800 GWh of renewable electricity each year – enough to power more than 250,000 households.
Rohner said ACEN has opted to build the New England Solar Farm on a fully merchant basis, in order to ensure that it is online in time to help replace closing coal-fired power stations in New South Wales.
“We wanted to get things built, to decarbonise Australia,” he said. “I truly believe that the work ACEN Australia is doing to accelerate Australia’s transition to a renewable energy future is here and now – and it starts with New England Solar.”
ACEN Chief Executive Officer Eric Francia said the official opening of the New England Solar Farm establishes Australia as a “stronghold” for the company’s renewables expansion in the region.
“The Australia team continues to harness the country’s outstanding potential for clean energy to help ACEN reach its goal of 20 GW of renewables capacity by 2030,” he said.
Francia said ACEN Australia has more than 1 GW capacity in construction, and more than 8 GW capacity in the development pipeline.
