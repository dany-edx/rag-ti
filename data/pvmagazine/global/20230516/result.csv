The report highlights the importance of approximately 650 GW of electrolyzer manufacturing capacity and expects cumulative sales of $2 trillion, resulting in a significant return on the $111 billion investment in electrolyzer gigafactories. The hydrogen industry is poised to follow the trajectory of the LNG market, with key players including the United States, China, Australia, Chile, and select European and African countries dominating global supply. While certain supply chain links and scarce elements may pose challenges, overall, the price of electrolyzers is expected to continue dropping. Green hydrogen is projected to be the leading hydrogen production method by 2039.
Hydrogen Europe says that global ammonia production, led by the Asia-Pacific region, has consistently risen over the past four years, reaching 185 metric tons (MT) in 2020. The organization highlights that renewable hydrogen supply costs would break even at approximately 3.0 €/kg with natural gas prices at 50 €/MWh (2025 price forecast by the IEA). However, if natural gas prices decline to historical levels of around 20 €/MWh, hydrogen supply costs would face significant pressure, moving the break-even point to around 1.6 €/t. Ammonia currently accounts for nearly one-third of hydrogen consumption in Europe, making it the second largest consumer after oil refining. As the importance of crude oil refining diminishes, ammonia's role is expected to grow.
Masdar and Airbus have agreed to support the development of the global sustainable aviation fuel market development. The collaboration focuses on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Green Hydrogen, Direct Air Capture technologies, and “book and claim” solutions. Masdar leads an initiative leveraging green hydrogen for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, working with licensors to certify a new methanol-based pathway.
The Danish Energy Agency and Ørsted Bioenergy & Thermal Power have finalized negotiations on state aid for Denmark's first project with full-scale capture, transport, and storage of CO2 (CCS). The project will capture and store 430,000 tons of CO2 per year from 2026.
Wood is working with the gas distributor SGN to accelerate plans for critical hydrogen transmission infrastructure in Scotland and southern England. “Over the next 12 months, Wood is delivering three pre-FEED studies to determine the route and design of new dedicated hydrogen pipelines and associated transmission infrastructure,” said the consulting and engineering company. 
Innio said Pan-Ledi has chosen a Jenbacher J420 engine for a 1 MWe combined heat and power project in Nova Pazova, Serbia, to provide electricity for electric-vehicle charging. The contract entails a containerized CHP unit generating approximately 1 MWe. According to the energy solution and service provider, the Jenbacher CHP plant will run on hydrogen produced by an electrolyzer powered by a solar PV plant near Cuprija. The hydrogen will be stored temporarily before being transported from Cuprija to Nova Pazova. Delivery and commissioning of the Jenbacher CHP plant are expected in the fourth quarter.

“In view of an output of almost 160,000 MT in the second half of 2022 alone, the analyst estimates that Tongwei reached an effective production capacity of approx. 345,000 MT by the end of 2022, far above the 260,000 MT officially stated by the company,” the consultancy said in a statement.
The second largest polysilicon maker was GCL Technology, followed by Daqo, Xinte, and Wacker Chemie.
“While the top three positions in the ranking have remained unchanged compared to the previous year, Xinte Energy has relegated Germany-based Wacker Chemie from the fourth to the fifth place,” Bernreuter Research said. “Thus, all top four manufacturers are now located in China; they produced more than 100,000 MT each in 2022.”
The sixth-largest producer was China-based Asia Silicon, which has now reached an annual production capacity of 92,000 MT, followed by East Hope, which closed part of its production at one of its facilities in the Xinjiang province in June after a fire accident.
“China achieved a share of 89% in the global output of solar-grade polysilicon in 2022, and expansion continues unabated. The six largest Chinese manufacturers alone have additional capacities of roughly 1.5 million MT in the pipeline for 2023 and 2024,” the report states, stressing the dominance of the Chinese polysilicon industry. “On top of that, more than a dozen new entrants are building or ramping up new polysilicon plants in China.”
According to polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter, overcapacity will be the main consequence of these expansion plans.
“Even though the potential for growth of global photovoltaic installations is enormous, it will not absorb such huge polysilicon volumes,” he stated.
*The article was updated on May 17 to reflect that Tongwei reached a capacity of 345,000 MT (not an output) by the end of 2022.

They conducted their tests on two rooftop PV systems in Sinsheim, a town in southwestern Germany.
The first system, a 37.8 kW grid-connected array, consists of 252 glass-backsheet solar modules, each with an output of 150 W, provided by Suntech, a Chinese manufacturer. The second installation is an 18.48 kW PV system comprising 112 Suntech glass-backsheet modules with an output of 165 W. Both systems utilize inverters from Solarmax, a German manufacturer.
Based on their analysis using NREL's HOMER software, the scientists reported that the PV installations generated a total of 958 MWh during the 2004-2021 period. They also observed that the larger system experienced some inverter failures in 2009 and 2010.
The research group discovered that the 18.48 kW system exhibited higher energy unit productivity compared to the 37.8 kW array, particularly in 2009 and 2014-2015. They determined that the annual degradation factor for the first system was 0.11%/year, while for the second system it was 0.20%/year.
Furthermore, the researchers found that the actual energy production per available irradiation was 0.817 for the 18.48 kW system and 0.826 for the 37.8 kW system. The measured specific yield divided by theoretical specific yield for the initial two years of operation was 96.8% and 95.8%, respectively.
Their analysis also indicated a power degradation rate of 1.9% in the largest system and 2.9% in the smaller system over the 16-year period. Additionally, the yearly power degradation rates were observed to be 0.11%/year for the 37.8 kW array and 0.20%/year for the 18.48 kW installation, which the researchers noted as significantly lower values compared to those reported in existing literature.
Thy described their findings in “Evaluation of degradation energy productivity of photovoltaic installations in long-term case study,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
“The main strength of the proposed extended methodology is the elimination of the impact of weather conditions on the scale of annual differences,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/16/carbon-electrode-perovskite-solar-cell-with-20-8-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 16, 2023",Carbon electrode perovskite solar cell with 20.8% efficiency,"Researchers at China's Henan University have fabricated a perovskite solar cell based on a carbon electrode that reportedly achieves a power conversion efficiency of 20.8% while providing enhanced stability.
Metal contact electrodes commonly used today can stimulate the degradation of perovskite solar cells due to the diffusion of metal impurities across the interfaces. This issue could be theoretically overcome by replacing the metal contact with carbon electrodes, which are highly promising for commercialization due to their ambient pressure processability based on industrially established printing techniques.
Perovskite solar cells based on carbon electrodes, however, create a problem elsewhere in the devices, leading to performance losses at the point where the carbon electrode meets the perovskite layer.
“For carbon electrode perovskite solar cells, the interfacial contact between carbon electrode and perovskite is of great significance to the performance of solar cells,” the scientists said. “Most of inorganic hole transport layers (HTLs) are based on dispersive nanoparticles those could easily aggregate to form rough contact with both perovskite and the viscous carbon paste; the holes collection is thus negatively affected.”
They sought to solve this issue by placing an organic semiconducting polymer called polythiophene (P3HT) between perovskite and an HTL made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and said this organic/inorganic planar HTL structure has superior electrical contact for carbon electrode perovskite solar cells.
“The organic P3HT layer enables effective moisture-inhabitation and densely contacted interface with matched energy-level alignment with perovskite, while the stable NiOx nanoparticle layer further protects P3HT from being corroded by carbon paste so that we can further optimize carbon blade-coating deposition to form densely contact with HTL,” they also explained.
The Chinese group built the cell with a substrate made of indium tin oxide (ITO), a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, a perovskite absorber, the P3HT layer, the HTL made of NiOx, and a carbon electrode.
The electrode is based on a carbon paste containing carbon black and graphite powder provided by Saidi Technology Development Inc., China. “Carbon electrode was prepared by blade-coating process and the wet film was annealed at 110 C for 5 min,” it said.
The academics compared the performance of the solar cell with that of a reference device without the modified anode buffer interfaces, which they say are able to facilitate charge collection.
The champion solar cell built with these interfaces achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.8%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.15 eV, a short-circuit current of 22.9 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 78.8%.
“This efficiency is among the top values of carbon electrode perovskite solar cells; a champion efficiency of 22% was reported from assembly of semi-cells with carbon electrode substrate,” they stated. “The operational stability of this cell obviously improves because of an introduction of the hydrophobic P3HT layer and the dense carbon pre-covering.”
The reference device, by contrast, reached an efficiency of only 13.4%.
The researchers presented the novel cell tech in “Efficient carbon electrode perovskite solar cells with robust buffer interfaces,” which was recently published in the Journal of Materials Research and Technology.

The government plans to allocate $135 billion by deploying more power generation capacity and new grid capacity, including projects to connect the country's network with neighboring countries.
The government has announced plans to create conditions for deploying rooftop PV systems in at least half of the country's commercial and residential buildings through net metering, while stating that no further feed-in tariffs will be awarded in the future.
The plan also envisions Vietnam becoming an energy exporter by 2030, with electricity exports ranging from 5 GW to 10 GW. The government expects renewable energy to account for over 70% of the energy mix by 2050.
Vietnam has installed over 18.4 GW of PV capacity, primarily through a feed-in tariff scheme that supported small-scale and utility-scale installations. However, the government has not introduced an auction scheme since the expiration of the previous one. Instead, it has initiated a pilot scheme to facilitate bilateral power purchase agreements (PPAs) and open up the electricity market.
Under current regulations, the state-owned energy company Electricity Vietnam (EVN) monopolizes the transmission, distribution, wholesale, and retail of electricity, serving as the sole buyer in the market.
The National Power Development Plan VII has revised solar targets for the period up to 2045, aiming for 13.6 GW of utility-scale solar and 3.4 GW of rooftop solar. To compensate for the reduced solar generation, the plan incorporates the expansion of offshore and onshore wind energy, as well as the import of electricity from Laos.

Electricity demand
During the second week of May, electricity demand increased compared to the previous week in almost all analysed markets. This behaviour was mainly due to the recovery of the demand after day 1 being a festivity in most markets. The increases were between 0.9% in Italy and 11% in the Netherlands. However, in Great Britain, where on Monday, May 8, the festivities associated with the coronation of King Charles III continued, the demand decreased by 0.2%.
Regarding average temperatures, decreases were registered compared to the previous week in the southernmost European markets, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy, as well as in Great Britain, while temperatures increased in the rest of the markets. For the week of May 8, according to the demand forecasting made by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, the demand is expected to increase in the European markets except in Spain, where May 15 is a holiday in Madrid, and in Germany, Belgium and Netherlands, where on May 18 the Ascension Day is celebrated.

European electricity markets
In the week of May 8, prices in most of the European electricity markets analysed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting remained stable, although with a slight upward trend compared to the previous week. The highest price increase, of 5.4%, was registered in the IPEX market of Italy. On the other hand, prices decreased in the Nordic and Iberian markets. The largest prices fall, of 39%, was that of the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries. In the case of the MIBEL market of Spain and Portugal, the decreases were 14% and 17%, respectively.
In the second week of May, the highest average price, of €119.36 ($129.98)/MWh, was that of the Italian market, followed by the average of the N2EX market of the United Kingdom, of €101.47/MWh. On the other hand, the lowest weekly average price was that of the Nordic market, of €47.74/MWh. In the rest of the analysed markets, prices ranged from the €73.76/MWh of the Spanish market and the €95.13/MWh of the EPEX SPOT market of Germany.
Regarding hourly prices, in the MIBEL market of Spain, on Sunday, May 14, nine zero-price hours were registered, between 9:00 and 18:00. In the MIBEL market of Portugal, on that same Sunday, there were three zero-price hours, from 15:00 to 18:00. On the other hand, in the Dutch market, on Saturday, May 13, between 11:00 and 16:00, a zero-price hour and four negative price hours were registered. The lowest hourly price, of -€99.93/MWh, was reached from 13:00 to 14:00 and was the lowest one since April 19.
During the week of May 8, the decrease in the average gas price was compensated by the increase in demand in most of the markets. In the case of the Italian market, wind and solar energy production decreased, with the highest weekly average value being registered. However, the increase in solar energy production and the relevant rise in wind energy production in the Iberian Peninsula contributed to the price decreases registered in the MIBEL market. The AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasting indicates that, in the third week of May, prices may decrease in most European electricity markets.

The Central Electricity Authority, a division under India's power ministry, has conducted a study to determine the optimal generation capacity mix for India in 2029-30. It found that a generation capacity of 777 GW, with renewables accounting for 62.4% (485 GW), supported by 41.65 GW/208.25 GWh of battery energy storage systems, is the most cost-effective and operationally feasible solution to meet the country's electricity demand.
The renewables mix includes 53.9 GW of large hydro, 18.9 GW of pumped storage, 292.6 GW of solar PV, 99.9 GW of wind, 14.5 GW of biomass, and 5.3 GW from small hydro plants. The remaining capacity consists of 251.6 GW of coal- and lignite-based capacity, 24.8 GW of gas-based capacity, and 15.48 GW of nuclear-based capacity.
The study used a state-of-the-art computer Generation Expansion planning model, which considered the projected regional peak electricity demand and electrical energy requirement for 2029-30. It took into account various technical and financial parameters associated with different power generation and storage technologies to determine the optimal mix.
According to the study, the share of thermal installed capacity is expected to decrease to 35.5% of the total installed capacity in 2029-30, compared to 57% as of March 2023. On the other hand, the share of renewable energy-based installed capacity, including large hydro, is projected to increase to 62.4% in 2029-30, compared to 41.4% in March 2023. The overall non-fossil capacity, including nuclear, is estimated to reach about 64% (500.6 GW) of the total installed capacity in 2029-30.
As of March 2023, India's installed capacity stood at 415.4 GW, comprising 236.68 GW from thermal sources (211.8 GW coal + lignite and 24.8 GW gas), 6.78 GW from nuclear, and 171.8 GW from renewable energy sources (42.1 GW hydro, 66.8 GW solar, 42.6 GW wind, 4.7 GW small hydro, 4.8 GW pumped storage, 10.8 GW bio-power).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/16/australian-startup-develops-gravity-storage-tech-for-mine-shafts/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 16, 2023",Australian startup to develop gravity storage tech for mine shafts,"From pv magazine Australia
Green Gravity said its new R&D facility will also be co-commissioned with a digital twin. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physically commissioned system, and can be used to test new components or hypothesis before they are trialed in the physical world.
The startup, led by former BHP executive Mark Swinnerton, says that the introduction of digital assets into Gravity Lab will quickly enable data to validate its commercial-scale energy storage systems. It is partnering with Bluescope and AI specialist xAmplify to build the Gravity Lab, and it has secured support from NVIDIA.
Green Gravity's tech involves the lifting and releasing of heavy weights in legacy mine shafts. The concept is similar to other gravity energy storage technologies, but Swinnerton said that the use of old mine shafts, rather than purpose-built tall towers, will be a competitive advantage. This is because redeploying abandoned but abundant infrastructure lowers costs and is better for the environment.
“By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low,” Swinnterton said. “By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.”
He claimed that Green Gravity will be able to attach capacity at similar unit costs to pumped hydro, but for substantially less capital outlay.
“So you don’t have to pay AUD 700 million ($468 million) like you do in some of the big pumped schemes,” Swinnerton previously told pv magazine Australia. “You just say, ‘well, we’ll pay AUD 30 million’. You’ll get less energy, but you’ll get a similar unit cost outcome to the pumped hydro and there’s lots of them.”
In November 2022, Green Gravity and GHD Group signed a memorandum of understanding to develop new applications for the startup’s storage solutions. It also completed domestic capital raises in 2022, but has its sights set on raising substantially more global capital.
Green Gravity claims it has uncovered at least 3 GWh of potential storage capacity from the 175 sites it has assessed and found to be suitable.
“There is more than that available – and that’s just in Australia,” said Swinnterton.

Patterned solar PV glass provider Canadian Premium Sand (CPS) is making steps to expand its business considerably after signing offtake agreements with major panel manufacturers Qcells, Meyer Burger, and Heliene.
The Alberta-based company said it will launch an 800 ton-per-day solar glass facility, expanding beyond its original plans to add 550 tons per day. This equates to about 6 GW per year of solar glass production, driven largely by strong demand for US solar manufacturing.
The facility will be capable of producing a range of patterned solar glass specifications, including standard 3.2 mm-thick front glass for the residential and commercial rooftop market, as well as 2.0 mm-thick glass required for the bifacial utility market.
The company has entered into a preliminary construction agreement for the production site that places a maximum cost of $880 million. The offtake agreements combine for a minimum of 62% of the company’s planned output capacity, with the option to expand to about 77% of planned output capacity.
“With strong revenue visibility through binding commercial off-take agreements and a high degree of certainty with capital costs and operational performance through our EPC agreement we are confident in our ability to commercialize this high return project, supporting the global energy transition,” said Glenn Leroux, president and chief executive officer of Canadian Premium Sand.
On May 3, the Canadian province of Manitoba issued the company an Environmental Act license to construct and operate its proposed patterned solar glass manufacturing facility on the site secured in the city of Selkirk, Manitoba. The receipt of this license secures a regulatory requirement and removes a path item from the development schedule.
The new facility being built by CPS uses the high-purity, low-iron silica sand from its wholly owned Wanipigow quarry leases. CPS said it intends to power the facility with renewable energy, which reduces the carbon footprint of producing the glass. The company also said it plans to use recycled water in the manufacturing process along with waste heat recovery.
