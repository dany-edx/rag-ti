In a joint press release, the companies explain that they have made the launch of HyDeal Ambition official, following two years of confidential research and preparation. The initiative is scheduled to start in 2022 and aims to reach 95 GW of solar and 67 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. This would mean the production of 3.6 million tons per year of green hydrogen for energy, industry, and mobility users, distributed through the gas transportation and storage network. This amount is roughly equivalent to two months of oil consumption in Spain.
The main gas transporter and operator in the Spanish territory, Enagás, explains that the goal of HyDeal Ambition goes beyond the simple production of green energy, as its competitive cost will make it possible to offer green hydrogen to customers at €1.5/kg by 2030, “that is, at the same price as current fossil fuels,” according to Enagás.
The project is in its early stages, with the various agreements and collaborations involving several of the 30 member entities of HyDeal Ambition being ironed out. The first real activity is expected in Spain around a year from now, with the launch of a set of solar installations with a capacity close to 10 GW.
Thierry Lepercq, spokesperson for HyDeal Ambition, and also founder of Soladvent and Solairedirect and former deputy director in charge of innovation at French energy giant Engie, emphasizes that the initiative “constitutes a complete industrial ecosystem, covering the entire green hydrogen value chain (upstream, midstream, downstream and finance), and is the result of two years of research, analysis, modeling, feasibility studies and contract design, aimed at enabling the production and supply of competitive green hydrogen in Europe”.
Among the participants that make up the HyDeal Ambition project are:
This is not the first initiative of its kind to involve such a large consortium, but it is the most ambitious: Iberdrola announced at the end of last year the formation of a global consortium to produce green hydrogen at less than US$2/kg (€1.65/kg at today's exchange rate): Green Hydrogen Catapult is sponsored by the UN and comprising ACWA, CWP Renewables, Envision, Iberdrola, Ørsted, Yara and Snam, and plans to deploy 25 GW of renewable energy-based green hydrogen production by 2026, as well as halving the cost of green hydrogen to less than $2/kg.
Since the Spanish Government's plans to reach 4 GW of installed electrolyzer capacity by 2030, and to invest €1.5 billion in the development of green hydrogen by 2023, numerous companies have announced their plans in the sector.
Abengoa announced this week that it has completed the construction of a pilot plant to produce energy from green hydrogen as part of the European Grasshopper project.
Endesa plans to develop 2 GW of renewable energy and 23 green hydrogen projects in Spain with an aggregate investment of €2,908 million until 2024 and electrolyzers with a capacity of 340 MW, as well as the development of a national electrolyzer and capital equipment manufacturing industry.
Repsol and Acciona will produce hydrogen with floating PV in Asturias, and Acciona also participates, together with Enagás, IDAE and Cemex are launching a green hydrogen plant in Mallorca.
Enagás and Naturgy are promoting the largest green hydrogen plant in Spain: a project that will be able to produce up to approximately 9,000 tons of hydrogen per year from a 400 MW PV plant and an electrolyzer of up to 60 MW.
Iberdrola created a business unit dedicated to green hydrogen, and subsequently announced its goal of covering 20% of the national green hydrogen target by 2027: the utility and Fertiberia plan 800 MW of green hydrogen by that year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/12/silver-prices-expected-to-rise-by-11-this-year/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021",Silver prices expected to rise by 11% this year,"Silver demand is expected to rise 11% this year, due to a strong increase in industrial and physical silver investments, according to industry body The Silver Institute.
“The outlook for silver demand is bright, with the global total forecast to achieve an eight-year high in 2021 of 1.025 billion ounces, thereby recovering all losses sustained in 2020,” the analyst said in a statement. “This reflects expected gains in the critical segments of industrial demand, physical investment, jewelry, and silverware fabrication.”
The Silver Institute revealed that the average annual silver price grew from $16.19 per ounce in 2019 to $20.52 per ounce last year, and that this year this price may grow by 46% to a seven-year high of $30.00 per ounce. “Given silver’s smaller market and the increased price volatility this can generate, we expect silver to comfortably outperform gold this year,” it further explained.
“Although significant, this growth in the average price is still far away from any critical threshold that would make silver supply for the solar industry problematic,” Michael DiRienzo, executive director at The Silver Institute, told pv magazine. “An average price of over $40, which would mean peak prices of around $45, would eventually become the critical limit to cross.”
As for the PV industry, it is forecast to buy 105 million ounces this year, which would represent significant growth, compared to around 88 million ounces in 2020 and approximately 93 million ounces in 2019, “Although silver loadings continue to drift lower, the sector will benefit from a growing number of countries that are installing new PV capacity,” the analyst stated.
In June of last year, the Silver Institute noted that the ability of PV producers to reduce silver content in solar cell production – a process referred to as ‘thrifting’ – has reduced since 2016 but they anticipated the average 111mg of the precious metal needed for each solar cell in 2019 would nevertheless fall to 80mg by 2030. With silver on prices on the rise, it is expected that the rate of thrifting will continue to reduce.
In a report published in June 2018, the analyst highlighted how the amount of silver needed by the PV industry could fall from 130 mg per cell in 2016 to approximately 65 mg by 2028. According to a recent study by the University of Kent, silver accounts for around 6.1% of total PV module production costs. BloombergNEF recently stated the metal accounts for about 4.7% of the cost of a panel.

“The success of our latest funding round will ensure that we have sufficient capital to meet key milestones as we scale up the technology,” said Power Roll CEO Neil Spann. “As well as opening our roll-to-roll pilot plant for our unique solar film this year, we are developing other applications including capacitors and sensors, and are strengthening our team to support market delivery.”
The company has developed a unique thin-film technology, which promises to offer combined solar and storage in a single device. It uses a flexible polymer substrate, embossed with what it calls “microgrooves smaller than a human hair,” onto which it deposits an active solar cell material via a technique developed in house.
Power Roll is currently working with a perovskite solar ink, and has already achieved 11% efficiency, with a roadmap to bring this to 20%. Power Roll also states that its substrate is compatible with any photo absorbing ink.
And beyond solar, Power Roll also states that applying different material coatings to its microgroove film could also create both energy storage devices and capacitors. Potentially, they could create a device that is a solar cell on one side, with combined energy storage on the rear. The company has developed a roll-to-roll solution to produce the solar film, and promises production costs as low as $0.03 per watt.
Investors in the two recent funding rounds include Indigo 7 Ventures (i7v), Kero Development Partners and RAB Capital, as well as the conversion to equity of a £1.25 million loan from the UK government’s Future Fund scheme.
“Power Roll’s technology has the capacity to change the outlook of solar installation the world over, not only by a dramatic reduction in cost, but also because it opens up the use of a huge variety of sites and buildings that would not be suited to traditional solar installations,” said Doug Duguid, Chief Executive of i7v. “Power Roll’s core microgroove technology has a number of other applications beyond solar, and as a result, they have created a platform product with potentially multiple uses, which is very appealing to us as an investor.”
The March 2021 edition of pv magazine will feature a closer look at the possibilities new thin film technologies such as Power Roll's bring, and the company's plans for a scale up. Visit our shop to subscribe

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/12/spain-introduces-ev-charging-stations-using-second-life-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021",Spain introduces EV charging stations using second-life batteries,"From pv magazine Spain
Energy multinational Repsol and Spain-based EV charging station provider Ibil, a 50% subsidiary of Repsol and the Basque Energy Agency (EVE), have brought a charging station for electric vehicles, with energy storage using second-life batteries, into service. The station is located on the N-1 road close to Tolosa, in the Basque Autonomous Community.
Spanish inverter maker Ingeteam supplied the 50 kW fast recharge point and the battery inverter.
According to a joint statement from Repsol and Ibil, this project has different benefits: It allows the installation of fast charging points (50 kW) in places where it would not otherwise be feasible, either due to lack of electrical power or where technical difficulties result in an excessive increase in investment. Thanks to the second-life batteries, the grid electricity required to provide the service is reduced by 70%; and a 50 kW fast charging point can be put into operation using a mains connection of only 15 kW.
The recharge station is suitable for almost any location, according to its designers, due to the minimum space required for the storage module – less than one square meter. “It significantly reduces the operating costs of the infrastructure, by up to 50%. [This is] mainly due to the lower contracted power,” the two companies said. “It also provides a second life to electric bus batteries, promoting the circular economy and sustainability.”
The system is designed to know when to take power from the grid to charge the batteries, and when to discharge from the battery to recharge the car. This function is monitored in real-time from the Ibil control center, which operates the grid. It is also designed to optimize the flow of energy from the grid and the storage system at all times.
This installation is incorporated into Repsol's electric recharging network, which already has more than 250 access points, of which 70 are fast charging and 2 offer ultra-fast charging.
In 2019, Ingeteam supplied the most powerful electric vehicle recharging system ever installed in Europe, also for a project led by Repsol-Ibil. The company installed four terminals capable of an ultra-fast charge at 400 kW, which allows vehicle batteries to be recharged in a time of between five and ten minutes.
This facility is located at the Ugaldebieta service station, in the town of Abanto-Zierbena. This ultra-fast charger model allows the creation of large charging stations of up to 1 MW.

Non-hydro renewables, primarily wind and solar, are set to represent 25.9% of the overall share.
The target proposal, which includes objectives delegated to local governments at province, municipality, and autonomous region level, is being sent to the NEA’s provincial branches, as well as major Chinese state-owned energy companies for “comments and suggestions” which need to be received by Feb 26th.
NEA said this target proposal is set to “ensure achievement of the policy target of non-fossil energy accounting for 25% of primary energy consumption by 2030” set by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2020. Once the targets are finalized, NEA will formally implement the objectives and take the responsibility for supervision of their implementation.
Silicon cell manufacturer Tongwei has signed an agreement for a strategic cooperation partnership with JinkoSolar, to focus on better supply chain cooperation.
Tongwei will invest and take 30% shares in a joint venture with Jinko for wafer manufacturing with an annual capacity of 15 GW. Meanwhile, Jinko will also invest and hold 35% shares in a new polysilicon manufacturing base with an annual output of 45,000 metric tons (MT).
Additionally, Jinko committed to supply an additional 6.5 GW of silicon wafers to Tongwei from 2021 to 2023, based on a previously announced silicon purchasing order made from Tongwei. Last November, the two companies signed a long-term purchasing order that will see Jinko buy a total of 93,000 MT of polysilicon from Tongwei over the same period.
One of the largest Chinese state-owned energy power groups, China Huadian Group released its first tender for centralized purchasing of solar PV modules and inverters for 2021. The total volume is 7 GW for each product category.
Modules with power ratings above 530 Wp are set to account for 80% of the total, or 5.6 GW. String inverters rated at 175 kW or above will comprise 85% of the total, or 6 GW. The first 500 MW of both modules and inverters is required to start delivery in the second quarter, and the rest should be shipped in the second half of the year. The online tender will close on March 2nd.
Project developer Comtec Solar on Monday announced the signing of a five-year agreement with a local government entity in Changzhou to establish a “new energy industry fund” to construct, acquire and sell solar projects. Comtec, which announced its intention to switch from solar manufacturing to project development in September 2019, will work with the Jiangsu Changzhou Tianning Economic Development Zone Management Committee to set up the fund, with the latter to focus on “financial services support.” The partners also aim to establish a platform for the provision of PV industry services including training, finance, and construction, with an initial focus on small-scale distributed PV.
Irico New Energy, a subsidiary of state-owned electronics business Irico Group on Saturday signed a master supply agreement with its parent to sell up to RMB100 million (US$15.5 million) of photovoltaic products, such as coated and tempered glass. The supply deal started on Monday and will run for the rest of the year. Irico Group, which has a 47.52% controlling stake in Irico New Energy, is owned by state entity China Electronics Corp.
Shareholders in solar developer Xinyi Energy on Thursday voted through the RMB512 million purchase of 520 MW of Chinese PV generation capacity from the company’s parent, Hong Kong-listed photovoltaic glassmaker Xinyi Solar. The vote came after Xinyi Solar’s takeover approach for rival China Glass had lapsed a day earlier. Under Hong Kong takeover rules, Xinyi Solar is forbidden from making another approach for 12 months.

The Bolivian Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy announced a few weeks ago on its website that it intended to complete the construction of the second phase of the 50 MW project.
The plant is located 3,735 meters above sea level in the department of Oruro, 41 kilometers from the city of the same name. The Oruro photovoltaic solar plant was initially 50 MW, tendered by the local government in April 2016. The $54.7 million investment cost was financed by the French Development Agency AFD, the European Union and the Central Bank of Bolivia.
Its execution was carried out by ENDE Corporación, and the Spanish company TSK Electrónica y Electricidad is in charge of the project's construction. The first stage of the project began construction in August 2018, and it is already in commercial operation, injecting energy to the National Interconnected System – SIN.
In 2019, expansion of the project by another 50 MW was approved. At 100 MW, Oruro is currently the largest PV project in Bolivia. This second phase required an investment of US$54.7 million and the engineering, procurement and construction contract was again awarded to TSK.

In the month of January, the Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN) increased 5.8%, while other major market indices, includng the S&P 500 and Dow, decreased by 1.1% and 2.0 %, respectively, over the same time period.
In terms of monthly returns, the top five stock performers within the U.S. solar market for January were Sunworks (SUNW), SunPower (SPWR), ReneSola (SOL), Daqo New Energy (DQ), and Applied Materials (AMAT), which increased by 247%, 111%, 81%, 54%, and 12%.
While no clear indicators can explain SUNW and SPWR’s tremendous growth, the overall surge in solar stocks last month can be attributed to a combination of the Biden administration’s focus on climate change and a historic rise of retail investors entering the market.
Following a ‘Blue Wave’, the U.S. market is expecting more incentives to be implemented, specifically in the solar and energy storage sectors. They include (1) a permanent Incentive Tax Credit (ITC); (2) refundability or direct payments; (3) a storage ITC; (4) a permanent ITC at 10% for consumers, i.e. loans; (5) a jobs program and prevailing wage requirements, which the unions want, and; (6) national standardization of permitting and interconnection, among other priorities still to be determined.
The global market outlook for solar also remains positive for 2021. ROTH Analyst Phil Shen suggested that China’s demand in 2021 is forecast at 50 GW. It might even reach as high as 80 GW, depending on grid parity project demand and the development of solar module prices throughout the year.
EU installation capacity could also increase by 10 times from 2020 to 2030, driven by significant development growth on the commercial side and cost efficiency on the residential side.

Spanish multinational Abengoa has completed the construction of a demonstration hydrogen fuel cell plant, as part of the ‘Grasshopper project', which targets the production of sustainable energy – both electricity and heat– through the use of hydrogen.
Announcing the demonstration plant in early 2018, Abengoa stated that its aim was to develop a new concept for flexible and profitable megawatt-scale fuel cell power plants. The plants should offer flexible generation to support the regional grid.
The Grasshopper project is an EU-funded research effort, coordinated by Slovenian company Informatizacija Energetika Avtomatizacija (INEA). The project consortium also includes Johnson Matthey Fuel Cells Limited (JMFC), Nedstack Fuel Cell Technology B.V., Politécnico di Milano (Polimi) and Zentrum für Brennstoffzellen Technik Gmbh (ZBT).
Manufactured in the South of Spain, Abengoa's demonstration plant has been transferred to Abengoa Innovación's test facilities in the port of Seville, where it is already in the commissioning and start-up phase. The plant is now set to be shipped to Delfzijl in The Netherlands, where it will be integrated with a modern chlorine production plant, which produces surplus hydrogen as part of its activity. At this plant, Dutch companies Akzo Nobel and Nedstack have been testing fuel cell technology for over 12 years. This stage of the project aims to validate the fuel cell system in a representative industrial environment.
The project has been funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking under signed agreement number 779430. This body receives support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation framework program and the Hydrogen Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research associations. The Grasshopper project will has a duration of 36 months and a total budget of €4.4 million euros.

At the core of the Western Australian Liberals’ New Energy Jobs Plan is a AUD 9 billion ($6.9 billion) 4.5 GW renewable energy “mega project” encompassing wind and solar energy. The renewable energy would be converted to green hydrogen for export markets.
Zak Kirkup, the opposition leader for Western Australia, said that the Liberals would also underwrite the development of a 1.5 GW solar and wind energy project in the state by 2025. The party aims to complete a AUD 500 million transmission line extension from Three Springs to Geraldton, which would result in zero emissions and renewable electricity powering the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). The plan also mentions a 500 MW mega-battery array, which would provide grid security.
In addition, Kirkup has promised to “lead by example” and deliver zero emissions from the state government by 2030. This plan is inclusive of the public transport system, state vehicle fleet, and the state-owned electricity network.
Under the plan, state-owned coal-fired power stations in Muja and Collie would be shut by 2025. The current Labor Party government has already indicated that it will shut two of the four operating generators at the Muja Power Station between 2022 and 2024. However, it has not said when the whole facility may be shuttered.
Kirkup said that transitioning to renewables would be a necessary step to ensure that the state keeps pace with other countries.
“I want to make it perfectly clear that this will not impact the private sector. This is about the state government’s emissions and leading by example,” he said. “Our plan will assist companies transition to green exports and independent clean energy operations – if they choose.
Kirkup, who aims to unseat Premier Mark McGowan in the March 13 state election, said the Liberals’ New Energy Jobs Plan would attract AUD 16 billion worth of public and private capital investment over the coming decade, on top of the AUD 400 million spent by the state.
“It’s a mega-project, building the largest renewable energy project in Australia’s history, with wind, solar and large-scale batteries that will transform Western Australia’s energy system for the next 50 years,” he said.

If the events of the first few months are any indication of what the rest of 2021 holds for electric vehicles (EVs), it could prove to be a landmark year for the technology.
The administration of President Joe Biden created significant battery and EV demand through the “Made in America” executive order, signed in January. The order directs the federal government to replace its entire existing vehicle fleet with EVs.
At the beginning of February, Ford announced plans to almost double its EV investment to $22 billion through 2025. Along with the Mustang Mach-E, the company’s first electric Mustang, Ford plans to roll out its first E-Transit commercial van in late 2021 and an all-electric F-150 pickup in mid-2022.
In addition, the company has announced a $1.8 billion investment to produce fully electric vehicles at one of its Lincoln manufacturing plants in Canada. It has also started construction on a new factory to build the upcoming F-150 electric pickup next to an existing plant in Michigan.
Earlier this week, Toyota said that it will unveil two EVs for the U.S. market as 2022 models, as part of its plan to introduce 10 new EVs worldwide in the “early 2020s.” Ultimately, Toyota plans to have 40% of all new vehicles electrified by 2025 and 70% of all new vehicles electrified by 2030. The automaker is also working on releasing a solid-state-battery-powered vehicle in the early 2020s.
State-level steps
While the federal government and leading automakers are now quickly working on the electric transportation revolution, not all states have been as willing to embrace the change. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) recently released the State Transportation Electrification Scorecard, a report that analyzes and grades the comprehensive steps that some states have taken to help residents and businesses to use and charge EVs – and the lack of action taken by others.

Unsurprisingly, California has led the way, garnering 91 out of 100 points. It is the only state to set deadlines to electrify transit buses, heavy trucks, and commercial vehicles. It is also one of a few to offer assistance for lower-income drivers replacing older, high-polluting cars with zero- or near-zero-emissions vehicles. In addition, the state plans to deploy chargers in economically distressed and environmental justice communities.
Following California were New York (63.5 points), Washington, D.C. (59), Maryland (56), Massachusetts (54.5), Washington (54), Vermont (54), Colorado (48), Oregon (47), and New Jersey (44). Twenty states earned 15 points or less.
The report also looked at the country regionally, highlighting one standout state in each region. New York led the Northeast because of incentives for individuals and fleet owners to purchase EVs, state and utility support for EV charging installations, and EV infrastructure equity programs.
Colorado led the Southwest because of the state’s adopted goal of having 940,000 EVs on its roadways by 2030. It also has incentives for EV charging investments and requirements for utilities to file plans for EV charging infrastructure.
Minnesota led the Midwest because state regulators issued guidelines on utilities’ investments in charging stations, bringing $23.6 million in funding. The state has also signaled its intent to adopt California’s zero-emissions vehicle program for personal vehicles.
Virginia led the Southeast due to its solid incentives for electric trucks and buses, and time-varying electric rates for home and workplace chargers. It has also taken steps to decarbonize the electric grid.
After combing through policies and evaluating each state individually, ACEEE found a handful of policies that have had the greatest impact on the adoption of EVs. They include zero-emission vehicle mandates and EV deployment targets, financial incentives for EV purchases, and incentives to install vehicle chargers.
While these have been found to be the most effective policies for spurring the transition to electric transportation, they aren’t the most commonly used. According to ACEEE, the most common policies are using federal funds to buy electric transit buses (48 states), utility programs that offer lower electric rates at preferred times for Level 2 EV charging (36 states), and incentives to buy large electric pickups and delivery trucks (27 states).
