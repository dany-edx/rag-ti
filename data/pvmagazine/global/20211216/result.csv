The resilience of solar during the Covid crisis of last year has again been demonstrated this time around, with the trade body expecting a record 25.9 GW of photovoltaic generation capacity to have been added in the last 12 months – a European high.
That has prompted the authors of the EU Market Outlook document for 2021-25 to “significantly” raise its forecasts for the four years ahead and the study also highlights how the leaps made by the industry have left the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) set by EU member states at the end of 2019 looking somewhat unambitious.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
Estonia and Latvia have already achieved the solar targets they set themselves for 2030 and Poland, emerging market Ireland and Sweden are all expected to follow suit next year, according to SolarPower Europe. Slovenia – one of only two EU member states, along with Belgium, to have installed less solar this year than in 2020 – will be the laggard, or perhaps the only nation with far-sighted politicians, as it will attain its solar goal at the end of the decade, one year after Italy – where permitting hold-ups continue to delay installation; Austria, and Slovakia.
By contrast, a slew of member states will secure their NECP ambitions well before 2030, prompting SolarPower Europe to call for much more ambition when the goals are due to be revisited, in 2023.
The trade body also used its latest report, published yesterday, to renew a call for the EU to raise its ambition of having 32% of final energy use from renewables in 2030 to 45%, rather than the 40% suggested by the European Commission. Appeals for faster permitting and 20 GW of polysilicon-to-module solar manufacturing in the bloc, by 2025, were also aired again.
With modelling by Finland's Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology having estimated Europe will need 870 GW of solar in 2030 to stay on track for the most affordable route to a maximum global temperature rise of 1.5C this century, SolarPower Europe's, most likely medium scenario predicts 672 GW will be installed by that point, via 328 GW in four years' time.
In terms of the numbers, Germany continued to lead the way this year, with 5.3 GW of solar added, ahead of Spain (with 3.8 GW of new PV), the Netherlands (3.3 GW), Poland (3.2 GW), and France, which added 2.5 GW this year after a figure of just 800 MW in 2020. That means Germany now boasts 59.9 GW of Europe's 165 GW of installed solar generation capacity. Italy, the only EU member state SolarPower Europe did not deem to have a sunny outlook for solar, in terms of political backing, reached 22 GW of photovoltaics this year, ahead of Spain (with 17.9 GW), France (13.2 GW), the Netherlands (13.1 GW), Poland (7.1 GW), Belgium (6.9 GW), Greece (4.8 GW), Hungary (2.9 GW), and rising star Denmark (2.8 GW).
That meant Denmark and Sweden entered the top 10 of EU solar markets in place of Belgium and Portugal, with the 200 MW of solar added in Denmark in 2020 rising sixfold to 1.2 GW this year. Greece more than trebled the 500 MW installed last year, to 1.6 GW, with Hungary and Italy each adding 800 MW this year, and Sweden 700 MW.
The rapidly expanding solar market in the Netherlands, notwithstanding its well-publicized grid constraints, meant the nation supplanted Germany as the EU member state with the highest per capita volume of solar capacity, with 765 W per person, or a fifth of all households according to trade body Holland Solar. Germans had 715 W each, Belgians 596 W, the Maltese 491 W, the Danish 490 W, Greeks 465 W, Estonians 412 W, Luxembourgois 405 W, the Spanish 384 W, and Italians 364 W.
Peering ahead, SolarPower Europe's medium scenario anticipates around 30 GW of solar will be added in the EU next year, even though rising panel prices are set to continue for “several more months,” before returning to more normal levels in the second half of 2022, according to the trade association.
The new German government's decision to double its 2030 solar target to 200 GW will help the EU market recover to 38.5 GW of new solar in 2023, according to the 68-page report, with 44.6 GW expected in 2024 and 49.7 GW the year after. Within those figures for the bloc, Germany will add 47.7 GW of solar out to the end of 2025, with Spain, helped by a “gigantic pipeline under development” and being “probably the world's largest market for subsidy-free solar,” adding 18.9 GW.
The Netherlands could add a thumping 17 GW over the next four years, according to SolarPower Europe, ahead of France (15.1 GW), Poland (9.7 GW), Denmark (8.9 GW), and Italy (7.1 GW). Sweden is expected to add 4.6 GW to 2025, to reach a total 6.3 GW, and the European trade association expects the Irish market to take off, with its current 100 MW of solar expected to be swollen by 2.7 GW over the next four years. Belgium, though, will add only 3.9 GW to the 6.9 GW it has, over the same period, in part because the government has not made enough plans to expand its grid networks.
Lack of grid capacity and land continue to be problems in Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland; and Austria and Czechia will also suffer from a lack of solar workers, according to the study. Renewables auction plans should be fleshed out in Croatia and in Portugal, said SolarPower Europe, with the latter expected to hold its next procurement round next month. With permitting troubles again cited in Italy, as well as Spain, Portugal, and France, the report also suggested Ireland's varying local requirements be standardized. And there is rising opposition to big solar in some parts of Spain, as well as in Czechia, where negative perceptions remain of how developers cashed in on over-generous feed-in tariffs in the past. A lack of sufficient finance in Cyprus, which also suffers from having no connection to mainland electric grids, was also mentioned.
Other interesting nuggets from the document included the fact plans to restore lowland and wetland habitats in Denmark, for natural carbon capture purposes, could free up agricultural land for solar; the fact the Netherlands is proposing biodiversity-gain certification for solar parks to combat NIMBY (not-in-my-back-yard) sentiment; and that rising wholesale energy prices in Spain are again burnishing the solar business case. Back in Denmark, local elections last month held up solar projects and, in Poland, an expected fall in small-scale solar from April – when net metering will be replaced by net billing – is set to be counterbalanced by more big projects, starting with a 998 MW clean power auction this month which is expected to be dominated by PV.
SolarPower Europe added, if all its policy wishes are granted, the bloc could add 35.7 GW of solar next year, rising to 65.8 GW in 2025. On the flipside, obstructive policy, trade conflicts, import bans and the like could lead to its low scenario, of 22.2 GW of solar next year, climbing to 32.3 GW in four years' time.

The transaction is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of next year and is part of Rocket Lab's plan to vertically integrate its products and services. “As one of only two companies producing high-efficiency, space-grade solar cells in the United States, Solaero’s space solar cells are among the highest performing in the world and support civil space exploration, science, defense and intelligence, and commercial markets,” Rocket Lab said in a statement. “In combining with Rocket Lab, Solaero will tap into the company’s resources and manufacturing capability to boost high-volume production, making high-performing space power technologies available at scale.”
Solaero operates an 11,000m² manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where it produces different kinds of space solar cells.
These include a 30%-efficient four-junction device on a germanium substrate; a 30.2%-efficient triple-junction solar cell optimized for low earth orbit (LEO) applications; a 29.5%-efficient standard triple-junction cell based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge); a 29.4%-efficient triple-junction device based on a germanium substrate; and an inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) cell with an efficiency of 32%.
Solaero claims its solar cells and products were used in more than 1,000 space missions since the company was created in 1998. “Solaero’s products have played key roles in some of the industry’s most ambitious space missions, including supplying power to NASA’s Parker solar probe and [the] Mars Insight Lander, the largest solar array ever deployed on the surface of Mars; and several Cygnus cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station,” it further explained.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/16/solar-redox-flow-cell-for-residential-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,PORTUGAL",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 16, 2021",Solar redox flow cell for residential energy storage,"Solar redox flow cells (SRFCs) are devices that can store electricity by harvesting sunlight via a photoelectrochemical (PE) panel. These storage devices are attracting increasing interest from scientists and research institutes and have been developed so far only at research level.
Two of the biggest challenges these batteries have to overcome, along with other minor issues, are the fact that their performance is restricted by inefficient photoelectrochemical reactions and that their storage capacity is limited by the physical dimension of solid electrodes.
With this in mind, scientists at the University of Porto have recently developed a solar redox flow cell for decentralized, residential energy storage.
“In our work, we designed, built, and tested the highest photoactive-area solar redox flow cell device ever reported to date,” the research leading author, Telmo da Silva Lopes, told pv magazine. “We also provided important device design guidelines that will help develop future up-scaled SRFCs, an emerging technology that uses semiconductor-based photoelectrodes to store solar energy in chemical bonds and heat.”
Called SolarFlow25, the device was designed to optimize light absorption by the semiconductor and ensure effective diffusion of redox species while offering minimal electronic and ionic transport resistance.
The device has a 25cm2 photoactive area and was built with a large-area PE cell linked to the system structure via small stainless steel screws and an auxiliary metallic rim. “These screws create an electrical path between the conductive metal layer on the perimeter and edges of the PE and the end plate, allowing for … effective current collection,” the Portuguese group explained. “To assemble the cell, both anodic and cathodic compartments were screwed together using bolts with a Nafion 117 membrane in between.”
The system also relies on ferrocyanide/anthraquinone (2,7-AQDS) redox flow chemistry and nanostructured hematite (α-Fe2O3) photoelectrodes combined in series with a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) that is able to produce a photocurrent of approximately 40 mA.
The SRFC was connected to a conventional redox flow cell (RFC) and its performance was tested. “By connecting the SolarFlow25 cell with a conventional RFC, the electrochemical fuels were photocharged and discharged in continuous operation exhibiting an unbiased photocurrent of around 11 mA during photocharge (100 mW/cm2) and a round-trip efficiency of around 0.15%,” the academics emphasized. “These photocharging results were further improved using a sponge-like nanocube, α -Fe2O3, photoelectrode that provided an unbiased photocurrent of around 40 mA during photocharge, resulting in a round-trip efficiency of around 0.44% during the 10 cycle/14-hour demonstration.”
These efficiency levels are claimed to be fourfold higher than any other results reported for α-Fe2O3-driven SRFCs to date.
The academics stressed that no leakage or electrical problems were detected for the device during the experiment, which they said lays the ground for further improving the proposed technology. “We hope that our contribution will help bring SRFCs closer to commercialization, on its way to revolutionize energy storage for households and stationary applications,” Silva Lopes concluded.
The device is described in the study “A 25 cm2 Solar Redox Flow Cell: Facing the Engineering Challenges of Upscaling,” published in Advanced Energy Materials.
A  low-cost redox flow battery powered by perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells was presented in July 2020 by researchers from the Wisconsin-Madison and Utah State universities, in the United States. This device combines photo-electrochemical solar cells with aqueous organic redox-flow battery technology and has solar-to-output efficiency of 20.1%.

The solar park will likely become operational by the end of 2023. It will consist of two 50 MW units – the PV Jeziórko 1 array and the PV Jeziórko 2 plant. Once completed, the facility will be Poland's largest solar plant.
The company said it has also secured permits to build 200 MW of solar. This includes two more plants totaling 13 MW, for which it recently obtained permits in Łosice, Masovia province, in eastern Poland.
“This is a lot considering that obtaining all approvals, environmental permits and other relevant documents is a complex process lasting many months,” said PGE Energia Odnawialna president Marcin Karlikowski. “In the next years, this process will accelerate even more, which will allow us to announce tenders to allocate 300 MW or even 400 MW of PV every year.”
The project is part of the company's plans to deploy 3 GW of solar by 2030.
In 2019, PGE signed a deal with silver and copper producer KGHM Polska Miedź SA (KGHM) to deploy 500 MW of solar capacity at one of the miner’s facilities.
PGE Energia Odnawialna currently operates 33 hydroelectric power plants, 14 wind farms and one 600 kW PV power plant, with a combined capacity of 2.1 GW. Its parent company, however, is still among Europe’s largest coal power producers, with two large lignite mines and around 40 power plants that mainly use hard coal and lignite. It currently has a share of around 36% of Poland’s energy market. Poland's Ministry of State Treasury holds a 57.39% stake in the company.

WoodMac Renewables & Power lowered their projections by 25% for solar power capacity to be installed in the United States in 2022, according to the US Solar Market Insight report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. They’ve also added a big 44 GW asterisk next to all projections going forward — a projection increase dependent on the passage of the Build Back Better/Reconciliation Bill.

 
From the hand that takes, WoodMac cited supply chain constraints and logistics challenges as they lowered their quarterly estimates for deployed solar power capacity estimates in the United States. The 25% reduction – of 7.4 GW  implies that prior projections were 29.4 GW, and that revised projections are now 22.2 GW of deployed capacity.
This US Solar Market Insight report adds to a bevy of projections suggesting that market projections are getting complicated going forward.
Michelle Davis, the report’s author at WoodMac, says costs have increased across all market segments for the second quarter in a row — and that these increases have undone two years worth of hardware price decreases. Other than the price hikes that hit the residential market in 2015, this year’s supply chain price increases were the highest they’ve been since WoodMac started tracking the data in 2014.
Additionally, solar panel availability and pricing has been affected by anonymous petitioners who sought to add additional tariffs to solar panel imports. Their petitions have since been rejected.
WoodMac suggests that these challenges, in addition to interconnection woes, is at least partially responsible for the commercial and community solar sectors slowing by 10% and 21%, respectively, quarter over quarter.
 

Amidst these price increases and market complexities, utility scale capacity has continued to set quarterly deployment records, as the sector is likely to be insulated from hardware costs by its long term supply chain choices. However, one might assume the utilities are taking a harder hit on shipping price increases – and delays – due to their large product volumes.
WoodMac also sees that residential installation volume has kept up growth. This may be due to the sector’s higher priced projects and premium product selection, which are better able to absorb subcomponent price increases.
In the end, the growth of two out of three sectors helped solar power to continue increasing its market share of new generation capacity as the USA seeks to extend a nearly two-decade march toward a cleaner grid.
 

 
Along with this downward projection, the group suggests that the solar market might increase by 43.5 GW of deployed capacity between 2022 and 2026, if the Build Back Better/Reconciliation Bill is signed with the current solar tax benefits in place.
WoodMac projects that 14 states will see at least a 1 GW of solar capacity increase due to the legislation, with another 14 states adding 500 MW of capacity. Texas alone could add 7 GW of capacity.
The most recent headline on the bill is that the US Senate has released their draft version of the document. The changes in the Senate version versus the House’s version include adding tracking manufacturers to incentivized hardware manufacturers list, as well, pulling the “Direct Pay” version of the 30% tax credit forward to projects installed in 2022 for residential customers — matching business projects.
The 10 year, 30% Tax Credit extension along with the “Production Tax Credit” for large scale projects are expected to greatly increase capacity.
Some projections even suggest that capacity in 2022 might slow a bit because the pressure to complete projects before 2023, when the prior tax credit would have expired, is no longer there.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/16/low-bandgap-gainnassb-solar-cell-for-multi-junction-architectures/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 16, 2021",Low-bandgap GaInNAsSb solar cell for multi-junction architectures,"A research group from the Tampere University in Finland has developed a solar cell made of gallium-indium-nitride-arsenide-antimony (GaInNAsSb) that incorporates gold-based back-surface reflectors.
“This particular low-bandgap GaInNAsSb cell is developed to be used as part of lattice-matched multi-junction solar cells,” the research corresponding author, Riku Isoaho, told pv magazine. “Essentially these cells are meant to be used as the bottom junction in multi-junction architectures, absorbing the infrared wavelengths of the spectrum, boosting the efficiency of multi-junction devices that could then be employed in concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) for terrestrial power or in satellites for space applications.”
The cell has a “p-i-n” layout and an energy bandgap close to 0.8 eV. It was grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which is an evaporation technique implemented in an ultra-high vacuum for the deposition of compounds of extreme regularity of layer thickness and composition, and its structures were made with undoped GaInNAsSb absorber layers with a thickness of either 350nm or 700nm and a nitrogen concentration of around 6%, which were placed on a 210μm thick n-GaAs substrate. A four-layer anti-reflection coating (ARC) made of titanium oxide and silicon oxide (TiOx/SiOy) was deposited on the n-side of the cell using ion beam sputtering.
The performance of the device was assessed through external quantum efficiency (EQE) and light-current-voltage (LIV) measurements under standard solar illumination conditions. The EQE is the ratio of the number of energy carriers harvested by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy incident on the cell itself.

The highest EQE, with a peak value of 0.79, was reported for a cell made with a 700nm GaInNAsSb absorber layer which also showed a lowest bandgap energy, of 0.78 eV. It also exhibited a short-circuit current density of 15.2 mA/cm2. According to the scientists, these values show the potential of low-bandgap GaInNAsSb to achieve current matching in advanced solar cells with five or more junctions.
“While the MBE production costs are generally higher compared to the commercial metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) approach, when it comes to advanced solar cell concepts, such as multi-junction devices with four or more junctions, our approach has the advantage of being fully lattice-matched, enabling much thinner and simpler architectures compared with alternative technologies, which is expected to offset the MBE fabrication cost,” Isoaho further explained. “Moreover, we want to note that significant advances in the functionality, whether linked to superior efficiency, light weight, flexibility, or all, would reduce the sensitiveness of cost at cell level by enabling more advanced power systems.”
According to him, the building blocks for multi-junction devices implementing these low-bandgap subcells are already at a good level of maturity.”In order to fully assess their commercial potential, we need to complete full integration in five or six-junction architectures and then assess the performance for specific applications. In general, we are aiming for proof-of-concept level at this point.”
A complete description of the cell can be found in the paper “High performance low-bandgap (0.8 eV) single junction GaInNAsSb solar cells incorporating Au-based back surface reflectors,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
The same research group unveiled, in March, a III-V multi-junction solar cell that is claimed to have the potential for reaching a power conversion efficiency of close to 50%.

DroneBase, a US aerial imaging services provider, has acquired India-based data analytics specialist AirProbe. The acquisition expands DroneBase’s footprint throughout the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, while giving it access to AirProbe’s proprietary artificial intelligence solution for aerial solar inspections and proprietary data analytics.
The AirProbe solution reduces the time needed to analyze aerial inspection data of solar energy systems by up to 50%. This allows solar owners, operators, and financiers to more quickly take action to fix high-value anomalies and defects to increase energy generation and improve return on investment.
AirProbe has inspected about 22 GWp of assets throughout the world, including rooftop projects. It has a cumulative 5 GW of solar assets in India. 
“As both the number and size of solar energy systems deployed grow exponentially, inspecting and maintaining millions of systems will become more critical and more complex,” said Dan Burton, CEO of DroneBase. “DroneBase solved how to scale solar energy inspections and data capture and AirProbe solved how to scale solar data analysis with AI: together our solution is truly unbeatable.”
Asset owners can use the tech to reduce their dependence on certain activities that used to be done manually. For instance, by using AI and drone inspections for construction monitoring, project owners can now visualize project sites and monitor progress remotely with a high degree of accuracy. 
“Our mission at AirProbe has been to increase the adoption, reliability, and efficiency of solar energy systems by developing the best AI-enabled software solution. That aligns perfectly with DroneBase’s mission to continually deliver the best, actionable intelligence so that solar energy system operators and financiers can deliver more clean energy and grow their bottom line at the same time,” said Aditya Bhat, the founder of AirProbe. 
Bhat will be based in Bengaluru, India, and will oversee operations in the Asia-Pacific market. The companies did not disclose the terms of the acquisition.

Mining giant Fortescue Metals Group’s Chichester Hub iron ore operations are now being powered by solar energy, following the completion of the 60 MW Chichester Hub Solar Farm in the northern part of Western Australia.
The Chichester Hub Solar Farm – which is developed, owned and operated by Alinta Energy – has been operating at full capacity since late November. It has already powered up to 100% of daytime operations at Fortescue’s Christmas Creek and Cloudbreak mining sites.
It is expected that the solar farm, which includes more than 160,000 solar panels spread across 120 hectares, will displace about 100 million litres of diesel per year. The mining operation’s remaining power requirements will be met through Alinta’s existing 145 MW gas-fired Newman power station and 35 MW/11 MWh battery energy storage system.
Alinta Managing Director Jeff Dimery described the solar farm, which is part of the Alinta Fortescue Solar Gas Hybrid installation, as a “benchmark renewable project.” He said the start of operations is a giant leap forward in the race to a low-carbon energy future.
“We took an ambitious brief from Fortescue, who wanted to dramatically slash their emissions, and made it a reality in just three years,” Dimery said. “I can’t understate the engineering challenge of designing and building a renewable solution on this scale, in a harsh environment like the Pilbara, to meet the reliability standards of mines like these.”
The project also included the construction of approximately 60 kilometres of transmission line linking Fortescue’s Christmas Creek and Cloudbreak mining operations to the solar farm and Alinta’s existing Newman power station and battery energy storage system.
Fortescue CEO Elizabeth Gaines said completion of the solar farm marks a major milestone in the delivery of Fortescue’s decarbonisation strategy, as the company works toward its ambitious target of being carbon neutral by 2030 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
“The project is a practical example of Fortescue delivering on its ambitious carbon neutrality target and demonstrates that renewables can power the energy needs of Australia’s mining and resources sector,” she said. “As Fortescue transitions from a pure play iron ore producer to a green energy and resources company, this milestone is a critical part of our Pilbara Energy Connect project which together with the Chichester solar farm will see 25% of Fortescue’s stationary energy powered by solar.”
The project forms part of Fortescue’s plan to develop an integrated renewable energy power network in the Pilbara region. ARENA Chief Executive Darren Miller said the commencement of operations at the solar farm is a major boost towards a low carbon energy future.
“This is a monumental step forward to see solar and battery storage help to displace diesel on mining sites,” he said. “Optimising the transition to renewable electricity has been a key priority for ARENA and we are excited to see the Alinta Energy and Fortescue project now successfully using solar energy for the day-to-day operations of the mines.”

The US House of Representatives has unanimously passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. If enacted, the law would ban all imports from China's Xinjiang region, unless it can be proven that products were not connected to forced labor.
The region, which accounts for 50% of global polysilicon supplies, has fallen under scrutiny for its human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that President Joe Biden will sign the bill, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the legislation will be sent to the Senate for “swift action.”
In June, the Biden administration ordered a ban on US imports from Xinjiang-based Hoshine Silicon Industry, as well as three other companies in the region, and banned exports to what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Shortly thereafter, the US Department of Labor’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs took an unprecedented step by publishing a Federal Register Notice that targets polysilicon produced in the region.
In August, an anonymous group of solar companies sought tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The group called for anti-dumping and anti-circumvention tariffs, pointing to uncertainty in the companies’ supply chain ties to China, and suspected dumping of forced-labor goods.
Solar industry leaders described the tariffs as potentially crippling. The Department of Commerce rejected the request in November, which Solar Energy Industries Association president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called “a major victory for America’s 231,000 solar workers.”
In 2020, the EIA reported US imports of solar panels fell 27% in the third quarter, as tensions between Washington D.C. and Beijing rose. With sanctions increasing internationally, the United States is looking to bolster its own domestic supply chain as it pursues goals of decarbonizing energy.
The Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the Build Back Better (BBB) infrastructure bill, which includes incentives for the US manufacture of thin-film PV and crystalline silicon PV. The bill also added incentives for US-made solar trackers, inverters, and other renewable energy technologies. 
Simultaneously, Senator Jon Ossoff (D-Georgia) sponsored a bill passed by the House in November that also pursues a boost in U.S. manufacturing. Similar to the BBB provisions, Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act would offer tax credits for domestic manufacture of solar-grade polysilicon, wafers, cells, modules, as well as trackers and inverters.
With polysilicon largely sourced from the Xinjiang region, the United States is exploring other photovoltaics, like cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film panels, and Earth-abundant but relatively unstable perovskites.
