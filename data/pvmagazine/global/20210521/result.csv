German start-up Next2Sun Mounting Systems presented its new bifacial solar fence in a pv magazine spotlight on Thursday.
The newly launched product is a combination of a photovoltaic system and property fencing. With this system, solar power production is combined with an appealing design.
There are several variants of the bifacial solar fence for different applications in homes, businesses or agriculture. The self-consumption solution is offered to homeowners and enterprises whose roofs are not suitable for photovoltaic systems.
“The PV system has an output of 400 W per fence section,” Sascha Krause-Tünker, Next2Sun's managing director and chief sales officer, said during the event. The fence has a frameless glass-glass heterojunction module structure with a bifaciality of more than 80%. The system uses solar modules with n-type Pert or heterojunction technology.
The bifacial solar fence is available as a single-row variant with the usual height of around 1.20 to 1.60 meters and as a two-row version for higher fencing. A premium version for different kinds of buildings is also available.
The fence is made with a steel structure made up of two posts and bars. According to Next2Sun, there is a customizable fence element in the lower area with which the height of the overall construction can also be flexibly modified. The galvanizing of the material surface offers protection from external influences.
The bifacial solar fence is claimed to be easy to install with just a few screw connections. As an alternative to the rammed steel profiles, drilling or concrete foundations are also possible if the conditions require it.
The fence technology relies on Next2Sun's vertical mounting technology for bifacial photovoltaic panels. The mounting structure of Next2Sun allows vertically installed panels to exploit the incident solar radiation on their front and rear side and offer maximum performance during hours of high consumption at dawn and at dusk. Protecting from the wind and the sun, occupying little space, and easily integrated into fencing between fields or other structures, the system is ideal for  agrivoltaic applications.
*The lead text of the article was amended to reflect that Next2Sun is a German start-up and not a French one, as we previously reported.

Iberdrola has built an apiary at its Andévalo photovoltaic plant near Huelva, in Spain's Andalucia region, and another one at its Núñez de Balboa project in Usagre, near Badajoz in the country's Extremadura region.
The first solar park hosts 165 beehives and more than 8 million bees. The second set of 105 beehives host another 5 million bees.
The projects, which Iberdrola will continue to develop at its other PV plants in Spain, are designed to demonstrate how the location of pollinators in renewable facilities can improve the stability of ecosystems and enhance the yield of crops from surrounding agricultural land.
In solar parks, bees can live free of herbicides and agricultural chemicals, because the growth of herbs is controlled by grazing livestock. Such initiatives therefore create ecological zones that allow scientists to study how the cultivation of aromatic plants – eucalyptus, milflores, rosemary, broom and thyme – can improve the quality of honey, which will eventually be sold commercially.
Iberdrola inaugurated the Andévalo 50 MW solar plant in the municipality of Puebla de Guzmán (Huelva) in September. The electricity is exclusively used to produce Heineken beer in Spain under a power purchase agreement with the brewing giant.
The 500 MW, €300 million ($366.6 million) Núñez de Balboa project is located near the municipalities of Usagre, Hinojosa del Valle and Bienvenida. Iberdrola built the project in collaboration with Ecoenergías del Guadiana.
In November 2020, Endesa collaborated with the Carmona City Council on a pioneering initiative – a beekeeping project at its PV plants. The initiative includes the pilot cultivation of 3 hectares of aromatic plants.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/21/a-solar-atlas-for-qatar/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,QATAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 21, 2021",A solar atlas for Qatar,"The Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI), part of Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), has developed a solar atlas to quantify Qatar‘s solar resource and its geographical distribution.
“The link to the atlas should be very soon available on our website,” Veronica Bermudez, Senior Research Director at QEERI, told pv magazine. “In the meantime, it can be accessed in pdf.”
She explained that the atlas uses existing ground measured radiometric data that have been compared with available solar radiation data derived from satellite images in order to generate a model which, after proper validation, has been used to fit satellite data optimally to the local conditions of Qatar. “This has allowed us to improve the forecasting reliability of PV production, and to find the best suitable location and operation characteristics of large scale solar power plants,” she added.
For rooftop applications, the researchers developed a specific tool. In this regard, QEERI’s Energy Center has partnered with the country's Ministry of Municipality & Environment (MME) and the company Mapdwell, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that provides advanced tools for energy decision making, to develop a comprehensive solar analysis tool for rooftop PV assessment in Education City in Qatar Foundation (QF).
“QEERI managed the project and provided the solar radiation and meteorological measurements that formed some of the basic data inputs,” Bermudez explained. MME provided the underlying light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system, aerial photography and geographic information systems datasets that completed the data requirements for the project and Mapdwell developed the rooftop PV potential assessment application using its platform with the input QEERI and MME data.
“The maps show that the yearly sum of global horizontal irradiation is in the range of 2000 to 2200 kWh/m2,” Bermudez stated. “GHI is distributed more homogeneously throughout the country, while direct normal irradiance (DNI) exhibits higher variability as a consequence of the high aerosol loads; which have, also, a different seasonal behavior affecting the spatial distribution.” According to her, the seasonal variability is very low, compared with other countries, which qualifies Qatar as a country with highly feasible potential for PV power generation.
Despite this huge potential, Qatar has seen so far a very limited development of both rooftop and large-scale solar. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Middle Eastern country had just 5 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020. A promising development for utility-scale PV, however, came in January 2020, when Qatar General Electricity and Water Corp (Kahramaa) revealed a 800 MW solar tender delivered a final price of QAR0.0571/kWh ($0.016/kWh) – at the time, the lowest winning bid ever registered in an auction for large scale renewable energy.
As for distributed generation, Bermudez said that the lack of incentives provided by the government for homeowners and businesses to adopt solar technology at the domestic level is expected to restrain the growth of the solar energy market in Qatar.

London-based Ernst & Young (EY) has once again ranked India as the most attractive destination for solar PV investment and deployment in its latest Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index.
India scored 62.7 in solar attractiveness, with the sector expected to grow significantly and with generation from solar PV set to surpass coal before 2040. The country rose one place to rank third in the overall renewables rankings.
The EY Index lists the top 40 countries by renewable energy investment and deployment attractiveness. It looks at individual categories such as solar PV, concentrated solar power, onshore wind, offshore wind, biomass, geothermal, and hydro. For overall renewables, the United States remained the most attractive market, followed by China. 
EY expects the United States to hold its top spot for renewables attractiveness under President Joe Biden. “The re-acceptance of the Paris Accord, coupled with the recent announcement to cut GHG levels by 50-52% as early as 2030 and achieve 100% carbon-free power by 2035, will likely see increased investment interest in the U.S.,” it said.
China’s position was helped by the addition of 72.4 GW of new wind power in 2020, as developers rushed to finish their projects before an onshore wind subsidy cut. China and the United States also maintained their attractiveness for solar, ranking second and third, respectively.
Australia ranked fourth, followed by Egypt and Israel. Egypt’s score was helped by the nation’s ambition to increase the supply of energy generated from renewable sources to 42% by 2035. 
The United Kingdom rose one place to rank fourth for renewables investment. This was driven by close to 8 GW of new offshore wind capacity allotted for development, and the government’s approval of the largest battery-storage project, in addition to GBP 92 million ($130.4 million) of funding for innovative green technologies.

TCOs are materials that show both transparent and conducting properties and have been used for decades in both sides of contacted crystalline silicon (c-Si) heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells to provide lateral conduction for carrier collection. “Our recent research shows that Ag contact or Al contact are possible candidates for TCO-free SHJ solar cells with efficiency over 22% achieved,” researcher Shenghao Lee, told pv magazine. “We haven’t worked on the cost evaluation of this type of solar cells so far and for the first step of proof-of-concept we used titanium, gold, and silver (Ti/Au/Ag) as contact metals, which are not ideal for mass production.”
In the study Transparent-conductive-oxide-free front contacts for high-efficiency silicon heterojunction solar cells, published in Joule, the German group explained that TCO ensures sufficient lateral conductivity, but it has a good but not perfect transmission that leads to losses in short-circuit current density.
The cell was built with a phosphorus-doped n-type Czochralski (Cz) silicon wafer with a resistivity of 1.09Ωcm and a thickness of 170 micrometers. Ti/Au/Ag metal stacks were used for the contact with the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers.
The TCO was replaced with the lateral conduction of the c-Si absorber. “Without TCO as buffer layers, the direct metal/a-Si:H contact reduces the passivation quality, which can be avoided by increasing the a-Si:H layer thickness,” the academics stated, adding that the layers were deposited through a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition system.
This helped improve the fill factor of the cell's both sides, which they attributed to the reduced contact resistivity on the rear side. “Metal diffusion into a-Si:H layer was observed in the direct metal/a-Si:H contacts,” they further explained. “To inhibit the metal diffusion, an ozone oxidation was performed on the a-Si:H surface, giving rise to an improved open-circuit voltage in TCO-free SHJ solar cells without increasing the contact resistivity.”
The 2.0x2.0 cm2 cell achieved an efficiency of over 22%. “External quantum efficiency measurement shows that there is a gain in a current of 0.99 mA/cm2 by substituting the TCO layer with a silicon nitride (SiNx) layer,” the researchers concluded. “In this design, the reliance on indium in SHJ solar cell is relaxed while the design conflict between transparency and conductivity of TCO layers can be avoided.”

New research from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory looks at where to locate battery energy storage to provide the highest value.
The study finds that adding four-hour-duration batteries sized to 50% of the capacity of a solar or wind project raises the value by $3–$22/MWh depending on the year and region, with an average value of $10/MWh. The highest boost was found in California ($15/MWh), where the value of adding storage to solar rises in tandem with increased solar penetration.
The study said an even higher value comes from siting the same batteries separately, in a nearby high-value location.
It said this strategy results in higher value than co-located projects in nearly all markets and years. Values ranged from $2–$50/MWh, with an average value boost of $12.50/MWh. The highest values were found in constrained regions, like New York’s Long Island. Lower values occurred in Texas in certain years of the study period.
The report said that the “value penalty” of co-located projects can be reduced through a number of strategies, including recharging batteries from the grid during low-price hours, or sizing the interconnection capacity so both the generator and the battery can deliver power to the grid at the same time.
Separating generation from storage usually delivers higher value, but it may also lead to higher costs, the report said. That’s because a project developer will need multiple sites and grid interconnections, and may lose construction cost savings. A rough estimate found about $15/MWh in cost savings could be realized from using a single location.
The report said that a big part of the savings stems from the federal tax credit for renewable energy production that can also be applied to batteries, so long as the batteries are directly charged by the renewable generator. The tax credit, worth as much as $10/MWh, can tip the scale toward co-location, making coupled projects more attractive to a developer than separate locations.
The report said that at the end of 2020, 34% of solar and 6% of wind capacity were being developed in the U.S. with co-located batteries. In the West, 70%–90% of proposed solar is paired with storage, including almost all grid-scale solar projects in California. Almost two-thirds of all grid-connected batteries in California are part of hybrid solar + storage systems, rather than in potentially higher-value locations. In other regions, the share is typically less than 40%.

Australia’s first pumped hydro energy storage system to be built in 37 years, Genex Power’s Kidston Clean Energy Hub, is now set for construction, following the financial close of its Kidston Stage 2 project.
The green light for the AUD 777 million ($602.6 million) pumped hydro project (including transmission infrastructure), is a boon to Queensland’s renewable energy ambitions. The 250 MW/2,000 MWh (baseload) hub at the former Kidston Gold Mine will provide the equivalent of eight hours of energy storage and support the introduction of new renewable energy generation in the state. 
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is chipping in AUD 47 million on top of the AUD 9 million it has already spent on feasibility and development of the project, and AUD 8.9 million for the original 50 MW Kidston Solar Project back in 2016. Some of the financing comes from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF), with AUD 610 million. And as pv magazine has previously reported, EnergyAustralia will operate the 250 MW pumped storage asset for up to 30 years.  
The project requires a 187 km transmission line to connect the North Queensland Hub to the National Electricity Market (NEM). The Queensland government has vowed to support this infrastructure. 
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said that the Kidston project “will supply dispatchable, renewable energy to the grid when and where it is needed and provide a blueprint for how we store excess solar and wind energy at scale.” Miller described the project as a significant milestone and pointed to the significant role installations like Kidston have in progressing Australia’s energy transition.
“Storage solutions such as pumped hydro and large scale batteries are a key part in providing back up power and grid stability as highlighted in the Australian government’s first Low Emissions Technology Statement,” he said. 
The project will be completed by 2024 and will generate 500 jobs, including 20 permanent positions.

Primergy Solar will build, own and operate the project.
The agreement calls for nearly 1.8 million modules to be supplied over a four-quarter period starting in the second quarter of 2022. Project completion is planned by the end of 2023.
The Gemini Project is a 690 MW solar photovoltaic array and 380 MW/1,400 MWh battery energy storage installation. It will be one of the largest operational solar arrays in the United States once it is completed. It is expected to support the start-up and initial operation of Maxeon’s new Performance line module capacity for the U.S. solar market.
The project is expected to take a significant portion of the expected output of Maxeon’s new capacity during the first year of operation. It will use large-format G12 mono-PERC solar cells manufactured in Malaysia, with module assembly in Mexico.
