The plant features more than 310,000 bifacial solar panels, capable of absorbing solar energy from both sides. EDP Renewables said this maximizes its conversion into renewable electricity.  
The project can power nearly 100,000 households, or approximately 1% of the Portuguese population. It is expected to prevent the emission of 170,000 tons of CO2 per year.
The Cerca plant is EDP Renewables’ largest solar plant in Europe to date and takes the company’s volume of owned solar in Portugal to 540 MWp.
EDP Renewables Chief Operating Officer for Europe Duarte Bello said that the company is looking at “dozens of new solar projects” that will make a “significant contribution” to the energy transition.
EDP Renewables has set a target of commissioning an additional 1 GW of renewable energy in Portugal by 2026. It estimates that by 2026, half of its global investments will be in large-scale solar projects and decentralized generation.
In February, EDP Renewables commissioned Portugal’s second solar-wind hybrid project, after commissioning the country’s first at the start of last year.
The European Commission recently approved a €350 million ($379.4 million) Portuguese grant scheme for the production of equipment for renewable energy, to support the country’s transition to a net-zero economy.

“The goal of the initiative is to develop a cooling system for low temperatures, from -40 C to 12 C,” the company said. “The system will operate from PV panels that supply it with electricity 24/7. The cooling cycle will use only green components, water, and CO2.”
The total grant was awarded to a consortium that includes the Israeli storage company, the Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Spain's University of Rovira I Virgili, Inveniam Group, Iberia Energies Technip, and France's CNRS Promes.
Storage Drop said the system is a long-duration isothermal compressed air energy storage (I-CAES) platform consisting of three different parts: HyDrop, DropX, and Cool Drop technology.
The first part features high-pressure vessels for isothermal compression, underground piping for the storage of compressed air, and discharge vessels for release of energy into Pelton turbine for power generation.
The second part is a hydraulic isothermal compressor based on a water pump that compresses the air in an isothermal process and generates compressed air.
“This air compressor is a game changer in the air compressors industry and can provide factories with significant cost savings in electricity and maintenance together with a longer life expectancy,” said Storage Drop.
The third component is the cooling system itself, which stores high-pressure coolant for cooling and air conditioning purposes.
“CoolDrop target users are buildings, factories, data centers, industrial refrigeration and mobile refrigeration applications,” said the company.
The system reportedly has a roundtrip efficiency of more than 70% and a lifespan of over 30 years.

Germany-based Agro Solar Europe GmbH has developed a special mounting structure made of organic materials for applications in agrivoltaic facilities.
The company said it has tested its AgroSolar.FibR system together with technology partner FibR GmbH. It added that it will now begin deploying the structure in several pilot projects.
Instead of steel, Agro Solar Europe uses materials such as carbon, flax,  and wood fiber, as well as other unspecified renewable raw materials. The new structures are stable, resemble trees, and fit perfectly into the landscape, according to the manufacturer.
The wound lightweight construction of the organic material not only achieves a high load-bearing capacity, but also reduces the use of natural materials by 90%. In terms of weight, substructures can also be up to 90% lighter than structures made of steel.
Agro Solar Europe said that with better landscape integration, the acceptance of agricultural PV systems among the population can be increased even more.
“In the future, we will be able to manufacture our agrivoltaic systems from the same materials that are grown under the systems,” said Markus Haastert, managing director of Agro Solar Europe. “In this way, we are bringing added value back to Germany and defusing dependencies on other markets.”
Technology partner FibR said it is also satisfied with the results achieved thus far.
“With our resource-efficient lightweight construction, extremely long-span, highly load-bearing structures can be produced,” said the company's founder, Moritz Dörstelmannn, who is also a professor of digital design and fabrication at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). “In cooperation with AgroSolar Europe, we can optimally use this technology and thus create sustainable and efficient solutions for agriculture.”
Agro Solar Europe said it wants to start mass production of the system in 2026.

German dowel manufacturer Fischer is offering a new mounting solution for PV facade systems.
The company developed the system with German module manufacturer Solarwatt. It said the system is not visible from the outside and can be used for various types of buildings.
“This is a completely safe system that can be used in all relevant areas such as residential, office and commercial buildings, as long as an anchoring base is available,” said Benjamin Orths, international product manager for facade systems at Fischer. “Our substructure is suitable for all sealed areas and existing facades.”
The manufacturer said that due to the bracket system in which the modules are hung, no components such as fastening rails are visible from the outside. The system also allows for the elimination of clamps, which means the distance between the individual modules, can be reduced, resulting in a typical facade appearance.
Although no clamps are used, the system is safe, according to the manufacturer.
“For this purpose, all relevant wind loads and standards were considered,” the company said.
The system is reportedly easy to install and can be dismantled if necessary. It is initially being used on a steel structure, but can be used on any solid anchoring base.
Fisher's BWM Fassadensysteme GmbH unit built a facade PV system with the new mounting solution on a new factory building for German storage specialist Fenecon. The system offers 204 kW of power and is made of modules attached to the hall on an area spanning 1,050 m2.
The company adapted Fisher's system for rear-ventilated facades for the project. The new factory hall is a steel construction with facade cassettes. For the facade system, the ATK-103-PV profiles, horizontal, open C-profiles, were installed, which have a precisely fitting holder for brackets installed on the module. These profiles make it possible to easily mount the modules, according to the manufacturer.

In its financial results for 2023, the company said that its panel shipments increased by 76.4% year on year.
“At the end of the fourth quarter, we became the first module manufacturer in the world to have delivered a total of 210 GW solar modules, covering over 190 countries and regions,” it said, in reference to its cumulative shipments.
JinkoSolar recorded a turnover of CNY 118.68 billion ($16.72 billion), up 42.8% from 2022. It also posted a net profit of CNY 3.45 billion.
“Benefiting from our efforts in cost optimization, our profitability for the full year significantly improved year-over-year, with gross margin at 16.0%, compared to 14.8% in 2022,” said Jinko CEO Xiande Li. “Module shipment in the fourth quarter was 26.3 GW, exceeding our guidance.”
Li said that around half of the modules shipped in the fourth quarter went to the Chinese market, where they were sold at lower prices.
In its outlook for 2024, JinkoSolar said it hopes to ship between 100 GW and 110 GW.
“We expect our annual production capacity for mono wafers, solar cells and solar modules to reach 120 GW, 110 GW and 130 GW, respectively, by the end of 2024, with N-type capacity accounting for over 90% of total capacity,” it stated. “By then, we believe mass-produced N-type cell efficiency will have reached 26.5%.”

7,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/20/new-model-to-calculate-energy-yield-in-east-west-vertical-bifacial-pv-plants/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-20,New model to calculate energy yield in east-west vertical bifacial PV plants,"A group of researchers from the Netherlands' Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and Dutch solar radiation measurement company Kipp&Zonen have proposed a novel methodology to simulate the performance of bifacial vertical PV installations with an east-west orientation.
In the study “Modelling of bifacial photovoltaic farms to evaluate the profitability of east/west vertical configuration,” published in Solar Energy, the scientists explained that the proposed approach offers the advantage of enabling large scale simulations that take into account key factors such as non-uniformity of the rear irradiance and spectral impact.
“The non-uniformity of the irradiance and the spectral impact are considered by using a four-dimensional matrix as the base unit to perform annual farm simulation,” they said. “The first and the second dimensions represent spatial irradiance distributions along farm rows and modules’ cells, respectively, whereas the third and fourth refer to the time and sunlight wavelength.”
The model is also said to rely on a matrix structure that offers different design parameters for each row and makes it possible to consider different “unconventional” configurations. It calculates the irradiance for every wavelength of the spectrum at the cell level. For measuring the total irradiance on both sides of module, it considers sky irradiance, ground-reflected irradiance, and irradiance reflected by neighboring modules.
Furthermore, the new methodology estimates the irradiance incident on the ground by calculating the sky view factor. To predict solar module temperatures it uses a thermal model analyzing data for the selected locations and computational time restrictions.
The proposed method was validated by the researchers under different market scenarios and installation conditions and the performance of east-west vertical bifacial systems was compared to that of identical systems but south-oriented. They found that east-west installations may outperform their south-oriented counterparts depending on factors such as design parameters, curtailment, location and market conditions.
“Larger row-to-row distance values increase the energy yield and the revenues of both vertical and tilted PV farms up to a saturation value,” they also explained. “However, the impact of this parameter is higher for the former case hence an increase in the row-to-row distance fosters the profitability of east-west vertical over south-tilted configurations.”
Looking forward, the academics said the new method should include albedo and mounting system analysis, as well as offer the option of investigating projects with battery storage. “To further improve the computational speed of the algorithm, the necessity of extending the dimensions of problem to consider effects like non-uniformity of the irradiance could be replaced by empirical coefficients,” they added. “Their dependence on design and meteorological parameters could be investigated through machine learning techniques.”

8,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/20/hybridizing-thermoelectric-generators-with-photovoltaic-ground-source-heat-pumps/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ASIA,SOUTH KOREA",LIOR KAHANA,2024-03-20,Hybridizing thermoelectric generators with photovoltaic ground-source heat pumps,"Scientists from South Korea have conducted a feasibility analysis for combining thermoelectric generators (TEGs) with heat pumps coupled with photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems.
TEGs can convert heat into electricity through the “Seebeck effect,” which occurs when the temperature difference between two different semiconductors produces a voltage difference between two substances. The devices are commonly used for industrial applications to convert excess heat into electricity. However, their high costs and limited performance have thus far limited their adoption on a broader scale.
The researchers said TEGs are critical for achieving zero-energy buildings (ZEBs), although they still do not supply sufficient power for building heating and cooling systems due to low electric generation at present. “Indeed, the ongoing technological advancements in thermoelectric materials are anticipated to yield greater energy recovery potential. Consequently, it is imperative to undertake a comprehensive feasibility assessment concerning the integration and advancement of TEG applications,” they added.
In their work, the researchers sought to harness temperature differences in the inlet and outlet pipes of a heat pump to generate additional electricity. For this purpose, they designed and modeled a hybrid system for a residential house consisting of a PVT with an electric efficiency of 16%, a ground heat exchanger (GHE), and hot storage tank (HST) units.
Modeling
They also modeled a 10.5 kW water-to-water heat pump, with supplementary heating and cooling provided by a fan coil unit. A solar storage tank (SST) was used for additional flow adjustment control. The TEGs were installed on the inlet and the outlet of the PVT, GHE, and HST and had an application of 0.1 m × 1 m in each unit.
“The electric generations of TEG are compared based on conversion efficiency (zT),” the research group explained. “The electrical power generation of TEG produced in each unit was calculated with a zT value of 1. A commercially available thermoelectric element has a zT value of approximately 1, with a conversion efficiency of 10–15%.”
The modeled house was assumed to be located in Seoul, South Korea, and temperatures and solar irradiation were simulated between November and March. The maximum solar radiation during the heating period was 899.7 W/m2, while the daily average solar radiation was 247.7 W/m2.
According to the research team, solar radiation and external temperature significantly impacted the heat exchange rate of the PVT and, therefore, its ability to generate electricity in the TEG. The TEG produced 85 Wh in November, 18 Wh in December, 8 Wh in January, 44 Wh in February, and 196 Wh in March.
“During the coldest month of the year, January, the GHE was used to heat the house rather than the circulating water stored in the PVT. Thus, considerably less electricity generation was achieved in January compared to other months, resulting from the limited number of operating days of the PVT and the absence of temperature differences between the inlet and outlet,” they explained.
In contrast, the GHE was able to maintain a constant temperature difference of approximately 4–6 C between the inlet and the outlet, resulting in more stable production. The TEG produced 591 Wh in November, 1,170 Wh in December, 1,389 Wh in January, 1,050 Wh in February, and 675 Wh in March.
For the HST, the water outlet temperature was 42–47 C, while the inlet temperature varied depending on heating demand. This led the TEG to record a generation of 768 Wh in November, 1,309 Wh in December, 1,530 Wh in January, 1,196 Wh in February, and 921 Wh in March.
Feasibility
“In this study, the area of TEG necessary to accomplish a ZEB was estimated,” the researchers said, noting that the heat pump used 10,413 kWh of electricity throughout the heating period, while the PVT produced 3,432 kWh. “Therefore, additional power of 6,980 kWh was needed to accomplish a ZEB, and the installation area of the TEG based on zT was computed for additional power generation. Here, the installation area for the TEG application corresponds to the length of the pipe. When zT was 1, the required TGE installation space in each unit was calculated at 64.5 m2.”
The team concluded that the electricity generation of the TEG applied to the active system was “relatively small,” and a large area was needed to deliver additional power to the heat pump.
The academics said the TEG showed sufficient applicability as a power source for data loggers and other sensors in a building system and are confident that TEGs may be applied further and subsequently reach commercial maturity.
Their findings were presented in the study “Feasibility study on energy harvesting with thermoelectric generators in a photovoltaic-ground source heat pump system,” published on Energy Reports. The group included researchers from South Korea’s Pusan National University and Hanyang University.

Traditional metal grid contacts used as electrodes in solar cells are able to provide transparency, but they also require high doping of the cell surface layer to provide efficient photocurrent collection. Heavy doping and deposition are energy-intensive industrial processes, which is why they drive up production costs for similar solar cells. SWCNTs represent an alternative, as they are said to combine optoelectronic properties, flexibility, chemical stability, and simple transfer protocols to cover large surface areas.
“For optimal bifacial applications, both front and back electrodes should be optically transparent, chemically stable, and compatible with the adjacent layers,” the scientists stated. ” Their exceptional optical property renders the SWCNT films highly suitable as front electrodes for optoelectronic applications that encompass a broad spectrum of wavelengths.”
The academics used the floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method to prepare SWCNT films with an optical transmittance of around 95% at a wavelength of 550 nm, which they ensured exceeds that of common indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates.
The research group built the bifacial solar cell with a glass substrate, an SWCNT electrode, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of copper-doped nickel oxide (Cu:NiOx), a perovskite absorber, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), a phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer, and another SWCNT electrode.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the flexible device achieved a front power conversion efficiency of 17.1% and a high power-per-weight value of 73.75 W/g. It also showed the potential to achieve a bifaciality factor of over 98% and a power generation density of over 36%.
“SWCNTs are flexible and mechanically robust, which enables them to withstand repeated bending cycles,” the researchers explained. “These features make SWCNTs suitable for flexible perovskite solar cells and enable new visions for the development of bifacial devices.”
The scientists claim the new all-carbon-electrode-based cell may be produced at 70% lower material costs than monofacial perovskite cells using ITO or silver (Ag) for the electrodes. “The cost advantage is further enhanced when accounting for equipment costs, as all-carbon-electrode-based devices eliminate the need for expensive radio frequency (RF) sputtering or thermal evaporation processes for ITO or metal electrodes,” they added.
The novel cell concept is presented in the study “High-performance bifacial perovskite solar cells enabled by single-walled carbon nanotubes,” published in nature energy.

Zen Energy has confirmed that the construction of the 111 MW/270 MWh Templers battery energy storage system will now commence, as the South Australian company has successfully signed definitive documentation to secure funding from US-headquartered investment giant Stonepeak.
Stonepeak, through its portfolio company Peak Energy, has announced a AUD 70 million ($46 million) debt package that will facilitate the construction of the estimated AUD 200 million Templers battery project, which is being developed near Gawler, about 60 kilometers north of Adelaide.
Zen Energy, which will build, own and operate the 291 MWh project, expects the battery to be operational by early 2025. The company said that with financing now finalized, and detailed design and long lead procurement well progressed, site construction work will start in the second quarter of 2024.
The construction phase is expected to generate more than 180 jobs and take 17 months to complete, with Zen Energy anticipating that the battery will be fully energized and providing services to the South Australian grid by the second quarter of 2025.
ElectraNet, the owner of the South Australian high-voltage transmission network, has already executed a connection agreement with the battery to connect to the grid via the existing Templers 132 kV substation.
Zen Energy, which has signed a 10-year supply contract with the South Australian government, said that once complete, the Templers battery will be used to support the delivery of energy to its existing South Australia-based customers. The battery is also expected to provide grid-stability services to the wider National Electricity Market (NEM), paving the way for more renewable energy generation.
Zen Energy Chief Executive Officer Anthony Garnaut said reaching the final investment decision for the Templers battery was a key milestone in the company’s “significant growth path and marks our first 100% owned major asset, in the state where we started … The South Australian government, through committing to a long-term contract with a renewable retailer, has enabled this significant investment in further stabilizing the supply of renewable, affordable energy into South Australia.”
South Australia Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis welcomed the announcement, saying the Templers battery will add significant storage and stability to the electricity grid as the state moves towards being 100% powered by renewable energy by 2027.
“South Australia led the pack when we invested in the Hornsdale Power Reserve, and our state is now home to six grid-connected batteries with a total capacity of more than 500 MW,” he said. “These investments are a big vote of confidence in our state’s ambitious plan to get to net zero emissions in energy production by 2027, and to help the world along the pathway to decarbonization.”
The Templers battery project, acquired from UK developer Renewable Energy Systems (RES) in 2023, is Zen Energy’s first utility-scale battery energy storage system. The project is the second largest in South Australia, overshadowed only by AGL Energy’s Torrens Island power station energy storage system, which was unveiled in August 2023.
Zen Energy, which contracts electricity from 20 solar and wind farms across Australia to service a total customer volume of more than 1 TWh, is also pursuing plans to develop a large-scale hybrid solar and battery project in South Australia. The proposed Solar River project would comprise more than 200 MW of solar generation and at least 300 MWh of energy storage capacity.

Inverter supplier SolarEdge has launched a new service, Re-Energize, to extend retrofit upgrades to US customers.
Homeowners with SolarEdge projects installed before June 30, 2022, excluding Home Hub customers, can choose from several upgrade options through the Re-Energize program. The company said installers can add devices on the DC-side of the inverter, allowing for component installations with minimized main panel upgrade requirements.
The program offers promotional pricing for the company’s Home Hub inverter, which comes with a 12-year warranty and a five-year data cell card that extends the ability of the home energy management system to connect to smart devices and appliances. The five-year data card enables customers to connect to the company’s solar monitoring platform via their cellular plan.
Participants in Re-Energize are able to add more solar panels to their system, for up to 200% oversizing, add home battery backup, and connect home energy devices like EV chargers, and load controllers. The company said the promotional program allows installers to re-engage existing customers with an incentive to upgrade their system.
SolarEdge said installers interested in the program can get involved with a three-step process. First, installers order the Re-Energize Home Hub inverter from a distributor, then, the company performs an upgrade on a qualified SolarEdge inverter. A document outlining eligible inverters can be found here. Installers then ship the replaced inverter back to SolarEdge, becoming eligible for the promotional pricing. An equipment return document is available for installers here.
Residential solar equipment providers like SolarEdge and Enphase have had a difficult year, with their stock prices shedding over 50% of their value. High interest rates, lowered demand, and equipment oversupply in Europe have dragged down earnings in the industry. In January 2022, SolarEdge announced it would cut about 900 jobs, or about 16% of its total workforce. One of its major competitors in Enphase also laid off 10% of its workforce.

In 2022, solar PV entered a new growth dimension by connecting almost 240 GW of new global solar capacity in the grid and by displaying an impressive 45% annual growth rate. Moreover, in 2022, solar PV claimed two-thirds of all installed renewable-energy power capacity and by the end of October 2023, solar PV modules reached a record-low price, making PV currently the cheapest electricity source on the market.
However, the electricity grids can be affected by this high PV penetration. On the one hand, PV introduces a stochastic variability dependent on meteorological conditions, not only because of the day-to-night fluctuations, but also because extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and droughts, caused by climate change, which can potentially damage our grid infrastructure. On the other hand, the energy system integration of PV should transition towards a smart and digitalized system, supported firstly by digitalized PV manufacturing and system and secondly by intelligent distribution control. Therefore, power electronics-based energy resources, digitalization and cybersecurity have gained much prominence in the last few years, resulting in a growing focus on deploying renewable energy sources (RES), with PV at their forefront, in a secure and efficient way. The goal, as outlined by the ambitious European targets such as the RePower EU plan, is eventually to electrify a lot of sectors, including mobility, heating, and cooling.
In this quest, the physical system with the required equipment of the operating infrastructure is populated with a growing presence of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and more power electronics-driven operation, making it evident that the control of the converters will have to be adapted to better support grid automation. Currently, converters are operating in a grid-supporting principle and providing the required active or reactive power. They mostly focus on frequency control, meaning that the current evolution of systems power converters is operating in a grid-forming mode, i.e. playing a key role in the frequency and system control. The combination of these capabilities with storage, data sharing through a reliable and secure common European data space for energy, aggregators acts by means of data platforms. Furthermore, an emerging Blockchain technology offers the possibility of peer-to-peer trading and can provide additional grid flexibility and be a step in the right direction towards grid automation and digitalization. Motivated by these grid-related challenges and opportunities, The European Technology and Innovation Platform for Photovoltaics (ETIP-PV) is dedicating its 19th annual conference on the topic of “Digitalized and Responsive PV: The driver of Grid and Market evolution.” The conference will take place from 22 May at 13:30 to 23 May at 13:00 CET in Brussels. The registration is now open and you can register for free here.
The conference will specifically focus on the importance of PV digitalization and cybersecurity, as well as the operational policies needed to ensure that PV grid integration is not a bottleneck for the energy transition. The agenda includes high-level keynote speeches from the European Commission representatives and four panel discussions on the following topics:
1. PV systems intelligently contributing to effective distributed control
2. Energy sharing building functional Energy Communities
3. Highly responsive PV in a flexible power system
4. Enhancing PV industry efficiency through focused digitized control and data sharing architectures and models (co-organized by ETIP on Smart Networks for Energy Transition ETIP SNET)
In summary, from this conference you can expect four inspiring panel discussions with experts from both industry and academia; high-level policy keynote presentations from the European Commission addressing how we can drive practical changes; key takeaway insights into PV digitalization and cybersecurity; to gain better understanding on emerging technologies and innovations in grid integration; and last, but not least, networking opportunities with industry leaders.

The annual SNEC solar exhibition in Shanghai is an exhausting affair. On his return from the 2015 event, seasoned energy storage analyst Sam Wilkinson took a call from a journalist at The Times newspaper. A drained Wilkinson provided what proved to be front-page analysis.
The United Kingdom-based title was after Wilkinson’s take on the new Tesla Powerwall, the American EV maker’s residential battery. The product had been revealed by Elon Musk, with trademark chutzpah, on social media.
“I was literally in a taxi on the way home from Heathrow Airport and the next day I got a call that somehow the story had made the front page,” said Wilkinson, a director of clean energy technology at S&P Global Commodity Insight.
“It showed that there was this level of interest in the idea of energy storage. At the time it was a very nascent, niche, techy thing to do – to have a battery in your house. Fast forward, eight or nine years and it has become a very well understood, common thing.”
The Times was not alone in its enthusiasm for the Powerwall. “Sleek, chic, and unmistakably touched by that Elon Musk magic,” enthused pv magazine when featuring the first iteration of the Tesla Powerwall on its June 2015 cover (see left). The battery came at a price point far below rival products. Musk said the 10 kWh Powerwall would retail for $3,500, with the 7 kWh model going for $3,000.
“At the time I noted the price of Tesla batteries was significantly cheaper than what we’ve seen in the market, which would bring competition among other suppliers and push prices down,” said Wilkinson. “Which turned out to be relatively true, in the end.” By setting such an aggressively low price, Tesla blew open a previously nascent market segment.
Next generation
At the time, Tesla embodied the cutting edge in EVs and uber-geek cool. Powerwall 3, launched in 2024, will be the most powerful iteration – offering backup power even to large homes. It became available to installers in the United States on Feb. 16, with the move announced on X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk’s social media platform.
The Powerwall 3 was unveiled in Las Vegas at the RE+ trade show, on Sept. 12, 2023. While it has the same storage capacity as the Powerwall 2 – 13.5 kWh – a key differentiator is that it can provide more than 50% more power, at 11.5 kW of continuous power. It is a hybrid battery with the solar and battery inverter fully integrated.
At RE+, Tesla engineers highlighted that the Powerwall 3 offers installers quicker installation through a series of innovations. The new battery is smaller and lighter, albeit slightly deeper. It is 110 cm long, 61 cm wide, and 19.3 cm deep and its inverter, battery cells, and battery management system weigh in at 130 kg.
To lighten the load, Tesla has also worked with partners to develop a “dolly” – to help installers to lift the hybrid battery up and onto walls for mounting. That may seem like a minor detail but, crucially, it allows a single installer to fix the battery in place.
At $11,500, the Powerwall 3 is not looking to shake up the residential market based on price, as its predecessor did. However, the Tesla team at RE+ were keen to impress that quicker installation will enable installers to carry out more jobs, bringing down their labor costs.
Integrated system
Tesla’s in-house engineers developed the solar inverter inside the Powerwall 3 – displaying the company’s growing technical proficiency. The product deploys six maximum power point trackers (MPPTs), to optimize rooftop PV output.
“That has been an evolution of the [energy storage] space in general,” said Wilkinson. “We call them ‘integrated systems,’ with batteries and inverters combined together. The integrated product is obviously looking to provide a lot of other functionality and slightly more futuristic things, like VPPs [virtual power plants] and systems that can respond to things like electricity prices.”
The integrated approach precludes retrofit applications in homes with existing rooftop arrays, which Tesla says it will continue to serve with the Powerwall 2.
“It is all about the Tesla brand and they have that unique position of being the place you can go to get solar, storage, and an EV – and no-one else offers that full ecosystem,” said Wilkinson.
In the United States, Tesla is planning to sell the Powerwall 3 in a bespoke offering for homeowners. The company’s sales team provides integrated solar-plus-storage quotes based on a home’s size and power consumption. For even larger homes, up to four Powerwalls can be installed in series, offering a whopping 40 kW of power.
“It is not completely unheard of to have three or four Powerwalls, in the States,” Wilkinson said. “It is not an economic decision, it is purely a backup power play. And people will pay for backup in the US because grid outages are relatively common, compared to Europe.”
Thunder Down Under
Sydney-based PV and battery retailer Natural Solar sold the world’s first Powerwall in January 2016. The company’s founder, Chris Williams, said that while the first Powerwall was largely for early adopters, the Powerwall 2 opened up more of a mass market, with some 500,000 units sold globally. He said the latest version represents the next phase of the product’s evolution – which he described as an “interesting and exciting” one.
“It is tackling a new market as a solar inverter and a battery,” said Williams. “Having that all in one ecosystem, with data flowing from the Tesla app – and you can add an EV charger – I think is the next stage of ecosystem, from a customer perspective.”
Australia is a significant market for Tesla, for its utility scale and distributed batteries and its EVs and chargers. With a vast and growing rooftop solar fleet, and power outages increasingly common as a result of extreme weather events, there is a growing appreciation of backup power provision through residential solar-plus-storage.
Around 600,000 homes in the state of Victoria lost power on Feb. 13, some for days, after a storm downed a major transmission line.
EUPD Research monitors EV charging and solar-plus-storage installers in Australia and Europe. EUPD analyst Finn Bee said that the Tesla residential EV charger has consistently had the highest installer satisfaction rating of any brand. When it comes to batteries in Europe, however, there is more of a mixed picture.

“Our installer monitor, for which we survey more than 1,600 installers in selected markets across Europe and Australia, shows that Tesla has lost some market penetration but is still one of the best-known brands in many countries,” said Bee. “They are doing particularly well in Australia and Italy, two of the strongest markets for storage but are lagging in Germany, for example.”
Future outlook
While Tesla helped to create the residential energy storage market segment in 2015, the dynamic in 2024 is one of oversupply. The residential segment in the United States is depressed on the back of net metering reforms in key solar states. In Europe, inventories remain high.
“The market has cooled off in 2023,” said Wilkinson. “We’ve now got a pretty grim situation, especially in Europe. Every company, especially the newer Chinese entrants, was shipping, into Europe, crazy volumes when the energy-crisis boom was under way.”
S&P Global forecasts incremental residential energy storage growth in the coming years, with slightly more than 17 GWh of installations expected globally in 2024.
