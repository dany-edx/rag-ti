The Green Hydrogen Coalition, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and other partners have launched HyDeal LA, an initiative to achieve at-scale green hydrogen procurement at $1.50/kilogram in the Los Angeles Basin by 2030.
HyDeal LA aims to overcome the biggest barrier to the green hydrogen economy – its high cost – by launching a commercial green hydrogen cluster at scale.
Green hydrogen can be produced from renewable electricity and water or organic waste, can be used as a carbon-free fuel, and provide long-duration seasonal energy storage.
Phase 1 of HyDeal LA will design the supply chain needed to achieve $1.50/kg-delivered green hydrogen in the LA Basin. It also will strive to agree on terms and conditions to achieve the production, storage, transport, and delivery of green hydrogen at scale.
LADWP said that green hydrogen “is the key to reliably achieving 100% renewable energy.” The HyDeal LA effort aims to catalyze the supply chain needed to achieve large scale, low-cost green hydrogen power supply for LADWP’s local power plants.
In March, a study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory said that Los Angeles’ goal of reaching a 100% renewable, reliable, and resilient grid could be met as early as 2035. Doing so will require adding new solar, batteries, wind, and transmission infrastructure, along with operational practices that make more efficient use of those assets. The study did not address specific costs but said that economic impacts to the city would be “small relative to the overall size” of LA’s economy.
LADWP is currently leading the conversion of the Intermountain Power Project in Delta, Utah, to become one of the world’s first gas turbines designed and built to operate on 100% green hydrogen.
Dubbed “IPP Renewed,” the Intermountain project includes retiring existing coal-fired units at the power plant site and installing new natural gas-fired electricity generating units capable of utilizing hydrogen for 840 MW of net generation output. Additional investment will modernize the power plant's transmission system to Southern California, and develop hydrogen production and long-term storage capabilities. The new natural gas generating units will be provided by Mitsubishi Power and designed to use 30% hydrogen fuel at start-up, transitioning to 100% hydrogen fuel by 2045 as technology improves.
HyDeal LA is part of HyDeal North America, a commercialization platform launched by the Green Hydrogen Coalition. It is modeled after HyDeal Ambition, a similar project in Europe committed to producing and buying 3.6 million tons of green hydrogen per year for the energy, industry, and mobility sectors at €1.50/kg ($1.82) before 2030.
In addition to LADWP, HyDeal LA leaders include 174 Power Global, Mitsubishi Power, and SoCalGas. Key implementation partners include Clifford Chance, Corporate Value Associates, Cranmore Partners, Energeia, Marathon Capital, Sheppard Mullin, and Strategen.
Earlier in May, Mitsubishi Power and Texas Brine Co. agreed to develop large scale, long-duration hydrogen storage to support decarbonization efforts across the eastern United States.
This collaboration expands Mitsubishi Power’s capability to store hydrogen in salt caverns across North America. As one of the nation’s largest brine producers, Texas Brine and its affiliates have salt positions in New York, Virginia, Texas, and Louisiana that will enable access to major load centers in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and the Gulf Coast.
Expanding the use of salt caverns for hydrogen energy storage offers an opportunity to create an infrastructure for clean energy resources throughout the U.S. to benefit industries such as power, transportation, and manufacturing, that are targeting net zero carbon emissions.

London based Deloitte, which had held up publication of GCL's 2020 annual figures over the payment made in September 2019, on Friday resigned from its position, GCL told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today.
Having questioned the commercial rationale of the pre-payment when it first raised the issue – including after conducting on-site interviews – Deloitte recommended an independent accountant be appointed to carry out a forensic investigation into the payment, which GCL said it recouped RMB495 million (US$76.8 million) of last month, minus the unnamed contractor's expenses.
GCL, whose shares have been suspended from trading since the end of March as a result of the matter, opened an internal investigation into the issue and subsequently followed Deloitte's advice by appointing a Shanghai-based firm which is part of the Mazars global grouping, to look into the payment.
The manufacturer last week said the independent investigator would also look at whether the payment was made between “related parties.”
However, Deloitte tendered its resignation on Friday, according to GCL, which today added: “Deloitte and the company are unable to reach a consensus on the scope of [the] independent forensic investigation.”
GCL said Hong Kong-based Crowe (HK) CPA Ltd has been appointed to replace Deloitte as auditor on a temporary basis, subject to audit engagement acceptance procedures.
The heavily-indebted poly manufacturer and solar project developer failed to settle a US$500 million senior note at the end of January, retroactively triggering a cross default of other liabilities from the end of 2020. Plans to reissue the senior notes in question are progressing through the court system of Bermuda, where the company is registered for tax reasons.

German renewable energy company Baywa re has published the preliminary findings on the environmental impact of the 27.4 MW “Bomhofsplas” floating PV power plant located on a quarry pond in the Netherlands, which is currently the largest floating PV project outside of China.
The company said the environmental impacts of this plant have been investigated for over a year with the help of its Dutch subsidiary Groenleven as well as the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen and the research institute Buro Bakker/ATKB. “The first results of the environmental studies do not show any significant negative effects on the flora and fauna of the lake,” said Toni Weigl, from Baywa re. “Rather, the first results are positive and we are pleased to see that our floating PV system integrates so well into the surroundings of the lake.”
Baywa re explained that the oxygen content in the water under the floating modules has changed only minimally within a year. Wind and sunlight could still easily reach the water surface under the modules and the measured deviations were mainly caused by changing weather conditions. According to Hanze University, the water quality under the system is at the same, good level as that of the adjacent water surface.
Buro Bakker/ATKB has found, according to Baywa re, that the modules have resulted in less wind on the surface of the water which has, in turn, resulted in less erosion of the banks. This is claimed to protect the local vegetation and stimulate the growth of plants.
The effects on the fish population are still being investigated. In order to strengthen the underwater ecosystem and promote biodiversity, Baywa re attached protective mesh boxes, so-called “bio huts,” under the floating modules, filled with shells. Investigations lasting several years are necessary for complete results.
Baywa re said it wants to continue promoting floating photovoltaics while paying attention to biodiversity and water quality. The company is currently building another plant, in Uivermeertjes. After completion, this should have an output of 29.8 MW and, thus, be even larger than the front runner, “Bomhofsplas.”

The manufacturer will invest €15.5 million in implementing R&D activities related to the module technology at its facility in Thalheim, Germany. “The additional €15.5 million come[s] on top of last year’s pledge to invest €20 million into machinery and equipment for next-generation PV technology development,” it said in a statement.
The new n-type tech, which is described as an evolution of its Q.antum cell technology, was dubbed Q.antum Neo and the module that the company wants to manufacture with it should be called Q.Tron. It said the new product will reach efficiencies well above the levels of current p-type modules on the market. It did not provide any further technical details.
Hanwha Q Cells' flagship products that are helping to drive the uptake of Q.antum technology include the Q.Peak Duo solar module range. The series includes the most powerful product developed by the company to date, the Q.Peak Duo XL-G9.3, which is available in five versions with power outputs ranging from 440 W to 480 W and efficiencies of 19.7% to 20.6%.
The Q.antum cell technology is based on a nano aluminum coating that enhances the module's electrical properties.

The Hangzhou-based manufacturer, which has broken five previous records, announced the achievement on Friday and said the result had been confirmed by government entity the China Institute of Metrology.
Microquanta has focused on perovskite solar since its foundation in 2015 and, in October 2019, achieved a record 14.24% conversion efficiency on a large-area (200x800cm2) perovskite solar module. Two months later, the company's perovskite module became the first one to pass the IEC stability test. In July last year, Microquanta achieved a new record of 18.04% efficiency on a small-size module. In January, the company made another breakthrough in perovskite stability when its products passed three environmental aging tests: the 1,000hr light aging exam; 3,000hr hygrothermal aging test; and the 100 kWh ultraviolet aging test, all specified by IEC standard 61215:2016.
Microquanta said it takes stability and conversion efficiency as two fundamentals of perovskite solar modules and believes, with the help of improved efficiency and stability, the commercialization of such devices will be greatly accelerated.

SA Water, which serves millions of South Australians and is one of the state’s biggest electricity users, has completed the commissioning of 367,769 solar PV panels across its network, as part of its AUD 300 million ($232.7 million) Zero Cost Energy Future project. 
In 2017, SA Water announced plans to reduce its net electricity costs to zero. Given that the water utility spent around AUD 86 million last year on electricity, the ambition was immense. With more than 350 kilometers of pipeline to travel, drinking water in South Australia has to journey a long way from source to water treatment to tap. That journey is now powered by the sun, saving both money and emissions.
With construction complete on all 33 sites and connection complete on 24 of those, SA Water and its partners are now finalizing connections on the remaining nine sites and integrating the vast arrays into Australia’s National Electricity Market.
The Zero Cost Energy Future project also involves 34 MWh of energy storage. 
“Where battery storage is deployed it is energised as part of the site commissioning process, with some storage now online and some to continue being brought online,” a spokesperson for SA Water told pv magazine Australia. Such additions will continue until SA Water reaches its target generation of 242 GWh of energy per annum, the person added.
In January, pv magazine reported that half a million solar panels would be needed to reach this target. However, SA Water said this month that through efficiencies in design, it was able to achieve its target with a smaller number of solar panels across a smaller physical footprint (a mere 367,769 panels, to be precise).
As part of its project, SA Water has deployed the world’s largest fully moveable solar array at the Happy Valley Reservoir, which provides drinking water of more than 40% of SA Water customers across metropolitan Adelaide. The portable array, which powers the Happy Valley Water Treatment Plant, includes 30,000 modules installed on a 12-hectare site adjacent to the reservoir and generates around 17 GWh of solar energy per year.
“With the ability to generate almost double the energy needs of the nearby Happy Valley Water Treatment Plant, on-site battery storage will complement the solar panels allowing energy to be stored and also released back to the market,” said South Australian Minister for Environment and Water David Speirs. “At Happy Valley the local community was heavily involved in the planning for this site so the the solar panel project is visually sympathetic to the natural environment.”
Nicola Murphy, SA Water’s senior manager for the Zero Cost Energy Future project, said the project, including the energy storage aspect, will reduce the utility’s reliance on a “volatile grid” and ensure the performance of its assets.
“Just like how thousands of South Australians use solar panels at home, we’re capitalizing on some of our physical assets to work harder for us while still performing their vital functions of delivering trusted water and wastewater services,” Murphy said. “We can also create an added revenue stream by selling any excess solar energy back to the national grid, where it can be used across Australia.”
The project created 250 jobs during construction and will generate enough renewable power for 50,000 homes. Of course, the planned renewable-energy-powered water system also flows into South Australia’s overall intention, declared in 2015, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
“This solar initiative was created by our own people, and clearly demonstrates South Australians leading the way to integrate renewable energy and proactively reduce the impacts of climate change,” Murphy said.´

They utilized a mathematical model to analyze how dust adhesion on the PV panels' surface is removed through the airflow and how the air had, also, a positive impact on the panel operating temperature. These findings were used to build a pilot cleaning and cooling system based on a compressed-air unit which was made of a compressor, an air tank, and an airflow regulation valve, and a series of nozzles with a thickness of 5mm. All components, according to the research team, are low-cost and standardized products.
“The compressor is directly powered by the PV panels and the release of the compressed air from the tank is regulated by the valve to meet the mass flow requirements of cleaning and cooling,” the scientists explained. “The spreading air from the nozzles installed at the edge of panels overlaps and forms a flake shape airflow then carries away the dust and heat from the panel surface.” Air can be transmitted over the panels through a pipe assembly that can be moved across an installation to clean and cool its parts when it is more needed.
The British team tested the system on a PV system relying on monocrystalline PV panels operating in an unspecified area of northwestern India. “The average size of the dust deposited on the panel surface was 20µm and almost 90% of particles had diameters less than 30µm”, it specified. “The tilting angle of the panel was set to 30 degrees and the average temperature of the surface can reach up to 333 Kelvin.”
After two weeks of testing, the panel surface was covered by 5.3g of dust, which reduced its power output from 42.5 to 37.5 W at 303 Kelvin. After cleaning operations were implemented through the airflow injected by two nozzles, the power output of the module returned to an average of 41.82 W. The experiment also showed that, at a temperature of 333 Kelvin, the module's yield dropped to 28.24 W while, after 130 seconds of airflow, the temperature fell to 315 Kelvin and the power output increased to 32.42 W.
The blowing time was then set as 10, 15, and 20 seconds and the power output of the tested PV systems increased, from 567.4 W, by 30.7%, 33.6%, and 36.1%, respectively. The cooling effect, however, may only be obtained for short periods of time during the cleaning operations, as the costs for producing the airflow are higher than the benefits achieved by long cooling operations. “Therefore, the blowing time and specific particle size for removals need to be determined, considering the optimal balance between energy consumption in compressing air and energy gain from PV performance improvement, for the application scenario studied,” the academics asserted.
In further research, they want to investigate nozzle configuration, frequency and time for cleaning operations, and how to integrate maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under different dust deposition rates and PV module temperatures.
All the details of the system, which is described as an ideal solution for arid climates, can be found in the paper Study on the cleaning and cooling of solar photovoltaic panels using compressed airflow, published in Solar Energy. All the researchers come from the University of Warwick, in the United Kingdom.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/17/thermodynamic-model-to-build-more-stable-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 17, 2021",Thermodynamic model to build more-stable perovskite solar cells,"Scientists at the Eindhoven University of Technology have come up with a thermodynamic theory that, in their view, explains why perovskite solar cells suffer from thermal stability, which is a crucial issue to overcome in order to take this cell technology out of the laboratories and nearer to commercial production.
In the study Unified theory for light-induced halide segregation in mixed halide perovskites, published in nature communications, the Dutch group explained that the vast majority of perovskites used for PV applications are halide compounds combining organic materials such as methylammonium or formamidinium with a metal, which usually is lead or tin, and halides, like bromide or iodide.
Their analysis was focused on five types of halide compounds combining both bromide and iodide. “This combination works particularly well because it allows for the ‘tuning’ of the bandgap, or the minimum amount of photon energy needed to generate electricity in the material,” they further explained, adding that this solution is ideal when perovskite PV devices are used in tandem solar cells.
In halide compounds, however, it is frequent that iodide-rich regions are spontaneously formed and bromide is expelled from these regions – a phenomenon which is known as halide segregation. “The subsequent segregation of the compound tends to trap the electricity-producing photocarriers in these low-bandgap areas, severely hampering the efficiency of the cell,” the academics highlighted, noting that the excited photocarriers tend to move to areas where their free energy is lowest.
For each of the five compounds analyzed, the researchers were able to identify stable, metastable, and unstable regions depending on temperature, light conditions, and bromide concentration. “Our unified theory for light-induced halide segregation looks at the total free energy of the perovskite in the photovoltaic cells, both in the dark and when the cell is exposed to sunlight,” stated researcher Peter Bobbert.
The academics claim that this theory may provide technical solutions to build more stable perovskite PV devices. For example, it could help determine how much bromide you can add to the compound without making it unstable. “By not mixing in an excessive amount of bromide, you can avoid segregation while at the same time still achieving a reasonably large bandgap that works for tandem cells,” Bobbert added.
The scientists also found that replacing organic cations with cesium may also have a stabilizing effect. They worked on a cesium-lead compound cell that is claimed to be stable up to 42% bromide concentration and have a maximum bandgap of 1.94 eV, which would be enough to make this cell applicable in tandem PV devices. “The theory can also be readily applied to other semiconductors where the bandgap is tuned by alloying,” they concluded.

State-level efforts will be crucial for India to make rapid progress in the uptake of utility-scale battery storage. Specifically, states with large load centers, such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan, will need to lead the way by making plans for utility-scale battery storage systems, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
State-owned Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) has led the way by introducing multiple renewable energy plus battery storage auctions that mandate round-the-clock renewable power supplies. However, SECI’s efforts alone will not be enough to build the battery storage capacity needed for the Indian grid to handle large amounts of variable renewables, IEEFA said.
Time-of-day pricing mechanisms that differentiate between peak and off-peak power supplies will be critical to incentivize investment into such capital-intensive assets, IEEFA said. Additionally, states could offer viability gap funding (VGF) for battery storage, just as they did to support the growth of large solar parks a few years ago.
Grid integration will be one of India’s biggest challenges as it targets the deployment of 450 GW of large-scale variable renewables by 2030. Reaching this target from a current installed renewables capacity of 93 GW will require average annual capacity additions of 35 GW.
India could double its renewables capacity to 900 GW by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) India Energy Outlook 2021. Currently, renewables account for about 10% of India’s total power generation, but this will increase to 31% by 2030 with 450 GW coming online. 
As the share of variable renewables increases, India’s power system will have to evolve and modernize to respond to grid stability challenges, IEEFA said. There is a need for the accelerated deployment of utility-scale battery storage to accommodate this, it added. 
The IEA said that India could have 140 GW to 200 GW of battery storage capacity by 2040. Success stories from Germany, Australia, and the United States show the way for India to integrate large-scale variable renewables into its power grid.
The cost of standalone lithium-ion battery storage systems globally has plummeted from $1,100/kWh in 2010 to $137/kWh in 2020. According to BloombergNEF (BNEF), costs will decline about 55% to $58/kWh by 2030.
In contrast to Australia, which is predominantly driven by market economics, the accelerated uptake of batteries in the U.S. market is being driven by state-level enforcement of battery storage requirements as well as subsidy support through tax credit incentives, IEEFA added. The states of California, Oregon, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Virginia have all set battery-storage capacity targets for state utilities.

Green hydrogen’s credibility was boosted at the recent Smart Energy Summit with the announcement of new founding partners to the Zero-Carbon Certification Scheme, which Australia's Smart Energy Council initiated to verify the origins of renewable hydrogen, green ammonia, and metals processed using green energy.
The Victorian state government has now joined the initial list of eight founding partners announced for the scheme at its launch in December. Lily D’Ambrosio, Victoria’s minister for energy, climate and the environment, expressed her enthusiasm for “the potential for renewable hydrogen.” She named the decarbonization of gas supplies and the powering of green manufacturing as one of the opportunities it provides.
“To support the industry we also need ways to trace and certify where and how hydrogen is made,” she said. “Schemes like this are instrumental to encouraging best practice in production and boosting investor confidence.”
Australia's Power Ledger specializes in using blockchain technology to digitally trace, track and trade units of energy, as well as environmental commodities. At the recent Smart Energy Summit, the company also brought its expertise and support to the Zero-Carbon Certification Scheme.
The Zero-Carbon Certification Scheme will only deal with green hydrogen, said Scott Hamilton, an adviser to the scheme. “We don’t want potential greenwashing or blurring of what is green and what is not,” Hamilton said, adding that customers for high-density green fuel who see the scheme’s brand “will have confidence that they’re getting zero-emissions hydrogen.”
At the opening session of the conference, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull set the tone of discussion. “Green hydrogen, that’s the only kind of hydrogen we should be planning for,” he said, while dismissing blue hydrogen – made from fossil fuels but capturing and sequestering the carbon produced in some form – as “BS.”
The Zero-Carbon Certification Scheme is designed to build faith in the green hydrogen ecosystem. Hamilton says it initially focused on the needs of local founding members such as CWP Global, “making sure that they can attract investment to get the Asian Renewable Energy Hub up and running.”
The AREH, which will be built in Western Australia's Pilbara region, will feature 26 GW of wind and solar capacity. About 3 GW of that capacity will be allocated to large energy users in the region, while most of the generation will be dedicated to the large-scale production of clean hydrogen for domestic and export markets. The project is expected to reach a financial investment decision in 2025.

Previous articles in this series look at how a roof’s age and physical characteristics, latitude, and local weather can affect the design and payback of a solar system. We also discussed considerations in choosing a solar contractor. Whether you’re new to solar or simply looking to review the fundamentals, this series offers essential information and perspectives to help you choose the best hardware and contractor.
Now we consider how much your prospective solar system will really cost. We’re not quite finished discussing hardware or construction, but since we just finished discussing how to find and evaluate your solar contractor, this is a good time to look at pricing.
So, how much might your solar power system cost? Think of it this way: Every solar system is actually a custom retrofit. The list of unique variables and components is quite long, and hardware requirements may result in a significant pricing variance.
However, we can offer you a solid guide based on averages collected from hundreds of thousands of installations across the United States. This cost data is provided via two government research lab reports.
The first report, by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DoE) National Renewable Laboratory (NREL), describes the costs of a solar project from the bottom up. This means that researchers have found the cost of every component, all the engineering and applications, plus labor. And from this data they assembled this alluring chart, clearly illustrating the aforementioned prices.
As you can see, the solar module (panel) price typically represents most hardware expenses. Solar panel choice is the one major item you ought to be conscious of, especially since some high-performance panels can cost twice the base price shown in this chart. Recent increases in labor costs and many commodities around the world, including solar panels, have widened variances of component costs.
Second, this report from the Electricity Markets and Policy (EMP) team at the DoE’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory looks at third-party data.

While the first report by NREL shows a base price of exactly $0.41/watt for solar panels, we can be sure that many buyers are choosing premium residential solar panels that sometimes cost twice that base price.
Another nuance to consider is how pricing varies based upon the state you’re in. For instance, states like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have heavy electrical experience requirements for rooftop workers, pushing labor prices higher. Places like Texas and Florida, where contractor licensing laws are more lax, result in less costly installation teams.
Also, note that the pricing in the above chart is the median pricing, and that there are massive volumes of solar installations equally on either side of that.
One final note – plenty of research suggests that getting a few quotes is the best way to get a reasonable price. Make sure to read our prior article on finding and vetting a contractor to make sure you get those numbers.
