“The fact that we are expecting seven power plants to come online by end of the year is a clear signal that we do have robust regulations that protect the investor and the consumer as well,” said ZERA CEO Edington Mazambani, adding that solar PV is the main energy source among all licensed IPP projects.
One of the projects under construction is the 5 MW Wartrail Power Plant in Bulilimamangwe, Matabeleland South province. It is being built by Plum Solar (Pvt) Ltd. In addition, SolGas (Pvt) Ltd. plans to build another 5 MW project in Hwange, Matabeleland North province.
Richaw Solar Tech (Pvt) Ltd., meanwhile, is constructing the 5 MW Sunset Technologies Solar Park in Gwanda, Matabeleland South province. And Harava Solar Park is installing a 20 MW solar array  in Seke, Mashonaland East province.
Power Ventures (Private) Ltd. is building a 25 MW Chidobe-Mizpah project in Hwange District, Matebeleland North. Guruve Solar Park (Pvt) Ltd. is also constructing the 5 MW Guruve Solar Park in Guruve District, Mashonaland Central province.
The six projects have all secured power purchase agreements with an unspecified power utility. Plum Solar has a 20-year PPA, while the remaining deals all have 25-year terms.
The seventh installation now under development in Zimbabwe is an off-grid, 0.5 MW hybrid solar-diesel project. Kefalos Cheese Products (Pvt) Ltd. is building the array in Mashonaland East province.
Zimbabwe had around 17 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020, according to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency. The country's grid has suffered from daily power outages over the past decade, with the government struggling to raise capital to invest in new power stations. The country, which is now resorting to power imports from neighboring Mozambique and South Africa, aims to deploy 1 GW of clean energy capacity by 2025.

The state entity wants selected counties to have at least 20% of all residential rooftops equipped with solar, as well as at least 30% of commercial and industrial structures; 40% of non-government public buildings, such as hospital and schools; and half of the roofs on the government estate.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
NEA provincial offices will be pressed for time, however, with the national office requiring the pilot counties to be identified within a fortnight.
Under the plan, installers will be selected to develop all of the rooftop capacity in each county and, two days after the policy was promulgated, the State Power Investment Corporation informed its subsidiaries it would be involved in the distributed PV pilot schemes.
With the provinces of Fujian, Guangzhou, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Gansu, and Zhejiang having, since March, published plans for similar programs, the NEA decision appears to have rolled out their actions across the rest of the nation.
Trade body the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) says the key feature of the new policy refers back to a document released in 2018, which attempted to enable the private sale of rooftop electricity to third-party consumers, referred to as ‘neighbor trading.'
With no net-metering in China, the earlier document attempted to regulate for solar households to be able to sign sale agreements with nearby energy consumers in return for paying just a grid-use fee to their utility. The power generated would be injected into the grid and the amount signed for by the customer would be paid for, to the generator, at a rate cheaper than grid electricity.
That earlier attempt at neighbor trading made little progress, thanks to unwillingness by electric companies, and ensured there is little incentive to invest in rooftop PV in China unless it is entirely for self-consumption. The CPIA said the new NEA policy regulates the trade in rooftop electricity under the terms originally suggested three years ago, in a move which could unleash a wave of distributed solar in the world's biggest PV market.

The City Council of Sevilla has commissioned, today, Spain's first electric scooter recharging station powered by a solar pavement.
The first pilot station is located in the city center and is relying on a 7.6m2, walkable photovoltaic pavement with a power output of 1 kW and linked to a 2.4 kWh battery, which is enough to power 12 scooters per day.
“The same recharging station will now [be installed in] another area of the city,” a spokesperson from Spanish start-up Solum told pv magazine. The objective is to evaluate and analyze the initiative over the next few months and to lay the foundations for an upcoming public tender for the service.” 
The city council aims to build up to 200 recharging stations of this kind, which would be enough to host around 2,400 scooters.
Spain, with its high level of solar radiation, is hosting an increasing number of solar pavements despite the skepticism that surrounds this technology. Solum itself installed the first solar pavement, in a port area in Valencia, as part of the strategy set by Puertos del Estado for the complete decarbonization of port areas by 2030.
Furthermore, the Barcelona municipal authorities have chosen Plaça de Les Glòries Catalanes, an historical square, as the future site of a 50m2 demonstration project to test the feasibility of solar pavements.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/01/residential-batteries-are-less-profitable-than-selling-excess-power-to-the-grid/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,FINLAND",MAX HALL,"JULY 1, 2021",‘Residential batteries are less profitable than selling excess power to the grid’,"A study by academics at Finland's Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT) has concluded the expense of residential battery systems means they are less profitable than exporting unused electricity generated by household solar panels to the grid.
Researchers, in a paper published in Applied Energy, concluded the most valuable use of household solar electricity was for self consumption, as it avoids the taxes and grid charges associated with each kilowatt-hour of network electricity, as well as the wholesale cost of the energy.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
While residential batteries increase the amount of self consumption in solar households, the paper stated, their costs outweigh the benefits they bring, meaning the simple export of excess energy to the grid, at the wholesale price, offers the best returns at current battery price levels.
“We could roughly say that battery prices would need to drop to a third of their current level for them to be a viable investment for residential power systems,” said LUT researcher and lead author of the paper, Pietari Puranen, in a press release issued by LUT on Monday.
The academics also attempted to weigh the financial returns available to solar households who sign up to be part of ‘virtual batteries‘ set up by electric companies who aggregate groups of solar ‘prosumers' – households which both consume and export solar power.
However, the researchers were unable to come to a conclusion on the merits of such systems, with LUT associate professor Antti Kosonen frustrated in his attempt to calculate the economics. “In my opinion, virtual battery storage is not particularly transparent,” he said. “At least, regular prosumers may have trouble finding out about its advantages compared to selling excess electricity to the grid.”
The findings of the Techno-economic viability of energy storage concepts combined with a residential solar photovoltaic system: A case study from Finland paper, also published on the ScienceDirect website, were based on the electricity import and export data from two detached houses in Finland over a three-year period, and the corresponding electricity market prices.
The academics found the costliness of residential batteries rises with their storage capacity at a faster rate than the economic benefits they offer by increasing household consumption levels.
“Many still think batteries are the best, or even a necessary solution for deriving a profit from self-produced electricity,” said Jero Ahola, LUT professor of energy efficiency in electricity-driven systems. “However, current battery prices rarely make the investment profitable.”

“In Version 58, we report 10 new results largely since January 2021,” Green told pv magazine. “Those of most interest will likely be the 4 new perovskite cell, minimodule and tandem cell results, although new efficiencies for more commercially relevant silicon heterojunction and TOPCon cells are also reported.”
Since 1993 when the Tables were started, the research group saw major improvements in all cell categories. “Copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) and multijunction cells have seen the most consistent gains, although perovskites have recently seen similar overall gains compressed into a shorter timescale,” Greener specified.
He also explained that the most important criterion for inclusion in the tables is that the results be independently measured at a test center on the group's list. “As well as efficiency, we now publish the cell's current-voltage and spectral response curve and sometimes include cryptic comments on measurement procedure or general comments on likely cell stability,” he emphasized. “The industry has shown that improved efficiency is the key to lower cost, stressing its fundamental importance, although stability is also a key factor as well as, for mass deployment, abundance and non-toxicity of the cell's constituent materials.”
According to the scientist, the more mature cell materials, such as silicon and gallium arsenide (GaAs) are close to demonstrating their full potential, although still plenty of scope for improvement by combining with other materials in multijunction cells. “Organic solar cells have seen a recent burst in performance that I think will take them to over 20% efficiency while other earth-abundant, non-toxic cells such as those based on kesterite (CZTS) still have massive scope for improvement,” he added.
Referring to the importance of independent third-party certification of the achieved efficiencies, Green said that history has shown, on multiple occasions, that it is unwise to trust cell results based on “in-house” measurements. “All of our recognized test centers are carefully vetted prior to inclusion on our list and have been involved in round-robin testing with one another, ensuring consistency of measurements to well within the uncertainty estimates included with the published results,” the professor stated.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE), Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), and the US Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

Called the Hydrogen Energy Storage Evaluation Tool (HESET), the new framework is an adapted version of PNNL's Energy Storage Evaluation Tool (ESET), which was created by the research group in 2013. It is able to assess individual system components, different hydrogen flow pathways, various grid and end-user services, and multi-dimensional couplings.
“This tool is unique in that it allows for modeling of stacked revenue streams, like grid services and several different hydrogen end uses,” said PNNL researcher Di Wu, noting that stored hydrogen may be used for grid services such as frequency regulation, capacity value, deferral of transmission or distribution equipment upgrades, demand charge reductions, and demand response.
According to Wu, hydrogen storage differs from other forms of energy storage, as it is able to interact with multiple sectors at a relatively low cost per volume for long-term storage.
The research team has already tested the novel tool on different configurations of electrolyzers with capacities ranging from 1 to 10 MW and discovered that, if properly sized, the system is not only economically feasible but it may also provide up to 1.5 times return on investment. “Economic benefits from bundling grid services can make a hydrogen energy storage project more cost-effective,” Wu further explained. “Value streams must be identified and appropriately monetized to make hydrogen storage a more financially competitive option and thereby adopted at scale.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/01/a-solar-pavilion-for-indias-rooftops/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,INDIA",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JULY 1, 2021",A solar pavilion for India’s rooftops,"From pv magazine Germany
Anyone who has visited India will know roof terraces are a common focus of residential life, a fact which hinders rooftop PV use and renders the nation's ambitious solar targets even more daunting to achieve.
To overcome the hurdle, Germany's international development agency – the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)– has developed a rooftop system designed for the Indian market.
The ‘PV Port & Store' system is a ready-to-use array that, according to the GIZ, can be bought, installed, and switched on within two days and takes the form of a pavilion with two benches and a solar module roof to offer shade. The benches are hollow plastic bowls filled with water and have three functions. Their water-filled weight is 1.5 tons, anchoring the system even at wind speeds of 200 kilometers per hour; the water can feed a sprinkler, for module cleaning; and it also cools a battery and hybrid inverter stowed inside the benches in drawers surrounded by water.
Designed for the Indian market, the pavilion is aimed at 100% self-consumption of the solar power generated. By means of its own dynamic energy measurement of household consumption, the inverter determines whether, and how much, valuable power should be used by the household to avoid electricity flowing to the grid. Smaller systems of that nature, which only cover household electricity demand, do not have to be registered with local energy suppliers, reducing paperwork.
Similar systems have encountered problems when the final circuit load is too high and, as a result, can cause household cabling malfunction. In such cases, the electricity fed into the house network from the roof is added to the electricity consumed, causing cables to heat. To prevent this, the inverter in the German-designed pavilion has a protection fuse and measuring sensors. Another feature of the PV Port & Store is an emergency power capability, a useful precaution, given power outages are particularly common in India. In addition, grid operators could access pavilion batteries to use any stored electricity for grid-related services.
The price of the pavilion varies depending on the size and location of each installation. A GIZ spokesperson estimated a target price for a 2 kW system with a small lead-acid battery, at around €2,500. A system with a large lithium iron phosphate battery would cost around €5,500.
The 2 kW devices will be available in five versions. For storage capacity, customers can choose between 2.4 and 4.8 kWh. Buyers can opt for lead-acid batteries, whose service life is estimated at around three years, or ten-year lithium iron phosphate devices. There is also a 1.6 kW pavilion, which does not offer energy storage.
Although such systems could be used by multiple tenants, even the model with the largest battery storage capacity would find the power generated consumed by the requirements of a single air-conditioned room.
The pavilion is manufactured by the home-pv business controlled by India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energies. With regards to manufacturing, the ministry says it has already tasked three companies with branch offices in India to roll out the systems, namely: Servotech, Kosol and Enphase.

Sterling and Wilson Solar has announced its financial results for the year ended March 31, 2021. 
The company secured orders for 1.96 GW of capacity, but its overall fiscal 2020-21 performance was affected due to one-off exceptional events in the fourth quarter. These included a prime subcontractor going bankrupt in Australia, an increase in prices of modules, higher freight costs, and provisions for liquidated damages due to Covid-19.
“The prices of solar modules have risen by over 35% in last nine months. This was on account of a significant increase in the cost of the key raw material polysilicon. Prices of aluminum, copper and steel have also risen along with freight costs,” said Sterling and Wilson Solar CEO Amit Jain.
Jain said the sector will likely continue to face some pressure in the near term, due to increases in solar module prices and supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic. Going forward, he said he expects growth to pick up. 
Logistics and supply chain issues will likely get ironed out by the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and return to pre-pandemic levels, he said. Operational effectiveness is also expected to normalize in the second half of the fiscal 2021-22 period, he added.

Water pumps have long been large part of Australia-based Commodore Independent Energy Systems’ business. The company sends out between 10 to 15 pumps every week, Marketing Manager Matt Miller told pv magazine Australia.
Commodore Independent Energy Systems recently crunched the numbers on how much customers – primarily farmers – can save by opting for solar water pumps over diesel, petrol or mains-connected pumps. It found at the largest end of the scale, the savings could reach AUD 44,837 ($33,550) per year.

Few farms would need pumps that big, however, so their savings wouldn’t reach such epic proportions. Nonetheless, Commodore Independent Energy Systems found that for a mid-sized solar pump, the customer could save AUD 1,793 in a year – paying off the bare running costs of a diesel pump in 2.77 years. Compared with a mains-connected grid, customers would save AUD 1,404 and meet the running costs in 3.54 years. 
These numbers don’t even include the costs of travel for diesel or maintenance, which can be significant, Miller noted. 
“[Solar pumps] are a renewable source … also a cost effective source,” Miller said, noting that they are routinely underestimated.
That is, most farmers or other customers don’t expect solar-powered water pumps to have anywhere near the pumping capacity they do. Naturally, solar pumps only run in the daytime, but Miller said they continue to perform well in shaded areas and on cloudy days. The ground-mounted solar arrays that power such pumps can also be located in premium positions, with Miller pointing to a recent job where the solar array sat around 300 meters away from the pump, connected via cable.
Batteries can also be fitted to pumps so they can be used on command. Miller said only around 10% of the solar pumps Commodore Independent Energy Systems installs include batteries, though.
While water pumps are most commonly used by farmers to irrigate crops, the company has fitted pumps in remote parts of Papua New Guinea under humanitarian projects to bring water to dry villages. The beauty of solar pumps is they require far less maintenance compared to diesel pumps and require no fuel, which makes them far better suited for developing and remote communities. Over the last six months, solar pumps have also began integrating remote app access and monitoring, allowing customers to stop and start the pump and irrigations on their phones.

The energy storage market has given rise to many new solutions in recent years, especially on the battery front, as storage has emerged as a foundational technology that will be absolutely critical to a successful energy transition.
Many companies have toyed with existing battery chemistries and have invented their own. One startup, backed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), has found an approach that’s been in front of us the whole time.
That company is Urban Electric Power and its technology is alkaline batteries – think AA in a flashlight. Just saying “alkaline” doesn’t tell the full story, however, as CEO Sanjoy Banerjee and VP of Operations Ann Marie Augustus told pv magazine.
The Urban Electric story began 12 years ago, when the company received an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) Grant for $6 million to design something for the grid – specifically, a storage solution that would be comparable in cost to pumped hydrogen, yet not as geographically exclusive. When looking at battery technologies and chemistries, zinc and manganese dioxide made the most sense, as both were already being widely used for battery cells and their supply chains were well established.
The issue then became recharging, as manganese dioxide and zinc both had high capacities, but their chemical structures would change after a discharge, disabling any hope of a recharge. As Banerjee explained it, the company was able to “freeze” the change by adding “certain doping agents like bismuth and copper,” finally achieving both high capacity and rechargeability.
Urban Electric Power has since used this innovation to develop modular batteries that can provide backup electricity for personal use. They can be installed in a home garage or basement, grouped as part of a commercial microgrid, or installed en masse at grid scale by an electric utility or independent power provider. Augustus also pointed to one advantage that the company believes offers a critical advantage over competing chemistries: The batteries pose no risk of thermal runaway.
The company currently has a manufacturing plant in Pearl River, New York, which you can see in a virtual tour.

This breakthrough is what Banerjee and Augustus believe got the attention of EPRI. Urban Electric Power was the only battery storage company of more than 250 applicants to be accepted into EPRI’s Incubatenergy Labs electric utility mentorship program.
Incubatenergy Labs brings startups and utilities together to crowdsource the demonstration of these innovations and speed up the commercialization of promising technologies. Urban Electric Power will now spend 16 weeks working with utilities such as Ameren, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Con Edison, and Duke Energy on demonstration projects.
Urban Electric Power is actively installing one large-scale demonstration project. The installation is at a San Diego State University data center that needed a backup solution, Augustus said. The facility's previous backup provided about 15 minutes of power, but it needed two hours. Space was limited, which meant that the center couldn’t explore diesel capacity, or the number of racks that would be required with other battery chemistries.
Urban Electric Power’s chemistry became the solution, because it allowed the center to achieve 2 MWh of storage indoors, with no risk of fire or toxic leaks, and at a lower cost per kilowatt-hour than the center’s owners paid for their previous lead acid battery system. What’s more, the solution was compatible with the existing inverters and racking.
Following this pilot and with the support from the Incubatenergy Labs program, Banerjee and Augustus said that the company is now moving rapidly into commercialization and building out its development pipeline. It aims to offer a battery system below $50/per kWh in the near future, and ultimately below $20/per kWh.
