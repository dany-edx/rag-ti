“The two new products are manufactured at our facility in Denmark,” the company's chief financial officer, Martín Rivadeneira, told pv magazine. “Our production capacity is currently 40MW per year.”
One of the two products is a dark grey tile named CFR G24BCM5. It measures 1,610x400x5.5mm and has a weight of 6.5kg. It features a power output of 70W and a power conversion efficiency of 18.15%. Its open-circuit voltage is 16.09V and the short-circuit current is 5.57A.

The other 70W tile is called CFR 6725R190 and features a terracotta color and the same other characteristics as the gray tile apart from that its efficiency is slightly lower, at 16.7%.
Both products can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,000V and come with IP65 protection, a 25-year linear power output guarantee, and a 12-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius.

According to Dansk Solenergi, the new products are ideal for use on heritage buildings, new residential complexes, architectural projects, churches, and building facades. Different tile patterns and colors can be developed by the company and adapted to different customer requirements.
The tiles are based on a monocrystalline all-contact solar cell technology provided by Singapore-headquartered solar manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies Ltd. Each cell has an area of 155cm2 and weighs around 6.6 grams. “The company's patented coloring technology can be adapted to any production line,” a spokesperson said at the time.
“Danish solar energy is still looking for investors and partners to start large scale production,” Rivadeneira added, reiterating a concept expressed in October.

Guinness World Records has confirmed the world's largest solar tree has been installed in India.
The construction, which has 309.83m2 of solar panel surface, has been constructed at the Centre of Excellence for Farm Machinery, Ludhiana, in Punjab by the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, which is part of the government's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
The structure, which has smashed the previous solar tree record of 67m2 of panel surface, has a generation capacity of 53.6kWp and can generate an estimated 160-200kWh per day.
Harish Hirani, director of the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, said: “These solar trees have wide applications such as distributed power generation to cater [to] the needs of different integrated farming activities of charging e-tractors, e-power tillers, and EV [electric vehicle] charging stations; running agriculture pumps for irrigation needs; solar-based cooking systems for food preparation at the farm site; and powering the cold storage needs of the farm produce, thereby increasing the shelf life [of the goods].”

It is abundant in nature, non-toxic, and can be supplied at a low cost. Furthermore, it has a near-optimal direct bandgap of about 1.3 eV, a high level of environmental and chemical stability, and a high absorbance coefficient.
With this in mind, a group of researchers from Shiraz University in Iran and the University of Rome Tor Vergata has designed a double-junction tandem solar cell based on a perovskite top-cell and an SnS sub-cell.
“SnS solar cells are a potential alternative to current low-bandgap subcells used in combination with perovskite solar cells to produce highly efficient tandems,” researcher Farshad Jafarsadeh told pv magazine.
In the proposed cell configuration, SnS is used for the buffer layer in the narrow-bandgap cell.
“We investigated the variation of thicknesses, carrier concentrations, and defect densities of the SnS and n-SnS layer on the PV parameters,” the scientists said.
The noted that the device was developed through a numerical simulation performed via SCAPS-1D, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium. The top cell and the sub-device were investigated separately and then connected in series to simulate a tandem cell.
“Based on numerical simulations, SnS homojunction solar cells operate best with a p-type layer of 2 µm thick and the n-type layer of 0.4 µm thick,” the academics explained. “Simulations proved that a 22.9% efficient SnS solar cell is possible.”
According to their estimations, such kinds of cells have the potential to reach a power conversion efficiency of up to 28.92%.
“The downside is that up to now fabricated SnS solar cells gained lower efficiency than the simulated ones which means there should be more research effort in the future in this area,” said Jafarsadeh.
They described the cell design in “Design and optimization of highly efficient perovskite/homojunction SnS tandem solar cells using SCAPS-1D,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.

Tatia Lemondzhava, an energy specialist at the multilateral development finance institution, told an event organized by Solarplaza, falling prices could see mini-grids offer electricity to as many as 500 million people by 2030, the deadline for achieving the United Nations sustainable development goal of providing universal energy access.
With Bangladesh preparing to announce on Monday that it has achieved that historic goal, the online event predicted Nigeria would need US$10 billion of the US$200 billion the World Bank estimates will be needed to supply universal access in sub-Saharan Africa.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Sudan will each need US$7-10 billion, according to Lemondzhava, and each of Angola, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe will require US$4-7 billion of investment.
Some US$155 billion of the US$200 billion total will be needed for household electricity access – US$62 billion on off-grid systems and US$93 billion for the expansion of grid networks – and a further US$40 billion would fund panels for schools, health centers, and clean cooking facilities, as well as funding the right enabling environment for such projects to be installed, according to the World Bank representative.
Lemondzhava added, the development body has already invested US$1 billion in mini-grids over the last decade while attracting US$1.1 billion from public and private sector partners.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/17/eva-the-next-supply-chain-pinch-point-for-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,BRAZIL,CHINA,EUROPE,INDIA",MAX HALL,"MARCH 17, 2022",EVA the next supply chain pinch point for solar,"With China set for record-breaking solar demand of up to 90GW this year, according to one in-country analyst, the component pinch point caused by a shortage of PV panel raw material polysilicon last year is likely to concern ethylene vinyl acetate this time around.
Global production capacity of the “EVA” material used to seal the solar cells into panels could reach 950-1,050 kilotons this year, according to Frank Haugwitz and his Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA) consultancy, but that is still likely to mean a supply constraint given the huge demand expected for solar modules next year.
That was just one of the headline predictions made by Haugwitz in his latest survey of the state of the world's biggest solar market.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
The AECEA statement released yesterday said the record 54.88GW of solar generation capacity installed in China last year could mushroom to 80-90GW this year, including up to 30-35GW of household roof-mounted capacity.
Haugwitz pointed to the volume of home solar added in China more than doubling last year to 21.59GW to account for 40% of the market and added, that figure rises to more than half when the 7.68GW of commercial and industrial rooftop arrays are thrown in.
With household solar subsidies boosting that portion of the market last year, Haugwitz pointed to a target, announced by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development last week, to install 50GW of rooftop and building-integrated PV by 2025, with a focus on new buildings.
With the eight million-population, port city of Ningbo, in Zhejiang province, aiming for 90% of new builds to have rooftop solar by 2025, the Shandong provincial government to introduce time-of-use electricity prices from May 1, and the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang having last month announced fixed tariffs for the sale of excess electricity to the grid, Haugwitz said the indicators are for another strong year for rooftop panels.
January and February saw orders placed for 45GW of modules and 13GW of engineering, procurement and construction contracts signed – a third of them for small scale, distributed generation systems – according to the AECEA update.
The rollover of uncompleted solar installations from December saw China add 7GW of solar capacity in January alone, the consultant said, twice the volume deployed in the same month of last year and more than the number of panels installed in the first three months of 2021.
Noting the 10.9GW of solar modules shipped from China to India last year was almost double 2020's figure, Haugwitz speculated the pending imposition of hefty customs duties on cells and modules imported by Indian developers was a major factor driving increased solar manufacturing output at the moment. India is due to charge duties of 44% on imported modules from next month, and 27.5% on cells.
Last year also saw Chinese solar exports to Brazil more than double, rising 129% to 10.4GW, according to the AECEA. That meant the South American nation was the third biggest export market for Chinese manufacturers, behind India and Europe, with the latter importing 45.3GW of modules – 54% more than in 2020 as the EU mulls a carbon border which would tax imported products to reflect their carbon footprints.
Quoting figures from the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, Haugwitz said the nation exported a total of 100.55GW of solar modules last year in trade worth $25 billion, rising to $28 billion when the value of wafer and cell shipments was included.
The production boom has not dampened demand for more output capacity, though, with Chinese solar manufacturers churning out 6.5% more polysilicon in January than in December, as well as 15% more wafers (enough to supply 20GW more panel capacity); 17% more cells (20GW); and 23% more panels (19.8GW).
That came after the nation produced 29% more polysilicon last year than in 2020, with output hitting 505,000 tons in 2021, according to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association. The 227GW of wafers manufactured last year, 198GW worth of cells, and 182GW of modules marked annual rises of 41%, 47%, and 46%, respectively.
And it was again a case of the biggest fish benefiting, according to the AECEA, with the three top solar manufacturers boasting annual output growth of 50-60%, the biggest five companies cornering 67-69% of the module market, and the biggest dozen, 75-77%.
With domestic demand soaring, China reached a cumulative 306GW of solar capacity last year to attain 12.9% of the national energy mix and Haugwitz suggested the clean power source could surpass hydro (which reached a cumulative 390GW of generation capacity last year) and wind (328GW) this year.
Overseas, Chinese entities have installed a cumulative 44GW of solar capacity, mainly in Asia and Africa, as last year saw 125 PV projects commissioned, with a total generation capacity of 10.2GW across 47 nations and with an investment value of around $5.7 billion.
Back in China, state bodies the National Energy Administration (NEA) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), last month set targets for 455GW of gigawatt scale solar and wind project capacity, to be added by 2025 as part of the current five-year plan, and Inner Mongolia is aiming for 45GW of solar by the same date, which would require around 6.5GW annually, according to the AECEA.
Thus far, 24 of China's 31 provinces and regions have set out five-year-plan renewables targets which include plans for 375-420GW of solar by 2025 – around 75-84GW per year.
Other highlights of the AECEA survey include the increasing penetration of heterojunction (HJT) solar panel technology with Haugwitz estimating China could have 10-15GW of annual HJT production capacity this year, in a market segment that could be worth RMB40 billion (US$6.29 billion) by 2025. The analyst also noted the policy instruction issued by the NDRC to iron and steelmakers last month, which hinted at the requirement for rooftop solar and the consumption of more clean electricity.
The solar boom is also likely to continue to be good news for China's energy storage businesses, with the AECEA estimating the market could be worth RMB450 billion (US$70.8 billion) in three years' time, and RMB1.8 trillion (US$283 billion) this decade. That estimate is based on the desire, announced by the NEA in the autumn, that the current 3GW of national energy storage capacity rise to 30GW by 2025. The State Grid Corp of China responded by outlining plans for 100GW of storage by 2030, in a nation where storage usually runs to around 10-20% of the generation capacity of new solar sites, with a typical 2-4-hour storage duration.
Last year saw 8GW/18GWh of storage projects installed at an average tendered cost of RMB1,476/Wh ($232).

The company said that the Garadagh Solar PV Plant will be located nine kilometers northwest of the Alat settlement and will represent the country's first foreign investment-based independent solar power project.
Construction on the project is planned to be finalized by the end of this year. The solar facility will likely supply power to the nearby located Garadagh Industrial Park.
“The Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), the UAE's leading development financing institution driving sustainable development at home and abroad, is a key finance partner for the project and is keen to support Azerbaijan further over its efforts to achieve renewable-energy goals,” Masdar said in a statement.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) estimates Azerbaijan’s solar potential at 8 GW. However, very little solar has been built in the country thus far.

With clean energy plants supplying 781MW of Bangladesh's total generation capacity of 25.5GW, officials say photovoltaic mini-grids and solar home systems enabled the provision of electricity in remote char lands – areas surrounded by water – and in mountainous regions.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
Solar accounts for 546MW of generation capacity in a nation which was the subject of power rationing a decade ago, with hydro supplying 230MW of the country's clean power generation facilities alongside 2.9MW of wind turbines, 690kW of biogas, and 400kW of biomass capacity.
Mohammad Alauddin, chairman of state entity the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (Sreda), told pv magazine the country's six million solar home systems, mini-grids, and utility scale PV plants are part of a clean power mix supplying electricity to 10% of the country's population of more than 160 million people.
Even more people would have benefited from clean power but for pandemic-related delays in installing the nation's 1GW renewables project pipeline, according to Alauddin.
“Had there been no Covid-19 spread, at least 500MW of them could have come online meantime,” he said, “raising the shares of renewable energy’s coverage in terms of population.”

The US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has released an analysis of full plant generation degradation of the 31GW solar power fleet in the United States. The analysis shows that total system degradation averages 1.2% per year – greater than what is projected in many observed power purchase agreements.
However, the analysis highlights two nuances in the data that paint a picture of stronger performance. First – newer (post 2014) and larger (greater than 25MW) facilities are showing only 0.7% of system-wide degradation. The second nuance in the data is that older facilities show a bump in generation in their later years. This suggests that repairs start in year seven, result in increased generation in year eight, and that performance improvements in subsequent years are sustained.
In fact, looking at year nine in the above chart – it appears that older facilities nearly reach their year one capacity factors. If this data pans out, it speaks volumes to repowering opportunities in the future.
 
These two data points suggest that newer and larger facilities are improving in both quality and O&M compared to their predecessors. It implies that older facilities are being upgraded or repaired by asset owners seeking to improve returns.
Often, solar assets in the US are resold to new owners after the fifth full year of operation due to the Investment Tax Credit structure. The bump in year eight and nine may be attributed to the asset transfer occurring in year six, as analysis and repairs occur in year seven, and results show up shortly thereafter.
In “Plant-level performance and degradation of 31 GW-DC of utility-scale PV in the United States,” the researchers attempt to tease out recoverable versus non-recoverable degradation losses. Recoverable losses are defined as correctable performance issues, like soiling or tracker malfunction, while unrecoverable losses are typically due to solar module delamination or solar cell hot spots. Naturally, these losses are larger than those of solar modules alone, as modern solar panels are typically warrantied at or below 0.5% of degradation per year.
Singular events – failures of fuses, trackers, breakers, and inverters – can briefly, but dramatically cut solar power facility outputs. The author notes that inverters or breakers may cut 100% of plant output, and that fuses can cut around half of a plant’s output. Individual tracker failures and curtailment may result in a 20-30% reduction to a plant’s output.
Of course, solar modules degrade slowly, and indefinitely, thus the wide and ever increasing dark blue bar. Interestingly, when the authors modeled losses based on solar module manufacturers, they found no statistically significant differences amongst the standard silicon module manufacturers. However, plants powered by thin film products – namely First Solar – showed 30% less annual degradation.

Sydney-based SunDrive said it has teamed up with China-based heterojunction (HJT) equipment manufacturer Maxwell Technologies to demonstrate what it said is “the future potential for HJT solar cell efficiencies exceeding 26% in mass production.”
SunDrive said on Thursday that it has recorded a solar cell efficiency of 26.07% on a full-size silicon HJT solar cell. The company’s technology replaces the expensive silver used in conventional solar PV cells with cheaper and more abundant copper, by using large-scale production processes provided by Maxwell Technologies.
SunDrive, which set a new world record for commercial-sized silicon solar cell efficiency in September, said its latest results have been officially verified by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH). The results are more than 0.5% higher than the 25.54% world-record achievement announced by the company last year. SunDrive said the improvements have been observed in open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc), and fill factor (FF). The improvement in efficiency due to “several equipment and processing upgrades,” the company said in an emailed statement.
The metallization of the HJT cell, with a total area of 274.3 cm2 (M6 size), was performed using SunDrive’s “latest generation of direct copper plating technology which achieves finer feature sizes and superior aspect ratios compared to commercial silver screen-printing technologies.”
Silver is a key component in today’s solar panels with estimates indicating solar panel manufacturing accounts for about 20% of the world’s annual consumption of the precious metal. That volume is expected to increase as the next generation of high-efficiency cells currently being developed require up to three times more silver than their antecedents.
SunDrive’s solution, developed by Chief Executive Vince Allen during his PhD at the University of New South Wales (NSW) in Sydney, has been to replace the precious metal with copper. Allen said for solar to reach its full potential, solar cells need to be more efficient, and copper is the key to unlocking the floodgates of more efficient solar cell structures.
“Copper is around 100 times cheaper per kilogram and around 1,000 times more abundant than silver,” he said. “And aside from the abundancy and cost benefits of copper, we have found we can improve the efficiency above and beyond what is attainable with silver.”
The company, which successfully fabricated its first full-size panel in December, said it is planning to establish cell and module production operations in Australia by the end of 2023 to provide for the nation’s rooftop solar PV market and future utility-scale projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/17/storing-renewable-electricity-with-supercritical-co2-heat-pump/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 17, 2022",Storing renewable electricity with supercritical CO2 heat pump,"Researchers from Spain’s Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) have proposed to store renewable electricity with a pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) system based on supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) as the working fluid and molten salts as the thermal storage fluid.
PTES consists of applying a running thermal cycle to transform low-temperature heat into high-temperature heat and then storing it in a  thermal storage unit during charging. This kind of storage technology allows higher storage efficiencies than the direct electric heating of the thermal storage unit and is claimed to be a promising technique for the management of intermittent renewable energies. Supercritical CO2 is a commercial and industrial fluid state solvent that allows many compounds to be extracted with little damage thanks to the relatively low-temperature process at which it is used.
In the proposed PTES design, supercritical CO2 is utilized as a heat pump and a heat engine. A cycle compressor takes the carbon dioxide during the charging phase and raises its temperature and pressure to the maximum level. The thermal energy generated is then stored in a hot storage unit that lowers the fluid temperature until it reaches the inlet value of a turbine.
“Once the fluid is expanded in the turbine, generating a certain amount of power that will reduce the energy required by the compressor, the fluid temperature is increased using cold thermal storage until reaching the operating inlet temperature of the compressor,” the scientists explained. “The energy in the cold storage system comes from the discharge phase of the cycle. In this process, the cycle works in the opposite direction than explained before.”
During the discharge cycle, the compressed CO2 raises its own temperature using hot storage energy and is then expanded, producing both electrical and mechanical energy for the compressor power requirements, as well as thermal energy that is stored in the cold storage system to be used later during the charging phase. A heat recovery unit was also deployed to reduce the number of heat exchangers, their size, and thermal storage media.
The techno-economical analysis of the systems was performed considering the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) as the key parameter and the best performing configuration was found to achieve an LCOS of €0,116/kWh. “This value places the PTES of this research as one of the most cost-efficient technologies,” the researchers noted. “The best pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PHS) and pumped heat electrical storage (PHES) cases only surpass the mark. The initial cost is much higher for both technologies, and the geographical conditions are particular and rare.”
The system performance was assumed not to decrease after a long sequence of cycles. “The net work generated by this novel proposal is 12.46MW in the load and 10MW in the discharge, reaching an efficiency of 80.26%,” the Spanish group emphasized.
The system is described in the paper Electrical energy storage using a supercritical CO2 heat pump, which was recently published in Energy Reports.

India installed 1.2GW of open-access solar (solar backed by private contracts) in 2021, from just 383MW added in 2020, according to a new report by Mercom India.
The nation surpassed 5GW of cumulative, “open-access” solar capacity in December 2021. Most of the new capacity was installed in the state of Uttar Pradesh, followed by Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Karnataka continues to lead with 38% of the country’s cumulative open-access solar capacity.
The development pipeline for open-access solar projects stood at 1.5GW as of December. Three states – Karnataka, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh – accounted for 75% of the capacity.
“Mitigating carbon footprint, reducing the cost of power, renewable power purchase obligations, and RE100 initiatives, the list of reasons for commercial and industrial consumers to go green is piling up. The demand for open access solar is growing, reflected in the robust pipeline of projects,” said Priya Sanjay, managing director of Mercom India.
Fourth-quarter, open-access PV additions reached 298MW, up 75% year on year. Uttar Pradesh led the nation with 38% of the quarterly total.
“Robust policy and regulatory framework, including favorable banking policies, exemption of additional surcharges, the state’s willingness to allow group captive business models, access to useable land, and efficient power evacuation facilities, drove the open-access segment in the state [Uttar Pradesh],” said Mercom India.
The second-highest amount of capacity was installed in Maharashtra. The top five Indian states accounted for about 90% of all open-access installations in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Telangana recorded the maximum quarter-over-quarter growth of 329%, followed by Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
