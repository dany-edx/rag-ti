As part of the U.K.’s £1 billion (€1.2 billion) Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, the competition has as much as £68 million (€79.5 million) available in capital funding for new technology projects which can store energy for longer than four hours, to support renewable power generation.
The storage technologies listed in the scope of the competition include electric, thermal, and “power-to-x” projects and exclude “widely deployed U.K. commercial demonstration” tech such as lithium-ion, pumped hydro, or large water tanks.
The competition guidance document requests first-of-a-kind, full-system prototypes or demonstrator projects. While global companies can enter the contest, provided they are U.K.-registered, demonstrations must be relevant for the U.K. energy system and take place in the U.K.
The competition is split into two streams for competitors to receive grants or funding.
Stream one applies to more commercially advanced projects involving actual demonstrations. Up to £1 million (€1.2 million) will be given to projects that reach phase one. A final three projects from phase one will then advance to phase two, where around £11 million will be available in grants.
Stream two involves earlier-stage projects, with lower technology readiness levels. Some 12 projects are set to be awarded, with £150,000 (€175,000) per project for phase one. As with stream one, a final three projects will then be chosen to progress to phase two development, and each will be awarded a maximum of £9.45 million (€11 million).
Finalists in each stream must plan to start their phase one efforts in November with a completion date in November next year. Phase two will start in December next year, with projects completed, at the latest, by March 2025.
BEIS has also launched a low-carbon hydrogen competition, with up to £60 million available in funding, and following a similar timeline to the longer-duration storage contest.
A previous £33 million (€38.6 million) low-carbon hydrogen competition produced five winners across carbon capture and storage technology, offshore wind-powered production, and a U.S.-based winner, with technology developed by the Gas Technology Institute, a natural gas-focused non-profit.

The event was moderated by Eckhart Gouras, the publisher of pv magazine.
Mr. Chen Guogang, President of Huawei Smart PV, opened the summit by highlighting the importance of energy storage and the shift Huawei’s latest solution is making possible. With Huawei’s “Smart PV Generator” technology at the heart of the new solution PV power plants are able to support the power grid, making PV a much more stable source of power.
The intelligent integration of battery storage is just one of the reasons the FusionSolar All-Scenario PV & Storage Solution is able to greatly improve the performance of the power plant within the grid. As Chen makes clear, the new solution “integrates our smart string energy storage solution and is compatible with AC and DC coupling, and uses intelligent PV + storage collaborative control algorithms to realize synchronous characteristics to improve grid stability.”
What is the benefit in terms of levelized cost of energy (LCOE)? Chen points to the world’s first “Gemini” +-1500 V design, which in his words “can help to support larger sub-arrays, higher voltages, thus [this design] could reduce LCOE by 7% and even enhance the grid, redefine the PV plant standards and can also adapt to large-scale wind + solar + storage projects as well.”
In fact, “All-Scenario” shows the broad range of applications that Huawei’s new solution covers: from large wind + solar + storage plants to just PV, PV + storage, micro-grid and even stand-alone storage as highlighted by Hariram Subramanian, CTO of Smart PV in Europe at Huawei.
Just as bifacial modules have become commonplace in utility-scale PV power plants, so battery energy storage systems (BESS) are poised to gain significant market share. In his presentation at the July 22 Virtual Summit, Sam Wilkinson, Director, Clean Energy Technology, at IHS Markit shared his outlook for the large-scale BESS market with the global audience. According to Wilkinson, 2021 will be a historic year for battery storage deployments, since this year’s installations should for the first time surpass the 10 GW mark. That would be more than double last year’s figure.
A closer look at these deployments and the forecast until 2030 reveals that front-of-the-meter (FTM) applications will rise the most, far outpacing behind-the-meter C & I and residential deployments. Within the FTM category, three main business cases have arisen, including short duration storage (<1 hour), 2-4 hour medium duration storage, and long duration storage for intraday or seasonal power supply. The increasing attractiveness of BESS has also prompted more governments to issue tenders in this sector, mostly in combination with solar PV projects.
Felipe Hernandez, Managing Director of FRV X & Engineering, provided more details on business opportunities in both the stand-alone BESS segment and hybrid PV + storage solutions. Hernandez sees plenty of opportunity in both segments and revealed the various layers in the value stacks of both approaches. Madrid-based FRV is active in the utility-scale power plant market, both as a developer and Independent Power Producer (IPP). Another speaker to provide insights into the PV + storage market was Jorge de Miguel from Vector Renewables, a Spanish renewable energy asset management company and consultancy. De Miguel pointed to the wide range of services BESS can provide to an existing PV power plant, providing for a diversified and future-proof set of revenue streams.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/26/meyer-burger-considers-legal-action-as-oxford-pv-unilaterally-terminates-exclusive-cooperation/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,EUROPE,GERMANY,SWITZERLAND",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 26, 2021",Meyer Burger considers legal action as Oxford PV unilaterally terminates exclusive cooperation,"From pv magazine Germany
Meyer Burger has said it was taken by surprise when Oxford PV released a press statement last week announcing the completion of an expansion to its factory in Brandenburg an der Havel, Germany, which mass produces perovskite tandem solar cells. Hidden among the details was a statement saying it was terminating its exclusive partnership with the Swiss turnkey equipment supplier.
This news was even more surprising, because Oxford PV's CTO Chris Case admitted in response to a question from pv magazine, that it still lacked one of the machines to manufacture the perovskite solar cells.
With a 19.76% stake, Meyer Burger is the largest single shareholder of Oxford PV and Gunter Erfurt, as CEO of Meyer Burger, sits on the board of directors of the PV manufacturer. However, the unilateral termination of the cooperation agreement does not appear to have been initiated via this route.
Today, Meyer Burger said it learned of the termination through the media and a letter from Oxford PV. “In view of Oxford PV's unexpected announcement, Meyer Burger is considering legal options to enforce its rights,” said the company.
Oxford PV cited “its own strategic reasons” as the reason for terminating the cooperation agreement. In response to an inquiry from pv magazine last week, Oxford PV explained the termination by saying Meyer Burger had changed its business model, and these changes are not compatible with its own plans.
In 2019, the two PV companies entered an exclusive partnership. Their goal was to make the mass production of perovskite tandem solar cells based on Meyer Burger's heterojunction technology market ready. To this end, Meyer Burger developed the production equipment and maintained the partnership when it announced its strategic transition from equipment manufacturer to solar cell and module producer.
Meyer Burger's production facilities in Germany’s Bitterfeld and Freiberg have since ramped up, each with 400 MW of annual capacity. Oxford PV, which is in the process of setting up a 100 MW production facility for its tandem cells in Brandenburg an der Havel, is not yet ready.
Originally scheduled to start production this summer, Friday's announcement now says this is targeted for 2022. The reason for the delay is on the equipment side and the impact of the Corona pandemic, Oxford PV said when asked by pv magazine.
Meyer Burger says it is skeptical about such an imminent production start. “Meyer Burger's assessment was and is that perovskite tandem technology will only reach the technology and production maturity, product reliability and cost structure required for competitive mass production in a few years' time.”
Nevertheless, perovskite tandem solar cells remain an integral part of the Swiss manufacturer's technology roadmap. Especially since Meyer Burger has a large portfolio of processes, technologies, and production techniques for its own potential mass production of tandem solar cells and modules, based on its own developments and know-how, it said.
“This includes the essential manufacturing processes and machines for perovskite tandem solar cells and corresponding solar modules with Meyer Burger's proprietary Smartwire interconnection technology,” it continued. It said these are essential for the cost-effective mass production of reliable products.
Oxford PV, in turn, is one of the pioneers in the development of perovskite technology, which enables significantly higher efficiencies than crystalline PV products. In December 2020, for example, the company set a new certified world record efficiency of 29.52% for its perovskite solar cells. However, no PV manufacturer in the world has yet succeeded in transferring its successes from the laboratory to mass production.
In this respect, too, Oxford PV aims to be a pioneer with its plant in Brandenburg an der Havel. “Since 2017, we have been operating a small volume line on site, which has allowed us to optimize our product and verify that we are achieving our long-term stability and manufacturability targets,” CEO Frank Averdung said after Friday's announcement.
“Now that the technology is ready to go and the factory build is complete, we look forward to the journey ahead to achieve our mission of making perovskite photovoltaics a mainstream solar technology.”
It was the following sentence that caused some buzz – at least on the Swiss side – over the weekend: “With the achievement of this factory milestone, Oxford PV has ended its exclusive relationship with Meyer Burger.”
Despite the termination of the cooperation agreement, Oxford PV states that it does not expect this to have any impact on the delivery of the remaining machines and that Meyer Burger will fulfill its contractual obligations.
Regarding the intended scaling, the PV manufacturer refers to other production equipment suppliers for heterojunction solar cells. In addition, the company says it will rely on industry-standard equipment for thin film production for the perovskite top cell. There are many alternative suppliers for this as well, Oxford PV said. Therefore, based on its own growth plans, it will source equipment from other suppliers in the future.

The second announcement, revealed by Madrid-based solar developer Dhamma Energy, concerns a plan by Eni business Eni gas e luce to acquire the Spanish and French solar assets of Dhamma, for an undisclosed investment.
A press release issued by Dhamma today stated the deal, if approved by regulators, will involve the transfer of more than 120 MW of operational or under-construction solar generation capacity in France as part of a more-than-2.8 GW development pipeline across France and Spain. Some 400 MW of that total figure, Dhamma said, is at an “advanced stage of development.”
News broke earlier today of Eni's purchase of a 1.2 GW Spanish renewable energy portfolio from Azora, which includes five “advanced stage solar projects” with a total generation capacity of 1 GW, which are expected to be operational by 2024.
As pv magazine has reported, Eni only entered the Spanish PV market in February, with the purchase of 140 MW of capacity from U.S. and Canadian-owned, Madrid-based developer X-Elio.
Dhamma Energy today said it would continue to operate in other markets, such as Mexico, where the company boasts a 2 GWp development pipeline, according to its LinkedIn page. The developer also said it would focus on its recent green hydrogen business.
Eni chief executive Claudio Descalzi, quoted in today's Dhamma Energy press release, said: “This transaction will help to boost our renewable power generation capacity in accordance with our growth strategy by continuing to expand in Spain and especially by launching our presence in the renewables sector in France, where Eni gas e luce already has a solid presence and a significant customer base. For Eni gas e luce, France and Spain are pivotal markets in which the company will increasingly enhance its value through the integration between [electricity] retail and renewables.”
Dhamma said it was supported in its solar portfolio sale by the Nomura Greentech business of the Japanese financial holding company Nomura, as financial advisor; and by London-headquartered law firm Fieldfisher, and Madrid-based Gómez-Acebo & Pombo Abogados, as legal advisors.

Italian energy company Eni has entered into an agreement to purchase a 1.2 GW renewable energy portfolio in Spain from independent real asset manager Azora.
The portfolio owned by Azora comprises three operational wind farms, one wind farm under construction (with a total of 230 MW between them) and five large solar power projects in advanced stages of development comprising 1 GW. The assets are located in Andalusia, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y León, Catalonia, Galicia, and La Rioja.
Azora and Eni say they will work together to ensure the entry into production of the five solar power projects by 2024 and add that they are developing a broader strategic agreement to continue to expand Eni's renewable energy platform in Spain – a market it entered in February with the purchase of 140 MW of PV projects from X-Elio.
Lazard and Uría Menéndez advised Azora on the financial and legal aspects of the transaction, respectively.
Santiago Olivares, partner in charge of Azora's infrastructure investments, commented, “We will leverage our track record of more than 20 years in this sector to support Eni in its ambitious growth plan.”
Among its plans, Eni also wants to develop a significant renewable portfolio in Italy. A few months ago, it announced the creation of a joint venture with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Equity that will see around €800 million invested in renewable energies in the country until 2025. The two companies plan to build 1 GW solar and wind with the option to use Italian government properties.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/26/how-energytag-plans-to-revamp-the-renewable-energy-certificate-market-with-hourly-timestamps/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,EUROPE",BECKY BEETZ,"JULY 26, 2021",How EnergyTag plans to revamp the renewable energy certificate market with hourly timestamps,"
Toby Ferenczi, founder, EnergyTag: My background is in renewables and startups. I completed my PhD in solar and then worked for GE. Following that, I established a U.K. startup for solar rooftop financing and installation. We sold this in 2013 to Hanergy. Through my work, I became interested in rebalancing electricity and energy storage and set up another company – a demand response aggregation platform called VCharge. This was acquired by OVO Energy, the one of the largest energy suppliers in the U.K., about four years ago. I was still interested in issues like grid balancing, how consumers buy green energy, and the enormous demand for renewables coming from individuals and corporates. So, I started digging into the difficult question of how its possible choose one type of electricity over another, given all power plants are connected to the same electrical network and you can't physically distinguish where your electricity is coming from.
Despite the global pandemic and recession, corporate purchases of clean energy are booming. In recognition of this, the UP Initiative will spend Q3 2021 investigating sustainable electricity supply. In the upcoming August edition of pv magazine, we will look at the evolving global business model landscape. You can also read our already published coverage, including an interview with RE100, and a BNEF Op-ed on 24/7 RES and net zero goals.
For over 20 years, there have been established systems of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). These are called Guarantees of Origin (GO) certificates in Europe or Renewable Energy Credits in the U.S. These systems exist everywhere where you have a liberalized energy market and are the only legal way for you to claim that your energy is coming from a renewable source.
If you have a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a solar farm, but you don’t have the GO’s from that farm, then you're not allowed to say your electricity is coming from there. The reason for that is because you need to be sure that there's no double counting or other types of fraud – EACs provide a robust tracking and accounting system to prevent this.
PPAs can be very good for helping developers get new plants built, if the PPA is long enough, because there's a fixed price, and the counter-party is bankable. If the corporate doesn't have a good credit rating and isn’t able to take risk, then it's much less valuable to developers, so only a small number of corporates can really help developers.
I concluded that the certificate system is important, but there's quite a lot of confusion in the market, because people think, ‘Well, if I have a PPA why do I need a GO certificate?’ So, what we need to do is to enhance the current certificate schemes, and everyone who's involved in it, along with us to build this market. We don't want to replace the current system; we want to build a complementary one that eventually gets adopted by the existing system. The current certificate scheme has been so successful in driving adoption of renewables and so many corporates now are signing up to these certificates. There were 700 million certificates in Europe traded last year. Now they are ready to evolve as more data is now available.
The way current certificates work is by matching annual electricity consumption with annual production. This means if you use 10 MW hours of energy as a corporate consumer, for example, and I buy 10 MW hours’ worth of certificates that were produced over the same 12-month window, I can declare myself to be 100% renewable – you’re just matching your total annual consumption with total annual production, without considering the time of day it was produced. In one sense, this means you can be claiming to use solar energy at night or in winter.
It wasn’t a problem before because there wasn't a grid balancing problem. Now we've got times where there’s massive overproduction of renewables, and other times where there’s not, and that's not reflected in the current certificate prices, which are the same regardless of time of day or time of year. We know the location of the plant, when it was built and what type of electricity it produces, but not the time the electricity was produced
So, my realization was that if you add a timestamp to the certificate and then you get consumers to match supply and demand on an hourly or half hourly basis to the power market then you create a price signal that reflects the real world availability of clean energy. Thus, the certificates can be priced according to supply and demand, meaning they’re cheap when there’s lots of renewable supply and expensive when there's less. It's a simple extension of the existing certificate.
It also allows corporates and individuals to send a price signal for storage, because if you're a battery, you can buy these certificates when they're cheap, when there's lots of renewables on the grid, and you can sell them when they're expensive, say at nighttime.
Demand is initially coming from corporates like Google and Microsoft, who have said ‘We want to buy clean energy on a 24/7 basis and by that we mean we want to demonstrate that every hour of the day our energy is coming from renewable sources.’ They are leading the way because they have a huge demand for data centers. The Biden administration also said they want to buy 24/7 renewables for the U.S. Federal Government. We have also got participation from the majority of large utilities in Europe, and over 100 other key organizations globally.
EnergyTag is not developing a technology, rather it's a nonprofit that is providing a market framework. There's a whole range of software companies out there that already have the technology to track and manage these certificates. You need access to the smart meter data and the hourly generation data, which probably wasn't there a few years ago. But it is there now.
Some people are using blockchain to do this and some are not but it's not really about blockchain.  The other nice thing about certificates is you don't need to be a big corporate with a big balance sheet to participate – anyone can buy them.
It's not a binary thing where you're either not green or you're 100% green, because no-one can be 100% renewable on a 24/7 basis today – that's not how the system works. Even Google say they're not going to get to be 24/7 carbon free until 2030. What corporates will start to say is, ‘Today we're at 60% renewables on a 24/7 basis and next year we want to get to 70% renewables, and we'll pay a bit extra to buy renewables in those hours where there's less of it available.’ That sends the right price signal. The market then helps not just in terms of building more renewables but also storage. And it also has implications for lots of other things in the energy system, like scope two emissions reporting.
It's also not just about renewables and storage deployment, it’s also about electrification. The quickest way to decarbonize is to decarbonize the power sector through renewables and then electrify everything, like transport. Granular certificates can help encourage smart charging of appliances, for instance allowing EV drivers to know that they are charging their car with renewables.
And there's a link to green hydrogen. There's a new suggestion from the EU that states for something to be classed as green hydrogen you need to show it was produced with renewable electricity, so you will need a certificate that states this information, which doesn't exist today.
We have six demonstration projects underway in the U.S., Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Australia. The big corporates are involved, like Google and Microsoft, who are buying the energy, and the biggest utilities and grid operators in Europe, and some software companies that track and manage the certificates. The market should be up and running by the end of this year. We also regularly engage with the EU Commission, and we hope the guidelines we are writing may one day be adopted by the EU system.
It's just another revenue stream for them, particularly those also developing storage. Developers already get money from selling traditional certificates but it's not a massive revenue stream compared to selling the power. But we think that by moving to this more granular system, electricity certificates should be cheaper in some hours and more expensive for others which creates opportunities.
Although the prices of traditional certificates have jumped recently from a low base, we think they will play an increasingly important revenue stream for new projects and particularly project developers who are using storage and are able to produce electricity at other times. Now you've got price cannibalization issues because you’ve got lots of solar in the grid and the more solar you add the more energy you’re producing in the middle of the day, which pushes down power prices and that creates an incentive to produce energy at other times.

Sturdee said it had begun the permitting and project development process for a planned 3 MWac solar plant at Bobonong, in the east of the Southern African country, and for a 1 MWac array at Shakawe, in northwestern Botswana.
The South African developer said the two projects would cost $5.5 million and would be expected to generate more than 10 GWh of solar electricity in their first year of operation. No completion date was mentioned in the press release issued by Sturdee today but the company did say it had committed to ‘citizen economic empowerment' targets – including skills transfer – as part of the project, which it was awarded in 2019.
Describing the planned plants as “Botswana’s first two renewable energy IPP [independent power producer] projects,” Sturdee said the national power company had agreed to purchase the electricity to be generated for 25 years, without specifying an agreed figure for each kilowatt-hour sold.
David Kgoboko, chief executive of the national utility which will be the power offtaker, said the two plants would be the first of a planned dozen which will bring a total 35 MW of solar generation capacity to the Botswana grid by the end of next year.
Kgoboko, quoted in the Sturdee press release, said: “The signing of the two PPAs [power purchase agreements] marks a major milestone for the adoption of renewable energy in Botswana’s new energy mix and increases energy security for our country in an environmentally sustainable manner.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency estimated Botswana had just 6 MW of grid-connected solar capacity at the end of 2020.

Hitachi ABB Power Grids in India today announced it has successfully commissioned one of India’s longest ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmission links for Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. 
The ±800 kV, 6GW link can meet the electricity needs of more than 80 million people. It stretches 1,800-kilometers to connect Raigarh in Central India to Pugalur in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Reliable power can now be transmitted in either direction depending on demand, with exceptionally low power losses and minimal environmental footprint. 
The link strengthens grid resilience and stabilizes the power infrastructure by combining traditional and renewable power generation. It enables further development and integration of sustainable energy, supporting the government’s goal of reaching 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030.
Using HVDC helps conserve the environment by only occupying about one-third of the land compared to a traditional AC link. In this case, the link amounts to a saving of approximately 130 square kilometers – equal to a quarter of the area of Mumbai. 
Hitachi ABB Power Grids worked with the customer, government agencies, local authorities and suppliers to deliver the link during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responsible project execution with health and safety at the forefront was key to this achievement. 
N Venu, Managing Director and CEO, Hitachi ABB Power Grids in India, said, “With the commissioning of this groundbreaking UHVDC link, we have kept our promise to enable more clean and reliable power for millions of people, helping to build a future where electricity will be the backbone of the entire energy system. During the entire project, the health and safety of our customers, employees, and partners remained our top priority.” 
The consortium of Hitachi ABB Power Grids and state-owned engineering and manufacturing firm BHEL won the order in 2016 from Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. Hitachi ABB Power Grids has been responsible for delivering the UHVDC converter stations, including design, engineering, construction, installation, and commissioning, as well as major equipment, including 800 kV converter transformers, converter valves, high-voltage products and control and protection technology. 
Switzerland-headquartered Hitachi ABB Power Grids is the global market leader in HVDC technology. In India, the company has introduced the HVDC technology with the Vindhyachal project in 1989. Raigarh-Pugalur is the company’s sixth HVDC project in India and the second UHVDC installation, following the multi-terminal NorthEast Agra link.

With just a touch of a button on your smartphone, you, too, can assimilate into a regional power plant from your garage.
All around the nation, a flurry of virtual power plants (VPP) have been making news. Comprised entirely of distributed residential energy storage, these plants stabilize the grid and often eliminate the need for new fossil peaker plants.
Starting July 22, if you have a Tesla Powerwall and app installed, you can “opt in” to the California Tesla Virtual Power Plant. The company page notes the project is currently being offered with no compensation and is being used as a public service during the current California power grid challenges.
The Tesla VPP website also said that as many as 50,000 Powerwalls are available, to create “the largest distributed battery system in the world.” Most of the Tesla Powerwalls that are installed are 5 kW/13.5 kWh, suggesting a maximum potential capacity of 250 MW/675 MWh.
Data collated by the California Solar & Storage Association from the California ISO power grid suggests that in 2020 alone, 165 MW/428 MWh of distributed energy storage was installed. Since 2011, the data shows 530 MW of distributed energy storage connected, suggesting a total stored capacity approaching 1,500 MWh.
Tesla has experience with networked VPPs. Its South Australia plant has a 50,000-unit goal, and is almost 10% deployed. That plant has been given credit for supporting the broader power grid during complex events.
Powerwall owners who opt in should expect their batteries to be used during so-called “flex events,” like those which occurred earlier this summer, prompting a record 999 MW energy storage injection of power into the California grid.
And, considering the Texas power outage this past winter, a new Tesla-powered housing complex in Austin should attract some attention. The development is set to incorporate as many as 10,000 SolarRoofs and Powerwalls. Tesla says this nascent complex will become a testbed for its technology.
But Tesla’s announcements are just the tip of the iceberg. Managed, distributed energy storage projects have been making headlines with increasing frequency and the average project size has been increasing as well.
Multiple parties commented to pv magazine USA that these projects are growing in size and delivering solid data.
Sonnen and its sonnenCommunity platform is likely the oldest residential energy storage VPP platform in the industry. Whole neighborhoods of this battery have been around for years.
Vermont electric utility Green Mountain Power should be given credit for its VPP, too. First launched in 2017, it now includes thousands of large and small Tesla batteries. Early on, the VPP saved $500,000 during a heatwave.
And of course, we can only wonder how many – and what new types – of VPP programs Lynn Jurich and team at Sunrun have been cooking up.
Sunrun’s NE-ISO capacity market win was a watershed moment for residential solar-plus-storage on the bid power grid. Since then, the company has signed multiple VPP deals made up of slices of its hundreds of thousands of rooftop and garage power plants.
And let’s not forget Sunrun's recent announcement with Ford, which suggests we should expect vehicle-to-grid VPP integration – especially considering the truck is expected to come with a battery somewhere near 150 kWh in capacity.
VPPs are clearly a recipe for grid success. Add in a dash of OhmConnect paying its homeowners hundreds of thousands of dollars with demand response during California power grid flex events, and we can begin to see some real smarts emerging from well managed distributed resource power grid.
One big reason these VPPs exist is that distributed power grid assets were bought as part of a grassroots energy movement. Homeowners and business owners who paid for energy storage in their garages and businesses are directly improving grid reliability. The killer innovation is in using software to use these assets in a way that maximizes electricity savings and grid stability for everyone connected to the grid.
Research by Vibrant Energy projects has indicated that integrating the privately owned 250 GW of distributed solar and 4 TWh of distributed energy storage could save over $470 billion in general electricity costs. Those savings are delivered to all ratepayers and not just those who invest in the assets themselves. By the way, $120 billion of those savings would go to California alone.
