The event showed that pandemic disruptions and supply chain issues are not slowing down demand in the region's markets.
Official figures on the numbers of exhibitors and attendants were not released prior to publication, but the size of the event has increased from years past, with some some observers estimating that it may have grown by up to 50%. The nature of attendees has also changed, with more professionals participating to search for business opportunities.
Several projects in the Middle East have been delayed in recent years, but now they are being resumed and are slowly going online. New projects are also being announced and big pipelines are consolidating in markets such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Key markets
However, local analysts are calling for a conservative approach to these markets, as they are driven by very low bids in energy auctions, with strong pressure on prices. However, the market is trying to find a balance between low prices and the volatility of the supply chain.
“We always considered the WFES the develop our strategy for the region in terms of products and technology,” Mohammed Saadi, head of technical services and product management at Chinese module maker JinkoSolar told pv magazine. “This is our second edition and we saw significant improvements. There are more global players and we also see consultants and media.”
Saadi said demand is increasing across the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
“For this and next year, we should ship up to 8 GW of solar modules in these markets,” he added, noting that the hottest markets for the utility-scale business might be Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Egypt, and Morocco. “For the distributed generation segments, the most interesting markets should be Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen, where last year we shipped more than 100 MW.”
Marwan Al Jaber, JA Solar‘s sales director for the Middle East, told pv magazine that the Chinese company received a lot of serious inquiries at the Abu Dhabi event.
“Demand is increasing even in some of those Middle East regions where there is no regulation and something is also now moving in the residential business,” he said. “The most active market right now is Saudi Arabia, especially for the utility scale segment, as well as for commercial and industrial projects.”
He said Lebanon is also growing, despite its deep financial crisis, due to chronic energy shortages.
“Solar energy is the most reliable source of electricity right now,” Al Jaber stated. “At this regard, Yemen is also an interesting market.”
Bright Sun, the chief marketing officer MEA&CA for China's Longi, told pv magazine that the module manufacturer met new and old customers at the Abu Dhabi event.
“We see the market accelerating in MENA and we also see companies from Central Asia and Africa joining the event here,” added Sun, who claimed that regional demand will more than triple year on year for Longi in 2023.
“We already signed a deal for a big project in Saudi Arabia and also in the UAE and Qatar,” he said.
Mohit Shrimal, marketing director for Huawei, told pv magazine that this year was the fifth consecutive year that the inverter manufacturer has a presence at the Abu Dhabi event.
“It offers easy market access not only to the Middle East but also to Africa,” said Shrimal. “Inverter demand here is increasing despite the technology challenges and chip shortages and we expect a very fruitful five-year period.”
Hydrogen hopes
Mohammad Youssef, a spokesperson for Chinese inverter maker Sungrow, said the success of the Abu Dhabi event underscores the “prosperity” of the market.
The market will see strong growth in the utility-scale segment this year, but we also expect impressive growth in the distributed generation business,” he told pv magazine. “We also started to make first shipments for storage energy systems but, compared with more mature markets such as the United States and Europe, their economical viability remains challenging.
Ray Luiz, regional director of MENA for inverter maker TBEA, said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the most promising markets. He noted that both string and central inverters are gaining acceptance throughout the Middle East. “It depends on the client's request, but we tend to offer boths solutions in all these markets,” he said.
A spokesperson for Austrian inverter manufacturer Fronius said the Abu Dhabi event was well attended by PV product distributors.
“We keep seeing strong demand in the C&I business, although the residential segment remains limited in volumes,” the Fronius spokesperson said. “It will likely become a big market likely in the next couple of years. Jordan are Saudi Arabia probably the most promising markets in this regard, as well as Yemen and Lebanon.”
Given UAE’s green hydrogen ambitions, it is no surprise that Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ABSW), which also took place last week, gave pride of place to its Green Hydrogen Summit (GHS).
Executive Director Masdar Clean Energy Fawaz Al Muharrami told pv magazine that the company is aiming for 100 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. He said approximately 25% of this will be devoted to green hydrogen production (or its derivatives), with the target of producing 1 million tons of green hydrogen per annum by 2050.
But while green hydrogen is verging on becoming a buzzword before it becomes a booming market, at least one speaker at the ADSW Green Hydrogen Summit didn’t forget the key word – sustainable. Wale Shonibare – the African Development Bank’s director of energy financial solutions, policy and regulations – said that when it comes to green hydrogen project development in Africa, “we don’t want to repeat the mistakes of fossil fuels,” He added that “local communities” also deserve consideration.
“Africa’s No. 1 problem is energy access, so we need to integrate local communities into the value chain,” continued Shonibare, who noted that green hydrogen offers African nations an export market in hard currency which can be used to develop local infrastructure.
In the midst of entertaining the enormous scope of the green hydrogen future and how it can help hard to abate industries and fossil fuel dependent economies transition away from carbon-intensive resources, it was interesting to note the concept of “additionality” was also on the lips of attendees.
A tangential concern in green hydrogen development in developing regions like sub-Saharan African is the water intensity of inherent processes and how they might affect already water scarce areas. However, Masdar’s head of business development for green hydrogen, Dr. Faye Al Hersh, told pv magazine that the amount of water required for electrolysis is not as significant as some people might think.
“The majority of the water required for the green hydrogen production process is actually for cooling, and this does not need to be desalinated water, it can be seawater for example,” said Al Hersh.

Spain deployed around 2,507 MW of new PV systems under its self-consumption regime, according to data from Unión Española Fotovoltaica (UNEF). This figure represents an increase of 108% from 2021, when 1,203 MW were commissioned.
At the end of December, Spain reached around 5,249 MW of cumulative installed power for self-consumption. About 47% of the new capacity additions have been installed in the industrial sector, followed by 32% in the residential sector, and 20% in the commercial sector. Off-grid installations accounted for just 1% of the total.
A 2021 study by the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE) showed that installed self-consumption capacity could reach between 9,000 MW and 14,000 MW by 2030.
Other countries are trying to accelerate self-consumption so that companies and households can cope with the current situation of volatility in energy prices. Germany eliminates value-added tax on self-consumption and residential batteries, and the Netherlands has also adopted the same measure.

This category includes all utility-scale PV plants that are being planned outside of the country's auction scheme, the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP). They all have capacities of less than 100 MW.
The South African authorities have raised the licensing threshold for embedded generation projects from 1 MW to 100 MW in August 2021.
“The first of these large-scale projects are expected to connect to the grid by the end of this year,” NECOM said in a six-month progress update on the implementation of the Energy Action Plan. It said it also plans to hold a tender for utility- scale storage. “The RFP for battery storage has been finalised and will be released to the market shortly.”
South Africa wants to reduce energy dependence on its state-owned utility, Eskom. The troubled company, which is unable to meet national power demand due to financial and operational issues, recently began considering renewables for its plant portfolio.

The consortium aims to develop standardized cost-effective PV modules, mounting structures, and O&M solutions that meet the needs of various crops across climates and landscapes. Planned innovations will include the use of functional coatings from Dutch tech specialist Physee in greenhouses. The coatings reportedly optimize the sunlight entering the greenhouse through spectral shifting by converting UV light into photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which improves crop growth.
The pilot project will also seek to adapt single horizontal axis tracker technology used in PV utility-scale systems to agrivoltaic applications. The tracker technology of Italian manufacturer Valmont Solar, a unit of US-based Valmont Industries, will be used in three steel mono-axial tracker structures more than 2.10 meters high. The trackers will be made of weathering steel, a low-cost material that turns brown over time, lowering the visual impact of the structure.
Symbiosyst will also develop a SCADA control system paired with a tracker tilting control system. The project will demonstrate the technology by setting up agrivoltaic plant demonstrators. The solutions will be in-field studied in four agricultural scenarios differing in location, climate, size, and kinds of crops.
“Our role at Eurac Research will concern the development of methodologies to aid the early design of agri-PV plants, to look into sustainability aspects and to go beyond social acceptance,” said David Moser, project coordinator.
The other consortium members include Belgian research center Imec, Italian research energy ENEA, German module manufacturer Aleo Solar, and Spain's Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, as well as Engie Laborelec, KU-Leuven, TU-Delft, 3E, Physee, Lucisun, Kubo Group, Above Surveying, ETA Italia, Südtiroler Bauernbund, and Versuchszentrum Laimburg.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/23/sustainable-capital-offers-e100m-of-financing-for-eu-hydrogen-companies/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ESTONIA,GERMANY,NETHERLANDS",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JANUARY 23, 2023",Sustainable Capital offers €100m of financing for EU hydrogen companies,"UK-based Sustainable Capital has launched a €100m financial instrument through its Orestes vehicle dedicated to scaling up Europe's hydrogen economy.
The company is interested in mobility solutions technologies already singled out by the European Union as part of ‘Important projects of common European interest' (IPCEIs), mostly focusing on companies active in hydrogen valleys in Estonia, Germany, and the Netherlands.
“These three countries have the best-organized approach to the market,” Scott Levy, founder of Sustainable Capital, told pv magazine. He explained that hydrogen companies in these countries present a lower risk profile.
Levy is not considering the United Kingdom for now, as there are no UK companies with the IPCEI designation. “The UK has been allocating so little money that I don't believe the allocated money will make a substantial difference in the commercialization of the technologies.”
Sustainable Capital and Orestes are focusing on companies in the pre-commercialization stage.
“We are not talking about start-ups nor companies about to go IPO. We are looking at Stage 2 and Stage 3, companies that passed their proof of concept; they are at the technical development level,” Levy stated.
At least 50% of the portfolio will focus on hydrogen-powered mobility. “The primary focus is on increasing the efficiency of mobility solutions because that is the one where we have the most advanced business cases: delivery of hydrogen infrastructure, hydrogen refilling stations, hydrogen-powered drones or hydrogen-powered vehicles,” said Levy. 
Orestes is also looking at the “most advanced companies in the electrolyzer market,” the companies closest to commercialization. They discarded, for now, long-term investments like hydrogen transport. 
The new instrument will tackle companies active in the green and turquoise hydrogen business. Turquoise hydrogen uses a hydrocarbon feedstock as the source of hydrogen atoms, performing pyrolysis in the absence of air and water to form hydrogen and solid carbon.
Orestes shortlisted two companies and one project for its initial investments: energy storage technologies-focused Skeleton, autonomous transportation company AuveTech, and the production facility in Emsland, Germany, which converted an Audi plant into a hydrogen delivery process. 
“These companies are on our initial list – but, of course, not exclusive – because they have demonstrable product deliveries and, as such, a relatively shorter roadmap to commercialization,” said Levy. 
Orestes also considered a series of ESG metrics, the companies' balance sheets, and business ratios. The portfolio is classified as Article 9 and is Orestes' third offering.
“Investment in hydrogen is going to be bigger than the space race. There are billions and trillions on the budget. The numbers are ridiculous,” added Levy.

“One specific concern is vibration – how much do the modules shake as a robot brushes them,” researcher Ben Figgis told pv magazine. “We found that the key factor was how large the modules were and that, regardless of differences in glass thickness and framing, modules with similar sizes tended to exhibit roughly the same amount of vibration.”
The study identifies the threshold of deflection at which solar cell damage can occur. The scientists set up an experimental setting at the QEERI testing facility in Doha and ran several tests on five crystalline silicon panels and on a thin-film module based on copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tech. All of the panels were south-oriented and mounted in landscape orientation, with a tilt angle of 22 degrees.
“The modules had various frame thicknesses, so to achieve the same height of the module upper surface spacers were added beneath the frames of some modules, at the clamps,” they explained. “The thin-film CIGS, module F, was mounted with clamps on vertical metal profiles, also bringing its front surface to the same height as the other modules.”
For their experiments, the academics used a linear rotating dry-brush robot provided by Saudi manufacturer Nomadd Desert Solar Solutions. “The vibration results observed in this study are particular to the robot used, and other robots are likely to produce different vibrations,” they warned. “Each module was measured three times, i.e. with three robot passes in one direction, on non-windy days.”
The research group found that displacements of the modules from their neutral position, or deflection magnitudes, under robot cleaning were “very small” for all panels.
“There was moderate consistency in the severity and number of vibrations over the three robot passes that were conducted for each module,” they said, noting that the robot does not pose a threat to the modules. “Overall, it seems the main factor in a module’s vibration amplitude is its size.”
The scientists also determined that an hour of strong wind made the panels vibrate more than when exposed to the cleaning robot.
“This reinforces the earlier conclusion that this particular robot seems unlikely to be a risk for flexing-related PV module degradation, because natural wind has a stronger influence;” they said.
They presented their findings in “PV module vibration by robotic cleaning,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/23/spray-passivation-to-reduce-losses-in-topcon-hjt-cell-to-module-process/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 23, 2023","Spray passivation to reduce losses in TOPCon, HJT cell-to-module process","Researchers led by Hebei University in China have developed a low-temperature, non-vacuum, large-area spray passivation technique to compensate for the efficiency losses caused by the cutting and separating process in the production of shingled solar panels based on TOPCon and HJT technology.
The academics explained that the losses are caused by the integration of stripes into the shingled panels in the cell-to-module (CTM) process, as the solar cells must be cut into more subcells through a laser scribing process that leaves unpassivated edge surfaces, which in turn results in efficiency declines due to recombination.
“In order to compensate this recombination loss during the CTM process, we used a organic polymer ink mixed by ethanol, water and Nafion to form the passivation layer,” the scientists said. “We show that the organic passivation coating can substantially reduce the newly formed edge loss from laser scribing.”
The said the spraying method can produce a uniform film on the passivate side compared to the unpassivated one.
“The solar cells with the passivation layer are much brighter than those without one. It indicates that the organic passivation layer has an excellent edge passivation effect for both TOPCon and SHJ solar cells and the edge recombination losses are largely reduced,” they said, adding that the passivation layer significantly increases the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of cells.
They found that the technique could increase the fill factor of a 24.4%-efficient HJT device from 77.9% to 82.5%, with the efficiency itself growing by 1% to 2%.
“The device can achieve long-term stability through the careful controlling of humidity and the simple packaging technology,” they also stated.
The latest edition of pv magazine considers how industry heavyweights are increasingly planning gigawatt-scale assets, looks at the huge potential repowering could unlock for German solar, and examines how solar can help trucking companies in the energy transition. A packed edition also features a focus on the Middle East.
The scientists introduced the new technique in “Compensating Cutting Losses by Passivation Solution for Industry Upgradation of TOPCon and SHJ Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy & Sustainability Research. The research group also includes scientists from Chinese module maker Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., Ltd. and the Quzhou Green Industry Clustering Zone.
“This straightforward and non-vacuum method is compatible with current production line and can be directly applied to industrial silicon solar cells in the future,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/23/new-method-to-measure-energy-yield-of-bifacial-pv-systems/,"INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 23, 2023",New method to measure energy yield of bifacial PV systems,"Researchers from the Sunlab laboratory at the University of Ottawa have devised a new way to measure the energy yield of bifacial PV systems. The innovation is intended to complement the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) measuring standard introduced in 2019.
The new scaled rear irradiance (SRI) method purportedly improves IEC measurements by accommodating the effects of different ground covers’ spectral albedo in its calculation of the bifacial system’s rear-side irradiance.
To prove the concept, the scientists modeled the performance of a bifacial silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar module under the IEC bifacial illumination technique and the SRI method. They mounted the system on a horizontal single-axis tracker 1.22 meters from the ground in Boulder, Colorado, United States. The ground covers considered were soil, red brick, green grass, roof shingle, concrete, sand, dry grass, and snow.
Results show that for a rear irradiance of 200 W/square meters, the IEC measurement does not distinguish between the different ground covers, overestimating bifacial gain by between 14% and 1.4% for all ground covers except snow. The SRI method, on the other hand, shows a clear differentiation between the range of operating conditions.
“Implementation of this method into international standards for such panels can enable predictions of outdoor bifacial panel performance to within 2% absolute,” said researcher Erin Tonita.
The new method can also predict energy yield gains in locations other than Boulder with an error of less than 7%, according to the academics.
The innovation could be used to compare different bifacial technologies and enhance system performance via ground cover-specific design optimization, the authors said. They shared their findings in “A general illumination method to predict bifacial photovoltaic system performance,” which was recently published in Joule.

South Korea-based PV module manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells’ Q.Maxx BLK-G5+ and Q.Maxx-G5+ panels are based on its proprietary Q.antum Duo technology, which has been refined to deliver greater power and efficiency.
Q Cells said the technology reduces electrical and optical losses by halving the current passing through each cell and making use of incident light more effectively. The manufacturer said the technology, in combination with half cells, multi-busbars and wire interconnection provided a power gain of 7.5% over standard PERC technology.
The Q.Maxx BLK-G5+ solar panels are available in two versions: 415 W products with power conversion efficiencies of 21.3% and a white frame, and an all-black 390 W to 400 W modules with efficiency ratings of 21%. They all measure 1,722 mm × 1,134 mm × 30 mm and weigh in at 21.1 kg. Q Cells said the new panels are “installation friendly” with the frame allowing multiple clamp and bolt options and up to 13 mounting configurations.
The panels come with a 25-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty. The first-year degradation is said to be no more than 2.0% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 86% of the nominal output power. According to the manufacturer, orders for the new modules are already open and the panels will be ready for installation on Australian homes by February.

The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) has completed final interconnection studies for 27 renewable energy and transmission projects for which the developers have agreed to interconnection costs.
The projects include 1.6 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of storage, which compares to 16 GW of solar and 14 GW of storage in NYISO’s interconnection queue studies at the end of 2021, according to data from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The projects also include 2.3 GW of offshore wind and 0.8 GW of onshore wind, compared to 37 GW of offshore wind and 4 GW of onshore wind in the NYISO queue at the end of 2021.
The approved transmission project is the 1.25 GW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line known as the Champlain Hudson Power Express, for which construction began in November 2022. The total interconnection costs for all approved projects is about $600 million, including about $200 million to interconnect the transmission project.
The approved projects “will help move the state closer to the clean energy mandates” of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, said Zach Smith, NYISO’s vice president of system and resource planning. Under that law, New York has an interim goal of reducing climate pollution 40% by 2030, compared to the 1990 level.
NYISO said in a statement that it “continues working with stakeholders to implement improvements to the interconnection study process.” The transmission operator said that additional engineers and project management staff have joined the planning department, and that ongoing focus groups with developers aim to identify “additional areas for enhancements.”
In addition, new technology is being developed, NYISO said, that will “create efficiencies in managing demands for applicants as well as NYISO staff.”
Last year, Texas grid operator ERCOT reported that it had completed final interconnection studies for 6 GW of solar interconnection requests in 2021, while the California Independent System Operator reported completing such studies for 5 GW of solar. Grid operator Midcontinent Independent System Operator in the central United States reported that generator interconnection agreements for 6 GW of solar projects were filed in 2021. A generator interconnection agreement follows a final interconnection study.
NYISO has made available a list of the 27 projects that are advancing. NYISO reviews requests to interconnect to the transmission grid using a “cluster study” process, which NYISO calls a “class year” process, as described in “The NYISO Interconnection Process.” In reporting on the 27 projects, NYISO said the “decision/settlement process for Class Year 2021” has been completed.
