The overall figure accounts for 160 deals and represents a 42% year-on-year increase from 2022, when $24.1 billion was made across 175 deals.
Funding from private marketing financing reached $7.4 billion last year, a 45% increase from last year and the second highest figure since 2013. Meanwhile, solar companies raised $20 billion in debt financing, a 67% increase from last year and the highest amount in the last decade. Mercom Capital Group said securitization activity was a key contributor, with $3.4 billion in 11 deals.
Funding from solar venture capital activity was down 1% on last year, reaching $6.9 billion across 69 deals in 2023. From that figure, $4.7 billion (68%) went to 42 solar downstream companies. Solar companies raised $1.9 billion, balance of system companies raised $311 million and service providers raised $32 million.
Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said investments into solar continue to defy expectations.
“Driven by the Inflation Reduction Act, the global focus on energy security, and favourable policies worldwide, solar continues to attract significant investments,” he said.
While funding activity was strong, M&A activity declined 25% year-on-year, with 96 corporate transactions in 2023, compared to 128 in 2022. The largest transaction was by Brookfield Renewable, which acquired Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale commercial renewables business in the United States for approximately $2.8 billion.
“Higher borrowing costs have put a damper on M&A transactions, with cautious investors biding their time for more favourable valuations,” Prabhu said. “Solar projects continue to attract interest, but high valuations and a lower risk appetite, compounded by unpredictable project completion timelines due to interconnection delays, labour shortages, and scarcity of components, have all contributed to a drop-off in project M&A activity.”
There were 231 large-scale solar project acquisitions in 2023, down from 268 deals in 2022. In 2023, almost 45.4 GW of solar projects were acquired in 2023, compared to 66 GW in 2022, down 31% year on year.

The group said Saudi Arabia is moving away from investigation and demonstrations and toward larger-scale development. The researchers estimated the total amount of investments made in green hydrogen thus far at around $900 million. However, they also acknowledged that oil remains the backbone of its energy industry and economy.
“Saudi Arabia's economy is heavily dependent on the oil and gas sector, accounting for about 50% of its GDP, 70% of government revenue, and 90% of its export earnings,” they said.

The country launched its National Hydrogen Strategy in 2020, with the aim of becoming a major exporter. Its Vision 2030 strategy set a target to generate 50% of the nation's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030.
The researchers analyzed the potential of hydrogen in all of its possible forms in Saudi Arabia, including green, blue, grey and turquoise hydrogen technologies. They noted that the current hydrogen strategy bets on blue hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, as well as green hydrogen generated with wind and solar electricity.
“The plan aims to produce 1.2 million tons of green hydrogen and to supply 10% of the global demand for hydrogen by 2030,” they explained. “Furthermore, Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (SAPIF) has been investing in several energy projects globally, including a joint venture with Power and Air Products to develop a $5 billion green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. The facility will have a capacity of 1.2 GW and will produce 650 tons of green hydrogen per day.”
One of the key advantages of Saudi Arabia in the hydrogen race is its high solar radiation levels. This, combined with wide land availability, can ensure one of the lowest, if not the lowest, levelized costs of energy (LCOE) for PV in the world.
The scientists identified a series of structural and local challenges that need to be addressed to enable the birth of a hydrogen economy in the country. They cited high capital costs, limited economies of scale, high electrolyzer costs, limited water resources, a lack of incentives, and low demand. They also noted fossil fuel dependency, a lack of regulations and infrastructure, the limited domestic market, and political instability.
“The government needs to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for green hydrogen production and distribution and invest in the necessary infrastructure to support the industry,” the researchers said, adding that a long-term commitment would be needed to reach this goal. “The infrastructural limitations of green hydrogen production in Saudi Arabia related to transportation, storage, and distribution pose significant challenges that must be addressed for the industry to develop.”
The roadmap outlined by the scientists is structured around six main pillars: creating a stable policy framework, building an infrastructure, setting up an R&D ecosystem, building demand, creating capacity, and supporting cooperation between all players.
If all of these actions materialize, Saudi Arabia could become a hydrogen exporter between 2030 and 2035 and also maximize its green energy potential in the following five-year period.
“The focus should shift to increasing the country exports of green hydrogen, particularly to Asia and Europe,” the academics said. “The government should establish partnerships with countries that are seeking to transition to renewable energy sources, particularly those with a high demand for hydrogen.”
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
The scientists concluded by saying that Saudi Arabia enjoys an enviable position for green hydrogen in the global energy landscape.
“It is clear that green hydrogen production is a trend that is here to stay, and as the world moves towards decarbonization, Saudi Arabia has an opportunity to become a leader in green hydrogen production and contribute to the global effort to mitigate climate change,” they said.
They presented the roadmap in “Energy futures and green hydrogen production: Is Saudi Arabia trend?“, which was recently published in Results in Engineering. The team included academics from the University of Diyala, Al-Farahidi University, and Al-Turath University College in Iraq, as well as the AGH University of Science and Technology in Poland and Qatar University and the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/18/the-wild-side-of-rooftop-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOILING,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 18, 2024",The wild side of rooftop solar,"In my experience, people who are interested in renewable energy also tend to enjoy nature. Many of us like birdwatching and spotting creatures in their natural habitat but there’s one place wildlife doesn’t belong: near our solar panels.
The biggest problem? Bird droppings.
Birds and other animals are attracted to solar arrays for a variety of reasons. Some like the shine or the shelter they provide, others enjoy the heat they radiate and many like all of those aspects.
As a result, solar panels can pull uninvited guests toward them like magnets. Not being tutored in proper manners, birds and other animals can defecate all over them. This waste is a big problem since it blocks the photovoltaic cells from accessing sunlight.
Indeed, of all the various kinds of dirt, dust, and debris that can fall on solar panels, one study concluded avian excrement has the most deleterious effect on performance. According to the paper, “Bird droppings accounted for about 46.42% to 89.18% of efficiency loss [in solar panels].”
This waste is also unpleasant to look at and if that’s not gross enough, when it is left to bake onto panels, it can cause permanent damage.
The natural movement of birds and animals can loosen panel wiring. When connections are compromised, it can have a negative effect on an entire system and efficiency can suffer. Squirrels also like to gnaw on the wires, for some reason known only to themselves.
Birds and other animals sometimes decide to build nests or burrows among solar panels. The new residents then constantly move around the system, increasing the risk of poor connections.
A build-up of nesting matter can also interfere with the panel ventilation. The empty space between a roof and the panels mounted on it, as well as between the panels, keeps systems cool. The accumulated material that comes with a bird or other animal infestation can lead a solar system to build up heat.
Electrical fires can result from damaged solar panels, and nests can serve as kindling for an even bigger blaze. With this in mind, bird nests and animal dens also constitute a fire hazard.
Moreover, just as high winds and storms can knock panels out of their brackets, so can the jostling of animals. As solar industry professionals know, the angle at which a panel is set is carefully chosen and depends on particular geographic locations, to maximize energy production. Installers measure this angle with pinpoint precision to ensure panel efficiency. Having a raccoon or other critter come along and push the panel out of position can undo much of that painstaking work.
There have even been cases of dangerous insects, such as hornets and wasps building hives in, under, and around solar panels, presenting an obvious risk to people and pets in the vicinity. Nobody wants to get stung and for those who are severely allergic to stings, just one could be potentially fatal.
The good news is that there are ways to dissuade birds and other animals from approaching your solar array. If they don’t dare go near it, they won’t choose to set up house there.
To frighten birds and other critters away from a solar system, the first thing any owner should do is keep their array immaculate. Regularly scheduled cleaning and maintenance, from professionals, is the best way to ensure this.
A predator decoy can also deter animals from moving in. While inert statues of owls and raptors can serve this purpose, in my experience many creatures will quickly detect they aren’t real and might even start using them as roosts themselves.
Technology that moves and appears lifelike is more effective. For instance, kites in the shape of a predator bird can be hoisted onto rods to fly in any breeze. Robotic birds that flap their wings and make other convincing movements are also available.
The more concerned you are with the presence of wildlife around your installation, the more you might want to consider adding audio components to your predator decoy. Soundtracks of attack cries scare animals away and can be pitched at a frequency that humans don’t hear.
In cases of infestation, more drastic measures may be necessary. For instance, after removing all traces of wildlife, system owners may want to put up netting to prevent critters from returning.
Since netting can be unsightly, and may interfere with panel performance, another solution would be to install an electric fence — the same kind of invisible barrier many dog owners use to ensure their pets don’t escape. If an animal crosses the barrier, they receive a minor electric shock that teaches them to stay away in future.
Spikes can also prevent birds from landing on a roof or near a solar array.
Permitting animals to roost in solar panels can cause a massive headache, which is why it’s best to address the issue before it occurs.
Keep wildlife where it belongs — in its natural habitat, rather than rooftop solar arrays.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/18/us-government-identifies-22-million-acres-for-solar-in-western-states/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 18, 2024",US government identifies 22 million acres for solar in western states,"The US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has released a draft analysis of the Utility-Scale Solar Energy Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS), also known as the Western Solar Plan. It is designed to guide responsible solar development on public lands.
First published in 2012, the plan originally identified areas in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah with high solar potential and low resource conflicts. The new document refines the analysis in the original six states and expands it to include Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming.
It identifies 22 million acres across the 11 states that are best suited for solar development.
The document calls for solar development to be focused on areas with fewer sensitive resources, less conflict with other uses of public lands, and close proximity to transmission lines, having identified 200,000 acres of land near existing transmission infrastructure.
Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said the BLM’s proposal is a “big step in the right direction and recognizes the key role solar plays in our energy economy.”
“Under the current policy, there are at least 80 million acres of federal lands open to oil and gas development, which is 100 times the amount of public land available for solar,” he added. “SEIA has been advocating for changes to the Solar PEIS for over 12 years and appreciates BLM’s extensive efforts to gather stakeholder feedback and make revisions that balance development and conservation. We will continue to urge the Administration to streamline permitting and harness the federal lands portfolio to supercharge job creation, promote energy security, and improve conservation outcomes.”
The BLM also announced the next steps on several renewable projects in Arizona, California and Nevada, representing more than 1,700 MW of potential solar generation.
The BLM has approved 47 clean energy projects, or enough to power more than 3.5 million homes, under the Biden administration.
In December, the SEIA predicted that the United States added 33 GW of solar capacity across the country in 2023.

Wannes Demarcke, a policy analyst for ODE Vlaanderen, told pv magazine that it seems “logical” that the final figure for the year, which is expected to come in February, will exceed 1 GW.
“This number always still increases the months after,” he said. “Many installations installed in December 2023 are not added yet in the data.”
In 2023, the Flemish authorities allocated €3 million ($3.3 million) toward its solar rebate scheme. But last year also saw the end of subsidies for solar in Flanders. Demarcke said he expects this will lead to fewer new residential orders in the early months of 2024.
“Even though it is not needed anymore for profitability, it has a mental aspect and a big rush often leads to a reduction in Q1,” he explained.
However, Demarcke predicted that the business-to-business market, which is also subsidy-free, will show “significant growth, because there is an obligation to place solar panels with businesses and public organizations that have a high electricity consumption.”
Looking ahead, all remaining prosumers in Flanders will lose net metering over the next two years, following the installation of digital meters.
“This opens the door for an extension by using the full rooftop potential,” said Demarcke.
Flanders has the largest regional share of installed solar capacity in Belgium.
The country currently has around 8.3 GW of installed solar capacity, according to an interactive grid map published by Belgian network operator Elia in December.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/18/neoen-shut-down-australian-solar-plus-storage-plant-after-7-years/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 18, 2024",Neoen shut down Australian solar-plus-storage plant after 7 years,"From pv magazine Australia
French renewable energy giant Neoen has confirmed the DeGrussa solar and battery hub in the heart of Western Australia’s goldfields region will be dismantled after seven years of operations.
The DeGrussa facility, comprising 10.6 MW of PV and a 6 MW lithium-ion battery energy storage system teamed with a diesel-fired generator, was commissioned at West Australian mining company Sandfire Resources’ Degussa copper mine site, 900 kilometers northeast of Perth, in June 2016.
The solar hybrid power system has since supplied nearly 20% of the mining operation’s annual power requirements and cut its emissions by about 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.
Sandfire purchased the power under an initial 5.5-year agreement but that was extended as the mining operation pushed beyond its original 2021 closure date. The mine has however now ceased operations, signalling the end of life for the DeGrussa solar and battery hub.
In a statement shared with pv magazine, Neoen said it plans to remove the solar panels, as well as the rest of its facility and to rehabilitate the site.
Climate Energy Finance Director Tim Buckley said the dismantling came as no surprise with the end of mine life “absolutely well known” when they solar hybrid power system was commissioned.
“There is no surprise there,” he said, adding that in spite of its short lifespan, the DeGrussa power project has been a “brilliant success.”
Buckley said the project, which attracted AUD 20.9 million ($13.7 million) in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and AUD 15 million in debt finance from Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC), was part of the “step change that took solar from being a potential technology to being now integral to the transformation and decarbonization of the Australian electricity system.”
“Given Australia has gone on to become a world leader in both the solar and battery energy storage systems means this was a brilliant success, over-delivering in terms of the financials and project’s planned life and the learning by doing of this pilot-scale, world-leading deployment,” he said. “The capacity, the scale, the technology improvements, the software integration, all the learnings that have gone on, Degrussa was a core part of the early learning by doing.”
Buckley said the project had provided key learnings in how off-grid energy needs are going to be met with Australia now is embracing the energy transition.
“Our biggest companies are BHP and Rio, huge balance sheets, huge potential and huge energy needs and they are starting to embrace the learning by doing that ARENA has been championing for the past decade and Degrussa was a classic example,” he said.
Even as it is being dismantled, the DeGrussa project could provide lessons with Neoen exploring opportunities to repurpose the 34,080 solar panels and other infrastructure that is installed across the 20-hectare site.
“Our preference is for the solar panels to be re-used as they remain in good condition,” the company said, adding that it “is currently investigating opportunities to find a second life for the solar panels and for the other main components such as the inverters, transformers and the battery pack.”
The DeGrussa milestone comes as Western Australian government-owned utility Synergy announced that it has commenced the decommissioning of the Ten Mile Lagoon and Nine Mile Beach wind farms near Esperance in the state’s southwest.
Nine Mile and Ten Mile wind farms were installed more than 20 years ago and have reached their end of life.
During decommissioning, two of the wind turbines are being donated to North Metropolitan TAFE for renewable energy training purposes and six wind turbines will be repurposed at new wind farm sites in the Perth region.
The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2024.

They have run a series of simulations on a 175 m2 system in the Turkish capital, Ankara.
“The analyzed values can be used in the central Mediterranean region of similar latitude and climatic conditions (Csb) and different regions of the world,” they explained. “The main ones are Portland in the USA, Braga in Portugal, Valladolid in Spain, Terni in Italy, and Žabljak in Montenegro.”
The academic group explained that optimal tilt can help both energy production and crop yield, as the PV panels partially shade the crops, protecting them from excessive heat. Some crops, such as tomato, potato, and garlic, are known to have better yield with shading, while others, such as rice, peanut, and okra, need more sunlight.
“The study's originality lies in the design of an APV system as an alternative solution to the rising energy-related food costs. The aim is to reduce the impact of operational costs on agricultural activities and promote sustainability, particularly in rural areas,” they said.
To conduct their simulation, the scientists first calculated the optimal tilt angle for Ankara in terms of power production. They found the annual average to be between 31 degrees and 33 degrees. The seasonal optimum slope angle for the winter was 55 degrees, for spring was 20 degrees, for summer was 7 degrees, and for autumn was 45 degrees.
Taking these values into account, they then created eight scenarios with different tilt angles and calculated their effect on crop yield and energy production. The scenarios are based on the following parameters: yearly average (M1); latitude 39.57° (M2); horizontal installation (M3); vertical installation (M4); winter optimum tilt angle (M5), spring optimum tilt angle (M6); summer optimum tilt angle (M7); and autumn optimum tilt angle (M8).
“In the design of the APV system, a 12.0 kW h DC power capacity was installed with 40 units with 300 Watt PV panels,” they added. “A 3 m gap is left between each PV array, and shading is considered ineffective. The height of the panels from the ground is assumed to be 3.6 m, and an APV design was made in accordance with international standards, with a width of 10.5 m and a length of 16.5 m, totaling 175 m2.”
The simulation was conducted assuming the utilization of standard crystalline silicon with an efficiency of 19%, premium crystalline silicon with an anti-reflecting cover of 21% efficiency, and cheaper thin-film PV modules with an efficiency of 18%. The crops under them were simulated as turmeric, olive,  winter cabbage, kiwifruit, corn, lettuce, and bok choy.
The academics ascertained that the M1 scenario with thin-film panels offers the highest performance with an annual financial gain of $1,286 and AC electricity generated of 15,674 kWh. The lowest performance, by contrast, was achieved in the M4 scenario with thin film panels, with the financial gain being estimated at $775 and AC electricity at 9,438 kWh.
The researchers also detailed the land equivalent ratio (LER). LER is a method used to measure land use efficiency for the simultaneous production of crops and electricity. They found the highest capacity factor to be for growing kiwi under the M1 scenario and the lowest for growing bok choy in M4 conditions.
“As of 2023, the discounted payback period (DPBP) value for the M1 model is 15.8 years, while the M4 model fails to meet the investment cost. By 2035, the DPBP value for the M1 model decreases to 7.8 years, while for the M4 model, it becomes 13.6 years. In 2050, the DPBP values are 5.4 years for the M1 model and 10.1 years for the M4 model,” they found.
Their results were presented in “Solar collector tilt angle optimization for agrivoltaic systems” and published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. The scientists behind the research are from Turkey's Batman University, Australia's James Cook University, Hungary's University of Pannonia, and ELTE Eötvös Loránd University.

The EIA has released projections for solar and wind energy growth in its recent “Short Term Energy Outlook” report, showing strong growth in solar and moderate growth for wind.
The EIA said it expects solar generation to grow by 75% from 2023 to 2025. In 2023, the United States generated about 163 billion kWh, and the EIA expects this to reach 286 billion kWh in 2025.
PV Intel statistics show that from January to October 2023, solar power accounted for 5.78% of US electricity. This marks a 16% increase in solar power generation over the preceding year.
Wind power generation is expected to grow 11%, increasing from 430 billion kWh in 2023 to 476 billion kWh in 2025, said the EIA. It added that it expects coal generation to decline from 665 billion kWh in 2023 to 548 billion kWh in 2025. Natural gas is expected to remain the largest source of US electricity generation, with 1,700 billion kWh generated in 2024 and 2025. Both natural gas and nuclear power are expected to remain relatively flat in generation contribution over the next two years.
In total, the US electric power sector produced 4,017 billion kWh. Renewable sources including solar, wind, hydroelectric power, biomass, and geothermal, accounted for 22% of the total. Renewable generation as a group passed total nuclear generation in 2021 and surpassed coal in 2022.
Large additions of new renewable energy capacity are driving this shift in generation mix. Solar developers are expected to increase the nation’s total operational capacity by 38%. Total solar capacity is expected to grow from 95 GW at the end of 2023 to 131 GW at the end of 2024.
The EIA forecasts the deployment of 45 GW (DC) of utility-scale solar projects larger than 1 MW in 2024. This is projected increase to about 53 GW in 2025. Adding Wood Mackenzie Power and Renewables conservative projections of 6 GW in residential solar and 2 GW in commercial projects, the total solar capacity expected for 2024 is 53.5 GW. Projected figures for 2025 suggest a potential total deployment of 65 GW of solar power.

They explained that TeHPs can be powered by PV panels directly, while offering silent operation and high reliability, due to the absence of moving parts. They also acknowledged, however, that their coefficient of performance is currently lower than that of conventional vapor compression heat pumps.
The novelty of the proposed approach consists of integrating the TeHP with seasonal solar energy storage (SSES), which the scientists said compensates for the seasonal mismatch related to the thermal power eventually produced by both photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) and solar thermal systems.
“To the best of our knowledge, few studies have considered such a solution,” they explained. “Our group aims to fill this gap, and to do so, two important issues must be solved,” they said referring to the technical-economic feasibility of the system and the quantification of the benefits it can provide.
In the paper “Modeling and Experimental Characterisation of a Water-to-Air Thermoelectric Heat Pump with Thermal Energy Storage,” published in energies, the research group said the DC-powered experimental system integrates a TeHP unit, a heat storage tank, a testing box, and a data logger system. The TeHP unit is based on a thermoelectric module (TeM), an aluminium-finned heat sink at the hot side of the TeM, and a water-cooled plate at the cold side of the TeM.

“The total heating capacity of the TeHP unit can be augmented by simply increasing the total number of the TeMs,” the academics explained. “To enhance the heat transfer between the TeM and the heat sink as well as the heat transfer between the TeM and the water-cooled plate, a high thermal conductance paste was placed at the two sides of the TeM to reduce the contact thermal resistances.”
They also placed a cross-flow fan on the heat sink side to enhance the heat exchange between the airflow and the heat sink. “The heat storage tank, made of stainless steel, features an inner diameter of 25 0mm, a height of 250 mm, and a thickness of 2 mm,” they added, noting that water is used as heat transfer fluid and heat storage medium. Furthermore, a pumped water circulation loop connects the heat storage tank with the water-cooled plate.
In a series of simulations implemented via the TRNSYS simulation tool, the research team calculated the potential heat generated from PVT systems or solar thermal collectors and the output performance of the TeHP unit compared to a reference system without heat storage. It found that the integration of TeHPs with heat storage tanks offers three main advantages.
First, the academics ascertained that the storage tank increases the TeHP heat output by 3 C compared to the TeHP without a tank. Then, they found that the COP of the TeHP with heat storage was 1.97 and that of the TeHP without a tank was 1.5. Furthermore, the simulation showed that the time required to heat the testing box was reduced by 18 m, which reportedly ensures a rapid achievement of the desired temperature.
The scientists said that, although these results are promising, the technical-economic feasibility of the system is still uncertain. “This is because, though the use of heat storage will enhance the output performance of the TeHP, it will also introduce additional costs for the heat storage facilities compared with a standalone TeHP,” they emphasized, noting that the current payback period of the system is estimated at 8.5 years.
Looking forward, the research group intends to test the system configuration on a real building in the United Kingdom.
