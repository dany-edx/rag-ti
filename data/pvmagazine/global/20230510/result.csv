Hydrogen Headstart will provide a credit per kilogram on the production price, mostly for large-scale projects. The executive body is also providing AUD 38.2 million to establish a Guarantee of Origin scheme to underpin markets for green energy, including hydrogen. “This is a substantial downpayment on Australia's response to the US Inflation Reduction Act, ensuring Australia remains in the race to become a global clean energy superpower,” said Australia's Clean Energy Council. The country also wants to expand onshore and offshore wind and solar production.
Iveco Group and Nikola Corp. have agreed to split their operations in Europe and North America, respectively. Italy-based Iveco Group will assume full ownership of the joint venture in Ulm, Germany. The transport vehicle manufacturer said the venture will be licensed to freely access and develop vehicle control software for jointly developed battery electric vehicles (BEV) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV). Nikola will secure the IVECO S-Way technology license for North America and related components supplies from Iveco Group, and will take ownership of the intellectual property for Generation 1 eAxles. Iveco Group will acquire the items partly in cash and partly in 20 million of Nikola shares.
HRS and Gaia Future Energy have signed a memorandum of understanding to provide global green hydrogen distribution solutions for mobility, combining the green hydrogen produced by Gaia Future Energy in Morocco and the hydrogen refueling station manufactured by HRS. The two companies will also collaborate to accelerate the development of green hydrogen infrastructure, particularly in European markets.
Austria, Germany, and Italy have signed a joint letter of political support to develop a “southern hydrogen corridor” in the European Union, with the respective infrastructure projects to obtain Project of Common Interest (PCI) status. “Snam Italy's gas infrastructure operator, Trans Austria Gasleitung (TAG) and Gas Connect Austria (GCA) in Austria and Bayernets in Germany welcome this political support,” said Snam. The SoutH2 southern hydrogen corridor would be a 3 300-km dedicated hydrogen-ready pipeline corridor connecting North Africa, Italy, Austria, and Germany. It could purportedly deliver 40% of the REPowerEU import target. According to the German government, it will have to import 70% of its own green hydrogen needs.
ABB, Lhyfe, and Skyborn have also agreed to collaborate on SoutH2Port. The hydrogen project will be located near Skyborns' 1 GW Storgrundet offshore wind farm in Söderhamn, Sweden. “Fully operational, SoutH2port is expected to produce about 240 tons of hydrogen per day, with an installed capacity of 600 MW, making it one of the largest suppliers of renewable hydrogen in Europe,” said Lhyfe. ABB will optimize hydrogen and electricity production integration across the entire ecosystem. The new plant will support the decarbonization of the Swedish energy system, either directly with hydrogen supplies or through further downstream production of refined fuels such as methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, or ammonia.

The strategic partner will be expected to develop 1 GW/1.2 GWh of solar and at least 200 MW/400 MWh of co-located battery energy storage systems. According to a government decision, state-owned utility EPS will act as the owner and investor in the project.
The partner will be required to select locations for the construction of the facilities, in addition to preparing all necessary documentation and procuring equipment. It is specified that single-axis trackers should be used.
The partner will operate the solar plants and batteries over a period of two years and during that time, it will be expected to provide O&M training to the EPS team. After the two-year period, the facilities will be solely owned and operated by EPS, which has previously laid out plans to decommission around 1 GW of thermal power plants in the 2025-35 period.
The solar and battery facilities are to be delivered within four to five years, while the contract with the strategic partner will cover a period of six to seven years. The government has formed a working group to organize the tender, select successful bids, and negotiate with the chosen strategic partner.
According to the Association of Renewable Energy Sources of Serbia, the country has installed around 50 MW of solar. However, that figure is not exact, as there is no official registry at this stage. In April, Serbia switched on its largest solar plant, the 9.9 MW DeLasol PV project in the Lapovo, central Serbia.
Serbia currently aims to deploy 8.3 GW of PV by 2024, according to a draft plan released by the government last year.  According to the draft, utility-scale PV projects could be built on 200,000 hectares of neglected, low-value agricultural land that could host 2 GW of solar.
The document also outlines the construction of around 300 MW of PV plants, valued at €200 million ($219.6 million) on land owned by EPS – primarily on its coal ash dumps. Most of the solar capacity envisaged under the 2022-24 draft is supposed to come from rooftop PV.

The Riverina and Darlington Point batteries – currently the biggest such system in New South Wales – have now been completed. Using Tesla’s Megapack technology and grid forming advanced inverters, the total capacity of the project is 150 MW/300 MWh.
Built in the state’s Riverina region, in the southwest, the project is made up of three separate battery facilities:
As outlined, 100% of the project’s output has been contracted to Shell Energy and EnergyAustralia for the next 10 years. The project has received funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and New South Wales government, which jointly provided AUD 13.1 million ($8.8 million) to support the project’s use of advanced inverters which can increase hosting capacity in the region.
Exactly which inverter brand the project uses is not mentioned, but Edify Energy’s Chief Executive, John Cole, said the inverters operate in virtual synchronous generator mode, meaning they provide vital system strength services previously only afforded by fossil generators.
The project is 90% owned by Federation Asset Management, a fund manager specializing in private equity assets in the energy transition. The remaining 10% is owned by Edify Energy, which has developed and will operate the project.
Federation Asset Management said the Riverina and Darlington Point energy storage systems will be a seed asset for its  Sustainable Australian Real Asset fund (SARA), a pure-play Australian energy transition fund currently open to institutional investors.

Borosil Renewables said this week that the solar glass production capacity of its German unit, GMB Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg GmbH, has increased to 350 tpd from 300 tpd, following the modification and cold repair of its solar glass furnace.
The company said the life expectancy of the furnace has increased due to the modification. Due to the implementation of certain advanced processes and technologies during the cold repair, GMB’s production capacity has also increased from 300 tpd to 350 tpd. The manufacturer said it expects the modification to result in substantial savings in energy consumption.
In January, Borosil Renewables began expanding its solar panel glass manufacturing capacity in India to 1,000 tons per day by starting trial production at its third solar glass furnace, which has a capacity of 550 tons per day. With 1,000 tons per day of capacity, it can supply solar glass for 6 GW of solar module production per year.
The company’s other two furnaces in India have production capacities of 240 tons per day and 210 tons per day.

France‘s Ministry of the Ecological Transition has reported results from the sixth round of the 282 MW solar tender for non-interconnected zones (ZNI). Launched in 2019, it is open to PV projects, including those with storage, ranging in size from 100 kW to 5 MW.
The selection process resulted in the allocation of 89 projects totaling 49.8 MW in Corsica and France's overseas territories. About 20.4 MW were designated for installations ranging from 100 kW to 500 kW on buildings or car park shades, while an additional 12.0 MW were awarded to projects of similar nature with capacities between 500 kW and 1.5 MW.
French developer Albioma secured the largest share of assigned capacity with 8.2 MW. Following closely were GreenYellow with 4.2 MW, Corsica Energia with 4.0 MW, and Corsica Sole with 3.1 MW, ranking second, third, and fourth, respectively.
The CRE originally planned to allocate 83 MW in the procurement exercise.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/10/storing-renewables-with-molten-hydroxide-salts/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,DENMARK",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 10, 2023",Storing renewables with molten hydroxide salts,"Hyme Energy, a spinoff of Denmark's Seaborg Technologies, is partnering with Semco Maritime to build a molten salt thermal energy storage demonstrator at the Gjesing Varmeværk heating plant, which is owned by regional utility Din Forsyning, in the Danish port of Esbjerg.
“The MOSS demonstration plant is the first energy storage plant ever built with molten hydroxide salts. It will consist in a 1.6 MWh storage unit, which will lay the groundwork for future facilities in the GWh range,” Ask Emil Løvschall-Jensen, CEO of Hyme Energy, told pv magazine.
He said the purpose of the plant is to display and test the company's molten hydroxide storage technology in a practical setting.
“The plant will be tested to prove our component integration, validate our system design, gain insights into the most optimal materials and components, and demonstrate operation and system control,” he said.
Therefore, the demonstration plant will only be used to produce heat. However, it is not part of the project's scope to provide heat to the district heating system in Esbjerg, the company explained.
Hyme’s energy storage technology stores electricity from renewable sources in 700 C molten hydroxide salt for up to two weeks. It is based on a two-tank storage design developed for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants and Hyme’s proprietary hydroxide salt corrosion control technology.
When charging electricity from renewables is converted into heat through electrical heaters. Salt from the cold tank is circulated through the heaters and heated up from 350 C to 700 C, then stored in the hot tank.
At the time of discharge, salt from the hot tank circulates to the steam generator, where the energy is transferred to water, generating high-temperature steam. Steam can be used directly in an industrial process or used to power a turbine and produce electricity and district heating. After that, the cooled salt is pumped back into the cold tank until the next charging cycle.
The efficiency of the storage system varies according to its use. For industrial heat, Hyme envisages efficiencies of around 90%, while for co-generation, the figure is somewhere between 80% and 90 %. For power generation alone, the company expects an efficiency of around 40%.
Hyme’s storage technology is scalable and a 1 GWh facility with sodium hydroxides should be able to produce power and heat for around 100,000 households for 10 hours of discharge, said the company.
Since sodium hydroxide can be produced at low cost from seawater as a byproduct of chlorine production, the company calculates that this is six times cheaper than standard salts used for storage.
Hyme, established in 2021, is working on another demonstrator on the Danish island of Bornholm. The company's 10-15 MWh molten salt storage facility will be part of a scalable hybrid storage system which will also feature a flywheel storage system provided by QuinteQ Energy and recycled lithium-ion batteries supplied by PLS Energy Systems.
The Bornholm project dubbed 2LiPP aims to provide insights on possible repurposing pathways for combined heat and power (CHP) plants. It will provide heat, power, and ancillary services to the local network.
In November 2022, the Danish company signed a cooperation agreement with Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 2 (PECC2) to develop and build at least 2 GWh by 2030 and at least 6 GWh by 2035 of thermal energy storage projects in Vietnam.
For the MOSS Project, the engineering is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023, with the subsequent installation phase ending in the fourth quarter. Hyme has received backing from the Danish Energy Agency to build the pilot plant.
“The storage system at Esbjerg will be connected to the regular grid, and not directly connected to renewable sources. When charging excess electricity (when the price is low) to the storage system, the electricity will mostly come from renewable sources,” said Løvschall-Jense.
This is possible given that the Esbjerg area is well-known as a favorable geographical site for wind power, with large offshore projects already in operation.
“We have matured the MOSS project in the past year and are soon ready to kick off the construction phase with Semco Maritime,” concluded the CEO.
In addition to the MOSS Project contract, the partners have agreed to explore opportunities to collaborate on Hyme’s future larger projects, where its long-duration thermal energy storage solution will enable utilities and industries to decarbonize heat and power generation.

The country added 70.1 MW of new PV installations in the first four months of 2023. By comparison, it installed 152.7 MW last year and 42.7 in 2021.
The largest share of the cumulative capacity is represented by residential PV systems below 20 kW in size, followed by installations ranging in capacity from 20 kW to 100 kW, solar arrays with capacities of 100 kW to 500 kW, and solar systems with capacities ranging from 5oo kW to 1 MW.
The growth of the past two years is mainly attributable to rising electricity prices Ali Arfa, data manager at EUPD Research, told pv magazine in November. Between 2023 and 2026, Norway could add 285 MW of residential capacity, 360 MW of commercial arrays, and 640 MW of large-scale projects, according to EUPD Research. The research firm said the country could potentially reach 1.6 GW of cumulative PV capacity by the end of 2026 and add 500 MW of capacity every year thereafter until 2030, to hit 3.6 GW by the end of the decade.

“The aim of our current EU-funded project Stable Inorganic TAndem (SITA) solar cells, is to make a wide-gap chalcopyrite top cell for tandem PV devices with silicon bottom cell,” researcher Jan Keller told pv magazine. “So, in the next step we need to transfer the process to transparent back contacts. We have shown the potential to make wide-gap chalcopyrite solar cells with slightly lower band gaps of about 1.45 eV on highly transparent back contacts in our earlier work.”
The use of silver alloying improves grain growth and crystal quality, while reducing detrimental defects and partly compensating for the low bandgap energy of the CuGaSe2 absorber. CuGaSe2 has band-gap energy of 1.7 eV and has thus far been used in solar cells with limited fill factor and open-circuit voltage.
“In addition to losses directly related to the CuGaSe2 layer itself, front interface recombination is supposed to be pronounced when a standard cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer is used,” the scientists said, noting that they tested devices with CdS buffer layers and layers made of zinc tin oxide (ZTO) grown via atomic layer deposition (ALD).
The research team used a three-stage co-evaporation process to deposit the absorber alloyed with silver (ACGS) for several samples of solar cells.
“The carrier collection improves with Ag addition, higher deposition temperature, and toward stoichiometric absorber composition,” they said. “Light soaking increases the fill factor for most of the samples, potentially by mitigating internal transport barriers.”
The champion cell the scientists fabricated was based on a ZTO buffer layer, with the device achieving a power conversion efficiency of 11.2%.
“This is the highest efficiency ever measured on an ACGS solar cell without an anti-reflecting coating,” they said. “Possible explanations for the beneficial effect of the light soaking may be the photodoping of the ZTO layer that would reduce the effective barrier height for electrons, or a redistribution of sodium at the heterojunction.”
The scientists said that they plan to use a transparent back contact (TBC) instead of one made of molybdenum (Mo) in the cell, due to its expected use in tandem devices.
They described the solar cell technology in “Silver Alloying in Highly Efficient CuGaSe2 Solar Cells with Different Buffer Layers,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.

Meyer Burger and German PV product distributor Magog have announced a distribution agreement for Meyer Burger Slate, a new version of the Meyer Burger Tiles that the Switzerland-based heterojunction solar module manufacturer unveiled last year.
Starting in August, the companies will offer slate-gray photovoltaic roof coverings in Europe. They feature housing made of powder-coated aluminum, special glass, and Meyer Burger's heterojunction solar cells with its SmartWire technology. The final assembly is done by a European partner. This product variant allows for the integration of PV systems into sloping slate roofs.
“The new ‘Meyer Burger Slate – Magog Schiefer Edition' is characterized by a high energy yield and is easy to deploy and maintain for installers,” said Georg Guntermann, managing partner for Magog. “The new Meyer Burger product in slate gray harmonizes with the slate roof and can be unobtrusively integrated into the building by using glare-free, structured solar glass.”
Magog and Meyer Burger are currently using the product in pilot projects.
“In the spirit of a comprehensive energy transition, this small-format and aesthetic solar roof tile with a uniform gray look fits harmoniously into slate roofs and thus also makes the energy transition possible for listed buildings,” said Frank Hötzsch, a division manager at Meyer Burger.

Now in its 14th edition, the report takes an in-depth at technology trends across the supply chain for silicon PV products. VDMA calculates PV module shipments in 2022 at 295 GW, with 258 GW installed and the remainder still in transit or warehoused.
The ITRPV finds that, at the end of 2022, the weighted average spot price for silicon PV modules fell by 7% compared to the previous year, reaching $0.228/W. The report also notes a growing market share for n-type technologies, and that the price premium for these is now marginal – just two tenths of a cent above the average at $0.230/W.
In terms of manufacturing capacity, VDMA finds that around 600 GW was online at the end of last year, with crystalline silicon technologies representing 95% of the market. New factories coming online today usually have at least 2 GW of capacity, and this is expected to increase to 5 GW in the longer term.
Large wafer formats (182mm and 210mm) now represent more than 60% of the market, with formats 166mm and smaller expected to disappear from the market entirely by 2027. VDMA also expects formats larger than 210mm to appear after 2025, representing only a small market share over the next decade. The split between these two large formats is still not clear, but all new production lines will be able to process both.
Monocrystalline silicon now accounts for 97% of production, and the report expects older multicrystalline technologies to disappear entirely in the near future. Gallium doping has also now become mainstream, with the boron doping it replaces also expected to disappear by the end of this year.
PERC (passivated emitter rear contact) remains the leading cell technology for now, amounting to around 70% of the market, but VDMA notes that its replacement with TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contact) is now well underway. TOPCon is expected to reach a market share of 60%, heterojunction of 19% and back contact technologies of 5% in 2033, according to the report.
VDMA’s research found that efforts to reduce silver consumption have proceeded faster than predicted in the 2022 ITRPV, and have now reached an average of 10mg/W. This should fall to 6.5mg over the next decade, despite the growth of n-type technologies that require more silver than PERC. “TOPCon in mass production by Tier 1 manufacturers in China is reported to be, end of 2022, on lower consumption levels 2 to 5 years ahead of our prediction,” states VDMA.
The ITRPV remains conservative about replacing silver entirely, however. It expects copper plating to be introduced in mass production during the next decade, but says this will represent only 7.5% of the market in 2033. “Technical issues related to reliability and adhesion must be resolved before alternative metallization techniques can be introduced,” VDMA states. “Appropriate equipment and processes also need to be made ready for mass production. Silver is expected to remain the most widely used front metallization material for crystalline silicon cells in the years to come.”

A Georgia jury has awarded Shaun and Amie Harris $135.5 million in damages to their property in Stewart County, Georgia, reportedly created from silt and sediment erosion from a 100 MW utility-scale solar project constructed by developer Silicon Ranch, engineering contractor Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives (IEA) and an IEA affiliate.
U.S. District Court Judge Clay D. Land issued a May 5 order ruling that Nashville-based Silicon Ranch and IEA are liable for damages.
According to the lawsuit, Silicon Ranch has developed more than 160 solar facilities across the country, many of which were built by IEA. At Lumpkin Solar, IEA cleared and mass-graded about 1,000 acres of timberland, farmland and land near the Harris property, which had previously been used for recreational hunting and fishing. The solar developers had not taken adequate measures for erosion and sediment control, according to press release from the plaintiffs’ counsel James E. Butler, Jr., of Butler Prather LLP.
The companies “created, operated and maintained a nuisance … that caused sedimentation to pollute plaintiffs’ wetlands, streams and lake. The court further finds that this nuisance has continued for approximately two years unabated,” Judge Land said in the court order.
In a statement to pv magazine USA, a Silicon Ranch spokeswoman said, “as the long-term owner of this facility, Silicon Ranch remains committed to the continued success of Stewart County and the surrounding region. While we sincerely regret the unintentional damage to our neighbor’s property, Silicon Ranch does not believe the verdict in this trial is supported by the facts in this case.We plan to appeal.”
Silicon Ranch hired IEA to design and construct the Lumpkin solar facility through its subsidiary, IEA Constructors. IEA’s scope of work included the installation of solar modules and the full balance of system EPC construction, including all civil, mechanical and electrical work.
“We relied on our contractor to carry out this scope of work in compliance with applicable law and in keeping with industry best management practices, as specified by the appropriate regulatory bodies in the state of Georgia,” Silicon Ranch said.
Lumpkin Solar is a 100 MW utility solar project located on 850 acres in Stewart County, Georgia. The facility entered commercial operation in December 2021 in partnership with electric cooperative Walton Electric Membership Corporation and IEA. Meta was the offtake counterparty for the solar project.
H&L Farms LLC, on behalf of Shaun and Amie Harris, filed a lawsuit against Silicon Ranch and IEA on August 6, 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.
The jury panel returned a verdict of $10.5 million in damages. It found that Silicon Ranch, IEA and an IEA subsidiary, IEA Constructors, LLC, acted with specific intent to harm. The jury administered $25 million in punitive damages to Silicon Ranch, and $50 million in punitive damages to IEA and its affiliated company, respectively.
According to court filings, H&L Farms purchased a 1,630 acre property from Kawikee Refuge, LLC on March 16, 2021. The Harris’ home is adjacent to the 100 MW solar site.
Cozen O’Connor represented Silicon Ranch in the lawsuit, while Drew Eckl & Farnham represented IEA.
