It pitched a total capacity of 1.4 GW and achieved 1.2 GW of awarded 17-year capacity payments, the company said on Tuesday, adding the BESS projects would be “reserve capacity” for the Polish electricity grid if minimum system capacity was not guaranteed. Greenvolt Power will be remunerated PLN 244.90/kW ($6.18/kW) per year as part of the arrangement.
Poland’s Energy Regulatory Office announced in December it awarded 494 MW of solar in the auction round, with 123 MW for installations smaller than 1 MW and 471 MW for projects larger than 1 MW. More than 274 TWh of electricity worth almost PLN 67 billion between 2016 to 2023 has been tendered in Poland, the Energy Regulatory Office said.
Poland recorded 12.4 GW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to data from the Polish research institute Instytut Energetyki Odnawialnej (IEO). The institute estimates the country's installed solar capacity could more than double to 26 GW by the end of 2025, with 5 GW of solar projects added to the grid last year.
SolarPower Europe said there were 4.9 GW of new solar additions in 2022, making Poland the third-best solar market in the European Union.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/11/acculon-launches-production-of-sodium-ion-battery-modules-packs/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 11, 2024","Acculon launches production of sodium-ion battery modules, packs","As the sodium-ion battery technology continues to mature, new product and manufacturing announcements are coming thick and fast from newcomers and established players alike.
With mainly pilot plants or small manufacturing lines up and running today, US-based battery system developer and manufacturer Acculon Energy has started the series production of its sodium-ion battery modules and packs and unveiled plans to scale its production to 2 GWh by mid-2024.
Acculon's first two sodium-ion products support a range of applications and are available in small and large modules, capable of building into varying capacities and voltage levels. The product are meeting the safety requirements of UL standards like 2271, 2580, 1973, and 9540, and comply with stringent UN regulations.
The company has been conducting research and development with the technology since its inception in 2009, “culminating in the commercialization of sodium-ion products poised to meet the ever-growing power demands of its OEM customers.”
“We've seen the technology readiness level and availability of sodium cells improve impressively over the past two years,” said Acculon President Andrew Thomas. “Along the way, we've invested heavily to validate cells in our renowned test lab and conduct pre-certification destructive testing. Our customers demand durable performance and a compelling value proposition–our sodium-ion batteries will achieve both.”
Previously, Acculon Energy revealed some results of its own research into sodium-ion cells, which it described as “promising.”
“On one of the high-energy sodium-ion cell types, we are now about the 300th cycle of 0.5 C rate cycling at room temperature with full depth of discharge and getting 96.3% of maximum capacity,” the company said in a press release in October. “Based on the linear degradation trend, the 80% capacity limit is projected to be reached after about 1650 cycles. This impressive level of durability, if achieved, could open a door to numerous diverse applications.”
There are also other aspects that make sodium-ion batteries a viable alternative to lithium-ion technology, such as superior environmental credentials, enhanced safety, and better raw material costs.
According to UK-based market research company IDTechEx, a sodium ion battery with a layered metal oxide cathode and hard carbon anode will have approximately 25% to 30% lower material costs than an lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. However, significant savings are unlikely initially as the technology will take time to scale.
Taking different chemistries into account, IDTechEx calculates that the average cell cost for sodium-ion batteries is $87/kWh. By the end of the decade, the production cost of sodium-ion battery cells using primarily iron and manganese will probably bottom out at around $40/kWh, which would be around $50/kWh at the pack level, the research company says. By comparison, BNEF's analysis found LFP average cell prices fell below $100/kWh in 2023.
In its latest report on sodium-ion technology, IDTechEx calculates that the capacities that have been publicly announced by various raw material and battery manufacturers alone add up to well over 100 GWh by 2030. “By 2025, significantly more capacity can be built up than that has been financed so far if investors are found for it in the course of 2024,” the research firm said.

The company, which is one of the largest dairy producers in the world, says the heat pump converts excess heat from chillers and compressors into a heat source.
“We’re really excited about this unique combination of a commercial heat pump and solar thermal plant helping us reduce our gas consumption and emissions output,” said Graham Thomson, site manager for Fonterra Palmerston North.
The new project is expected to reduce the natural gas required by the site and remove 495 tons of CO2e per year, equivalent to taking 140 cars off the road. It is Fonterra’s fourth site to upgrade its energy infrastructure within the last year, as the company works toward its Scope 1 and Scope 2 target of 50% emissions reduction by 2030.
The heat pump and solar thermal plant has secured co-funding from the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry fund, delivered by New Zealand’s Energy Efficiency Conservation Authority.
In March 2023, Germany-based manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions said it was building an industrial-scale heat pump that generates steam without using gas for use at one of Fonterra’s farms.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/11/more-than-2-gw-of-pv-installed-in-austria-in-2023-predicts-analyst/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRIA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"JANUARY 11, 2024","More than 2 GW of PV installed in Austria in 2023, predicts analyst","More than 2 GW of solar was installed in Austria in 2023, according to Austrian PV analyst Hubert Fechner. The vice chair of  the Austrian PV Technology Platform, a PV manufacturing and research association, told pv magazine he does not have official data confirming the exact figure, but feedback from grid operators suggests the threshold has been exceeded.
“If we will end up at 2.2 [GW] or 2.5 [GW] nobody knows for that moment,” he said.
“But we have surpassed the threshold of 2 GW.”
Austria installed 1 GW of solar in 2022, according to PV Austria. This brought the country’s total PV capacity to 3.78 GW – accounting for 6.6% of total electricity demand. Austria installed 740 MW of new PV systems in 2021, 341 MW in 2020, and 247 MW in 2019. Hubert said if the landlocked central European country maintained this installation pace, “We might reach about 20 GW by 2030 and 40 GW by 2040 as it is indicated in our national plans.”
The 2021 Renewable Energy Extension Act (EAG) stipulates that 11 TWh of solar energy will need to account for 27 TWh of increased renewable electricity generation by the end of the decade. The Austrian Government said solar will “rely” on one million rooftop installations to reach the target.
Fechner’s comments come as the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its national survey on Austrian PV applications in 2022. The report, authored by Fechner, states the local market is still dominated by rooftop installations – comprising 83% of all of PV projects. But for the first time, a “significant number of larger ground-mounted PV systems were reported” with 157 MW of utility-scale PV installed in 2022, according to the document.
Fechner said rooftop solar installations were popular due to policies incentivizing PV deployment on existing infrastructure, such as buildings and car parks. The general public's anxiety over disappearing space, also known as land being “sealed,” also played into rooftop solar's popularity, he said.
Research shows a “ substantial” amount of Austrian permanently habitable land is continuously covered in asphalt, concrete, or other materials for residential, commercial, and infrastructural uses. “The country size is limited,” Fechner said.
“PV does not seal anything, but land use is a big topic in Austria and that's why we want to have a big preference in using PV on existing buildings in a double functionality way.”
He attributes the uptick in 2022 utility-scale installations to increased general acceptance of solar, more ambitious targets as well as surging argi-PV. While Fechner does not have the data surrounding solar installations on agricultural land, he said anecdotal evidence reveals “the trend of agriPV is growing.”
Another trend is the growing amount of energy communities, with 600 currently operational in Austria and “many more” in development, according to the report. Fechner said the Austrian Government's Climate and Energy Fund, with €45 million ($49 million) earmarked for energy community storage, has been the “driving force for energy communities to be developed further.”
Austria maintaining its 2 GW solar installation streak in the future would be a “big success,” the expert said. However, the report warns of “sustainable growth,” stating that special efforts need to be made to maintain the pace required to fulfill the larger 41 TWh by 2040 goal. Asked how sustainable growth can be achieved, Fechner said it was a “good question” and that “nobody knows” the answer.
“What we have seen in 2023 was mainly what started in 2022 with the Ukraine war,” he said.
“Austria has the most or the highest dependency on Russian gas in Europe. A lot of people want to get rid of it and try to find alternatives and this mainly drives two people towards PV installations and heat pumps. The market with both technologies has increased very much.”
Fechner said installers are expressing anxiety that the PV bubble will eventually burst, and that connection is troublesome. He said network providers are claiming their grids are “full” and it is “no longer possible” to inject solar into infrastructure. “We need solutions,” Fechner said, before adding strengthening the domestic manufacturing sector would be another win.
According to the report, no silicon, ingot or wafer products were made in Austria in 2022. However, four manufacturers – Kioto Photovoltaics GmbH, Energetica-Photovoltaic industries, DAS Energy, and Ertex-Solartechnik GmbH – produced 2,083 MW of PV modules, with Austrian solar heavyweight Fronius producing 415 GW worth of inverters in the same year.
“We should really try to help Austria's industry survive on the international market because this competition with Asian and Chinese production is very heavy,” Fechner said. “If we can succeed to keep our production and come out with innovative modules, inverters and other equipment, I think this would be highly successful.”

Grid-scale solar segment growth and increasing labor costs are driving solar site managers to find new ways to expand inspection capabilities while reducing overheads. Solar sites require extensive preventative maintenance to keep equipment running optimally. The detailed visual inspections currently being conducted by field technicians can be laborious and time-consuming.
“Most maintenance contracts include service-level guarantees requiring responsiveness and insight into system performance, and the demand for these insights is increasing each year,” said Scott Canada, from McCarthy Building Companies’ renewable energy team. “Current examples of monitoring systems and methods used include stationary monitoring systems or aerial drones but these methods often have inadequate capabilities and practical limitations.”
Researchers at robotics startup OnSight Technology have developed the Bulldog robot to help bridge the gap and provide an alternative monitoring system. After incorporating enhanced technology that increases battery life and offers wireless charging, thermal camera resolution, outdoor-rated components, and advancements in machine vision training techniques, the latest ground-inspection robots were ready to be field tested.
“By automating the process, inspections can be systematically completed with a higher level of accuracy and efficiency by the robot, reducing human error and maintaining a consistent level of high-quality checks,” said Graham Ryland, chief product officer with OnSight. “Not only does automation increase operational efficiency, it frees up human resources to focus on more complex tasks, thereby optimizing overall workflow.”
McCarthy partnered with OnSight on several solar projects and use cases. The robot maker built out barcode-scanning capabilities for a 195 MW project in Arizona that included geo-location as a contractual requirement to ensure ease of operation and warranty fulfillment. A head-to-head comparison was conducted using human labor versus the latest technology in ground-based robotic inspection.
“Through a three-phased approach, OnSight made improvements to barcode scanning on-site that increased the scanning speed from two modules per minute to 18 modules per minute, rivaling the human field technician’s rate of 21 modules per minute,” Ryland said. “This was achieved by adapting the technology on-site to optimally perform inspections.”
The OnSight robot was equipped with a 4k color camera, 33x optical zoom and high-precision GPS. It operated on battery power for eight hours daily and recharged using solar generator charging stations.
The robot was managed remotely by a human operator using manual and autonomous modes to undertake the scanning process, instead of eight-hour shifts and two-and-a-half-hour roundtrip commutes by field technicians to the site.
Human module scanning is quicker than robot scanning but only when skilled and reliable personnel are available on site. With human scanners coping with extreme weather conditions, their overall time scanning throughout the day was significantly less than that of the robot, ensuring the per-day performance of modules scanning by a human and robot were similar.
Where the robot excelled was in the accuracy and reliability of scanning mission results. This was due to the robot’s use of an auto-stop functionality, serial number integrity verification, and constant mission recording, which combined to prevent the robot from missing a barcode while scanning a row. This level of precision is important because the robot’s scanning results aligned exactly with the project’s as-built drawings and made locating a faulty module much easier.
 
Access to a high-power, radiometric thermal camera enabled the robot to perform back-of-module hotspot and MC4-connector infrared inspections and barcode scanning missions at the same time. This occurred without negatively affecting barcode scan rate unless an issue was discovered and needed to be documented.
The McCarthy and OnSight collaboration illustrated that time-consuming, repetitive, and detail-oriented tasks, particularly focused on data collection and identification, are better completed with technical solutions, especially when it involves the rapid deployment of multiple automated robots. The potential benefits of ground-based robots include: cost savings on quality inspections by eliminating the need for quality engineers and manual inspections; efficient remedial work by having all issues identified with geotags; less rework for quality inspections; and higher revenues, thanks to higher DC availability.
“Rather than replacing humans in the construction and commissioning of these projects, we anticipate these tools can be used to free up specialized workers and technicians to do higher-value work,” OnSight’s Ryland said. “With labor shortages and [solar] demand only expected to increase, ground-based robots make sense to incorporate on projects.”

Dracula Technologies has announced a new application for its OPV cells.
The French OPV specialist is presenting a device at the CES 2024 show this week that integrates the production of solar energy from mini-OPV modules and a storage device based on a flexible film. The new product is designed to increase the autonomy of connected electronic devices
The “LayerVault” solution is designed to replace traditional batteries. The solar cells are based on Dracula's OPV inkjet technology, which captures both natural and artificial light. It is designed for indoor use, due to its light energy recovery system. In these devices, energy from ambient light is converted using an organic active layer composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen.
The active layer absorbs light photons, generating electron-hole pairs which are then separated by an internal electric field, producing an electric current. The other layers of the organic module, such as the interfacial layers or electrodes, are designed to facilitate the extraction and collection of charges created in the active layer. According to the company, the power of the cells under indoor lighting amounts to 45 µw/cm² at 1,000 lux.
The new solution is patented with its OPV inkjet technology and is designed to power ultra-low consumption electronic devices in low-light conditions under 500 lux. According to the company, the product is suitable for ultra-low power devices and efficiently powers  Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) devices in sectors such as Electronic Tags (ESL), Remote Controls, Indoor Industrial Internet of Things (smart building), smart asset tracking, and indoor consumer Internet of Things.
To support its deployment, Dracula Technologies has established a partnership with its investor, SemTech, which provides semiconductors, IoT systems and cloud connectivity services. The LayerVault device is compatible with sensors based on the LoRa communication protocol developed and operated by SemTech. The new device can be integrated into the group's wireless connectivity chips and other products aimed at low-consumption connected technologies.

“A drone can transport 360 solar panels a day and 40 drones operate in shifts,” the media outlet said. without providing further details. “This will be a huge solar power plant.”
pv magazine identified a European startup that has just launched a drone with these functions – FlyingBasket, based in Bolzano, northern Italy.
The company was established in 2015 by Moritz Moroder and Matthias Moroder. They came up with the idea of transporting solar panels with drones while they were hiking in the Dolomite Mountains in Italy and noticed a helicopter bringing food to a mountain refuge.
The idea of replacing a helicopter with a drone began to take shape to make such services more sustainable, efficient and profitable. In the following years, they designed, developed and tested drone prototypes in a mountainous area where weather conditions can be extremely difficult and the first use cases were tested.
“In 2020 FlyingBasket was the first operational commercial cargo drone,” they said.
In October 2023 they launched the FB3 UAV, an unmanned multicopter with eight rotors powered by four rechargeable batteries, capable of transporting up to 100 kg of payload.
With an empty weight of 70 kg and dimensions of 1,600 mm x 1,600 mm x 412 mm, the FB3 can reach speeds of 30 meters per second. It is capable of flying up to 2.5 km carrying 100 kg of weight, and up to 25 km with five kg. Its operating temperature range is from -10 C to 45 C.
FlyingBasket currently sells the drone for €75,900 ($83.322).
Leonardo currently owns around 10% of FlyingBasket, with around 25% in the hands of Cysero, a venture capital fund promoted by AVM Gestioni SGR and Kilometro Rosso, which invested directly in the company in March 2022. The remaining 65% is distributed among the founders and directors of the company, including the Moroder brothers.

Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and other III-V materials – named after the groups in the periodic table they belong to – are among the best known in terms of efficiency potential for solar cells. Their high production costs, however, have so far limited them to niche applications powering satellites and drones. In these devices, low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than the cost of energy produced.
The researchers considered a triple-junction solar cell based on gallium indium phosphide (GaInP), gallium indium arsenide (GaInAs), and Germanium (Ge). “The measurements presented are unprecedented, as there are no previous publications that combine different spectral and temperature-controlled experimental conditions in the UHC range, thus extending the range of studies reported in works carried out at lower concentrations,” they emphasized.
To measure the I–V curves under different temperatures and power concentrations, the scientists built an experimental setup based on a multi-flash indoor solar simulator, which they say allows operating temperatures of up to 85 C and irradiance concentration levels of up to 2,200 suns. Under these conditions, they produced several sets of I-V curves based on 30 measurements per combination of temperature and concentration.
“In a first approximation, the curves show that both open-circuit current (Isc) and short-circuit voltage (Voc) increase with irradiance,” they found. “However, while Isc increases with temperature, Voc decreases. Thus, the parameters exhibit similar behavior in the UHC regime to that observed at lower concentrations.”
As for the short-circuit current, they identified a linear increasing dependence on temperature at constant irradiance levels and said it depends on irradiance. Considering the open-circuit values as a function of the irradiances at different temperatures, they also found a “linear fitting that depicts an increasing dependence on irradiances and a good linear fitting to the natural logarithm of the irradiance.” However, they have also found a negative linear dependence of open-circuit voltage on temperature at constant irradiance levels.
Furthermore, when they analyzed the cell fill factor, the academics found a decreasing dependence as temperature and irradiance increase. “The data indicate a linear decreasing dependence of efficiency with the logarithm of irradiance,” they specified. “With respect to temperature, it shows a close linear relationship between cell efficiency and temperature at each irradiance level studied.”
The team also observed a strong correlation between the relative variations of open-circuit voltage and the efficiency with temperature. In addition, they conducted an analysis of cell response measurements to spectral variations in the UHC regime by utilizing the spectral matching ratio (SMR) factor, which is the ratio of the photogenerated currents of adjacent subcells under the same irradiance levels.
“For SMR< 1 values the spectrum is redshifted (with lower power density at short wavelengths compared to the standard), and less generation is obtained in the top subcell,” the scientists stated. “In contrast, for SMR> 1, the middle subcell has lower generation levels although the total current is not equally affected by the same relative deviations of SMR. In the opposite case, with SMR< 1, the contribution of the top subcell is much lower than that of the middle subcell in the case of SMR> 1.”
Their findings were presented in “Multi-junction solar cell measurements at ultra-high irradiances for different temperatures and spectra,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The group comprised researchers from the University of Jaen and the Andaltec Technological Center.

ClearVue Technologies has signed a deal with construction contractor Kapitol Group to supply its power-generating solar windows for a new commercial building project in Melbourne for the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, and Employees Union (CFMEU).
ClearVue said its second-generation, building.integrated PV (BIPV) product, which is designed to maintain glass transparency while generating electricity, will be incorporated into the facade of the CFMEU’s new training and wellness center being built in the inner-city suburb of Carlton.
Martin Deil, global chief executive officer of the Perth-based company, said the deal marks a significant milestone for ClearVue with the project the first major commercial solar facade installation of its integrated glazing units (IGUs) in Australia.
“This is a significant milestone for ClearVue as we have now commercially launched in Australia,” he said.
ClearVue said its second-generation BIPV product was specified for the Hayball Architects-designed project because of its “exceptional sustainability benefits and high performance.”
“Our solar glass windows generate the highest energy of any comparable solar glass on the market, with strong insulation and thermal performance which reduces heating and cooling loads,” Deil said.
The company is optimistic the CFMEU project will showcase the viability of integrating solar power directly into new builds and retrofits.
Kapitol Group Project Manager Tom Stephens said ClearVue’s product has the potential to contribute to sustainable buildings that minimize environmental impact.
“One of our core company values is to ‘do no harm,' and engaging with suppliers like ClearVue means we can build more sustainable buildings that will minimize their environmental impact for decades to come,” he said.
Project architect Hayball hopes the project will earn a 5-Star GreenStar certification – a rating given for environmental excellence in Australia – and a Gold WELL certification, which recognizes the impact on health and wellbeing. ClearVue’s IGUs are expected to form an integral part of the submission.
ClearVue’s announcement comes just days after it revealed it would accelerate the commercialization of its smart glass windows after securing a maiden manufacturing and distribution agreement in Australia with Victoria-based Melbourne Safety Glass (MS Glass).

The scientists identified the types of failures according to the errors obtained in the inverters and the description of occurrences. Failures include grid faults, grid overvoltage, temporary grid overvoltage, grid undervoltage, low voltage, temporary AC overcurrent, grid overfrequency, grid underfrequency, grid power failure, excessive stray current, supply grid fault, 10-minute grid overvoltage, output overload, and unbalanced load of grid device fault.
The group tested the proposed approach on two ground-mounted PV systems with capacities of 140 kW and 590 kW. Both installations rely on inverters provided by German manufacturer SMA. “The variables of each inverter were analyzed, and the following types of failure were verified in the case of the variable yield, due to the inverter errors,” it explained.
The data were characterized via fine tree, medium tree, and coarse tree prediction models. In tree-based models, a set of splitting rules actively divides the feature space into multiple smaller, non-overlapping regions with similar response values.
The academics claim that the proposed algorithm is able to identify seasonal variations in inverter failures and that the results it provides can be used for reliability analysis. “The data-driven evaluation developed in this study indicates that inverters subsystems emerge for categorizing failure modes,” they stressed.
They also suggested protecting inverters from inrush and overcurrent automatically by using clamp circuits to the resonant capacitance in parallel. “High power-conversion efficiency can be achieved by regenerating the clamp current to the input voltage source,” they concluded.
The novel algorithm was presented in the study “Machine learning for monitoring and classification in inverters from solar photovoltaic energy plants,” published in Compass in Solar.

The EIA forecasts the deployment of 45 GW (DC) of utility-scale solar projects larger than 1 MW in 2024. This is projected increase to about 53 GW in 2025, said the agency.
Adding Wood Mackenzie Power and Renewables conservative projections of 6 GW in residential solar and 2 GW in commercial projects, the total solar capacity expected for 2024 is 53.5 GW.
The projected figures for 2025 suggest a potential total of 65 GW of deployed solar capacity.
The EIA also said that utility-scale solar is expected to account for 6% of total electricity generation in 2024 and 7% in 2025. This is set against a backdrop in which overall electricity generation is predicted to grow by 3% in 2024 and remain constant in 2025.
Small-scale solar generation is expected to account for 2% to total electricity generation in 2024, increasing to 2.3% in 2025. This suggests that solar power could represent 8% of the total electricity used in 2024 and 9.3% in 2025. If deployment reaches about 65 GW in 2025, solar power could account for nearly 11% of all electricity generation in 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/11/swiss-perovskite-startup-sets-up-indoor-solar-cell-manufacturing/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JANUARY 11, 2024",Swiss perovskite startup sets up indoor solar cell manufacturing,"Perovskia Solar, a Swiss developer of indoor solar cells, is setting up a factory in Aubonne, Switzerland to produce one million printed perovskite devices annually.
“It is a sheet-to-sheet production line based on commercially available equipment with minor customization. It includes a new in-house built tool to simply print the encapsulation material,” Anand Verma, Perovskia Solar's CEO, told pv magazine. “The full cell stack with contacts is printed in-house on glass substrates.”
Perovskia is a spinoff of the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA). It was founded to develop the market for customized perovskite solar devices as battery replacements. A recent design-in win was a bracelet-style health tracker developed by France-based Baracoda, which won an innovation award last year at the 2023 CES Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.
In 2023, Perovskia had 15 original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in the process of evaluating, testing or producing products. “Two out of 15 were already using another indoor PV technology, either amorphous silicon or organic PV. The rest were using conventional batteries. That confirms to us that the application is clearly battery replacement,” said Verma.
Optimized for indoor light condition, Perovskia Solar's latest generation of cells have an open-circuit voltage of 0.9 V and a power output of 80 µw/cm² – 85 µw/cm² under indoor lighting at 1,000 lux. “We are aiming to increase it to 100 µw/cm² – 120 µw/cm² in a development project with EMPA,” said Verma.
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
As for stability, Verma noted efficiency of 80% is maintained after 5,000 hours of full sun exposure. The devices also reportedly retains 90% of its original efficiency after 1000 hours. “Indeed, we have passed accelerated benchmarks. The typical perovskite degradation rates are avoided by using additives,” said Verma, adding that the devices comply with Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) standards.

SECI has allocated 900 MW out of 2 GW of tendered wind-solar hybrid power projects, at an average price of INR 3.19/kWh. NTPC Renewable Energy bid for 300 MW and won the capacity by quoting the lowest (L1) tariff of INR 3.15/kWh.
Green Infra Wind Energy secured 450 MW and Juniper Green Energy took 150 MW at INR 3.21/kWh each, as their quoted prices stayed within L1 tariff plus 2%.
The successful bidders will develop the projects on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. The projects must be connected to the interstate transmission system and can be located anywhere in India.
SECI will sign 25-year power purchase agreements with the successful bidders. Power procured by SECI from the projects will be sold to different buying entities across India.
