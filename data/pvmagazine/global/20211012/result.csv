Research into silicon anodes has made plenty of progress in recent years, with a few companies making moves toward commercialization and large scale production. However, there are still challenges and plenty more to be done at the research stage for silicon to realize its potential in energy storage.
The major challenge is that the material tends to swell up as lithium ions enter it. Eventually, this causes the anode to crack, flake, or otherwise fall apart, and it cannot regain its original structure. Plenty of solutions to this have been suggested – coating the anode, using porous silicon, and more have shown positive results.
So far, however, few researchers have delved deeply into the mechanisms at work within the anode as a battery cycle, and there are disagreements over exactly what is going on at the atomic level. “Many people have imagined what might be happening, but no one had actually demonstrated it before,” said Chongmin Wang, a scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the United States.
The group at PNNL set out to change this, combining two sophisticated imaging techniques – known as sensitive elemental tomography and cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy, with an advanced algorithm to observe the process in action, finding that the lithium anodes essentially push their way into the silicon structure, and then flow back out leaving large gaps in the structure. These gaps are then filled by the development of a solid-electrolyte interphase within the silicon (rather than at the edge of the anode where it should be), creating dead zones within the anode that quickly add up to significant capacity loss.
The group’s work on characterizing this mechanism is described in full in the paper Progressive growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase towards the Si anode interior cases capacity fading, published in nature nanotechnology. The group was able to observe the change in the anode structure after just one battery cycle. After 36 cycles the damage was said to be significant, and the anode was ‘destroyed’ after 100 cycles.
“This work offers a clear roadmap for developing silicon as the anode for a high-capacity battery,” said Wang. In the paper, the group concludes that its work demonstrates that the most effective way to improve on silicon anodes would be to focus on preventing or limiting the electrolyte from permeating the anode. The group further notes that, beyond silicon, its work could be applied to other high-capacity anode materials.

Critically, 3,000 W/kg of specific power opens HyPoint's system up to larger aircraft, including passenger planes,” HyPoint wrote on Friday. The startup focuses on hydrogen-powered zero-emission aviation, aeronautics, and urban air mobility. “Our collaboration will yield next-generation membranes and membrane-electrode assemblies that result in a significant improvement to our system’s specific power, durability, and operational temperature range,” Alex Ivanenko, founder, and CEO of HyPoint, commented.
Italian gas transmission system operator Snam launched a program to support startups along the entire hydrogen value chain, from transportation to storage and end-uses. “The startups selected after the calls will have access to an acceleration process lasting between four and six months, with research and development support, as well as mentoring, networking and technology testing,” the Milan-based company wrote on Monday, adding that HyAccelerator is “the first corporate global-scale startup acceleration programme focused on hydrogen.” At the end of the program, the startups will coordinate with Snam to conduct feasibility studies. Snam owns and operates the largest natural gas transmission network in Europe, with 42,000 kilometers of pipelines. The gas TSO previously told pv magazine it is open to shipping any form of low-carbon hydrogen – green or blue.
French President Emmanuel Macron said that small modular reactors and green hydrogen are two of the country’s development objectives to 2030. “We must be a leader in green hydrogen by 2030,” he said on Tuesday during a two-hour speech about France’s 2030 strategy. Macron said that France must reinvent nuclear energy and use it also to produce green hydrogen. “We can become a leader [in green hydrogen] because we have all the elements to do so. And first and foremost we have the nuclear … At the moment, given the electrification of the European energy and mobility systems, it is not true that we have enough renewable capacity for the electrolysis needed to produce green hydrogen.” Macron said that the EU countries can either import green hydrogen or produce locally, in the case of France through nuclear.
Green hydrogen should be prioritized in the upcoming reforms of the EU’s gas rules, wrote a group of four researchers in a white paper published by the International Council on Clean Transportation on Sunday. “We encourage policymakers not to add fossil-based hydrogen as an eligible pathway in the REDII and not to incentivize this pathway in any other relevant climate and gas policies, such as the upcoming Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package,” reads the document. The researchers conducted a sensitivity analysis of the life cycle GHG emissions of several low-GHG gas pathways, including biomethane. “Hydrogen produced from biomethane (made from wastewater sludge, LFG, or manure) and natural gas plus CCS can deliver significant GHG reductions, but it is also possible that they could have similar or even higher GHG intensity than the fossil comparator.”
South Africa’s Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) and partners launched the Hydrogen Valley Feasibility Study Report. The government said that developing a hydrogen economy has become a strategic priority for the country. “South Africa's proposed hydrogen valley will start near Mokopane in Limpopo, where platinum group metals (PGMs) are mined, extending through the industrial and commercial corridor to Johannesburg and leading finally to Durban. The hydrogen valley will be used to establish, accelerate and embed niche innovations through upscaling and replication,” the South African government wrote on Friday. The study also identified nine pilot projects in the mobility, industrial, and buildings sectors. “In the mobility sector, there is already momentum in place to deploy mining trucks (e.g., project Rhyno in Mogalakwena) and heavy-duty trucks along the N3 corridor… The industrial sector already sees many pilot projects underway that could be supported by this project. Sasol has committed to developing ethylene and ammonia from green hydrogen… In the buildings sector, the Limpopo Science and Technology Park, as well as Anglo-American corporate office buildings in Rustenburg, have already planned to install fuel cells for power,” reads the feasibly study. According to the document, hydrogen demand in the Valley could reach up to 80% of demand in the national hydrogen roadmap.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on green hydrogen production, transmission, storage, and use. Over the past months, IRENA tried to leverage knowledge across its global membership, while IPHE facilitated information sharing and engagement on policy, codes, standards and safety, trade issues, and supply chain opportunities. “It is very important that the international initiatives working on hydrogen collaborate effectively to build on and lever each other’s efforts to accelerate the pace of development and deployment of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies,” commented Noé van Hulst, IPHE Chair. The organization founded in 2003 has 22 members, including Australia, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Norway, Russia, and the United States.
U.K. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and India’s Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy Raj Kumar Singh endorsed a forward action plan on clean energy, including boosting renewable energy and storage, enabling production and use of green hydrogen, and increasing the switch to electric mobility. “The Energy Dialogue today advanced our joint agenda to develop clean energy to support sustainable growth for both our economies,” Alex Ellis, High Commissioner to India, commented on Friday.

China will continue to promote the adjustment of both industrial and energy structures, vigorously develop renewable energies, and accelerate the planning and construction of large-scale wind and PV projects in desert areas. The first phase of projects with a total installed capacity of around 100 GW will commence soon, said Xi.
Wuxi Shanghai announced on Tuesday that it will increase capital for a subsidiary located in Inner Mongolia for the annual production of 100,000 MT of granular silicon and 150,000 MT of nano-silicon. Granular silicon is the raw material for downstream ingot and wafer products, while nano-silicon serves the upstream sector for the production of polysilicon and granular silicon. The Inner Mongolian subsidiary is jointly owned by Shangji and Jiangsu Zhongneng – the latter a fully owned subsidiary of GCL group – with Zhongneng holding 65% of the shares and Shanghi the remaining 35%. The total investment will be around RMB 3.14 billion (around US$486 million) with Shangji providing RMB1.02 billion. Shanghai said that 70% of the planned 100,000 MT of granular silicon capacity will be ordered by the company for its wafer factory, which is also located in the same province.

The government of Queensland, Australia, has confirmed that green hydrogen will be produced in the state's Darling Downs region in less than two years, with a “unique” demonstration facility capable of producing an estimated 50,000 kilograms of solar-powered renewable hydrogen each year to be operating before the end of 2023.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the Kogan Hydrogen Demonstration Plant, to be developed by government-owned generator CS Energy, will go ahead after a successful feasibility study with Japan's IHI Corp.
De Brenni said the facility would be built beside the existing Kogan Creek Power Station and would include the co-location of a solar farm, battery energy storage system, hydrogen electrolyzer and a hydrogen fuel cell. The minister said the project is unique because the facility will be powered exclusively by behind-the-meter solar energy, making it one of the few truly green hydrogen projects in Australia.
CS Energy CEO Andrew Bills said the feasibility study had confirmed the optimum design of the renewable hydrogen plant and that Kogan Creek Power Station was a good location with existing assets and plenty of space for expansion opportunities.
“This project offers multiple benefits for CS Energy because of hydrogen’s ability to be used as both a fuel and as a way to store energy,” he said. “In addition to selling hydrogen into the domestic market, CS Energy can use the plant’s battery to provide grid stability services in the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) Market.”
Construction on the Kogan Creek facility is expected to commence in 2022, with commissioning scheduled in early 2023.
The announcement comes amid a flurry of green hydrogen activity in the state. Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) announced plans on Monday to establish a 2 GW green hydrogen manufacturing facility near Gladstone, in central Queensland.
That was followed by FFI teaming with fertilizer and chemical manufacturer Incitec Pivot to announce that they will “assess whether industrial-scale manufacturing of green ammonia at Gibson Island is technically and commercially feasible on an existing brownfield site.” The two companies will examine whether a new electrolysis plant at Incitec’s Gibson Island facility near Brisbane can produce about 50,000 tons of renewable hydrogen per year, which would then be converted into green ammonia for Australian and export markets.
Incitec CEO Jeanne Johns said the partnership was considered one of Australia’s best near-term opportunities to produce green ammonia at an industrial scale.
“The combination of FFI’s drive to develop a globally competitive green hydrogen industry, and our leadership and technical skills in ammonia production, will play an important role in developing Australia’s capability in this growing international market,” said Johns.
That announcement was followed on Tuesday by Rio Tinto signing a statement of cooperation with the Queensland government to investigate off-take agreements for large-scale renewable energy projects to power its assets, including the Boyne Island aluminum smelter near Gladstone.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/12/covid-19-recovery-a-lost-opportunity-for-the-energy-transition/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 12, 2021",Covid-19 recovery a “lost opportunity for the energy transition”,"The 2021 edition of DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook was published this week, examining progress toward decarbonization of the entire energy sector. The report finds that worldwide, Covid-19 recovery and other stimulus policy packages have failed to address decarbonization as well – a major missed opportunity for the energy transition.
“Covid-19 has more than demonstrated that governments can act boldly. Yet, from an energy transition perspective, the pandemic has been a lost opportunity,” said DNV president and CEO Remi Eriksen. “Recovery packages have largely focused on protecting rather than transforming existing industries.”
As in previous years, the report finds that emissions are not falling fast enough, that targets laid out in the Paris agreements will be missed, and the global average temperature will increase 2.3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. This comes despite the expectation of a surge in both electrification and renewable energy over the coming decades.
DNV forecasts electrification of final energy demand to grow from 19% today to 38% in 2050, driven by the growth in electric vehicle demand – expected to be 50% of all passenger vehicle sales by 2032; and in heat pump use, which it expects to triple to account for 32% of heat demand while using only 9% of the energy used for heating.
Despite falling short on decarbonization targets, the report is positive on solar growth – noting that co-located solar plus storage is emerging as a new category of power plant – one that will account for 12% of all grid-connected electricity generation by 2050. Gas is forecast to maintain its current position, while demand for oil will fall by half and coal by two-thirds over the same period.
“Wind and solar PV will expand 15- and 20-fold respectively in our forecast period,” said Eriksen. “Twinned with the plunging costs and advancing technology of battery storage, variable renewables are already enabling a phase out of thermal power generation and the business case will become overwhelming by 2030.”
The report calls energy efficiency “our greatest untapped resource against climate change”, noting that the push for electrification and related gains in efficiency will keep overall energy demand flat after the 2030s.
It is in difficult to electrify sectors such as shipping, aviation, heavy industry, and others, where DNV finds the most urgent need for action. The report expects these industries to remain heavy fossil fuel users, and to increase their share in global emissions.
Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels, seen as the most viable solution for these more difficult to abate sectors, will account for just 5% of overall energy demand by 2050. “Not everything can be electrified. That is what makes tackling the hard-to-abate sectors of high heat, aviation, shipping and trucking so very urgent. Yet our forecast shows that hydrogen enters the picture at scale only in the late 2030s. That is far too late,” Eriksen warns.
Though it may lack scale in overall energy demand, DNV does expect green hydrogen produced from renewable energy to overtake other forms by 2050, with grid connected electrolyzers meeting 18% of demand and those powered directly by renewables accounting for 43%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/12/solar-deployed-on-rooftops-could-match-annual-u-s-electricity-generation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 12, 2021",Solar deployed on rooftops could match annual U.S. electricity generation,"From pv magazine USA
The United States has enough usable rooftop space to deploy an amount of solar equal to its current nationwide generation levels, according to recent research on global photovoltaic potential. Researchers at Ireland’s University of Cork leveraged big data, machine learning, and geospatial analysis to reach their findings, which were published in Nature Communications.
In the report, about 77,000 square miles of rooftop area worldwide was demarcated as usable PV surface area (for context, the state of Florida is roughly 65,000 square miles). The researchers said this area could result in the production of 27 petawatt-hours, or 27 million GWh, if completely covered by conventional photovoltaics.
This level of potential energy would exceed 2018 total global electricity consumption, a year in which 6 petawatt-hours (PWh) of electricity was consumed by homes alone, and over 23 PWh was consumed globally, per Statista.com.
The report further said that rooftops in the United States could host enough capacity to produce an annual 4.2 PWh per year, effectively matching the nation’s current total energy output of about 4 PWh per year.
In 2020, about 60% of U.S. electric generation came from fossil fuels, and roughly 20% each from nuclear and renewable energy sources, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). EIA estimated that the U.S. additionally produced 42 billion kWh of electricity from distributed, small-scale solar, about 1% of total generation. Large-scale solar accounted for 2.2% of total generation that year.
The authors of the paper in Nature Communications said there are mitigating factors in this potential PV outlook, including constraints around transmission, and the need for storage due to the intermittent generation cycles of solar energy.
This high potential for rooftop solar may come as good news for American ratepayers, as it may put some savings back in their pockets. Recently, it was estimated by Local Solar for All that collectively $109 billion in utility bill payments could be avoided by 2030 if rooftop solar were to scale up 2-4 times faster, vs. an all-utility-scale solar deployment scenario.
The report is an important talisman to wield for those who are concerned about energy sprawl, or the development of land for energy generation. A study by Clemson University showed that in the U.S., including spacing and zoning requirements, roughly 500,000 square miles of land would need to be dedicated to new energy development by 2040, an area larger than Texas. Rooftops represent an alternative to using up otherwise useful lands.
(Read: “Solar in uncommon spaces“)
“The open data generated in this research helps to quantify, locate and prioritize investment in zero-carbon electricity systems,” said study co-author James Glynn, senior researcher at Columbia University.
Potential costs for rooftop solar across the globe were also evaluated in the Nature Communications paper, and it was found that costs range depending on location. The lowest per-megawatt-hour costs were in China ($68) and India ($66), and the highest costs were in the U.K. ($251) and the U.S. ($238).

One U.K. firm has said it is seeing up to a 1,000% surge in orders in the past weeks for solar modules, as energy prices have reportedly trebled since 2001, with the average cost of domestic gas rising by 221%, compared to 193% for electricity, according to one market report.
“People are getting in touch with us every day; we’ve seen an unbelievable spike in orders as they want to get away from traditional energy and move to renewables, despite no Government incentives because they were scrapped several years ago,” said Carbon Net Zero managing director Gareth Jones.
The U.K.’s take-up of solar has been stilted. In 2020, solar generation grew just 4.6% year-on-year, according to the Digest of UK Energy Statistics, including utility-scale options. Limited incentives have been provided to U.K. households and small businesses by policymakers, with concerns over taxation and understanding of benefits.
“[The Government[ should be helping people who are looking at long-term future-proofing of their homes, use different strategies hand in hand and do so sustainably, to avoid mistakes being repeated. I think the Government has its priorities wrong,” continued Jones.
As far as supply chain issues might be impacting solar modules stocks, no such concerns have yet materialized for Carbon Net Zero: “We are in a strong position and have plenty of stock in store, so there are no supply chain issues, unlike many sectors struggling to obtain materials,” said Jones. “There has never been a better time to switch to solar.”

The Paris-based company said the guarantee will cover its equity and quasi equity investments in Société de production d’énergie solaire de Ouagadougou SAS (SPES Ouagadougou) for a period of up to 20 years. The project will be implemented under a public-private partnership signed by the Burkina Faso Ministry of Energy. The electricity will be sold to Société Nationale d'Electricite du Burkina (Sonabel), the country’s state-owned utility, under a 25-year take-or-pay PPA.
Hiroshi Matano, the executive vice president of MIGA, claimed that the facility will help to address Burkina Faso's power deficit and support its transition to renewable energy. ”MIGA's support sends a clear signal to the private sector of the possibilities in the Sahel region,” he said.
The board of directors of MIGA, a member of the World Bank Group, has approved the guarantee and three other 102 MWp PV projects – Burkina Faso's first round of independent solar power producers.
Otmane Hajji, the president of GreenYellow, said the company aims to use its decentralized model to help Burkina Faso deploy more renewable energy. “Political risk insurance from MIGA demonstrates the group's ability to finance its growth ambitions in promising markets like Burkina Faso,” he said.
The agreement follows a recent investment in which GreenYellow obtained €21 million of financing from FMO, the Dutch development bank, for a 30 MW solar plant in Burkina Faso. The array at the Nagréongo power station, about 30 kilometers northeast of Ouagadougou, is scheduled for commissioning by the end of the year.
In June, the World Bank agreed to support Burkina Faso's Sustainable Renewables Risk Mitigation Initiative (SRMI) with $168 million to improve access to electricity in rural areas. The funds will be used to support the country’s Large Scale Solar and Rural Electrification Project. They will also be used for an upcoming tender for 325 MW of solar coupled with 335 MWh of storage capacity.
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) statistics show that Burkina Faso had just 62 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2020. MIGA notes that the country relies heavily on expensive heavy fuel oil generation and imports from neighbouring countries such as Ghana.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/12/spanish-ppas-and-the-remuneration-reduction-under-rdl-17-2021/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SPAIN",,"OCTOBER 12, 2021",Spanish PPAs and the remuneration reduction under RDL 17/2021,"The measures were adopted by decree and after only a few days were concretized by an additional explanation (aclaración) (Real Decreto-ley 17/2021 of 14.09.21, in conjunction with the ministerial announcement “Respuesta al operador del sistema sobre la aplicación del RDL 17/21” of the Ministry of the Environment of 21.09.21).
On the one hand, the package of measures in RDL 17/2021 includes tax benefits and, on the other, a reduction in remuneration (“clawback”) until the end of March 2022, which must be paid to the Spanish TSO by the owner of the renewable energy plants.
Taken together, the economic losses of the reduction outweigh the positive effects of the tax relief, so that in extreme circumstances project owners could find themselves forced to shut down plants in individual cases to limit the losses incurred.
The temporary reduction particularly affects owners of renewable energy plants with a capacity of more than 10 MW, the produced energy volumes of which are traded on the spot market and thus, along with other types of plants, benefit “extraordinarily” from the current sharp rise in electricity prices.
Thus, it is assumed for regulatory purposes that the sales revenue to be reduced has “internalized” or “indexed”, as it were, the increase caused primarily by the gas price (as one of the main factors in electricity price formation).
Accordingly, investments whose sales proceeds are not “indexed” in whole or in part are excluded from the reduction.
First and foremost, this concerns renewable energy installations that have agreed to physical, bilateral power supply contracts (physical PPAs) with fixed prices, provided that these PPAs were not concluded among affiliated companies and before September 16, 2021.
Secondly, “financial PPAs” are also exempt from the reduction, provided they were agreed in whole or in part with non-indexed hedging transactions (hedging) during the period of validity of RDL 17/2021, not with affiliated companies and before September 16, 2021.
This, therefore, applies to financial PPAs with a mixed pricing mechanism (e.g., cap-floor pricing) and financial PPAs relating to several assets of an owner (asset pool), but only in relation to the revenue portion that is priced on a fixed and non-indexed basis. The unsecured “net revenue share” is then subject to pro-rata reduction.
Lastly, those renewable energy installations that either receive a special state-subsidized feed-in tariff or a remuneration scheme based on tenders are also exempt from the curtailment.
With regard to these aforementioned exemptions, the exact details have not yet been finalized. It is not unlikely that RDL 17/2021 will be amended in the coming weeks until it is either confirmed or repealed by Parliament.
In particular, the setting of the time limit for PPAs as a condition for exemption from curtailment (PPA conclusion before September 16, 2021) is strongly debated and attacked in the market. This regulation is in direct contradiction to the government's idea of intensively promoting the use of long-term electricity supply contracts in the future as well.
In any case, however, the affected plant owners are required to assess the economic impact of RDL 17/2021 in terms of responsible contract management in legal terms, either because they already manage applicable PPAs in their portfolio or because they are about to conclude a PPA.
From a contract law perspective, the effects of the clawback according to RDL 17/2021 should be examined as events that could, in extreme cases, open the possibility for the renewable energy plant owner and contracting party to a PPA to adjust the contract. In the following, this particular case will be briefly outlined and finally summarized as a concise practical tip:
First of all, when examining the contractual clauses, it is necessary to clarify which law is applicable to the electricity supply contract. Even if contractual adjustments are regularly regulated in detail in the PPA, these clauses always apply only in the context and on the basis of the contract law chosen by the contracting parties. On PPAs with reference to Spain, this usually means the application of Spanish law. However, foreign legal systems must also be taken into account, provided that a corresponding choice of law has been made.
Hardship” refers to events that make the performance obligations of the parties agreed in the contract more difficult than is tolerable to the detriment of only one party to the contract, but not impossible. They thus represent an exception to the principle of the obligation to perform the contract (“pacta sunt servanda”). They regularly apply if the contractual situation originally found by the contracting parties outside the sphere of responsibility of the parties involved unforeseen and serious changes in such a way that adherence to the contract would lead to undue hardship for one party to the contract.
Whereas in German law, for example, the exception to the general obligation to perform described above is now explicitly regulated in § 313 BGB (“Störung der Geschäftsgrundlage”), there is no corresponding statutory regulation in Spain. As an unwritten principle of a “change of the contractual situation” (“rebus sic stantibus”), the exception is nevertheless recognized in Spanish doctrine and case law. The local case law on the application of hardship clauses was consolidated for the last time in the context of the global financial crisis to resolve extreme distortions in contractual symmetry. As in German law, this is based on the hypothetical will of the contracting parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract and thus also defines the specific standard of reasonableness in each case.
In relation to an electricity supply contract in Spain, the regularly agreed so-called “change in law” clauses are to be qualified as a subcategory of a hardship clause. They are also based on unforeseen events outside the risk sphere of the contracting parties, which can occur specifically due to legal interventions, such as regulatory changes.
The reduction in remuneration due to RDL 17/2021, therefore, fulfills the requirements of a hardship clause in any case on the merits. The decisive factor is then that the economic burdens and effects which the reduction in tariff means for a plant in a specific case exceed the threshold of unreasonableness. Since each plant has different initial economic parameters, the special features of each plant must be taken into account. With regard to the type of PPA, for example, contracts to secure plant financing (upstream PPAs), with their specific bank requirements, would have to be differentiated according to their financial structure.
For the future, the RDL, which has now come into force, means not least a shift in the “unforeseeability requirement” for the application of the “change in law” clause. This must be taken into account in particular when reformulating PPAs.
Even though the reduction in remuneration under RDL 17/2021 will lead to noticeable losses for most renewable energy plants, only a few are likely to exceed the unreasonableness threshold of a typical PPA hardship clause.
The primary objective is to adjust the contract before it is terminated. In this respect, it is the responsibility of the (Spanish) court to adjust the contract at its own discretion. Those who have concluded an arbitration agreement in the electricity supply contract as a precautionary measure can consider themselves lucky, as this enables the parties to select suitable arbitrators themselves in view of the judicial discretion to be exercised.
The substantially shorter duration of arbitration proceedings compared to proceedings before state courts lasting several years is also an advantage that should not be underestimated in the case of disputes over electricity tariffs. Against the background of the latest decisions of the Court of Justice of the EU, the competent arbitral tribunals must ensure that this adjustment is proportionate and in any case within the limits of competition law.
For existing PPAs with indexed price clauses
Review the existing contracts and assess their economic impact. If your PPA is affected by the clawback to such an extent that you would be forced from an economic point of view to (temporarily) shut down the plant, inform your contractual partners as well as investors and financial institutions in advance about this possible step. In the event that the contractual partner is considering legal action in the event of a shutdown, try to reach an out-of-court solution to the conflict at an early stage, ideally within the framework of commercial mediation(ADR). If this does not succeed, there remains the possibility of a contract adjustment by the (arbitration) court called upon.
For PPAs to be negotiated
Use suitable hardship clauses, tailoring them to your specific contractual situation and chosen law, and in particular providing for cases of contract adjustment by court or expert. Suitable clauses can be found on the ICC website. Note that the RDL now enacted has now shifted the requirements for the unforeseeability of state reductions in remuneration.

CEP.Energy has engaged Enerven Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of SA Power Networks, to provide engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services as it looks to continue the roll-out of its commercial and industrial (C&I) solar PV and storage program and big battery network.
Enerven, which has delivered large-scale solar, Virtual Power Plants (VPP) and standalone battery systems across the National Electricity Market (NEM), will act as CEP’s exclusive EPC services contractor in South Australia, and its preferred contractor in other states.
CEP CEO Peter Wright said the partnership paved the way for multiple projects, including the planned Lionsgate project, a 24 MW rooftop solar farm and 150 MW grid-scale battery to be developed on the site of the former Holden car manufacturing plant at Elizabeth in South Australia, to be progressed and for CEP to achieve substantial scale in a shorter timeframe.
“CEP.Energy has ambition to become the largest distributed renewable energy and storage developer and owner in Australia through strategic partnerships with large C&I property owners and specialist delivery partners,” he said. “Partnering with Enerven will help facilitate that by giving us a single point of contractor relationship and delivery for our large pipeline of projects involving embedded networks, solar and storage projects across Australia.”
Under the agreement, Enerven will provide project design and delivery to support CEP’s ongoing C&I and VPP program. Enerven will provide technical assessment and site feasibility analysis, and help design, install, operate and maintain systems.
Enerven General Manager Richard Amato said the company will also provide technical and advisory services to advance CEP’s proposed utility scale storage network. This will include providing strategic advice to support grid connection submissions, detailed engineering design and early selection of technology, installation and operation.
CEP, which finances, builds, owns and operates renewable energy microgrids and virtual power plants (VPPs) in partnership with property portfolio groups, has an impressive pipeline of renewable energy projects that includes more than 70 C&I embedded networks with solar and onsite battery storage.
The company said Phase 1 of the roll-out has commenced with 2.9 MW of rooftop solar installed in recent months and 11 MW of battery storage in the installation or planning phase. The installation of 2.6 MW of solar and 4 MW of storage at the Narellan Town Centre project, described by the CEP as Australia’s largest retail renewable energy project, is also progressing. CEP has also announced plans to develop a 2 GW utility scale battery storage portfolio, including the Lionsgate Energy Storage System in South Australia. The current estimate is that construction of the project will commence in 2023.
The battery is one of four utility-scale battery projects that CEP plans to develop throughout Australia, including a 1.2 GW megabattery in the Hunter region of New South Wales. Wright has previously said the Hunter Big Battery will be developed in stages, with construction on the project expected to begin in the first quarter of 2022.
