Our strategy revolves around increasing our R&D capabilities, with core technologies including digital technologies, power electronics, solar technology, and battery technology. We have expanded our presence in full scenarios: utility, commercial & industrial, and residential, where these technologies play vital roles. Moving forward, our strategy converges on three defined scenarios for the next five years.
The first aspect of our strategy aims to bring our advanced solutions and technology to more places in the solar market. We want to create more value for our customers by integrating our 4T (Watt/Bit/Heat/Battery) technologies into various applications.
The second strategic announcement acknowledges the rapid growth of PV across utility, commercial, and residential sectors, accompanied by the adoption of batteries. We strongly believe that the future grid will be powered by renewable energy and supported by power electronics, from generation to distribution and consumption. To promote development and ensure high-quality standards, we recognize the need to collaborate with our industrial partners.
Lastly, we view PV as a business based on an ecosystem. Our booth at the event showcases how our partners have become significant players. We have established partner schematics encompassing industry partners, financial partners, service partners, solution partners, and more. Working together, we aim to further build and expand our ecosystem, fostering collective growth.
Guoguang Chen: We have aligned our product offerings with the three defined scenarios. For utility applications, our most important solution is the Smart PV & ESS Generator. In countries with high renewable penetration like those utilizing PV and wind, grid instability becomes a concern. This solution addresses voltage, frequency, and power angle challenges, enhancing the future grid as conventional grid generation phases out. It’s the transition from grid-following, grid-supporting to grid-forming technology, enabling support and reinforcement of the grid with high proportion of renewable energy.
By integrating the Smart PV Inverters, Smart String ESS, Smart PCS with algorithm, the solution can accelerate PV to be the primary energy source as its wide application in future. With grid-forming technology, it is designed to support future up to 100% renewable energy penetration. This innovation is our most significant contribution to the utility sector.
We also cater to a wide range of industries and commercial applications. Our upgraded solution for commercial and industrial (C&I) applications includes the inverter + optimizer + ESS + charger + smart PV Management System Solution. This comprehensive solution is tailored to suit the diverse requirements of C&I applications.
In residential scenario, Huawei aims to lead the future by advancing the evolution of household energy through component innovation and technological upgrades. Through off-grid power backup, intelligent home energy scheduling by AI Energy Management Assistant (EMMA) and the future virtual power plant (VPP) interconnection will enable power independence and self-sufficiency for homes.
Guoguang Chen: The use of optimizers is crucial in our approach. Rooftops vary in shape, angles, and shading. Our optimizers, equipped with the latest power electronics functionalities, enable full utilization of rooftops and ensure high yield for C&I applications. Safety features like rapid shutdown are integrated into our optimizers, making them a standard part of our solution.
Furthermore, our inverters offer arc protection, allowing for higher voltage and current handling. In ESS, our goal is to help individuals balance generation and consumption, particularly in regions where extended power outages are common. Smart PV+ESS solutions replace diesel generation in such areas. Additionally, EV chargers play a crucial role by offering complementary loads for C&I applications. The synergy between diversified generation and load necessitates intelligent load management systems.
For high consumption industries, deploying PV on rooftops alone might not suffice. To achieve 100% green power and safe consumption, it becomes necessary to tap into virtual power plants. Therefore, we provide a one-stop solution that includes BIPV (building-integrated PV) to utilize every possible surface for generation.
Moreover, we have upgraded our 1+4+X solution for homeowners, increasing the green power consumption rate to 100% even during power outages or when the grid is unavailable.
We expand beyond rooftop applications to wall installations and gardens, utilizing any sunlit space as a resource. Different PV technologies can be applied to generate more power, while home energy management systems control generation and consumption. Battery technology advancements, such as our new 7kWh battery pack, offer flexibility in charging, discharging, and power conversion systems (PCS). This ensures varying backup time spans, even in extreme cases like the 10-hour outages in South Africa. With technological advancements and increased battery capacity, homeowners can achieve 100% green power consumption.
Furthermore, this fundamental technology is applicable to both on-grid and off-grid scenarios. We observe PV's significant impact on expanding off-grid applications. The largest microgrid project we are currently involved in is in Saudi Arabia, featuring a 400 MW PV system coupled with a 1.3 GWh battery energy storage system. This project, incorporating grid-forming technology, will provide power to one million homes and become the world's largest microgrid. We consider this technology as fundamental in bringing PV to any location, regardless of grid connectivity.
Guoguang Chen: I arrived in Europe in 2010 when Huawei had just initiated its PV endeavors. Our goal was to establish an R&D center in Europe, considering that Europe was at the forefront in terms of product development and technological advancements.
We aimed to bring new and improved products to the PV industry and recognized the global opportunities it presented. I personally traveled to various countries in Europe to determine the ideal location for our R&D center. After careful consideration, we decided to establish it in Nuremberg, which was known as the European center for power electronics.
Fortunately, we were able to recruit numerous power electronics experts to join our research center. This facility contributed significantly to key inverter technologies, particularly in the early generations. After three years of focusing on research, I transitioned from R&D to being responsible for the European market. I established the sales and marketing operations in Europe, which was a busy and challenging task.
We also emphasized the importance of partnerships. We sought partners who understood the technology and product, the enduring partnerships we built over more than 10 years have been instrumental in our growth in Europe. Building localized teams that understand the specific needs of each country has been crucial. We have worked closely with our partners and ensured they possess the necessary expertise to support local customers effectively. By combining superior products, strong partnerships, local support, and a passion for serving customers, we have achieved success in Europe.
Guoguang Chen: Safety is a critical consideration across all scenarios. We recently published a White Paper in collaboration with TUV to enhance product safety and reliability. With the increase in PV module power, larger inverter power sizes, and doubled current, ensuring physical safety has become even more important.
In the commercial and industrial (C&I) sector, where PV is installed on rooftops, higher voltages increase the risk for people, and the potential for short-circuits can lead to fires and disasters. Therefore, continuous improvement in safety measures is essential. High-level arc detection and DC rapid shutdown should be defined within standards, made mandatory, and applied in all countries to ensure the safety of PV installations. Only when we can guarantee safety can the PV industry grow without limitations.
PV technology is evolving rapidly, with significant increases in module power and the emergence of decentralized PV within a short span of time. It is crucial to upgrade safety measures and address the challenges that arise while promoting health and quality development in the industry.
Guoguang Chen: We anticipate significant growth in the PV and storage market this year. Last year, solar installations reached around 280-300 GW globally, and storage installations reached approximately 40 GWh. This year, we expect solar installations to increase by another 100 GW, reaching around 450 GW. We also anticipate storage installations to grow to about 60 GWh, a 50% increase from the previous year.
As more renewable energy sources are integrated into the grid, batteries are being deployed to provide grid support and stability. We have already seen successful deployments of storage systems alongside wind farms in the Netherlands, and we expect this trend to continue in more locations.
There is also potential for retrofitting older plants with storage, both large and small, to enhance grid stability and support. However, to achieve this, grid-forming technology is crucial. While we don't see it becoming mandatory, we believe it is essential to work with distribution system operators (DSOs) to develop policies that support the deployment of grid-forming technology. This will enable the storage of more renewables and support countries achieve their carbon targets without the need for extensive grid reconstruction.
Guoguang Chen: Grid-forming technology is still evolving and will take time to reach maturity. We currently see its application in off-grid scenarios and major projects like the Red Sea project in Saudi Arabia. We expect to see its adoption in residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) sectors as well. However, utility-scale projects may face more challenges due to their scale and complex technological requirements. To achieve innovation and advancements in this area, we need to see large-scale projects taking more risks and being brave in implementing new technologies.
Guoguang Chen: We have been using the FusionSolar brand since around 2015. The name “FusionSolar” represents the convergence of solar PV and the idea that all energy sources originate from the sun. It aligns with our commitment to utilizing solar energy efficiently through quality and technological innovation.
As for our slogan, “Making the Most of Every Ray,” It resonated well with our vision and connected with people's emotions. My idea was to go for a high-profile slogan, but a certain person in our group had, in the end, a better idea, which was to make a connection to people’s emotions.
From the beginning, we are thinking about utilizing everything from the sun through both technology and quality, and creating more value by innovating to convert solar energy in a highly efficient way.
Guoguang Chen: From our perspective, we don't see any significant obstacles in the market. The PV industry has matured in terms of technology, and we have a clear roadmap for further improving efficiency and optimizing costs. While the industry has made significant progress, it has only penetrated deeply into around 30 countries. There are still more than 200 countries where the industry can thrive and drive economic growth. Grid-forming technology can address many challenges, supporting the transition to renewable energy in these countries. Overall, we see tremendous opportunities rather than obstacles.
Guoguang Chen: At Huawei, we have a comprehensive product roadmap, and we have already unveiled new products during Intersolar week. For the utility sector, our focus is on grid-forming technology, which can play a crucial role in achieving a renewable energy mix of 60%.
In the commercial and industrial sector, we aim to enhance our products and provide a one-stop-shop solution, including hardware, software, and energy management solutions. Each industry has its unique requirements, and we strive to meet those demands through continuous improvement and innovation.
For the residential sector, our target is to offer complete solutions that enable consumers to achieve near 100% self-consumption. We have already implemented successful projects, such as one in Spain, where a combination of PV and battery systems achieved close to 100% self-consumption.
Overall, we balance our vision for the future with customer demands by closely listening to our customers' needs and aligning our product development and innovation strategies accordingly.

The system is expected to replace traditional electrical boilers and is aimed at decoupling energy production and demand. The scientists said the novelty of their approach consists of creating two levels of thermal energy storage, in order to utilize the full potential of the PV system.
“A first storage level is provided by a large centralized water tank which is equipped with a programmable control system to use the water tanks as a buffer and let the heat pump operate under desirable conditions,” they explained. “The second level of energy storage is provided by innovative slim and modular decentralized tanks, called hereafter e-TANKs, devoted to DHW production and storage, providing a higher thermal efficiency and, at the same time, a greater users autonomy through local storages installed in each dwelling.”
The e-TANK consists of a water tank and a hydronic module designed by Austrian specialist Pink GmbH. Both components are wall-mounted on a steel frame. The tank is also equipped with an internal helical heat exchanger that is linked to a 2-pipe hot water network. This network can be used either for the charging of DHW storage tanks or for heating purposes. It can work at high temperatures during charging periods during the day. It has lower heat losses from the piping network and lower consumption of circulating pumps compared to conventional boilers. 
Through the TRNSYS software, which is used to simulate the behavior of transient renewable systems, the research group simulated the proposed system configuration in a residential building located in Catania, Sicily, southern Italy, and assumed it could be powered by a 13.5 kW PV system made of 36 monocrystalline modules.
The electricity produced by the PV array could be either by a reversible air-to-water system, with a heating capacity of 26.0 kW and a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.10, or stored in a 20 kWh battery. “The maximum water temperature supplied by the heat pump is equal to 65 °C for the outdoor temperature between 5 C and 19 C,” the researchers said.
The academics compared the energy performance of the proposed retrofit solution with that of the existing system in the pilot building and found that the system achieved a “desirable” thermal performance in both the charging and discharging processes.
“The result obtained through dynamic simulations indicated that the e-TANK system reduces the annual energy consumption for DHW production more than 7,200 kWh, compared to the current DHW system,” they explained. “It was shown that a typical centralized system requires about 11 times higher electrical energy for the circulating pump than the e-TANK solution.”
They also found that, over a 20-year period, the new solution has a 6.1% lower life cycle cost (LCC) compared to traditional boilers. “Furthermore, it was turned out that applying the proposed PV-BESS system for electricity generation reduces 7.1 MWh/yr the required primary energy, compared to the case that the electricity is provided by the grid,” they stressed.
The team presented the new solution in the paper “Techno-economic analysis of a novel retrofit solution for the domestic hot water system: A comparative study,” published in Energy Conversion and Management. “The outcomes of the present study for the pilot building are expected to be extended to a significant portion of the existing European building stock,” it concluded.

Australian clean energy investor Pollination has revealed that it will build a 900 MW solar farm as part of the proposed AUD 3 billion ($2.05 billion) East Kimberley Clean Energy Project. It says the installation will be Australia’s first 100% renewable energy hydrogen and ammonia production hub.
The project, which is being developed near the town of Kununurra, is expected to commence operations in 2028. It will target 50,000 tons of green hydrogen and 250,000 tons of green ammonia per annum for domestic and export markets.
The East Kimberley Clean Energy Project will be planned, created and managed by the Aboriginal Clean Energy (ACE) partnership, a new company in which equal shares are held by the traditional owners of the land where the project is to be built.
MG Corp., representing the Miriuwung and Gajerron people, and Balanggarra Aboriginal Corp. will each own a 25% stake in the ACE, as will the Kimberley Land Council and Pollination. Rob Grant, head of projects at Pollination, said the “first-of-its-kind partnership” provides a model for infrastructure projects in Australia that will ensure traditional owners benefit from the scale and pace of the transition to renewable energy.
“This project represents a just, ambitious and achievable vision for Australia’s clean energy future,” he said. “It leverages natural advantages and existing energy and port infrastructure already in place in the East Kimberley region to create a major new clean energy export hub that will help Australia and our region decarbonise, grow new industries and ensure transitional owners and local residents are shareholders, not just stakeholders, in the benefits.”
Grant said the involvement of the traditional owner groups directly in the project also offers attractive prospects to investors by mitigating risks associated with land use agreements and approvals.
The first stage of the project will involve building a 900 MW solar farm – more than double the size of the country’s biggest so far built – and a 50,000 tons per year green hydrogen plant on MG Corp. freehold land near Kununurra.
The resulting solar energy will be combined with fresh water from Lake Kununurra and hydro energy from the existing Ord Hydro Power Plant at Lake Argyle to produce green hydrogen that will then be transported through a new pipeline to the “export ready” port of Wyndham. There it will be converted into green ammonia. About 250,000 tons of green ammonia will be produced every year for both domestic and export markets in the fertilizers and explosives sectors.
While the project’s feasibility and funding are still pending, construction is expected to begin in late 2025, with hydrogen production starting by late 2028. Grant said scoping studies have already been completed to define the project concept, and feasibility studies will now commence, including 12 months of environmental, engineering and approvals work.

“This technology is inexpensive as it is silicon-based and uses the same processes used for terrestrial cells such as TOPCon devices relying on silicon oxide passivating contacts,” the research's lead author, Paul Stradins, told pv magazine. “The module is composed of poly-Si/SiO2 passivated contact minicells. These minicells offer remarkably low contact resistance, suitable for high suns operation.”
In the paper “High-voltage monocrystalline Si photovoltaic minimodules based on poly-Si/SiOx passivating contacts for high-power laser power conversion,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the scientists explained that the panel may be used, for example, in applications such as wireless data transmission in special environments or energy transmission in medical implants, among others.
The multijunction mini panel is designed with silicon oxide (poly-Si/SiOx) passivated contacts using a very thin SiOx layer of approximately 1.5 nm. These passivated contacts are used to build minicells that reportedly offer remarkably low contact resistance, suitable for high suns operation. The minicells are put “on edge” and packed into the modules.
“These minicells can be composed into micromodules by simply mechanical stacking,” said Stradins. “We used 10 cells, but it can be any number. Thus, the voltages of these micromodules can be high, while currents are kept low.”
In the solar module, the direct contact of the metal from one cell to the next allows for electricity to flow freely between them, with the large area of contact limiting series resistance. Light penetrates vertically through the narrow edge of the device and current is collected laterally through the large-area p- and n-type passivating contacts.
According to the researchers, this architecture allows the cell current to be collected over the whole “side” area of a minicell, which is considerably larger than the light entry area. “These 10- or more minicell stacks can be assembled into any size larger power beaming conversion module,” Stradins further explained. “There is no size limitation, can be meters if necessary, with cooling, tabbing, and power electronics on the backside.”
The research group tested the module at an illumination of around 1000 nm and found its photoconversion efficiency exceeded 40% and the open-circuit voltage surpassed 7 V. The fill factor was around 78%. “Based on current device results, it is expected that power transfer of 25 W could be obtained for a 10 cm2 module with a 12 kW laser source at a distance of 1 km,” the academics said.
 According to Stradins, the minicells are made without any expensive lithography. “We use mechanically aligned masks for all deposition steps, which are easily made using ns laser scriber,” he said. “The minicells also are produced by the same laser scriber process. They remain attached to the wafer and processed as a whole wafer, for all steps including final metallization. Only then they are detached and assembled into a micromodule. All this can be automated in a production line.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/18/nrel-develops-bifacial-perovskite-solar-cells-with-93-bifaciality/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 18, 2023",NREL develops perovskite solar cells with 93% bifaciality,"From pv magazine USA
Research by NREL on bifacial perovskite solar cells has resulted in bifaciality of 91% to 93%, leading it to conclude that bifacial perovskites could be a preferable pathway for a lower levelized cost of electricity. It published the results in Joule.
Perovskites hold promise because of their low production costs, and their thinness allows them to be deposited on most surfaces. While challenges remain with the stability and longevity of perovskites, new efficiency records have been achieved month after month in recent years.
Past iterations of bifacial perovskites have struggled to keep up with monofacial cells, which currently have a record efficiency of 26%. Bifacial cells are also more expensive to produce than their single-face counterparts. The NREL researchers noted that for the technology to compete, a bifacial cell should have a front-side efficiency close to the best-performing monofacial cell, and that the bifaciality rating should be close to 100% of the front-side efficiency.
In the newly produced single-junction NREL bifacial cell, an efficiency of 23% was recorded on the front, with the back side achieving a bifaciality of 91% to 93% of that efficiency level. The research team said that bifacial cells could generate 10% to 20% more power than single-face cells.
Before constructing the record-breaking cell, researchers used optical and electrical simulations to determine the ideal thickness. The front layer had to be thick enough to absorb most of the photons from a certain part of the solar spectrum, but a perovskite layer that is too thick can block the photons.
On the back of the cell, the NREL team had to determine the ideal thickness of the rear electrode to minimize resistive loss. The team noted the balance between the resistive and optical losses needs to be considered. The transparent oxide rear electrode needs to be sufficiently thick to minimize the resistive loss, but it also needs to be sufficiently thin to minimize parasitic absorption.
The research team found that an ideal thickness for a perovskite layer is around 850 nanometers, which is incredibly thin. For reference, a human hair is roughly 70,000 nanometers thick.
Albedo, or the reflectivity of the surface beneath the solar cell, impacts the output of the backside perovskites. The bifacial output power was measured at 28.5 mW per square centimeter with an albedo of 0.3 and 30.1 mW per square centimeter for an albedo of 0.5.
This research was funded by the US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office.

The Brazilian government, led by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, relaunched the Minha Casa Minha Vida (My House, My Life) social housing program this week. Originally launched by Lula’s government between 2003 and 2011, the program was discontinued by Jair Bolsonaro’s government.
Like the previous versions, the new program includes the deployment of PV systems on a large scale. The scheme aims to build 2 million new social housing units by 2026 and deploy two solar modules in each home, providing 1 kW of power per dwelling.
According to figures released by Brazilian PV association ABSolar, the program could lead to the installation of 2 GW of solar distributed generation, reducing electricity bills for families by 70%. The program will serve families with a monthly income of up to BRL 8,000 ($1,660) in urban areas and up to BRL 96,000 per year in rural areas.
In June, the Chamber of Deputies approved a new version of the scheme, allowing funds from the Severance Indemnity Fund (FGTS) to be used for public lighting, basic sanitation, public roads, and rainwater drainage projects.
