The result is claimed to be, by the company, the highest efficiency ever reported for any large, polymer film-based perovskite photovoltaic module to date.
The device was fabricated through a one-step coating method that uses improved ink, film drying processes, and production equipment to form a uniform perovskite layer. The process is said to halve the steps for deposition of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. The coating speed is said to reach six meters per minute on a 5×5 cm2 module, which the company defined as a rate that meets requirements for mass production.
Toshiba had previously developed a two-step coating process that first applied a layer of lead iodide (PbI2) ink to a substrate, followed by a layer of methyammonium iodide (MAI) which formed the MAPbI3 layer. “However, this multi-step approach had a low coating rate and often left unreacted sections in the perovskite layer,” it further explained. “The alternative is a one-step process that applies MAPbI3 ink directly.”
Toshiba’s printing technology for the production of film-based perovskite solar cell modules involves forming the substrate with a resin film, such as polyethylene terephthalate. It uses a planar inverted structure that can be produced at a temperature below 150 degrees Celsius for the cell structure. The company managed to form a uniform thin layer of methylammonium lead iodide by utilizing a meniscus printing technology that it developed by conducting research on organic thin-film solar cells. It said that this improves the efficiency of panels by lowering the degree to which the cells vary from each other. 
The flexible and lightweight panel is indicated by Toshiba as suitable for locations where it is difficult to install conventional crystalline silicon modules, such as low-load-bearing roofs and office windows. “Toshiba estimates that the new perovskite photovoltaic modules would generate power equivalent to two-thirds of the annual power consumption by homes in Tokyo if installed on a roof area of 164.9km2, roughly equal to the roof surface area of all buildings in Tokyo,” the manufacturer further explained.
Looking forward, the company said it wants to enlarge the module area to 900cm2 and to achieve efficiency close to 20%. “Achieving these targets will cut the manufacturing cost of perovskite photovoltaic modules to approximately $0.14/W,” it concluded.

The EU executive said on Tuesday it had drawn up a green bond framework verified by a third-party to reassure investors their cash would go to climate change-related projects, and added the first of a planned €80 billion worth of green bonds would be offered to investors in October.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The bloc has budgeted for an €800 billion ‘NextGenerationEU' Covid recovery package to the end of 2026, including a €724 billion ‘recovery and resilience facility‘ (RRF) which will disburse grants and loans to member states, and of which at least 37% must be devoted to green spending.
The EU has committed to having 30% of the bonds it issues to finance its recovery plans fall under the ‘green' definition and, having raised €35 billion in June by launching four oversubscribed instruments, it has signaled the sustainability-linked packages will begin to be auctioned next month.
With the bloc intending to raise around €150 billion per year from next year onwards, this year's finance will be generated by €80 billion worth of bonds, topped up by “tens of billions of euros of short-term EU-bills,” with auctions for the latter to begin on Wednesday, and then to ‘typically' be held on the first and third Wednesdays of the month. The plan is to auction bonds monthly “in general,” the commission said on Tuesday, and to offer syndications with the same regularity. Syndications will offer groups of lenders unable to sign up individually to provide the large sums of credit required, to do so collectively.
The commission has already approved the RRF plans submitted by numerous member states and has distributed several ‘pre-financing' sums to provide nations with 13% of their total grant and loan packages.
The latest member state to benefit was Cyprus, with the commission today announcing the release of its 13% – €157 million – of a total 2021-27 package of €1 billion in EU grants plus €200 million worth of loans. Cyprus has earmarked €89 million of its full RRF package for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects.

All-back contact (ABC) cell architectures – where both the electron transport layer and the hole transport are deposited on the rear side of the cell – have shown performance advantages in silicon PV, though increased processing costs compared to other silicon cell types mean they are only a niche product in rooftop PV markets.
A group of scientists led by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) decided to test the ABC structure in perovskite devices, reasoning firstly that the absence of a front contact layer can increase efficiency by allowing more light to reach the perovskite layer, secondly that they open up new possibilities for front side passivation and encapsulation – potentially improving device stability, and finally that they allow for the use of in-situ techniques to analyze the device during operation.
The group noted, however, that having both layers on the same side also comes with a host of challenges. They were able to fabricate ABC perovskite cells with an efficiency of just over 10%, representing a significant improvement over the previous 4.4% achieved in October 2020. Focusing on the interface between transport layers was key to this, a process of UV ozone exposure followed by annealing at 300 Celsius degrees was shown to both reduce defect density in the hole transport layer, and remove contaminants from the electron transport layer, increasing voltage, and current collection.
After fabricating the cells, the group used sophisticated imaging and modeling techniques to find out where the performance losses occur and how they could be prevented, with this they were able to provide a pathway to achieving efficiencies beyond the 20% mark. The work is described in full in the paper Complementary interface formation toward high-efficiency all-back-contact perovskite solar cells, published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
Modelling suggests that focus on defects at the layer interfaces, the work function of the hole selective contact, and frontside passivation will be the best strategies to bring ABC cell efficiencies to 20% or better.

The developer, ultimately controlled by solar panel glassmaker Xinyi Solar Holdings, posted a first-half update in Hong Kong yesterday which stated its directors had not found bond or other financial market investments attractive enough during the first half of the year, so the company is set to bet on more project acquisitions instead.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
Xinyi Energy explained it still had the billion or so in the bank following a shares issuance in May 2019 which raised a net HK$3.76 billion (US$484 million). The company had spent HK$2.04 billion to help it acquire solar projects that year and used a further HK$386 million (US$49.6 million) for working capital and refinancing loans. By pv magazine‘s rough calculation, that would leave an unspent balance of HK$1.33 billion (US$171 million) or so, but Xinyi Energy put the figure at around HK$294 million (US$37.8 million) lower.
Regardless, the developer in August announced it may devote the entire cash pile to acquiring more projects and its latest update spells out why, with Xinyi Energy reporting the 340 MW of generation capacity it bought last year had added HK$91 million (US$11.7 million) to first-half returns of HK$1.11 billion (US$143 million), up 30% from the HK$853 million (US$110 million) revenue posted in the first six months of last year.
That added up to a net profit for the shareholders of HK$621 million (US$79.9 million), up 42%, year on year, from HK$438 million (US$56.3 million).
Xinyi Energy acquired three solar farms with a total generation capacity of 250 MW from controlling shareholder Xinyi Solar in the second quarter and will add another three (270 MW) in the final three months of the year. With another 80 MW added from an unrelated party during the first half, and Xinyi Energy eyeing 100 MW of grid-parity, unsubsidized projects by year end, the developer says it will add at least 700 MW of PV projects this year.
Unlike rival Chinese developers, who have dutifully toed the policy line by extolling the ultimate race-to-net-zero benefits of projects developed without subsidy, Xinyi Energy put a more pragmatic spin on the move away from subsidy, explaining it will ensure no big mismatches in its accounts as the result of waiting for long overdue payments from Beijing.
The spending spree has had an effect on the bottom line, however, with Xinyi Energy's current bank borrowings rising from HK$1.2 billion, at the end of last year, to HK$1.38 billion six months later. Non current borrowings more than trebled, from HK$653 million to HK$2.12 billion, and cash fell from HK$1.36 billion at the end of December, to HK$803 million.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/09/brazil-may-add-another-20-gw-of-distributed-solar-by-2030-government-agency-says/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,BRAZIL",LÍVIA NEVES,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021","Brazil may add another 20 GW of distributed solar by 2030, government agency says","From pv magazine Latam
Brazil may reach an installed PV capacity of 26 GW for distributed generation PV systems – which in the country includes all installations not exceeding 5 MW in size under the net metering regime – by the end of this decade.
This is one of the main conclusions of a report from the state-run Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica (EPE) agency, in which it simulated five growth scenarios for solar distributed generation which predicts between 23 and 42 GW of new capacity may be deployed by 2030. In the reference scenario, EPE projects 26 GW installed in 2031, including the 6 GW that are currently online. In other words, the most probable scenario is that DG will add approximately 20 GW of capacity in ten years.
EPE also expects that centralized solar power plants, which are all solar parks exceeding 5 MW in size, will reach a cumulative capacity of 8.4 GW by 2030, from around 3.8 GW, currently. These figures, however, do not include unsubsidized large scale PV projects under power purchase agreements that, according to a recent report from Brazilian consultancy Greener, are becoming increasingly important in the Brazilian energy market.
According to the energy regulator, Aneel, there are 24.7 GW of centralized solar plants under development in Brazil and, of these, 23.3 GW are outside the auction mechanism.
The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies has recently approved bill 5829/19, which creates the new regulatory framework for distributed generation. The law is now being discussed by the senate and the expectation is that the law will be promulgated in 2021, giving more predictability and legal certainty for the sector. The project began to be discussed in 2019 and, after many negotiations, the current version was reached with general consensus – the approval was almost unanimous, with 476 votes in favor and three against. “There was a lot of negotiation, a lot of dialogue, we all had to give in a little but, with this, we reached a consensus,” Rodrigo Sauaia, CEO of Brazilian solar energy association ABSOLAR, told pv magazine.
One of the scenarios outlined by EPE was based on the changes in the compensation system for the country's net metering scheme brought by the bill. In this projection, distributed generation would reach 36 GW of capacity in 2031, and solar would represent 90% of this capacity. This scenario, however, has some differences in relation to the text that was approved in the House of Representatives.
According to PL 5829, distributed generation systems already installed, or those that have a grid-connection approval issued within the 12 months following the enactment of the law, will remain under current regulations until December 31, 2045. That is, they will continue to discount the energy credits of their systems in all the installments that make up the energy tariff.
For new consumers with distributed generation, the part of the tariff that remunerates distributors will begin to be paid (it cannot be compensated with credits) gradually, until its entirety, in 2029. The so-called package B, which remunerates services and assets of the distributors, corresponds to approximately 17% of the energy tariff. Consumers with distributed generation will have to pay 15% of this tariff from 2023; 30% from 2024; 45% from 2025; 60% from 2026; 75% from 2027; and 90% from 2028.
The possibility of electricity companies contracting power from the owners of distributed generation (DG) systems – which encompass systems up to 30 MW in size – would boost the new ‘large DG' segment. At the end of August, Aneel closed a public consultation on the contract model for energy distributors to contract the auxiliary services of distributed generation plants of up to 30 MW.
In theory, distributors could contract energy from distributed generation since 2015. But only in 2018 were specific pricing criteria defined for each source. The contractual model remained to be defined and must be announced by Aneel based on the contributions received during the public hearing. “Now the game has started,” said Sauaia.
Brazilian energy firm Copel (Companhia Paranaense de Energia), which operates in the southern state of Paraná, has already been authorized for a pilot project in which it can contract distributed generation to test the operation of micro grids. With the publication of the reference contract model, more distributors will be able to join it and publish their own tenders. “It is not a mandatory purchase, but we know that distributors in the southern and southeastern regions are studying it carefully,” said Sauaia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/09/the-worlds-largest-solar-power-plants/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",The world’s largest solar power plants,"A solar PV plant is an individual generating station, designed by a single developer (or consortium) and usually with a single export connection to the grid. It may in some cases be configured on several nearby plots of land and/or constructed across multiple phases. This article looks at the largest of these individual solar power stations, highlighting those over 500 MW, and showing in brackets where it stood in the list published in 2019.
In some places, solar plants are grouped together in solar parks or clusters, leading to even higher capacities. As described in the introduction, these will be covered in later articles.
China recaptures the number one position this year with the 2,200 MWAC solar power plant commissioned last September by Huanghe Hydro­power Developments. It covers over 5,000 hectares of semi-desert in Gonghe County of the Hainan Prefecture in Qinghai, China.
Just visible to the east in this picture is the Longyangxia Solar-Hydro Project (3). This plant has been expanded over seven years and now covers such a huge area (220 km2) that I will list it with the solar parks in the next article, although it arguably meets my definition of a solar plant.
This 938 MWAC plant in Abu Dhabi in the UAE became the world’s largest single solar power station when commis­sioned in June 2019 – a position it held for 15 months.
The development led by Marubeni and JinkoSolar was built by Sterling & Wilson using a pitched structure with arrays totalling 1,177 MWP at a shallow angle oriented towards east and west. As this aerial view of the plant shows, this configuration achieves a very high packing density on the 800 Ha site.
The UAE will also feature prominently in the solar parks list with Dubai’s multi-gigawatt development.

2019’s number one is third in today’s list – the so-called Yanchi Solar Park just south of Gaoshawo in Ninxia’s Yanchi district. Despite the name, it is not a ‘solar park’, as we would define it. The project was developed by China Minsheng New Energy and has been operational since 2016. Its 1 GWP solar arrays give it an output of about 820 MWAC.
 
 
The USA’s highest entry this time is at #4 (it’s highest at #6 in the previous list, Solar Star, is now down to #10). One of the U.S.’ earliest utility-scale solar plants, phase one of the Copper Mountain project was first connected by Sempra Energy back in 2010. When the southernmost phase five was commissioned this March, it took the total capacity of the plant to 816 MW.
Located in Nevada’s Eldorado Valley between Boulder City and Searchlight, not far south-east from Las Vegas, it surrounds Acciona’s Nevada Solar One CSP project (outlined in red).
 
In China’s Shanxi Province, another 1 GWP project has been installed in Datong district, as part of China’s demonstration program for projects at this scale. The solar array is distributed on hilltops over a wide area, making them hard to pick out on satellite images.
Another project of similar size is located around Ili in Xinjiang, but is spread over such a wide area, I have not included it as a single plant in this list. Nor do I include a further GWP project portfolio being developed around Alashan in Inner Mongolia.
Spain leaps into this list at #6 with ACS Group’s 850 MWP project covering a total of almost 1,900 hectares divided between three municipalities in Zaragoza. It was commis­sioned in stages during 2020.
The plant, which delivers 730 MWAC is owned by Galp, a Portuguese energy company.
 
Enel Green Power’s Villanueva project in Mexico has been expanded from 640 MW since our 2019 list, to leapfrog over the Kamuthi project.
The plant is located in Coahuila state and is one of several projects in this list to use horizontal single-axis trackers. It is therefore relatively less dense, covering an area of just over 2,600 hectares.
 
India’s top stand-alone plant has now slipped down to #8, although the country will feature more prominently in the forthcoming solar parks list.
The plant was built in 2016 by Adani covering nearly 1,200 hectares in the State of Tamil Nadu, and has an AC capacity of 648 MW.
 
 

Another Indian plant – located further north in Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan – is a new entry to the list with a capacity of 600 MW. It is one of a series of projects contracted by tender to supply power directly into India’s Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS).
The PV project, which spans the communities of Lawan and Purohitsar in Pokhran, was connected recently by SB Energy, the company acquired earlier this year from Japan’s Softbank by Adani.
 
Now the USA’s second-largest solar plant, Solar Star covers multiple sites in California’s Antelope Valley.
The plant was constructed in two phases in 2013-2014 using Sunpower Corporation modules. It has a total capacity of 585 MW and is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group.
Back to China for plant #11, this multi-phase project is clustered in an area of semi-desert around Hongshagangzhen in Gansu province.
It is being built by China Singyes, with at least 574 MW now operational, and an eventual capacity of 820 MW.
The USA’s third plant in this list at 550 MW, Topaz was briefly the country’s largest plant when commissioned in November 2014.
Developed by First Solar, it is built on multiple sites totaling nearly 1,400 hectares in Carrisa Plains in central California. Coincidentally this incorporates the site where the world’s first multi-megawatt solar project was built in the 1980s (outlined in white on this image).
 
 
We go to Brazil for the first South American project to reach this list of the world’s largest solar plants. But it is the second entry in Latin America for Italy’s Enel Green Energy.
The plant near São Gonçalo do Gurguéia in the State of Piauí is being constructed in three phases with an eventual capacity of 765 MW. When phase II was completed in February this year, the capacity reached 549 MW.
The plant uses bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers, and currently covers about 1,300 hectares.
 

The last of the ½ GW+ solar plants is a conglomeration of hillside arrays In the valleys to the east of Ninxia’s capital Yinchuan. The Yinchuan Xinqing project has a total capacity of about 500 MW and was installed in mid-2018.
Just below our cutoff, with a present capacity of 480 MWAC, is Vietnam’s largest plant at Ea Súp in Đắk Lắk Province. This is due to be expanded, so may join this list in the future.
Other large projects in development may lead to Australia, Saudi Arabia, Chile, France, and Texas, amongst others, joining soon.

Chief technology officer Wang Shitao told visitors to a completion ceremony, the new laboratory will test the effect of wind on trackers at speeds of up to 30m per second. With the wind tunnel scaled at 1:30, Wang said, 30m/sec equates to 90m/sec, a speed which would cover most likely real-world scenarios.
Wang, who is also convenor of tracker safety standard IEC TC82 WG7, said there are five stages of wind test. The stage I, static and stage II, dynamic levels test mainly wind resistance design. The stage III, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and stage IV, aeroelastic levels test system stability, and the final level – referred to as AeroPlus by Arctech – examines strength and stability.
The 142m tunnel, which is 48m wide, occupies an entire factory building.
Arctech said Harbin Institute of Technology had helped with construction of the facility “due to its rich experience in wind tunnel testing and R&D of space structures” and Colorado-based engineer CPP Wind has also assisted the project.
The tunnel will initially be focused on R&D for trackers such as those destined for complex climatic environments and Arctech senior VP Rong Gang said it will help the company better answer questions from overseas customers about project design.
Arctech said the facility may also be offered up for use by third party organizations.

The three manufacturers agreed that 54-cell panels will have to measure 1,722×1,134mm and have a mounting hole spacing of 1,400mm and that 72-cell products must have a size of 2,278×1,134mm and the same mounting hole spacing as 54-cell modules. Furthermore, they agreed that 78-cell panels will have to measure 2,465×1,134mm and have a mounting hole spacing ranging from 400mm to 1,500mm.
“Since the joint launch of the M10-type wafer standard by JA Solar, Jinko Solar and Longi Solar, in June 2020, the wafer size has been gaining widespread recognition and acceptance in the PV industry,” the statement reads. “However, due to the differences in the technical roadmap, design concept and installation mode followed by different manufacturers, the standards of the same type of modules vary in their lengths, widths and mounting hole spacings despite being based on the same M10 wafer technology.”
The new parameters are aimed at standardizing component specifications to reduce manufacturing costs and simplify design and installation in the downstream business, the three companies stated.
In mid-June, they jointly published a white paper intended to show what they believe are the advantages for developers of large scale PV projects of using photovoltaic modules manufactured with M10, 182mm wafers. In November 2020, the three manufacturers stated their combined production capacity of PV panels based on 182mm wafers would reach 54 GW in 2021.
The three manufacturers emphasized the increasing reliability risks associated with larger and more powerful products and reiterated the well-known saying “bigger is not always better,” heard in recent months from all those companies that decided not to bet on 210mm wafers and modules with a power output exceeding 600 W.

The United States maintained its position as the largest tracker market in 2020, with Brazil, Chile, China, and Spain making up the top five, and each recording significant year-on-year growth.
Growth of solar trackers is driven by the increasing demand from global economies for renewable energy, and the resulting rapid deployment of solar. Trackers further enable project developers in some markets to reduce the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), enabling increased revenue potential while supporting success in competitive auctions and tenders.
The supplier landscape continued to be extremely competitive last year, with several suppliers shifting position, such as previously unranked FTC Solar entering the top 10. The top two suppliers, Nextracker and Array Technologies, maintained their ranking positions, but several other major players – including PVH, STI Norland and Gamechange Solar and – moved up the rankings as they gained market share in key solar tracker markets.
The United States saw the largest year-on-year increase for tracker shipments in 2020, boosted by trackers procured to meet safe harbor requirements prior to the expected step down of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC). As the expected ITC step down in 2021 has been extended to 2023, suppliers with a strong U.S. presence, such as Nextracker, Array Technologies, Gamechange Solar, FTC Solar and PVH, will continue to benefit from this policy.
Latin American markets such as Brazil, Chile and Mexico grew in 2020, with STI Norland taking the largest share of the Brazilian market, supporting its climb in this year’s ranking. Soltec increased its market share significantly in Chile, while the European market was dominated by PVH, supported by having the largest share of the Spanish market, which made up the majority of European tracker shipments. Middle Eastern markets were dominated by suppliers to large-scale solar PV projects, such as an 800 MW installation in Qatar awarded to Ideematec. African markets remain modest, but with significant growth expected over the coming years.
The Asia-Pacific market is split in two. Australia represents a strong market for U.S.-based suppliers, while other regions, such as China and India, remain heavily influenced by Chinese and other local suppliers, namely Arctech Solar. However, Western suppliers have made inroads into India and suppliers such as Gamechange Solar had a strong presence in the Indian market in 2020.
Despite these gains, multiple suppliers have dropped down the rankings, in large part due to loss of market share in key markets and a continued competitive landscape. Other suppliers, such as Solar Steel and Convert Italia, have been relegated from the 2020 rankings, but have made recent announcements that indicate strong potential for resurgence in 2021 and onwards.
Revenues rising
North America, mainly the United States, will remain the largest tracker region globally in the forecast period, but the Asia-Pacific region will move up to second for tracker installations, driven by the huge growth of PV installations in China and India over the forecast period. This growth is driven by significant government renewable energy targets, supported by increasingly competitive auction processes, which will push developers to seek lower LCOE.
Additional growth potential exists for global suppliers in both mainland China and India, as these markets are currently dominated by Arctech Solar. Other local suppliers exist in both markets, with Trinatracker and Nengyao (formerly Kingsun Solar) representing strong challengers in the Chinese market. Gamechange Solar recently announced an office in India, cementing itself as one of the only global suppliers present in the region and a definite contender in India.
Steady tracker installation gains are expected across European, Middle Eastern and African markets through to 2025, driven by increasing solar PV installations, but installations in Latin America are expected to plateau toward the latter part of the forecast. Modest uptake of trackers will occur in European markets such as Greece, Italy, and Portugal, while significant growth is expected in South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Other growth regions include North Africa, Oman, Qatar, Jordan, and Israel.
Product innovation
Despite these clear opportunities over the coming years, the top suppliers will be challenged to hold their positions as smaller suppliers continue to grow in emerging markets and increasingly compete in established markets. This shifting landscape is aided by ever changing PV developer demands and requirements, such as the need to push into regions with harsher terrain and climatic conditions.
While cost and performance will always remain key requirements for PV developers, tracker product reliability and adaptability are becoming increasingly important for developers as flat open land becomes increasingly scarce and costly. Tracker products will be chosen based on proven ability to operate under harsh weather conditions, such as high wind and snow loads, and suitability for installation on rugged or sloped terrain.
This effectively creates a window of opportunity for innovative suppliers to promote their specific product strengths against competitors, utilizing emerging tracker technologies such as two-in-portrait configurations, dual-row configurations, advanced control software, and features which increase stability under high winds, thus enabling them to gain a foothold across global markets over the coming years.
The development of artificial intelligence-based software, which enables increased energy yields through optimization of tracker operations, is proving to be a priority among tracker suppliers as a means to achieve a competitive advantage. Many suppliers, including Nextracker, Array Technologies, PV Hardware and Soltec, have been promoting the use of software to distinguish themselves from competitors and help developers and grid operators make solar a more predictable and reliable source of energy.

They claim that the model allows for better energy yields than the two technologies can achieve separately, with additional financial and environmental advantages.
“The model is applicable to any region, it should just include different data such as different wind and solar potential data and different energy demands such as heating for comfort purposes, for example, which is not a reality for tropical regions,” Monica Carvalho, a researcher for the Center of Alternative and Renewable Energy at the Federal University of Paraíba, told pv magazine.
The proposed mathematical model is designed to determine the topology and main equipment of a highly complex system featuring wind turbines and PV modules, but also solar collectors, fuel lines, gas boilers, engine-generator sets, recovery boilers, and absorption and compression chillers, as well as grid electricity.
The model uses solar radiation and wind speed data from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) and collects data on PV power generation, It assumes the use of a 275 W SA275-60P solar module made by Taiwanese manufacturer URE Corp., formerly known as Neo Solar Power. It also considers all the electricity generated by the solar panels and the wind turbine for every month of the year.
“The optimization model allows the purchase of electricity and fuel from the corresponding electric and fuel grids and the export of surplus electricity from renewable energy sources to the electric grid,” the research team said, referring to the possibility of exporting excess power for renewable energy generators under Brazil's net metering scheme.
The optimization method can evaluate how each piece of equipment operates hour by hour and throughout the day and the year. The solar thermal collector has an estimated cost of $414.50/m and the photovoltaic system has been valued at $1,776/kW. The researchers also estimated the cost of a wind turbine at $770/kW and a gas boiler at $90/kW.
The costs of engine-generator sets and recovery boilers have been estimated at $500/kW and $200/kW, respectively, and that of the absorption and compression chillers at $516/kW and $400/kW, respectively. The natural gas tariff was assumed to be $0.476/m3.
“The success of the system does not depends exclusively on gas prices but also on climate data and electricity tariffs, as well as on the hourly-seasonal energy demands,” Carvalho explained.
The model works through four different steps: the pre-selection of the equipment, the configuration of all possible equipment combinations, the operational optimization of each configuration, and the identification of the lowest net present value of all configurations.
“Once a specific project or configuration is installed, that configuration can be subject to fluctuation in tariffs,” the Brazilian group said. “Therefore, knowledge of the historical behavior of tariff variations is essential to analyze how the optimal system can behave throughout its lifetime.”
Through this methodology, the academics found that a system based on renewable energy with minimal use of grid electricity is economically feasible, given rising gas and electricity prices.
“The evolution of the residential electricity tariff in Brazil shows an average increase of 6% per year,” they concluded. “Therefore, over the system's lifetime, it is likely that there will be a variation in the electricity tariff.”
They described the model in “Optimization of an integrated combined cooling, heat, and power system with solar and wind contribution for buildings located in tropical areas,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Energy Research.

Indian EPC installer Maxwatt Solar has deployed a 36.72 kWp rooftop solar system with 540 Wp modules for a homeowner in Kerala. It claims the project is India’s largest on-grid residential solar system. It is located at Anchukallumoodu, in the Kollam district of Kerala.
The installation uses 68 of JA Solar 540 Wp half-cell mono PERC modules, supplied by Redington Solar, which is one of the largest solar PV distribution companies in India. It also features a three-phase 27 kW Fronius inverter (model ECO 27.0-3-S). The system is an on-grid solar PV system without any battery backup. 
“It is designed not to run any specific house load, but it is sufficient enough to run even the centralized AC unit of this house. So, in a nutshell, we could say that irrespective of the connected load, this solar system could run any house load connected to it and the electricity generation is more than enough to offset the customer’s monthly electricity bill,” said Prabi Prasad, technical director at Maxwatt Solar.
Prasad claimed that 1 kWp could easily generate four units of electrical energy (kWh) per day.
“Therefore, 36.72 kWp could generate 146.88 kWh daily but based on our experience with previous systems, you can consider 4.5 kWh instead of 4 kWh. Then it will be 165.24 kWh daily, or 60,312.60 kWh annually,” he said.
Prasad noted that the daily electricity consumption of the customer’s house is 40 kWh, based on their monthly electricity bill.
“So the daily electricity generation of 165.24 kWh/day by the solar system will be four times their daily requirement,” he said. “In this case, the customer will be able to feed this extra 120 kWh/day to the state discom Kerala State Electricity Board, which is a win-win situation for both parties.”

It wasn’t just our readers who were interested in the recent launch of Australian startup H2X’s Warrego pickup truck – the company clocked AUD 50 million ($36.8 million) of order requests within four days of its announcement – and remember, the truck doesn’t even officially launch until November.
The Warrego was just the first in a suite of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) that the company plans to bring to market, including more light cars and agricultural vehicles. The company says its 200 orders for the Warrego have come from “several significant energy companies and a number of private buyers” in Australia and abroad, including the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia.
“It obviously shows a pretty incredible demand across the board for vehicles of this kind,” H2X Corporate Affairs Specialist Tony Blackie told pv magazine Australia.
Based on the Ford Ranger, Blackie said that the Warrego is something of a concept car – a demonstration that a hydrogen-powered twin cab pickup truck could work.
It has undeniably drawn attention, but questions do remain around how relevant the technology will be for light vehicles and passenger cars, given that electric vehicles (EVs) are far more mature, making them cheaper and visible today. There is also the little snag of where to refuel a hydrogen car, as there are currently just four green hydrogen refueling stations in Australia, not all of which (like Toyota’s Melbourne station) are even open to the public.
Another catch is the fact that you need to generate twice as much electricity to produce hydrogen than if you just straight up charged your car. Such questions don’t seem to phase H2X execs, however. In its suite of new models, Blackie said that Australia can expect a number of other light vehicles like small vans to heavier vehicles and eventually tractors.
“Hydrogen fuel cell capabilities cover all motor vehicles,” he said, noting that the horizon is not just limited to buses. Brendan Norman, the company’s CEO, has a vision for a range of vehicles to be available for a broad spectrum of uses, Blackie said.
In the short term, the company wants to develop close to operations with hydrogen fuel capabilities, but in the longer term it wants to service the agricultural industry. That is, it wants to enter the farm machinery market, with Blackie saying that those conversations are already happening.
“And it’s not just vehicles of course, there’s the generator set,” he added, noting that mobile hydrogen generators are also in the cards for H2X.
H2X’s ultimate ambition is to begin producing its own hydrogen fuel cells for its vehicles in Australia, but the company has yet to start manufacturing on a larger scale.
Why hydrogen?
So why hydrogen? Well, the primary reason is hydrogen vehicles’ only emission is a clean puddle of water. So if you refuel with green hydrogen – that is, hydrogen produced with an electrolyzer powered by renewable energy – the car has no carbon emissions. If the car is powered with blue or gray hydrogen created using fossil fuels, that’s an entirely different story. But the point is, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have the capacity to be super clean – yes, cleaner than purely electric vehicles.
Batteries are mainly made from pretty toxic chemicals and Australia isn’t particularly good at recycling them, so a lot end up in landfill. Even as the world gets better at recycling batteries, properly reusing the materials they contain, we will still inevitably need to dig up virgin minerals to keep up with demand. Which makes hydrogen as a form of energy storage (fuel) superior in that sense.
It remains to be seen whether that’s enough for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles to displace EVs, but Australia is certainly banking big on hydrogen. As of March, the country's hydrogen project pipeline was triple the size of the next biggest, which belong to Germany and the Netherlands.
Many have speculated about why Australia is so infatuated with hydrogen – perhaps it feels like home for our gas-export nation, or perhaps it’s the fact hydrogen can rehouse our increasingly obsolete fossil fuels. But not everyone is convinced that hydrogen is the clean energy panacea it has been marketed as.
Australian-American inventor and entrepreneur Saul Griffith knows the hydrogen landscape “intimately” and is far from convinced. “I’m not at all bullish on hydrogen,” he said at the Clean Energy Council’s “It’s Electrifying” webinar on Tuesday.
The sticking point for him, like many others, is how much energy hydrogen loses. He estimates that about 25% is lost during electrolysis, while compression loses a further 15% – and that’s before you even think about unloading and using the fuel. “I think Australia has a dangerous addiction to the hydrogen narrative and I think we need to be more realistic,” said Griffith.
H2X aims to launch its new hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle suite in Australia within the next 24 months.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/09/how-safe-are-smart-ev-chargers/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",How safe are smart EV chargers?,"From pv magazine USA
Smart chargers have become a useful resource for electric vehicle (EV) owners, allowing them to remotely monitor and manage the charge state, speed and timing of their car chargers, among other functions. Smart chargers can also be integrated into a home’s solar and storage system to provide even greater control and flexibility over one’s own energy use.
As with any emerging technology, there have been hiccups and issues in the early stages of rollout. However, with smart EV chargers, these shortcomings are more concerning than, say, a malfunctioning new video game console.
Pen Test Partners, a security consulting company, recently spent 18 months investigating the security of some of the market’s leading smart charger offerings, and found troubling results. Of the six smart chargers they tested, nearly all of them included some level of security risk, from accessible user data to the possibility of hijacking “millions” of smart chargers.
To better understand how these risks emerged, the scope of the issue at hand, and potential remedies for the risks, pv magazine spoke with Baksheesh Singh Ghuman, senior director of product and GTM strategy at Finite State, a cybersecurity company focused on Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices.
IoT refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that are used for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet, like smart chargers, smart thermostats and smartphones.
“It’s a connected device, so its functions are all software defined. The software controls a majority of the functions,” explained Ghuman. “[They can define] who the users are, who can charge and cannot charge, when they can charge, or how much they can charge.”
Ghuman said that while the devices are connected, they also allow remote access. Functionally, this allows owners to access the charger’s app from a distance, so they can look at state of charge on their vehicles. That means that the devices are also connected to a user’s home network. If one gets access to a smart charger, that means they can indirectly get access to a user’s home network.
The user is then compromised and potentially open to cyberattacks, as well as ransomware attacks, which shut down devices until a ransom is paid.
According to Ghuman, the associated vulnerabilities can be placed in three critical categories:
The specific consequences of these vulnerabilities differ between public-use EV chargers and private chargers in a user’s home. For public chargers, the main concern is theft of electricity.
“If somebody’s got access to it, then they can then we can use the same account to charge multiple devices or vehicles,” said Ghuman.
Individuals could also remotely turn on and off as many chargers as they have access to, whenever they want, for however long they want, which could have an indirect impact on the power grid.
“It’s like a cyberattack, so to speak. There’s a whole range of things you can do you can ever have more access to that. You can actually control the device itself,” he said.
For homes, the risk is more on network control and user data extraction. Individuals could also send bad information to billing systems, charging users for more electricity than they consume, and gain access to all user data stored within a device and its associated software and apps.
“If you’ve got access to a device, you can actually control the device and, from that device, then, if it’s connected to the internet, you essentially have an impact on other devices within the home,” said Ghuman.
Key fixes
Despite the grim potential of cyberattacks, Ghuman said that the situation is by no means a lost cause, and that remedies would not require significant labor or overhaul – at least, not yet.
“There is already work underway, and these vulnerabilities only serve to highlight that there is a strong need for for security,” said Ghuman. “I think the device manufacturers are working very hard to make sure that the products are secure. But as you know, cybersecurity or security in general is so complex. Sometimes you don’t know from where a vulnerability or a threat factor is going to come from.”
He outlined that most of the known concerns could be patched with firmware. Ghuman said the charger installer must then ensure that the firmware is secure, has been tested before deployment, and is updated or patched post-deployment, in case any additional vulnerabilities are discovered.
This was a conclusion that Pen Test Partners also reached. After its study, the company said it contacted the manufacturers with its findings, and a number of them resolved the issues within 24 hours.
“I think that more and more companies are realizing the key to a competitive advantage is product security,” said Ghuman. “So the more secure your product is, the more competitive advantage you have, because nobody wants to do recalls. And so and nobody wants a reputational loss.”
