Tennet announced today on its website it had formally notified regulator Autoriteit voor Consument en Markt (ACM) that with the region already hosting around 1.5 GW of solar and wind generation capacity, the remaining 980 MW of transmission capacity has been accounted for by signed bids for contracted transmission.
The area affected comprises the 110 kV stations at Gorredijk, Heerenveen, Herbayum, Leeuwarden, Lemmer, Louwsmeer, Marnezijl, Oosterwolde, Oudehaske, Rauwerd, Schenkenschans, Sneek and Wolvega, said the transmission entity.
As a result, Tennet said it expects grid congestion in that section of the network from this year until 2028 and will address the issue with a three to seven-year works program that will include the installation of new transformers and adjustments of the regional high-voltage network.
The Arnhem-based transmission company, which also operates in Germany, said it is looking into the option of applying grid management measures – which can include the option of paying generators to spend periods offline – and will publish the results of that study in the second half of the year.
Tennet said it is already investing €250 million in grid upgrade measures including improving the connection between Oosterwolde and Oudehaske, upgrading capacity at the latter and expanding the Louwsmeer high-voltage substation.
The Ministry of Finance-owned company has been forced to notify such developments on multiple parts of the Dutch network because of the surge in in applications for solar and wind parks in the nation and has considered solutions to the issue such as temporary grid infrastructure and harnessing internet-of-things devices to help shift peak demand periods.

If France will reach its goal to fully decarbonize its energy system and economy by 2050, solar may reach, then, an installed PV capacity comprised of between 70 GW and 208 GW, according to a new report from French grid operator Réseau de Transport d'Électricité (RTE).
The document includes the results of a consultation that RTE launched in January for which it received 4,000 responses from institutions, groups and individuals. Six scenarios allowing for the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050 were outlined and, for each of them, the RTE analysts considered an expected decrease in energy consumption and an increase in the share of electricity and the use of renewable energy. Furthermore, they took into account data on electricity consumption, the future of nuclear power, and the role of hydrogen, among other factors.
Three of the scenarios describe the country's energy system as relying on 100% renewable energy with nuclear power being fully decommissioned by 2050 or, at the latest, by 2060. Another three scenarios, by contrast, see nuclear energy as still playing a crucial role in the energy mix, with different levels of investment in new nuclear capacity.
In all six scenarios, solar will see its share being multiplied by a factor of between seven and 21 and its cumulative installed photovoltaic capacity will reach between 70 GW and 208 GW by 2050.
According to recent figures from the French Ministry of Ecological Transition, the country's cumulative installed solar power had reached 11.5 GW. The total is still quite far from the 2030 target of 20 GW, under the national energy strategy.

French environmental services provider Veolia is leading a research project which is aimed at developing a highly efficient and special process for the recycling of solar modules.
Through the ReProSolar initiative, which the EU is funding with €4.8 million through the EIT Raw Materials pot, the company and its partners from the public and private sectors who operate along the value chain of recycling solar modules are seeking, for the first time, to recover all components of a solar panel at the end of its life cycle.
The consortium hopes to develop a process that allows recovery of pure silicon, silver and glass and makes them be made usable, again, for industrial sectors of different kinds.
Funding for the project began in February and runs until January 2025. The feasibility of the process on an industrial scale will be tested by the partner companies Flaxres, operating in Dresden, Germany; and Rosi Solar – headquartered in Grenoble, France – by the end of the year.
According to Veolia, around 5,000 tons of solar modules will be processed in a demonstration plant, annually, by 2023. “Our process is based on a new delamination technology that is able to efficiently separate the solar cells from the glass plate,” explained project manager Antoine Driancourt, of Veolia Umweltservice GmbH. “Innovative physical-chemical processes will then enable all materials to be recovered without the photovoltaic modules having to be shredded.”
According to the French company, no industrial process in the world is able, to date, to recover silver and silicon with very high purity from solar cells. “This would be a major breakthrough for the entire solar industry in terms of current recycling standards,” said Driancourt. With the project partners, Veolia will map the entire value chain, from processing and raw material cleaning to the waste stream supply chain and reintegration into various industries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/10/building-renovations-crucial-for-heat-pump-deployment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 10, 2021",Building renovations crucial for heat pump deployment,"Heat pumps are raising big hopes for the electrification of heating for buildings and households. However, their performance is still considered insufficient for satisfying, completely, heating demand. Their technical and financial viability, on the other hand, remains subject to different views, with some claiming that payback time is still too long and others saying they are far from achieving the required level to ensure that heating or cooling are efficiently provided.
According to recent research from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), in Germany, energy efficiency and building renovations may be the crucial factor to reduce heating demand, thus creating the conditions to help homeowners and real estate developers adopt heat pumps to electrify heating as much as possible.
The scientists analyzed, in particular, whether implementing building retrofitting and thermal energy storage, and installing individual hybrid heat pumps with back-up gas boilers, may help mitigate heat demand peaks in a renewable European energy system with net-zero CO2 emissions. “The European perspective is important because energy markets are already strongly coupled internationally and a cross-sectoral perspective is necessary to understand, for example, the impact of heat pump demand on electricity supply,” they explained.
In the paper Mitigating heat demand peaks in buildings in a highly renewable European energy system, recently published in Energy, the German group defined a model that considers space and water heating for the residential and services sector. “The industrial sector is not included and the required energy for cooking is incorporated in the electricity demand,” it specified. “The overall heat demand per country is distributed spatially, weighted by population density; and temporally, by creating time-series based on ambient air temperature and typical end-user behavior.”
Under this configuration, in which wind and solar contribute the largest share of electricity generation, with up to 95%, heating demand can be met by: power-to-heat, such as heat pumps and resistive heaters; gas-to-heat, such as combined heat and power (CHP), gas boilers and fuel cells; or solar thermal collectors and solid biomass-to-heat, in district heating networks. “Heat pumps of two categories are considered: ground-sourced, brine-to-water heat pumps, which are restricted to rural regions due to land requirements, and air-to-water heat pumps useable in areas with high population density,” the academics stated, noting that their model considers building renovation measures such as adding insulation material and replacing energy inefficient windows.
Through this analysis, the researchers found that, with the implementation of the three, above-mentioned measures, the overall cost for heating may be reduced in Europe, from €751 billion to €622 billion, and that building renovations may result in savings of €104 million per year. “The availability of individual back-up gas boilers has a more modest impact,” they pointed out. “In scenarios without building renovation, these provide a 6% overall cost reduction.”
According to them, building renovation, thermal energy storage and individual heat pumps with back-up gas boilers are efficient tools to mitigating heat demand peaks and may result in cost savings for the European energy system of up to 17%. “Building renovations, which result in 44–51% space heat demand savings, show the strongest effect on the reduction of total costs, with 14% cost savings,” they concluded. “Individual gas boilers that are used as back-up for heat pumps can be completely removed in rural areas with a minor cost increase of only 1-2% if the buildings are renovated.”

The public body, in a post published yesterday on its website, said the pumping station was 92% complete and will soon be providing the water needs of the vast solar park “and nearby areas.” The pumping station is being installed in two phases, the first of which had a daily capacity of 4.5 million imperial gallons.
The huge solar development, which is set to reach 5 GW of generation capacity this decade, has had 1,013 MW operational since the completion of its 800 MW third phase was announced in November.
pv magazine reported in November that the AED15.8 billion ($4.3 billion), 950 MW fourth phase – comprised of 700 MW of concentrating PV and 250 MW of conventional, ground-mounted panels – of the solar field was expected to “start coming online,” in the third quarter of this year.
Saudi energy company ACWA Power in September announced it had closed the $564 million financing needed for the 900 MW conventional photovoltaic fifth phase of the project. That stage of the development, which is at Saih Al-Dahal, south of Dubai, has been delayed, with pv magazine having reported, in February 2019, that the fifth phase was expected to have been commissioned this month.

That's it for Cornerstone 4, pv magazine's European Roundtables Innovation Hub.
We are left optimistic that green hydrogen in Europe is key to reducing emissions in “difficult sectors”. And the staggering 1,000 GW of energy storage prophesied for Europe somehow, at the end of the panel discussion, seemed eminently achievable.
Of course, whether this optimism is well founded will depend upon the continuance of European innovation.
Claire Miller, Director of Technology and Innovation at Octopus Electric Vehicles is running a trial to see whether electric vehicle owners are willing to use their EV battery to participate in the grid for a small payment.
Interestingly, Miller points out that modern trends spawned from the Covid-19 pandemic, such as a reduction in commuting. If more people are staying at home more often, that means there are more EVs plugged into the grid and available to participate.
But are the car manufacturers preparing for the challenge of vehicle to grid? Andreas Piepenbrink, Managing Director of Hager Energy said he could only speak for the German manufacturers, but that those at least are preparing a standard in order that all their EVs will be able to communicate with the grid within the next 36 months.
Miller concurred that the international standard was in a final draft stage. And that despite the great excitement about the potential of vehicle to grid, it is not until the standard becomes rule that the market can really begin to charge.
The question is asked, can we really acheive the 1000 GW goal. The answer, from Andreas Piepenbrink, Managing Director of Hager Energy, is a definitive “Yes.” The reason being that we will be seeing 20-30 million electric vehicles and each of them with 50 kW means that not only will 1000 GW of storage be met in Europe, but easily achieved.
Marta Victoria, Assistant Professor at Aarhus University returns to the fray for the final panel discussion. Victoria said that energy storage is best suited to solar PV but it is not restricted to solar PV, it has usage for hydrogen, wind, etc.
Victoria said that it is not surprising, given the advanced network of the European grid interconnection, and that is why we are not seeing huge capacities of energy storage installed in Europe. But Victoria stressed that after 2030 when emissions reductions will only be more pressurised, Europe will start to catch up to the kind of project sizes we are currently seeing in the U.S.
Jansen noted that the kind of 100 MW systems we are seeing in the U.S. are not batting an eyelid, but if something even half that size was proposed in Europe we'd all fall off our seats.
Holger Wolfschmidt, Market Applications Director at Fluence, noted that infrastructure is “perfect in Europe compared to other continents” and that means that the opportunity for energy storage is there even if it is not currently dominating the market.
Europe has been historically centered around Germany and the United Kingdom, with new markets only opening slowly, says Julian Jansen, Associate Director, Consulting – Clean Technology & Renewables, HIS Markit.
Jansen noted that France, Spain and Portugal are beginning to grow their energy storage markets but everyone has a lot of ground to make up on, at least when it comes to front-of-meter storage, the United States.
Jansen added that while promising things like green hydrogen are great, the glory of energy storage is in its short-duration capabilities.
Improvements in modular power electronics is pushing the market toward string inverters and decentralized systems.
Filippo Carzaniga, Chairman of the Board of FIMER Group, said miniaturization of inverters is a key frontier of innovation.
Digital capabilities are the other frontier. “We are introducing artificial intelligence in the highest level, and machine learning to improve maintenance.”
Carzaniga clarified that while inverters will be getting smaller, it will not negatively impact their ability to deal with the new trend of larger modules.
After over a century, Barcelona's Sagrada Familia is only finally nearing completion today. But “Hydrogenizing Barcelona” will not take anywhere near as long. Manfred Groh, Manager Hydrogen Projects, BayWa r.e. gave us a taste of a broad cooperation (over 20 companies) to implement a hydrogen economy in the Barcelona metropolitan area.
The project, to proceed in two phases, will see a 20 MW electrolyzer and a 100 MW electrolyzer fed by onsite rooftop solar PV and offsite PV and wind plants.
Manfred Groh, Manager Hydrogen Projects, BayWa r.e. begins a presentation about why a leading project developer and investor cannot wait to start hydrogen projects.
Groh notes that there are at least four main motivations for big developers toward hydrogen projects and they are:
As far as grid congestion goes, Baywa r.e. and Dutch grid operator Alliander are commissioning a project for September/October 2021 in which 50 MWp of solar will be used to produce green hydrogen 40km southwest of Groningen. Of course, grid constraints in the Netherlands means that projects can wait a number of years before connection, making hydrogen production a much more interesting side-hustle.
What is the conversion efficiency at the moment for solar to hydrogen? Jan-Justus Schmidt, Co-founder Enapter says “We require about 50 kWh of effiency to produce 1kg of hydrogen.” He notes that this is a good efficiency for the moment, but points to several percentage points of improvement on the horizon.
Of course, these efficiency developments require scale and investment. Aurélie Beauvais, Deputy CEO SolarPower Europe, notes that the LCOH is determined by the LCOE and the capex of electrolyzers. for the latter, Beauvais said that Europe has to support large-scale electrolyzer factories across the continent.
Following on from a short presentation from Pasi Bainikka, CEO of Finnish firm Solar Foods, Jan-Justus Schmidt, Co-founder Enapter, says that we have not yet seen all the “killer applications” hydrogen is capable of.
Hydrogen is an element we have ignored for way too long, but not anymore. Innovators around the world are discovering the flexibility and variety of this the most abundant element in the universe.
When pv magazine moderator Michael Fuhs asked Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, Secretary General of Hydrogen Europe, whether Europe was devoted to developing green hydrogen as opposed to hydrogen with emissions.
Chatzimarkakis noted that while technology paths in the future are open, Europe knows that “The best marriage in the renewable world is between solar and hydrogen.”
Aurélie Beauvais, Deputy CEO SolarPower Europe, noted that only 4% of hydrogen produced in Europe is renewable, and that renewable hydrogen remains less competitive than blue hydrogen. That, says Beauvais, is a big problem.
Nevertheless, there are various ways we are working to improve the situation:
An audience question comes in with concern to the safety of co-locating hydrogen and storage. Pho Duc says that the safety fears (lingering from Hindenburg) do not have great credence as the modern safety standards are much more organized and well-structured.
Jan-Justus Schmidt, Co-founder Enapter, says that green hydrogen is essential to heating, transport, industry, and long term storage. He believes Enapter is rethinking electrolyzers as mass produced products, achieving low cost and accelerated emissions reduction. “Under 2 Euro a kilogram is absolutely possible…and the cost curve will be very similar to the pv industry.” Schmidt says.
Christian Pho Duc, CTO & Managing Director H2 Projects at Smartenergy, spoke to the variety of electrolyzer technologies fighting it out for supremacy at this pivotal moment. But stressed that the technologies need to be implemented in projects before we can see which technologies will rise to the top.
Faith Bihrol of the International Energy Agency has said that “Solar will become Europe's prime power generation capacity by 2025”, and this, says, Christian Pho Duc, CTO & Managing Director H2 Projects at Smartenergy, is the major driver behind the descending levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH).
“Both together (solar and hydrogen) can win a lot,” continued Pho Duc, who advises solar developers to consider co-located hydrogen generation as a way to achieve “additionality”, which is to say a way of producing varied generation potential while also scaling green hydrogen to continue to bring costs down.
After all, one of the main challenges remains the cost of electrolyzers.
Assistant Professor at Aarhus University, Marta Victoria, gets the green hydrogen ball rolling. Victoria makes the point that we need more technologies than just solar and wind to make this energy transition stick.
Hydrogen is one of those technologies; it is one of, if not the best option for seasonal power storage. “We need 220 TW per year for this purpose,” says Victoria.
Of course, seasonal power storage is not the only, “difficult sector”, but it is in the “difficult sectors”, Victoria notes, that  are where green hydrogen is most useful and most needed.
On your marks, get set, Innovate! We're live with our fourth and last cornerstone for Roundtables Europe.
pv magazine moderators Michael Fuhs and Marian Willuhn are about to take us into a closer look at the world beyond solar, into the realm of innovation, and perhaps the most talked about realm in innovation at the minute is green hydrogen, and that is where we're starting.
The first Cornerstone on Sustainability and Made in Europe is over. We heard from a range of experts on diverse subjects including circular manufacturing and closed loop recycling, the opportunities and challenges of European PV manufacturing, and perspectives from outside the solar industry.
As with all our cornerstones, the presentations and recordings of the speakers will be available online shortly.
Coming up at 2 p.m. CEST is our final cornerstone: The innovation hub – hydrogen, battery storage, and e-mobility raise new opportunities for solar companies. Here you will discover which innovations, technological or regulatory, are necessary to compete, and how and when can the market become as attractive for solar companies across the continent as it is for their U.S. counterparts.
Overall, we've had 1,500 attendees from across the globe tuning in to hear our expert speakers share their thoughts. Coverage from day 1 is available, and we will also be live blogging this afternoon, so stay tuned!
If you've enjoyed the Roundtables thus far, make sure you stay tuned for details on our upcoming events in the U.S. and Australia, which will be published soon.
Good morning Roundtablers,
We're now ready for a fireside chat with Lubomila Jordanova, co-founder and CEO of Berlin start-up PlanA, which helps corporates measure and report their environmental, social and governance performance.
Jordanova will be talking about how working with material and component suppliers can deliver sustainability wins. If you missed the discussion, a recording will be uploaded to our website later today.
Sustainability and the pursuit of the circular economy could deliver a competitive advantage for EU solar manufacturing – and clear the way for governmental support. Michele Vannini, business manager of Coveme presented the company's innovative project that aims for truly circular PV materials.
Specifically, he discussed a closed loop recycling system for PV backsheets, and how to recover the polyester for re-use without compromising performance. Coveme worked with DuPont Teijin, both of which are partners to pv magazine's UP sustainability initiative, to research the process.
The presentation and a recording of his talk, will be available soon.
Last year, the UP initiative focused on circular manufacturing. Read our coverage from the quarter.
If the European solar industry is to re-establish manufacturing at scale, what technologies, support measures, and strategies could potentially deliver success?
Our panel, comprising Alex Barrows, director of research at Exawatt, Laura Sartore CEO of Ecoprogetti, Edurne Zoco executive director of clean energy at IHS Markit, and Vartan Oskanian advisor to the CEO of Recom, discussed these key issues. 
Alex Barrows said that there is currently around 10 GW of PV module manufacturing capacity located in Europe, if you include Turkey, although some of it is underutilized. 
He added that Europe is good at focusing on the two ends of supply chain, for example, Wacker Chemie and polysilicon production, and module manufacturers of which there are a number of small companies operating in Europe. What is missing is the middle of the supply chain, i.e. the manufacture of wafers and cells, of which there is just 1-2 GW of capacity.
Edurne Zoco said that there a a few different factors which have helped the current EU-based module manufacturers to be successful, including the presence of local content or carbon footprint requirements for solar projects. The double digit growth of the installation market is also helping boost the landscape, as is module technology differentiation. 
Laura Sartore, meanwhile, believes that European manufacturers' level of customized automation and automation that is integrated with logistics, have helped establish their businesses.
Flexibility also plays a key role, she said, with successful manufacturers managing to adjust their production lines to specific kind of modules for specific markets , e.g. rooftops in Italy, Hungary, or Germany. 
Former production equipment supplier Meyer Burger is pursuing the bold plan for German HJT cell and PV module manufacturing. Gunter Erfurt, CEO, Meyer Burger has outlined the Swiss company's next steps and what can be done to support the initiative-seizing endeavor.
Erfurt said that Meyer Burger currently has a “very small” manufacturing capacity of 400 MW. However, the goal is to “grow as fast as we can” to become a multi-GW player. The next phase targets 1.4 GW by the end of 2023, and should approach 5 GW by end of 2026.
The PV modules are sustainable, said Erfurt, in terms of the recycling process, which employs a circular approach and reuses 98% of components. They are also lead-free.
He added that it is important to understand that the solar supply chain has been optimized over the past decade. Thus, further cost reductions will be associated with technological improvements, like higher efficiencies, thinner wafers, and removing silver, for instance.
Furthermore, it is important to move away from a focus on $/Wp. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is what matters, he said, with energy yields a key issue. “We are focusing on this,” he said, explaining that Meyer Burger is already working on the next generation of HJT. Already the company has tested module efficiencies “way above” 24%, he said.
Overall, he believes the question is not ‘should a European-only manufacturing landscape be established?'. Europe should not create an isolated market, he said, but rather form part of the global industry.
In a panel on the rationale for Made in Europe PV, we heard the panelists discussing the recent price hikes in solar raw materials and logistics, which have “significantly” increased over the past few months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, among other factors. 
Naomi Chevillard, senior policy advisor, SolarPower Europe, believes these increases make the case for the development of a European PV manufacturing industry. However, she says they are not the only driver. There are also opportunities in the heterojunction (HJT) technology, for instance, that Meyer Burger is working on.
Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF, disagrees. Stating that a European manufacturing market will always remain a “cottage industry”.
She added that even if we had solar manufacturing bases in Europe, we would still have experienced price increases. “There's a global economic upswing that’s driving commodity prices up,” she said, and also a perceived polysilicon problem, which BNEF is not convinced actually exists. Furthermore, she believes a China-free supply chain is unrealistic, given the fact China is a leading manufacturer of ingots and wafers.
The EU Green Deal looks to be a sweeping range of policy measures that could present considerable opportunities for solar. But can they extend to manufacturing? And what details from the plan are emerging?
Sven Giegold, MEP, from North-Rhine-Westphalia / Germany, a spokesperson for the German Greens in the European parliament and coordinator of the Greens/EFA group in the ECON (economy and monetary affairs) committee, is joining us live to discuss.
The first day of the pv magazine Roundtables Europe has successfully wrapped, with over 1,000 people tuning in from around the world to listen to our expert panels talk about large PV module formats and the associated quality risks, and asset management, with a particular focus on ESG. Check out our live blog from Day 1.
Coming up this morning, we have a number of Networking and Meet the Speaker sessions, in addition to the final two cornerstone panels on Sustainability and Made in Europe; and the Innovation Hub: Hydrogen, battery storage, and e-mobility.

French solar companies Sun'Agri, REM Tec, Kilowattsol, and Altergie Développement et Râcines have announced the creation of France Agrivoltaisme, the world's first trade body for the agrivoltaics sector.
“France is the ideal promoter of this cutting edge technology,” the association said. “The Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) has contributed since 2019 to the development of this solution by including agrivoltaic projects in its tenders.”
In addition, French environmental agency Ademe has sought to define agrivoltaics and has outlined guidelines for its deployment.
The association aims to promote agrivoltaics by prioritizing solutions with a strong agricultural impact. It aims to represent the sector and wants to define and defend the interests of its members.
“Like any emerging sector, agrivoltaics must be structured to allow sustainable development and encourage practices favoring the improvement and resilience of agriculture,” said Antoine Nogier, the founder of Sun’Agri and the president of France Agrivoltaisme.
Nogier said the first objective is to make the authorities aware of the need to support agrivoltaics.
“In particular within the framework of CRE tenders and agricultural aid – in particular, those of the EU Recovery plan for the adaptation of agriculture to climate change,” he said.

Off-grid inverters create AC power from the DC power that solar panels feed into batteries. They therefore need a storage system to operate. Such devices combine the functionality of a voltage controller, inverter and charger.
Green Cell's inverters are available in two versions with power outputs of 1 kW and 3 kW. They have  90% efficiency. “The 1 kW version costs €204.95 and the 3 kW inverter costs €404.95,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The largest inverter has dimensions of 320.5 mm x 224 mm x 95.1 mm and a weight of 7.4 kg. Its output voltage is 230 Vac and the maximum charging current is 80 A. The inverters also feature a maximum MPPT output current of 50 A and a PV voltage range for MPPT between 30 and 80 Vdc. They are equipped with temperature and voltage monitoring, as well as protection from overvoltage, overcharge and discharge, and reverse polarity.
The manufacturer said that the devices were designed for installations equipped with their own energy storage.
“It can be used to build an independent power source or provide emergency power during electricity outages,” the company said. “It's also possible to connect it to a traditional grid and when the panels produce too little power, the inverter will draw it from the operator and use it to power appliances or charge batteries.”
The inverters are recommended for small buildings such as cottages and year-round homes. The manufacturer said they can power all kinds of appliances, including refrigerators and air conditioners.

Real-time retail pricing of electricity, which can make room for more renewables on the grid by increasing demand flexibility, is one element of a draft proposal presented by the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) energy division.
Such systems could include scheduled charging of electric vehicles and distributed storage, and remote control of space heating and water heating, said CPUC Commissioner Darcie Houck. Opt-in real-time pricing for retail electricity, which involves “sending prices to devices,” is also a central element in the energy division’s draft proposal.
Real-time electricity pricing has been proven to work in a pilot program funded by the California Energy Commission that involved customers of California utility SCE. Participating customers reduced their electric bills mostly by shifting air conditioning loads.
Aloke Gupta, a CPUC energy division staff member, said the SCE pilot’s pricing scheme could inform a pricing scheme for California as a whole, as could San Diego Gas & Electric’s hourly dynamic rate for electric vehicle owners. Smart devices receiving and responding to price signals, Gupta said, could include thermostats, heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and smart plugs.
If California moves to bi-directional pricing, Gupta said, a utility customer could either consume or export electricity at the current price, with exports coming from storage or from rooftop solar. Alternatively, a customer could choose a fixed-price subscription, he said.
The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) asked the CPUC in 2018 for a rule on opt-in real-time pricing, in a joint petition with the Solar Energy Industries Association and others. CALSSA and others followed up that request in 2020, asking the CPUC to allow customers in the San Diego area to choose real-time pricing.
Houck said that communications and power control systems are now available to automate demand flexibility. “So customers can spend as much or as little time as they want thinking about their energy … reshaping demand to flex with supply” is as important as deploying more renewables, Houck said, as the state works to reach 100% clean electricity by 2045.
Energy division staff plans to release a white paper this summer on widespread flexible demand management. They expect to recommend at that time that the CPUC consider the proposal.
Any changes would likely occur in a stepwise fashion, said Paul Phillips of the energy division. Infrastructure recommendations being developed by the California Energy Commission will help facilitate the CPUC’s work, he said.
Presentations from the CPUC’s “Advanced DER & Demand Flexibility Management” workshop, and a video recording, are available online. Informal written comments are invited through June 11.
This article was updated on June 8 to reflect a change in the due date for written comments on the proposal.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/10/australian-pv-system-owners-look-at-off-grid-options-amid-talk-of-tariffs/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 10, 2021",Australian PV system owners look at off-grid options amid talk of tariffs,"From pv magazine Australia
The Australian unit of South Korean solar module maker Hanwha Q Cells has revealed that more and more installers and residential customers are looking at going off grid, as policymakers continue to contemplate changes to make room on the grid for more renewables, including rooftop solar PV.
Australia’s booming rooftop solar market delivered a record-breaking 2.6 GW of rooftop solar in 2020, while another 4 GW is expected to be installed this year. Despite the benefits, the proliferation of small-scale solar has increased the pressure on grid infrastructure, which was built when power only flowed one way.
Accordingly, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) – the governing body responsible for making the rules for the national electricity market – has unveiled a draft determination on distributed energy resources (DER) to ease pressure on the grid as the boom in rooftop solar continues.
Included in the reforms package is a proposal for a two-way pricing mechanism – labelled by some as a sun tax – which would allow distribution networks to reward DER owners for sending power to the grid during peak demand periods and to charge them for sending power when it is not needed.
Q Cells Australia Marketing Director Myung Shim told pv magazine that the talk about export charges had initiated plenty of discussion in the rooftop solar PV sector.
“More and more installers and consumers (are) thinking about going off grid … the level of inquiry around going grid independent – what are the options and alternatives to being dependent on the grid – has been rising and it’s understandable,” she said. “Even if you don’t understand what all these energy management systems and policy changes are, in the end, if you are asked to pay for something that you didn’t have to pay for in the past by the grid operator or network provider, of course you will think about options.”
Shim said the options include batteries, with the proposed rule changes sparking renewed interest in energy storage solutions.
“Contrary to all the research in the energy market, Australians have been putting off buying or installing batteries, but people are now thinking a battery is something they should install soon, not look at as a future investment,” she said. “Now they are saying maybe I can have this solar system and battery installed and perhaps I can go 100% off grid. I will have my own generated energy, I will maximise my self-consumption and if I have something left over, I can store it and then I can sell it when I can make extra revenue at the most attractive nominal value.”
More than 2.6 million Australian houses already have solar modules installed on their roof. And that number is expected to double in the next 10 years. Conservative estimates suggest Q Cells commands about 12% of Australia’s annual rooftop solar PV market. And Shim, who confirmed that more than 85% of the company’s revenue comes from residential and small commercial rooftop, said it is conscious of its responsibility to help deliver a solution which will allow more small-scale renewables into the electricity grid.
Shim said while talk of tariffs has dominated discussions since the AEMC released its draft determination, technology will be critical to solving the problem of ‘traffic jams’ on the network.
“It all ties back into technology,” she said. “No matter what, this whole conversation leads to the demand for more sophisticated energy technology … It’s about us as manufacturers trying to really keep up and be aware of trends and changes in the market.”
The final determination on the AEMC’s draft rule is due for release in July.
