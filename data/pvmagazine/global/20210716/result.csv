Among other documents and strategies published on Wednesday, the EU Commission proposed the revision of key EU directives in the energy field, including the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The Commission also proposed the revision of the Emission Trading System (ETS). All these proposals are somehow related to hydrogen. “The lowest minimum rate of €0.15/GJ applies to electricity – regardless of its use -, advanced sustainable biofuels and biogas, and renewable fuels of non-biological origin such as renewable hydrogen. Low-carbon hydrogen and related fuels will also benefit from that same rate for a transitional period of 10 years,” reads the Commission’s statement on the ETD revision. The proposed RED revision seeks to convert into EU law some of the concepts outlined in the energy system integration and hydrogen strategies published in 2020.
The Commission proposed to raise the overall renewables target from 32% to 40%. “The Commission is … aiming at a more energy-efficient and circular energy system that facilitates renewables-based electrification, and promotes the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels, including hydrogen, in sectors where electrification is not yet a feasible option, such as transport,” the Commission's website states. It also assessed the options to create a certification system for low-carbon fuels. The idea is to extend the EU-wide certification for renewable fuels to include hydrogen. The Commission is also seeking to create binding sub-targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and its derivatives in the transport sector and called for the production of hydrogen with electrolyzers to be included in the ETS, making renewable and low-carbon facilities eligible for free allowances.
A Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is also on the list. The Council and the Parliament will now have to go through the proposals and eventually agree on the final texts of the legislative tools, all meant to deliver on the targets agreed in the European Climate Law.
Europe is the continent contributing the most to global hydrogen developments, but decisions being made in South America and the Middle East, combined with climate commitments announced by China and the United States, bode well for the steep increase in hydrogen investments. Investments are reportedly reaching $1 billion every week. This was one of the key messages of the latest Hydrogen Insights Updates from the Hydrogen Council in collaboration with McKinsey & Company. Hydrogen Council is a global CEO-led coalition working to accelerate the energy transition through hydrogen. “Globally, 131 large-scale projects have been announced since February 2021, taking the total to 359 projects. The total investment into projects and along the whole value chain amounts to an estimated $500 billion through 2030,” said the coalition on Thursday. According to the report, low-carbon hydrogen production capacity “will exceed 10 million tons p.a. by 2030, an increase of over 60% on February reported project level.” The Hydrogen Council and McKinsey & Company underlined that the Chinese government has made $20 billion of public funding available to hydrogen projects. “Europe remains the center of hydrogen development, accounting for more than 50% of announced projects and estimated investments of $130 billion. However, all other regions grew faster proportionally with over 75% increase. Furthermore, trade flows between supply and demand centers are starting to arise.” The majority of the production capacity is expected to come from renewable energy sources, but 30% also depends on carbon capture storage technologies. “Large-scale clean hydrogen projects, amounting to about a third of total hydrogen demand growth expected in the next decade, are materializing in response to the many calls for bold action to address climate change,” commented Daryl Wilson, executive director of the Hydrogen Council.
New Zealand and Singapore signed an arrangement of cooperation on low-carbon hydrogen on Thursday. The arrangement follows in the footsteps of the 2018 memorandum with Japan. “New Zealand has an abundance of renewable energy that could be used to produce hydrogen, potentially for export, so this cooperation between us and Singapore… is significant,” commented Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods. The two countries want to collaborate on the production, deployment, and research into a new hydrogen economy, focusing on transport and industry applications. New Zealand is also looking into options to export hydrogen to South Korea. “Korea’s interest in producing hydrogen, developing the technology and infrastructure for the storage, transportation and consumption of hydrogen, and securing liquid hydrogen imports from abroad (including New Zealand) is serious, and presents a number of opportunities for New Zealand businesses as we develop our own hydrogen economy and associated technologies,” New Zealand’s Foreign Affairs Ministry wrote in February.
Portuguese power utility Energías de Portugal (EDP), whose main shareholder is the state-owned China Three Gorges Corporation, presented last week to the Andalusian regional government its plans to convert the Puente Nuevo and Los Barrios power plants, currently in the process of closure, with industrial projects worth €1 billion. The Los Barrios coal plant is a potential site for the development of hydrogen projects that would allow the supply of green energy for the entire industrial environment of Campo de Gibraltar and its possible export by sea. Collaboration with the administration could launch a hydrogen pole in the Campo de Gibraltar to supply nearby industries. In a separate development, EDP announced it is cooperating with French-American technology provider TechnipFMC and other research partners, including the University of South-Eastern Norway, to develop a conceptual engineering and economic feasibility study for a new offshore system for green hydrogen production from offshore wind power, called the Behyond project. “The study will include innovative integration of equipment for the production and conditioning of green hydrogen and infrastructure that allows for its transportation to the coast. The goal is to create a unique concept that can be standardized and implemented worldwide, allowing for large-scale hydrogen production,” reads the note released on Monday. According to TechnipFMC, the consortium will strengthen cooperation between Portugal and Norway.
Norway-based consultancy DNV will lead the process safety study to identify environmental, safety, and operational risks for the world's first offshore hydrogen production facilities. Collaborating with producer and supplier of green hydrogen Lhyfe and the École centrale de Nantes school of engineering, DNV wants to demonstrate the reliability of an offshore electrolyzer. “Located off the coast of Le Croisic, France, the green hydrogen-generating system is intended to be powered by electricity from a floating wind turbine, with a target start-up date in 2022,” reads the note released on Thursday. DNV will investigate several risks, including the ones related to floating barge, fuel cells and hydrogen production. A regulations and standards review will also be included as part of the study. “We believe green hydrogen at scale is the ultimate destination for the future of energy storage,” commented Santiago Blanco, DNV's executive vice president.
Helsinki-based technology group Wärtsilä has begun testing its thermal balancing engines using pure hydrogen and expects to have an engine and power plant concept capable of running on 100% hydrogen by 2025. Full-scale engine tests have been recently carried out in Wärtsilä's engine laboratory in Vaasa, Finland, to assess the optimum engine parameters for running on hydrogen and ammonia,” reads a note released on Wednesday. Wärtsilä has installed a total of 74 GW of power plant capacity in 180 countries. Its engines are reportedly capable of ramping up to full load in two minutes. They can currently run on natural gas, biogas, synthetic methane or hydrogen blends, “with a blending possibility of up to 25% hydrogen already proven today.” For the marine market, Wärtsilä said in a separate note that it expects to have an engine running on an ammonia blend already this year. Wärtsilä anticipates having an engine concept with pure ammonia fuel in 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/16/an-environmental-failsafe-for-lead-based-perovskites/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 16, 2021",An environmental failsafe for lead-based perovskites,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a big hope for the future of solar cell technology, with the potential for low-cost production, high efficiency and incorporation into all sorts of flexible or multilayered devices. As the technology overcomes more of the challenges related to performance and stability that have held it back from commercial development, questions are increasingly being asked about the use of lead, a toxic material that’s at the heart of all of the best performing perovskite solar cell materials developed to date.
Opinion is divided on the level of risk posed by lead in perovskites – some studies have shown that the amounts of lead present in most of the cell materials being researched are too small to pose an environmental threat even in a ‘worst case' scenario, and were production to be scaled up, options could be explored for safe disposal and recycling – as has long been established for the lead used in today’s car batteries.
However, there is still the possibility that if a perovskite module in the field suffered damage or moisture ingress, lead from the device could dissolve into water and make its way into the soil or even the food chain – and this will likely be a factor for regulators in allowing large commercial solar installations to use the material. Plenty of research is underway into alternatives to lead in perovskites, with both tin and bismuth showing some promise. But abandoning lead would be a setback in terms of cell performance; and finding ways to prevent it from entering the environment could be a more effective solution.
This was the approach of scientists led by Switzerland’s Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), who discovered a material that reacts with lead only in the presence of water, forming a new substance that cannot be dissolved in water and thus reducing the risk of lead from a PSC ending up in the environment in almost any possible scenario. The group incorporated this material, a phosphate salt, into the structure of a PSC; showing that it did not affect the properties or performance of the cell, and only reacts with the lead when water is present (and water coming into contact with the active cell material would likely mean the panel has already failed).
Work with the phosphate salt is described in the paper Fighting Health Hazards in Lead Halide Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices with Transparent Phosphate Salts, published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. “The ‘fail-safe' chemistry keeps lead ions from leaching out and can render perovskite devices safer to use in the environment or close to humans,” says EPFL scientist Márton Kollár.
The group expects that its discovery will see perovskites solar cells downgraded to a similar risk category as existing thin-film PV technologies like CIGS or cadmium telluride and hopes to see its approach adopted in other prototype perovskite devices. “This approach can be used to build functional photodetectors, and we suggest that the broad community of researchers and R&D centers working on various devices like solar cells and light-emitting diodes implements it in their respective prototypes,” added Pavao Andričevic, another EPFL researcher who worked on characterizing the cells’ performance.

The company said it expects to achieve revenue of up to RMB 18 billion ($2.79 billion) during the period, with a year-on-year increase of 108%. Net profit is predicted to come in at up to RMB 1.55 billion, which would represent 188% growth over the first six months of 2020. Zhonghuan said the positive performance is due to the expansion of its capacity and strong market demand for 210 mm-sized products. At the end of June, the manufacturer had an annual production capacity of 70 GW.
Shanghai-listed panel maker GCL System Integration said it expects a net loss of up to RMB 270 million in the first half of 2021. The company explained the loss comes from several key factors, including the price hike for polysilicon, the suspension of several large-scale solar projects in China, and a non-recurring loss of around RMB 100 million coming from liabilities related to the sale of PV power plants.
Shanghai-listed silicon wafer manufacturer JYT Corporation reportedly posted a net profit of up to RMB 470 million in the first half of the year, an increase of up to 105% compared to the same period a year earlier. The company currently has an annual production capacity of 8 GW and plans to reach 20 GW by the end of the year.
Module manufacturer Solargiga yesterday reported an unaudited 12% rise in first-half revenue, from RMB 2.6 billion ($402 million) in January-to-June last year to RMB 2.91 billion ($450 million) this time around, with shipments of solar ingots, wafers and modules up 18% to 3.38 GW.
Chinese solar manufacturer Akcome Tech announced it may incur a net loss of around RMB 70 million for the first six months of 2021. According to its preliminary statement, the negative result was due to the cost rise of upstream components, including wafers and solar cells, and higher prices for supporting materials, such as copper, aluminum, steel and glass.

German storage system manufacturer Hager has unveiled two lithium-ion batteries with capacities of 5.8 and 11.6 kWh, respectively.
Although the company calls the devices “flow energy storage systems,” the two batteries have nothing to do with the flow battery technology. In its view, “flow” refers rather to the ability to record energy flows in one's own home and to steer them optimally in the energy management controller.
In addition, the storage does not come alone, but is already equipped with appropriate inverters for the photovoltaic system. The system also includes an electric vehicle charging station, which is optional. There is also a Smart Grid-Ready interface, which can also be used to integrate an intelligently controllable heat pump. Hager states that the system can be charged and discharged in advance, as it has access to various Internet services such as the weather report. The manufacturer describes it as intelligent charging planning.
The system's main aim is to increase self-consumption. To do this, the controller registers the residents' energy consumption habits and recognizes the electricity tariffs of the energy providers. This data flows into the consumption planning along with weather report information. Installation and operation are regulated by a company-owned app.
On the technical side, the battery can handle a maximum DC input power of 18 kW and 1000 V. The MPP trackers search for the best working point from a voltage of between 250 and 850 V. The strings find their way into the inverter via MC4 connectors. The system has an output of 20 amps per phase, with three phases.
The efficiency of the inverter and the battery are indicated at 95%. The efficiency of the overall system is 88%. The depth of discharge is estimated at 100% for both models. The weight of the unit is 196 kg for the 5.8 kWh product and 240 kg for the 11.6 kWh version.
The company states that the system is only sold through specialist companies that have been certified by Hager.

The scientists explained that potassium (K) ions present in KMnO are able to diffuse into the perovskite material to both enlarge grain size and passivate the grain boundaries. Manganese (Mn) doping, meanwhile, improves both its crystallinity and stability.”In addition to the K and Mn ions diffusing into perovskites, several previous works also demonstrated that the direct incorporation of K and Mn ions into perovskite precursors can improve the perovskite grain size, reduce the hysteresis in resultant solar cells and enhance the thermal stability,” the Japanese group explained, noting that potassium is key in reducing the ionic migration and hysteresis – both known to cause defects and performance issues in the material.
The cell was built by depositing the SnO2 film, the perovskite layer, the spiro-OMeTAD film and a gold electrode via CBD. According to the group, the proposed multifunctional interface engineering resulted in a solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 21.7%, The cell was then used to produce a 7-cell perovskite module with a size of 5×5 cm and an efficiency of 15.62%, as well as a 14-cell module with a site of 10×10 cm and an efficiency of 11.80%. The academics are convinced that building a module with an area of 22.4 cm2 and the same configuration of the 5x5cm panel could provide result in an efficiency of up to 13.62%.
“This precursor solution passivation in CBD method was demonstrated as a compatible technique for upscalable fabrication of solar modules,” the scientists concluded.
The manufacturing process is presented in the paper Up-Scalable Fabrication of SnO2 with Multifunctional Interface for High Performance Perovskite Solar Modules, published in Nano Micro-Letters.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the U.S. Department of Energy are soliciting leaders of companies and research institutes to join a consortium of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film photovoltaic advancement, with submissions due in the coming days.
The CdTe Accelerator Program, announced this March, has a mission to form a consortium that guides the United States to a highly competitive position in the CdTe space. Specifically, the program seeks to enable cell efficiencies above 24%, and sustainable module prices below $0.20/W by 2025. By 2030, the consortium will have a goal of over 26% efficiency, and costs below $0.15/W.
CdTe is known for its high light-absorption rates, and relatively low manufacturing costs, making it second only to silicon-based panels in deployment. NREL said that if CdTe research could unlock higher cell efficiencies and even lower module manufacturing costs, the United States could capture a larger portion of the global solar market.

Greenakku, a German provider of solar modules for applications in balconies, has begun selling a micro-inverter that German manufacturer Bosswerk has specifically designed for balcony PV panels.
The BW-MI300 and BW-MI600 inverters were developed for plug-in photovoltaic systems and allow monitoring via WiFi connection. The BW-MI300 costs €149 in the Greenakku online shop and the BW-MI600 €259. Bosswerk grants a 12-year product guarantee.
The only difference between the two products is the output power: while the BW-MI300 feeds up to 300 W into the household power grid, the BW-MI600 supplies up to 600 W. The recommended input power from the solar panel to the BW-MI300 is between 210 to 400 W, with the BW-MI600 the output power can be almost double.
According to Greenakku, the two products have the highest efficiency in this device class. From a module voltage of 20 V, they generate the 230 V alternating current required for the household supply. As soon as the starting voltage is applied on the photovoltaic side, the microinverter feeds the electricity into the domestic power grid. The module output can be displayed, saved and statistically evaluated by the user via a WiFi connection on a tablet, smartphone or PC. A quick shutdown function ensures safety in the event of a power failure.
Greenakku calculates that a solar module with 360 W of power delivers up to 400 kWh of electricity per year, depending on the location and orientation. At an electricity price of €0.30 per kWh, it may result in savings of up to €120 per year. According to the PV product distributor, the price for a complete system with micro-inverter, a 360 W module and mounting system is around €400. In the best-case scenario, the small system therefore pays for the investment again after four years.

According to new statistics released by Spanish photovoltaic association UNEF, 2020 was the second-best year ever in terms of newly deployed PV capacity in Spain.
The association reports that 3.4 GW was installed last year, of which 2.8 GW came from ground-mounted PV plants and 596 MW from rooftop solar arrays. In 2019, the best year in the photovoltaic history of Spain so far, 4,201 MW were installed on the ground and 459 MW for self-consumption. While most of the ground-mounted projects in 2019 were subsidized through the country's auction scheme, last year's projects were mostly unsubsidized plants under power purchase agreements.
Furthermore, in 2020, a year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic, the direct contribution of the photovoltaic sector to the national GDP was €3.7 billion, or a 0.33% share, UNEF noted. In terms of employment, the PV sector employed 58,892 workers directly and indirectly overall last year.
2020 was also one of the best years in terms of regulatory activities. In June 2020, Royal Decree (RD) 23/2020 was approved, introducing administrative milestones to the holders of access permits and modified RD 24/2013 of the electricity sector to allow the development of a new remuneration framework for renewables and the hybridization of facilities, among others.
Also approved in 2020 was RD 960/2020, which carries out the regulatory development of the Economic Regime for Renewable Energy Sources (REER) based on the allocation, via auctions, of a fixed price for the energy generated.
After the RD, new provisions detailed the procedure for holding the first renewable auctions under this new mechanism, with the first one having been held on January 26, 2021. Regarding the results of the auction, PV was awarded 2,034 MW, and it took all of the capacity that was awarded in the technological neutral procurement exercise. 26 different companies were awarded. The average final price was €24.5/MWh (wind €25.3/ MWh) with a distribution focused on average values, with the vast majority (88%) of bids awarded between €22/MWh and €29/MWh.
For 2021, sustained growth is expected, with a wide portfolio of ground-mounted projects under development. As of December 31, 2020, there was 97 GW of PV projects that had obtained connection permits and 20 GW that were in the process of obtaining approval.
In the first months of 2021, 1,314 MW have been installed, and UNEF estimates ground-mounted solar plants with a combined capacity of up to 3 GW may be deployed this year.
Looking ahead to 2030, “being positive, it is expected to reach some 13 GW of plants on the ground and 10 GW of self-consumption”, concluded UNEF General Director José Donoso.

“It has weathered all the storms since November 2019, and these were many!” the company's CEO and founder, Allard Van Hoeken, told pv magazine. “Including the storms named Ciara, Dennis, Bella, Evert.” The installation had to deal with waves as high as 10 meters, wind speeds of up to 62 knots, and tidal currents of up to 4 knots.
“We have tested multiple solutions for key challenges, and we have seen what works well and what doesn’t,” Van Hoeken added. “Overall,  the system has remained in good condition.” He also explained that the achieved results encouraged the company to start the fabrication of the units in order to expand the system to up to 1 MW, with the design remaining unchanged.
“Solar power generation was until now not the major focal point, since our focal point was the structural well-being of our system in the high waves, winds and currents, but solar production was monitored and was in line with what we expected,” the CEO further explained, noting that, in the project's next phases, power production monitoring will be a major focal point.
“We are measuring everything we can, including loads, movements, power production, regular observation and inspection of practically all components, also ecological parameters such as light in the water, water quality parameters such as temperature, turbidity chlorophyll, oxygen levels, and salinity,” he added. “We take sediment samples as well as water sampling for fish eDNA and phytoplankton. We also observe the interaction of our platforms with life at sea, such as which plants and animals like to attach underwater to the bottom of our platforms.”

The 50 kW modular PV system started operating at the end of November 2019. The plant is planned to be initially expanded to 1 MW, and to 100 MW at a later stage. The installation relies on standard solar modules.
Van Hoeken said in December 2019 that solar at sea could end up being cheaper than offshore wind, once the technology is scaled up. He believes that offshore PV could help the Netherlands cover 50% of its energy demand, mainly by deploying solar close to existing or planned offshore wind projects.
According to a recent report from DNV GL, the North Sea may host around 100 MW of floating solar capacity by 2030, and 500 MW by 2035. The LCOE of offshore PV systems is currently estimated at around €354/MWh but in the future it should be close to that of ground-mounted solar parks.
The DVN GL experts are convinced that offshore PV is ideal as a complementary technology of offshore wind, with solar panels being installed in the space between the wind turbines and connected to their transmission lines.
Scientists from the Copernicus Institute at Utrecht University in the Netherlands have claimed offshore PV plants could be more productive than ground-mounted arrays after running a simulation comparing a North Sea project to a conventional system at the Utrecht Photovoltaic Outdoor Test field.

It will produce monocrystalline facial and bifacial modules for commercial and utility-scale projects. A company spokesperson told pv magazine that talks are now underway with multiple states that are interested in hosting the facility.

The line, deployed at the end of March, is currently operating with an annual capacity of 400 MW, the company said.
The manufacturing facility will be able to produce cells with wafers measuring between 8 to 12 inches, which would allow the manufacturer to produce more powerful modules with a power output of up to 700 W.
TSEC invested TWD 900 million ($32.2 million) in the new production line, which raised the company's total solar cell capacity to 1 GW.
Back in October 2015, the company announced ambitions to increase its manufacturing capacity from 800 MW to between 1.5 and 1.6 GW. Since then, however, the Taiwanese solar industry has experienced very hard times due to strong pressure on prices and fierce competition from other Asian manufacturers.

Project developer UPC/AC Renewables Australia has revealed that the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) has approved the development of the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm and 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project near Dubbo, in the Australian state’s Orana region.
The solar farm will be funded by shareholders of UPC\AC Australia, a joint venture between UPC Renewables and AC Energy, which is a subsidiary of Ayala Corp. in the Philippines. It will include about 800,000 single-axis tracking solar modules and a battery energy storage system, which means the project will be able to dispatch energy when it is most needed during peak hours, while also providing important grid stability services.
Upon completion, the Stubbo Solar Farm will annually generate more than 1 million MWh of solar energy – enough to power more than 150,000 homes. Killian Wentrup, the head of solar development at UPC\AC Renewables Australia, said the project will now push ahead with its grid-connection application and the appointment of a main EPC contractor.
“We hope to begin construction by early to mid-2022, subject to finalisation of our final contracts and securing finance,” Wentrup said. “We want to thank the local community for its ongoing feedback, which helped us make changes to the project proposal and to reduce some of the potential impacts. We look forward to continuing that positive relationship over many years to come.”
The project will be developed across a 1,250-hectare site about 10 kilometers north of Gulgong, approximately 115 km east of Dubbo. It will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via TransGrid’s 330 kV Wellington to Wollar TransGrid transmission line, which transects the site.
The DPIE released its final assessment decision earlier this month. It concluded that the project would support the transition of the state’s energy sector to renewable sources and provide stability for the grid.
“It would contribute 400 MW of renewable energy to the National Electricity Market, including a battery storage facility with a capacity of 200 MW/200 MWh,” the department wrote in its report. “Importantly, the battery facility would enable the project to store solar energy for dispatch to the grid outside of daylight hours and/or during periods of peak demand, which has the potential to increase grid stability and energy security.”
The site is strategically located within the New South Wales government’s Central West Renewable Zone. It expects this to help unlock 3 GW of renewable energy generation and AUD 4.4 billion ($3.3 billion) in private capital investment by the mid-2020s.
The project is one of several that the joint venture has in its Australian pipeline, including the 720 MW New England Solar Farm, the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, and the fully approved 250 MW Baroota Pumped Hydro project in South Australia.
