The cabinet committee on public purchase, chaired by finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal, today approved the provision of 40,000 home systems and 2,500 community set-ups, having already green-lit the same volume a week ago.
The solar panels are being supplied for free as part of the government's electrification effort and will be installed by army entity Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory Ltd in the mountainous districts of Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban.
The latest, $50 million installation drive follows an earlier $9 million project in the area which saw 10,890 home systems, 2,814 community installations, and 5,890 solar-powered cell phone chargers provided between July 2015 and June 2019, benefiting an estimated 13,708 people.
Bangladesh boasts more than 6 million small scale solar home systems, with a total generation capacity of around 262,753 kWp, making the country the world's largest installer of such units.
The nation's 766.68 MW of renewables generation capacity accounts for 3% of the Bangladeshi power mix, with the government having missed a target to reach 10% by last year.

Scientists from Germany's Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP have developed a new process aimed at lowering the series resistance of monocrystalline PERC solar cells.
The new technique was tested in partnership with German company CE Cell Engineering GmbH. “Contacting surface structures (emitters) of solar cells with high sheet resistance is already technically possible, but costly,” said Stephan Großer, project manager in the diagnostics and metrology group at Fraunhofer CSP. “The series resistance of the contact structure on the solar cell increases due to high contact resistances, which significantly reduces the efficiency of a solar cell. In the project, we were able to lower the series resistance by using laser-assisted current treatment and elucidate the active principle.”
Through this process, which was dubbed laser enhanced contact optimization (LECO), the researchers were able to identify faulty semiconductor-to-metal contacts in the PERC cells and to establish where there was insufficient electrical contact formation between the metal and semiconductor. Furthermore, all this happened without damaging the solar cells. “The optimization of the contact takes place through a large number of microscopic current-fired contact points, which enable … very low series-resistance between the metallic silver contact finger and the doped silicon wafer,” the research team further explained.
The Fraunhofer CSP is currently evaluating the LECO process parameters for patenting.

SunR began offering PV panel recycling services in Brazil this year, especially to product distributors and systen integrators. Since the beginning of 2021, the company has received 30 tons of panels and expects to receive another 125 tons that should be sent for recycling or proper disposal. Altogether, there are more than 100 disposal requests from all over Brazil, representing a demand of 300 tons.
Although most of the PV systems in Brazil have been installed in the last five years, there is already considerable demand for recycling, mainly for products that suffered accidents, which can occur from transport to post-installation, or that have not passed quality tests.
SunR estimates that for 500,000 tons of panels installed in the country – considering 9 GW installed – 40 thousand tons of discarded materials have been generated. SunR founder and CEO Leonardo Gasparini puts the market value of the material at some R$20 million (US$3,8 million, approximately). “One of the main problems in Brazil is inadequate disposal, not the offer of recycling,” he told pv magazine, noting that recycling is a more adequate and cheaper solution than landfilling or incineration “The biggest challenge, however, is the logistics.”
The company is betting on closing partnerships with integrators that provide deinstallation services and may also start offering reverse logistics. This would enable the reduction of logistic costs of both services, thus lowering the final price for the consumer. The material collected would generate revenue from the sale of its components.
SunR began to be strategically structured in January 2020. Gasparini said that he was impressed with the numbers and growth of the Brazilian market after attending an edition of the Intersolar exhibition in São Paulo. “I left thinking about what would happen to all these modules in a few years,” he explained. “I worked with R&D for EVs and decided to research this topic. I found PV Cycle, which is a network of researchers with the aim of encouraging the recycling of panels. And studying more, I realized that this demand already existed in the country.”
The company is headquartered in Vinhedo, Sao Paulo, where it partially disassembles the panels and recovers aluminum and copper cables, corresponding to approximately 19% of the composition of the panels. “The biggest challenge is removing the glass, which adds weight and makes it difficult to ship the materials,” said Gasparini. In addition to photovoltaic modules, the company also receives inverters, trackers and other equipment from solar generation systems.
Approximately 70% of the panel's weight is glass and 18% is aluminum. The panel also has recyclable materials such as plastic, silicon, copper, silver and tin.
Currently, there is no specific regulation or recycling policy for the solar sector in Brazil. What exists is the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS) and Decree 10,240, which regulates the reverse logistics of electronics in Brazil and which includes PV panels among the products that are subject to reverse logistics. “This is a topic that is being discussed in the sector, if it makes sense to include photovoltaic panels in a rule that applies to computers or washing machines,” Gasparini stated.

Jetion Solar will invest RMB3 billion ($460 million) in the factory, which is expected to begin manufacturing activities in 2023. Construction at the site is planned to start by the end of this year.
“The HJT technology is nothing new, with Sanyo and then Panasonic having developed and produced the high-efficiency technology over decades,” said Jetion Solar CTO Ewain Guo. “However, it has remained a high-performance and high-cost product, which limits its mass market penetration. Given the Chinese PV industry’s historic ability to aggressively drive down costs, let’s just wait and see.”
No more details on the new factory nor the HJT module technology were disclosed.
Jetion Solar currently has a production capacity of 2.5 GW for PV modules and 2 GW for solar cells. Last year, it put into operation a new 1 GW mono PERC cell fab at the site in Tongcheng, in Anhui Province.
CNBM also operates CIGS production facilities at four different locations, including one in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. The conglomerate was the first of several organizations to bring large-scale CIGS production online in China.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/26/icra-offers-stable-outlook-on-indias-renewable-energy-sector/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 26, 2021",ICRA offers stable outlook on India’s renewable energy sector,"From pv magazine India
Ratings agency ICRA has offered a stable outlook for the Indian renewable energy sector due to the government's continued policy support, a strong project pipeline, and superior tariff competitiveness offered by wind and solar power projects, both in the utility and the open-access segments.
Tariffs in utility-scale solar and wind project auctions remained below INR 3.0/kWh (US$ 0.040/kWh) despite the upcoming customs duty on imported cells and modules from April 2022. 
“The investment prospects in the RE sector thus are expected to remain strong, given the policy impetus with a target to reach 450 GW by FY2030 and competitive tariffs,” said Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head at ICRA Ratings. “The capacity addition in the power sector over the medium term will be driven by the RE segment, led by a strong project pipeline of close to 40 GW as on date.”
“The key challenges constraining the growth remain on execution front, mainly associated with land and transmission infrastructure as well as the slow but improving progress in signing of power purchase agreements and power sale agreements by intermediate procurers with state distribution utilities (discoms). An improving financing environment along with the softening in the interest rate for the RE projects over the last 12-18 months period has been a positive for the sector.”
Apart from execution-related challenges, RE developers face delays in payments from the state distribution utilities and grid curtailments in some states, especially for the relatively higher tariff projects. 
Vikram V, ICRA vice president and sector head of corporate ratings, predicted that a recent order by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) favoring developers in Tamil Nadu would act as a deterrent against grid curtailment by discoms and grid operators.
In its order, APTEL stated that the actions of the state utility of Tamil Nadu were “mala fide” in issuing backdown instructions for commercial reasons and ordered compensation to the solar power producers at 75% of the PPA tariff. Further, APTEL directed all state discoms, state electricity regulators, and grid operators to compensate any curtailment of RE plants for reasons other than grid security at PPA tariff.
Further, “while the operating projects continue to face delays in payments from the state discoms in some of the key states, the presence of strong intermediate procurers like SECI and NTPC is supporting the addition of new capacities led by the presence of strong payment security mechanism in the form of a letter of credit, payment security fund and tri-partite agreement with central government, state government and RBI.”
The demand outlook for the domestic solar manufacturers remains favorable, with the strong policy support through BCD imposition on imported cells and modules, the notification of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, and a strong project pipeline from various schemes requiring the use of domestic modules. Also, the non-inclusion of the overseas suppliers in the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) so far is likely to support the demand for domestic module manufacturers in the near term. 
The policy push is expected to improve the cost competitiveness of domestic manufacturers. It has led to new capacity announcements of more than 15 GW by various OEMs and the entry of new players. The timely commissioning of these new capacities remains important to meet the growing demand from the developers, given the current capacity constraints. Moreover, the ability of the OEMs to achieve backward integration and build economies of scale would be important to remain competitive against the overseas suppliers on a sustained basis, according to ICRA.

After few months of operations of its 1 GW manufacturing lines, the company has disclosed a few more details about the new product – the Tiger Neo solar module, which it is planning to launch on the market soon. “Having expanded the economies of scale makes it easier to compete with p-type PERC product,” JinkoSolar CTO, Hao Jin, told pv magazine.
The panel is made with 182mm wafers, half-cut cells, and has a power output ranging from 590 to 620 W. It measures 2465×1134×30mm and has a weight of 34.8 kg. Its power conversion efficiency ranges from 21.11% and 22.18% and its temperature coefficient is -0.30% per Celsius degree.
The operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 to 85 degrees Celsius, said the manufacturer, and maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has an anodized aluminum frame and 2mm of tempered glass with an anti-reflection coating. Its junction box has an IP 68 rating.
Jinko offers a 15-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 30 years is indicated at 0.40% while degradation for the first year of the panel’s lifetime is capped at less than 1%.
“The module is manufactured with a circular solder strip to obtain better optical gain,” Jin went on to say. “Its bifaciality of 80-85% is about 5%-15% higher than that of conventional p-type bifacial products.” According to the manufacturer, the combination of advantages such as a low-temperature coefficient, a low degradation rate, and the high bifaciality ensure that the energy yield is 3% higher than that of mainstream p-type bifacial modules.
The module is recommended for utility-scale projects, but JinkoSolar said that, given its efficiency and reliability, it could also be used for rooftop projects of any size.
JinkoSolar had announced in mid-July it achieved a 23.53% conversion efficiency for an n-type monocrystalline solar PV module based on its TOPCon mono cell technology. “The module's breakthrough performance was the result of adopting JinkoSolar's cutting-edge TOPCon cell technology fused with a new-type of welding and packaging technology,” the manufacturer said in a statement released at the time. “The module design not only reduces the internal resistance loss of the module, but improves power efficiency and module appearance.”

Fast forward to 2021, and today’s top five total over 12.5 GWAC.The intervening Covid-19 pandemic has clearly done little to slow the explosive global growth of utility-scale solar.
In three blogs in the coming weeks, the top solar power plants, solar parks, and solar clusters will be identified. First, however, here’s a reminder of where the records stood in 2019; and how solar parks, individual plants, and regional clusters are distinguished.
Image: Google Earth, using imagery from Airbus, CNES, Copernicus, Digital Globe and Landsat
In most cases, solar power plants are designed and built singly, with the project developer choosing a site with a suitable connection to the electricity grid. Project size may be dictated by the site area available, connection capacity, or financial restrictions. Where those factors do not impose limits, developers aim for economies of scale often by maximizing plant size.
In 2008, the largest PV project – at about 50 MWAC – was near Olmedilla de Alarcón in Spain. By 2012, the Agua Caliente solar farm in Arizona had taken the record to over 250 MWAC. When the previous list of top plants was published two years ago, the Sweihan project was about to be commissioned in Abu Dhabi with a capacity of 938 MWAC (or 1,177 MWP).
Not all solar projects are developed individually, however. There can be benefits in grouping plants together to take advantage of prime locations and strong grid connections.
By the second decade of the millennium, several national and state-level energy agencies had realized that solar power could be produced even more economically if multiple projects were co-located in one area, where they could share grid connection and other site related costs.
Probably the most notable early example is the Charanka Solar Park in the Patan district of India. When this was first opened in 2012 by Gujarat’s then chief minister, Narendra Modi, it had a combined capacity of 224 MW from 19 individual solar power plants, of which the largest were 25 MW each. It has since been expanded to over 600 MW of overall capacity. Agencies of the state of Gujarat arranged the grid connection and leased land to the project developers.

A similar approach was adopted in China most notably in the Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces. This approach lends itself particularly to centralized economies where state agencies can arrange grid connections, land allocation, and other shared services. This model is also now being adopted in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, with a few instances in Europe and America.
The Golmud Solar Park in China’s Qinghai province was the largest at 1,800 MWAC, when the previous list was published. Many of these solar parks have been progressively expanded over the years, with several now achieving combined capacities running into the multi-gigawatt range.
The co-located solar park model has not been widely adopted in Europe and America where energy markets are more deregulated. However, less formal co-location of multiple projects can sometimes be found in areas where suitable land and grid connection capacity is plentiful and solar radiation is good.
The Antelope Valley in Los Angeles County hosted the largest cluster in 2019, with a total of about 3,000 MWAC.

Press reports of the largest solar power station may refer to any of the above mentioned arrangements and may therefore ‘compare apples with pears’. Subsequent blogs in this short series will identify the world's largest solar power stations, distinguishing between individual plants and groups of multiple co-located projects.
For consistency, the terminology solar plant will be used for an individual project that has been developed by a single developer or consortium, even if it is spread over several geographical plots or built in various phases. Where multiple plants are co-located in a discreet area under the coordination of an identified agency, this will be called a solar park. A cluster denotes several solar farms are co-located in an area without formal coordination.
Single plants are often colloquially known as solar farms. Readers should note that this terminology is not universally adopted, and that some developers and owners choose to call individual plants a ‘solar park'.
Also for consistency, all capacities are quoted in MWAC to allow direct comparison between PV and CSP plants (and other forms of generation). Readers will be aware that the DC peak capacity of PV plants is typically ~25% higher than the rated AC capacity, quoted here.
The next blog will identify the largest individual solar plants in the world, to be followed subsequently by solar parks and then clusters.

The Amsterdam-based company posted an €869,000 loss for the second quarter, down from a €969,000 reverse a year earlier, and blamed rising interest costs associated with refinancing its latest solar projects in Hungary, as well as the two plants in Leeton, in the Australian state of New South Wales. The Australian sites have a combined generation capacity of 14.6 MW.
Those grid delays, and recruitment as part of a planned expansion drive, partially offset a 16% year-on-year rise in revenue from the sale of electricity, which pushed up the total revenue figure 11%, by the same comparison, to €9.86 million for the April-to-June window.
With Photon reporting it has added around 187 MWp of generation capacity in its core European markets of Hungary, Romania and Poland since December, the company bolstered its finances by issuing 5 million shares in a €7.7 million fundraising exercise.

An AIP is a framework used by BV to demonstrate project feasibility for novel technologies that are not covered by traditional classification prescriptive rules. It is used to demonstrate technical feasibility to project partners and regulatory bodies.
“This is the first time such an approval has been granted to an offshore floating solar technology, marking the beginning of a new era for this form of renewable energy,” SolarDuck said in a statement.”The AIP covers the design methodology of the unit’s structure and validates the relevant parts against guidance note NI631 on the certification scheme for marine renewable energy technologies, and NI572 on the classification and certification of floating offshore wind turbines.”
The first, 64 kW pilot project was deployed on inshore waters in the Waal (Rhine), the widest river of the Netherlands, near IJzendoorn, a village in the province of Gelderland. According to its developer,  the structure holds the solar panels more than three meters above water, is able to handle coastal sea conditions and hurricane-force winds, and is optimized for offshore sites in estuaries and natural harbors as well as near-shore sites.
“Bureau Veritas is a key name in the maritime industry and well known for their certification of maritime structures. We are immensely grateful for their support and cooperation on certifying our technology and setting standards for the offshore floating solar industry,” said SolarDuck CEO, Koen Burgers.
The company's basic floating platforms are triangular structures measuring 16x16x16m. They resemble offshore floating wind platforms or floating oil platforms. They can be flexibly connected together to form large plants.
“The idea is based on our offshore heritage,” Burgers told pv magazine in March. “Our company is a spin-off from the research department of the Damen Shipyards Group in the Netherlands, a company which uses the best of industry practice to design a reliable solution which is able to cope with the harsh maritime environment.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/26/sun-cable-plans-capacity-increase-for-worlds-largest-solarstorage-project/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 26, 2021",Sun Cable plans capacity increase for world’s largest solar+storage project,"From pv magazine Australia
Sun Cable’s mega project is set to get even larger with the consortium behind the proposed Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) –  which would export solar energy from Australia’s Outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link – announcing it will produce much more electricity than originally planned.
Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin said on Wednesday that improvements in solar PV technology meant the proposed solar farm will be significantly larger than the 14 GW originally planned.
“It will certainly be a material uplift from that,” Griffin told the ABC. “We’re still refining that precise figure but we’ll have more to say about that at the end of September.”
The proposed AAPL already includes a 14 GW solar farm featuring the prefabricated, pre-wired Maverick solar PV system designed by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B. The renewable energy generation will be coupled with an estimated 33 GWh of battery storage.
The project, being developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Barkly Region, is expected to supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,500-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
Griffin said the capacity increase had been driven by customer demand for more consistent renewable energy generation and improvements in solar PV technology.
“Our customers are wanting more electricity supplied on a flatter profile so more 24/7 rather than the traditional load profile,” he said. “The other factor is simply improvements in the technology.”
“Solar PV technology has come over an extraordinary journey over the last 30 years. Panel prices have fallen more than 99% over that timeframe so it sounds like a mature technology, but it actually has a huge amount of technological advancement to go. The roadmap for that is very clear. We understand what the industry is doing to further improve the efficiency of these solar panels and what timeframe that’s going to occur over. And those advances are pretty profound. It’s not a mature technology just yet, it’s got a lot of improvements to come so we’re just taking account of those future enhancements,” he also explained.
Griffin said the expected increase in renewable energy generation will be mirrored with an increase in battery energy storage capacity.
“There’s a marginal increase in the scale of the battery as well but again, a lot of that is reflected in increased efficiencies within the battery technology between now and when the project is built,” he said. “So once again, there’s no visible change to the system it’s just that it’s operating more efficiently.”
While the capacity increase is not expected to alter the physical scale of the project, Sun Cable has changed the location of where its under-sea cable will land, shifting it from Middle Arm in Darwin to Murrumujuk Beach at Gunn Point, about 60 kilometers northwest of the city.
“We had been intending to base our voltage source converters in Middle Arm,” Griffin said. “We were going to supply the Darwin Katherine Integrated System (DKIS) with 800 MW of capacity and then transition to submarine cables through Darwin Harbour and off to Singapore. But Darwin Harbour is getting pretty crowded with prospective projects and infrastructure that are there already and we didn’t need to compete against conflicting uses when there was perfectly viable alternatives elsewhere so we’ve moved that portion of the system out to Murrumujuk. We’ll still supply the Darwin Katherine Integrated System from up there and the submarine cables will transition from there into the sea and directly off to Singapore and avoid the Darwin Harbour area.”
Sun Cable said the AAPL will be capable of supplying up to 20% of Singapore’s total electricity needs, with supply commencing in 2027.
Griffin said the company is still “some time away from kicking off any physical construction” on site but work on the project is progressing with baseline analysis and geotechnical studies continuing.
Actual construction is expected to begin in early 2024 with the first power to be supplied to Darwin in 2026.

Energy Vault, maker of the EVx gravitational energy storage tower, has secured $100 million in series C funding. The investment was led by Prime Movers Lab, with additional participation from SoftBank, Saudi Aramco, Helena, and Idealab X.
The company said capital raised will support plans to ramp up deployments of the EVx platform for customers in the U.S., Middle East, Europe, and Australia. The first U.S. deployments are slated to begin fourth quarter 2021, with a broader global ramp-up throughout 2022, said Energy Vault.
The EVx platform is a six-arm crane tower designed to be charged by grid-scale renewable energy. It lifts large bricks using electric motors, thereby creating gravitational energy. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the bricks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
There is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the raised composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time, said Energy Vault.
 
 
Energy Vault said the composite blocks are made of local soils, as well as materials otherwise destined for landfills or incinerators, including recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and wind turbine blades.
In 2020, Energy Vault had the first commercial-scale deployment of its energy storage system and launched the new EVx platform this past April.
The company said the EVx tower features 80-85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.

The company said its technology can economically serve both higher power/shorter duration applications with ancillary services from 2 to 4 hours and can also scale to serve longer-duration requirements from 5 to 24 hours or more.
With global lithium supply considered a constraint, and, according to the Biden administration, a national security issue, alternative measures are being taken to find ways to store solar and wind energy.
For example, Form Energy of Somerville, Massachusetts, has secured $240 million in series D funding for its iron-air batteries, which use iron pellets. The pellets are exposed to oxygen to create rust. The oxygen then is removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the batteries to be charged and discharged.
