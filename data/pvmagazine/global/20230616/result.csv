The Israel-based inverter manufacturer's DC-coupled architecture allows for simultaneous EV charging directly from solar, home battery storage, and the grid. The charger is connected to single- or three-phase inverters through a DC bus circuit which can be oversized by up to 200%, enabling charging the EV with excess PV. The charger has a charge/discharge rate of 12/24 kW and a peak efficiency of DC to DC of 99%.
The new charger will enable solar-powered vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. It will become commercially available in the second half of 2024.
V2G applications allow automatic charging and discharging of the EV battery based on dynamic utility prices. This enables homeowners to receive payments from their electricity supplier by discharging stored EV battery power back to the grid during demand response events.
Additionally, users can use the EV battery to back up their homes during outages, demonstrating a V2H application. The battery has a capacity of up to 50 kWh.
“The charger will be compatible with both 400V and 800V EV powertrains via a standard CSS connector,” Solar Edge said in a statement.
The device measures 620 mm x 340 mm x 200 mm, weighs 22 kg, and features a 7-meter cable. It can operate in temperatures ranging from -30 C to 50 C and features an IP-65 rated enclosure for indoor and outdoor use.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/16/green-baseload-hub-to-replace-coal-gas-generation-in-eastern-germany/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 16, 2023","Green baseload hub to replace coal, gas generation in eastern Germany","LEAG is looking to build a major renewable energy hub in a bid to replace baseload power currently provided by lignite-fired coal generation plants operating in southeastern Germany, near the Polish border.
The hub will comprise up to 14 GW of solar and wind energy generation paired with 2 GWh to 3 GWh of battery energy storage, as well as 2 GW of green hydrogen production.
The first large-scale project was announced this week at Intersolar Europe in Munich. The coal miner signed an agreement with NYSE-listed battery specialist ESS to build a 50 MW/500 MWh battery system to help replace the 2.5 MW Boxberg coal-fired power station in Saxony, eastern Germany.
It will be commissioned in 2027 at a cost of €200 million ($218.9 million). The initial investment will come from LEAG and partners with potential subsidies at a later stage.
“A key requirement for our transformation into Germany’s Green Powerhouse is the deployment of cost-effective long-duration energy storage,” said LEAG CEO Thorsten Kramer.
In addition to long-duration BESS, LEAG will also install short-duration lithium-ion batteries on site. The company, a leading operator of large-scale lignite mining and coal-fired generation in eastern Germany, expects to demonstrate a renewable energy system at scale to replace baseload coal generation, while using battery storage and hydrogen to replace natural gas for grid balancing.
“If you want to replace natural gas, you need to have long-duration storage,” Aland Greenshields, director of Europe at ESS, told pv magazine.
Greenshields stated that the company's current operations include an 80 MW fully automated manufacturing line near Portland, Oregon. The opportunity for significant deals would enable them to expand their operations. Greenshields identified the primary challenge as increasing the pace of scaling up.
ESS has developed a battery technology that uses abundant materials like iron, salt, and water, resulting in batteries that are safe, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. It claims that these iron-flow batteries do not deteriorate with usage and are resistant to the formation of dendrites, which are needle-like filaments that can lead to battery malfunctions and lithium-ion fires.
ESS systems have already been deployed in commercial microgrid systems, with utility-scale projects now underway in the United States and Australia. The definitive agreements and financial close for the 50 MW system at the Boxberg Power Plant site are anticipated in the third quarter of this year, with commissioning expected in 2027.
LEAG and ESS have joined the Energy Resilience Leadership Group (ERLG), a multi-stakeholder initiative led by Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy and Siemens Energy. The group was launched at the 2023 Munich Security Conference to enhance Europe’s energy resilience.

The Sweden-based company said it aims to become “Europe’s No. 1 direct-to-consumer brand.” It will assemble heat pumps in a new facility in Wroclaw, Poland, where production is scheduled to start in 2024. Aira’s heat pump business will assemble parts manufactured by other providers, according to a recent report by Sifted.
Aira says it makes heat pumps affordable and accessible by offering “zero up-front costs” with a monthly fee payment model. This purportedly lowers heating-related costs by 30%.
The company guarantees a fast, seamless customer experience, moving from the initial quote to installation in just four weeks. This is significant because high demand for heat pumps in Europe has resulted in extended waiting times for the technology.
The company is currently testing its solutions in Italy and will launch in Germany and the United Kingdom later this year. It aims to establish a presence in more than 20 markets by 2030, with more than 10,000 clean energy experts and technicians employed across Europe. Within 10 years, Aira says its heat pumps will serve 5 million European homes.
Aira also plans to integrate heat pumps with home energy storage and rooftop PV. It said in a statement that its complete home energy ecosystem will be managed by its fully integrated digital platform.
“With clean energy tech for every home, Aira is transforming residential heating and accelerating Europe’s energy transition and decarbonization,” said Aira CEO Martin Lewerth. “Today, consumers spend thousands of euros on inefficient, dirty, and expensive gas-based heating. We will make heat pumps affordable and cut energy bills and emissions. Our unique direct-to-consumer model will dramatically change how European families heat their homes.”

“The modules, set to come to market in 2024, are based on 3SUN CORE-H, the tried and tested heterojunction technology (HJT) entirely developed by 3SUN, and therefore 100% European,” the company said in a statement.
The 3SUN CORE-H technology, according to 3Sun, combines crystalline silicon with amorphous silicon layers and ensures superior efficiency, performance, and reliability compared to other products in the market, for utility-scale and distributed generation installations.
The M40 series for rooftop applications includes nine versions, with power ratings ranging from 440 W to 480 W and power efficiencies from 22.9% to 25.0%. The modules measure 1,754 mm x 1,096 mm x 30 mm and weigh 21 kg.
They feature an anodized aluminum frame, 3.2 mm of tempered glass, and a white backsheet. The products operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V and have an IP68 junction box. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.24% per degree Celsius and an operating temperature range from -40 C to 85 C.
The series comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is reportedly 1.0%, and the 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 91.8% of the nominal output power.
3Sun offers a Bold version of the rooftop series, which maximizes practical and aesthetic requirements. It has an output power ranging from 430 W to 470 W and an efficiency of up to 24.5%.
In addition, 3Sun launched a utility-scale series at Intersolar Europe with power outputs ranging from 650 W to 680 W, a bifaciality factor of 95%, and an efficiency of up to 24.63%.
The three new products will be available starting in 2024. 3Sun manufactures the modules in its gigafactory in Catania, which currently has a 200 MW capacity. A capacity expansion to 3 GW of heterojunction modules is scheduled to be operational in July 2024.

Solar producers in this region benefited from higher than average generation compared to average conditions according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via its Solcast API Toolkit.
The high pressure regime that caused record-high temperatures in large parts of Asia at the end of April has largely persisted into May, with below average rainfall and a slow start to the Monsoon.

In April, many temperature records were shattered in South-East Asia in a heatwave that the World Weather Attribution defined as a “once-in-200-years event that would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change.” An anomalous high over Siberia persisted in May, with the heat pervading the region: Vietnam’s all-time temperature record was broken in early May, reaching close to 45°C.
 


The dry weather in South-East Asia was counteracted by cloudier than usual weather in Northern China and South Korea, which generally saw solar irradiance at 80% to 90% of the long-term expectation for May.
Most of Japan saw broadly typical total solar irradiance for the month of May. However, irradiances were about 10% above average for the northern island of Hokkaido, associated with drier conditions over Siberia.
Total solar irradiance was highest over the Tibetan plateau, where a thinner atmosphere means more sunlight reaches the surface.

 
 
Solcast produces these figures via its irradiance forecasting and weather API by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1 to 2 km resolution globally using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

Ex-China polysilicon prices remained the same for a second week running, with most players offering no new price points during OPIS’ market survey. Instead, and extending the pattern from last week, multiple sources gestured at how prices in China’s polysilicon market remain in freefall.

Prices for polysilicon in China, assessed by OPIS as China Mono Grade, continued to break records, diving even further to CNY78 ($10.96)/kg, its lowest figure in almost three years, which also leaves the hitherto-much-discussed, psychologically significant figure of CNY100/kg in the dust. This 27.44% plummet takes the crown from last week’s already-dramatic percentage plunge, and is now 2023’s largest percentage drop in China polysilicon prices.
This precipitous decline comes as China’s market fundamentals also remain unchanged, with polysilicon output continuing to exceed demand, as one source reiterated. Transactions take place in reality at 10% below the figures quoted by large and small factories alike, and wafer producers now have a rather strong negotiating position when placing purchasing orders with polysilicon businesses, the source added.
With the exception of a few prominent manufacturers, many polysilicon producers can currently no longer break even at prices between CNY70/kg and CNY80/kg, and a brutal pricing war is currently in full swing, according to a source. These major producers are expected to continue waging a price war, taking advantage of their lower production costs and larger production scale this and next year to deny small and newer players market share, the source added. In this way, they can maintain their high ground in polysilicon when the segment faces significant oversupply.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The move follows the Romanian parliament's adoption of amendments to Law No. 50/1991 in January. Those amendments allowed PV, wind, biomass, bioliquids, biogas, storage projects, and transformer stations to be built on plots of agricultural land that are less than 50 hectares in size. The government did so by removing a requirement to acquire a zonal urban plan (PUZ), which was one of the most time-consuming stages of the permitting process.
With law No. 166/2023 passed on June 10, 2023, Romania is also removing the PUZ requirement for buildable land. Project developers will also only need to acquire approval for all building permits once. In the past, developers looking to build a 130 MW project on a 130-hectare plot of land, for example, would have had to split the project into three sections and apply for separate approvals for each part.
“It is a clear indication of the legislator’s intent to support renewable energy development,” Daniel Vlasceanu, partner at law firm Vlasceanu & Partners, told pv magazine. “Apart from the PUZ-related exemption, the fact that on the basis of a single urbanism certificate multiple projects can be developed, will obviously reduce bureaucracy and is meant to simplify the permitting of large projects.”
Vlasceanu said the new measures will shorten the permitting process for larger renewable energy projects by a couple of months.

Investors led by Indian chemical conglomerate Himadri Speciality Chemical and Australian venture capital firm Artesian have invested AUD 22 million ($14.9 million) in Sicona Battery Technologies to support the company's work with battery density-boosting technology.
The Series A funding round was led by Kolkata-based Himadri, Artesian, and Electrification & Decarbonization AIE LP, a fund managed by Canada-based Waratah Capital Advisers. New York-headquartered Riverstone Ventures, Chaos Ventures, Investible Climate Tech Fund LP and Club Investible also participated in the funding round.
Sicona is working to commercialize its high-capacity silicon anode technology, which has been flagged as a possible game-changer for the lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries that dominate the electric vehicle and renewable energy storage market.
Sicona Chief Executive Officer Christiaan Jordaan said the company’s silicon-composite anode technology delivers 50% to 100% more capacity than conventional graphite anodes and its anode materials can deliver significantly higher cell energy density than current Li-ion batteries.
“Sicona’s core product is an innovative silicon metal-based silicon-composite battery anode technology enabling more than 50% increase in energy density of existing Li-ion batteries,” he said. “By using silicon metal, and not expensive, supply chain constrained and dangerous silane gas like our competitors, Sicona can offer low-cost silicon anode materials at large automotive scale locally in major markets.”
Jordaan said that the recent funding round will enable Sicona, based in Wollongong near Sydney, to advance its goal of establishing a battery component manufacturing facility in the United States. The demand for anode materials in the country is projected to surpass 1,200 GWh by 2030.
“Due to significant interest in our materials from North American automotive companies, we are focusing our efforts on building Sicona’s first commercial-scale manufacturing plant in the US,” Jordann said, noting that the support of Himadri “allows us to accelerate our mission of becoming a major producer of cost-effective silicon composite anode materials.”

Gregory talked about plans for the near-future at Solis, where his first focus will be “to complete certification of our existing machines for the remaining European markets where that needs to be done. And which will be done in the next several months, so we’re working very hard on this.”
He also talked about Solis’ commitment to go after the utility-scale market in Europe, recognizing that inverters are just one piece of the puzzle for solutions to fulfill customer needs. Gregory says his time at Intersolar is focused on meeting with potential partners, with the ultimate goal of “orchestrating the commercial agreements to make it all happen.”
As Solis grows its team in Europe, it will be focused on attracting and hiring salespersons not only for the utility-scale market, but also for its inverters for C&I and residential applications.
You’ll be able to read the full interview between Jonathan and Gregory in the coming days as we continue our reporting on happenings at Intersolar Europe 2023.
You can see the latest utility-scale inverters from Solis at their booth in Hall B3 (B3.430).
“There are indicators in the battery energy storage sector that we should continue to ramp up supply, particularly in the small commercial market segment,” says Christian Löffler, product manager at Tesvolt. “In Germany, for instance, there are many farmers that have already switched to solar and are now looking to attach a battery.”
At this year’s Intersolar, the German battery specialist is presenting its new generation of battery storage systems, TS HV 30-80 E, specifically developed with small businesses in mind, writes Marija Maisch.
The three new energy storage systems (in 30 kW, 50 kW, and 80 kW sizes) incorporate Tesvolt battery modules, each with the latest-generation Samsung SDI cells. New features include the Sunny Tripower Storage X three-phase battery inverter, from SMA.
“The energy management system in our latest products enables multi-use applications such as self-consumption optimization, peak shaving, and managing of EV charging infrastructure, as well as those we may not even know about now but may prove profitable in the future” says Loffler.
He says Tesvolt’s EMS interface can communicate with any brand for energy generation or on the load side, which makes it particularly versatile. In its next version, the product will be available with a backup functionality.
The TÜV-certified TS HV 30-80 E will be available on the market next month and can be delivered within six weeks to eight weeks.
Tesvolt is offering a generous cash back for end-customers in the DACH region, of €80 ($87)/kWh on the TS HV 30-80 E purchases in combination with its Tesvolt Energy Manager (the TS HV 30-80 or TS-I HV) until the end of September.
At the booth of Austrian PV racking manufacturer Aerocompact, pv magazine met up with CEO Dirk Morbitzer, writes Eckhart Gouras.
Aerocompact is bringing a new mounting solution to market that is specifically engineered for traditional tiled roofs.
Instead of cutting through tiles to mount the racking, installers can simply lift out the tiles and mount the racking directly to the beams below them.
The solution provides waterproof sealing and being anchored directly to the roof beams it allows for higher loads and less mounting equipment being installed on roofs, saving installation time and cost.
As the exhibition halls begin to thin out, Jonathan Gifford caught up with our host in Munich, the founder and CEO of Solar Promotion, Markus Elsässer. He had many reasons to smile.
Across the three days, The smarter E Europe show – of which Intersolar is a part – attracted 100,000 visitors, Elsässer says. And they had plenty to see, with almost 2,5000 exhibitors.
“I hope that everyone will be back next year,” Elsässer said, “these sectors are growing together more and more, the electric vehicles, the renewable generation, storage, power-to-heat, and everything growing together. We are just at the beginning of the transformation of the energy and mobility world into a new renewables, digital, and decentralized world. This is an exciting journey and it is great to see it finally happen.”
The smarter E Europe show will return in 2024, from June 19 to June 21.

The inverter category is set to be hot competition again this year, and don't forget you can enter your products across a range of categories here, from August 1.
Our Tristan Rayner‘s spotted it's already packing up time for some of the exhibitors eager to beat the exodus.
Before leaving the exhibition halls and heading west today, Intersolar attendees can stop by at battery manufacturer Sonnen in Hall B1 – although “battery manufacturer” is no longer really accurate, writes Cornelia Lichner.
For its customers in the Sonnen community, the company is much more: energy supplier, smart home manager, and provider of balancing energy for the grid.
For a few years now, Sonnen has provided primary control power using its customers' storage systems and it has recently also integrated electric vehicles.
If the frequency increases and there is not enough load in the grid, Sonnen can charge a vehicle fleet and, in the opposite situation the battery storage systems can feed electricity into the grid.
In addition to primary control reserve, Sonnen is active on the spot and day-ahead electricity market. As a result, the company has managed to keep energy prices stable for its customers over the past year, according to Tamika Balken, Sonnen Product Manager for Virtual Power Plants.
Other news from the Sonnen ecosystem concerns big storage. The sonnenPro FlexStack is a large white cube. Two are required for the minimum output of 92 kW with 110 kWh and a maximum of four cubes offer 495 kWh and 368 kW of power.
The outdoor storage system is suitable for commercial and industrial customers, for example to enable the introduction of electromobility.
Sales will start at the end of October in Germany, Spain, and Italy.
Turkish solar manufacturer Kalyon PV is showing off its full production capability at Intersolar, from polysilicon, to ingot, wafer, cell, and module manufacturing, writes Tristan Rayner.
A full ingot, cooled down somewhat from its 1,500 C furnace temperature, is on display.at the Kalyon booth. The 228 mm diameter version on show is full sized apart from its usual 4 m length, with production ingots weighing around 350 kg to 400 kg.
Kalyon told pv magazine the factory produced its first TOPCON cell and module recently and the company is hoping to start large scale TOPCON production within three months to four months.
Steel in need of a solar fix after the booths begin to come down this afternoon?
Check out the current issue of pv magazine, which you can subscribe to here.
In the June issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
Towards the back of section A at Intersolar, suppliers of varied balance-of-systems products have their wares on display, writes Mark Hutchins.
pv magazine dropped in to visit UK company Gripple for a demonstration of its cable management system, which sees cables suspended from steel wires and clipped into place using specially designed plastic holders.
Business development director Glen Bills explained the system promises big savings in the long run, since the alternative is to bury cables, which can be a major challenge later on when it comes to maintenance, and can also require cables with higher ratings to offer sufficient moisture protection.
Gripple also says its system should have a minimal impact on production – around 2% or less on energy yield for a bifacial system.
The steel wiring is connected to steel posts at either end of the row, with supports placed every few meters. In some cases, the system can be suspended from the panel mounting system itself, leading to further savings on steel.
While wandering the halls, our Cornelia Lichner spotted this image displayed on a screen at the booth of Eco Float.
The company would say only that the images are from a “competitor” in the segment.
This week marks the launch of Women in Solar Europe (WiSEu), an initiative that aims to address inequality and create opportunities for women in the solar sector, writes Tristan Rayner.
The group, which already has 450 members, hosted its first breakfast networking event this morning at Intersolar.
WiSEu welcomes anyone from the industry who supports its mission and the initiative is sponsored by Solis and Jinko, the founding partners who organized the breakfast event.
WiSEu will have a website within a few weeks but if you're reading this, you're in on the ground floor – the initiative is assembling on LinkedIn and you can find out more here.
Perovskite-silicon tandem cells are often dubbed “the future of PV,” and have been prominently mentioned in sessions during Intersolar – as well as at VDMA’s PV manufacturing stage over in the back of hall A2, writes Mark Hutchins.
Aside from a small preview at Q Cells’ booth, however, the technology is still largely absent from the show floor, suggesting challenges remain in the way of commercialization.
This may be about to change, however. Oxford PV has been working toward commercial production of tandem modules at its site in Brandenburg for a few years now, and when pv magazine met with CEO David Ward this week, he said the first modules are expected to roll off production lines in early 2024, with the line to scale up to its full 100 MW capacity over the following months.
Ward said the company’s focus is now entirely on pushing higher efficiency on “full size” wafers, leaving the higher efficiency records achieved on small devices to academics and research institutes.
The next step for the company will be submitting its module for testing and certification from the IEC and other bodies.
“Commercial size is what matters,” said Ward. “And at this point it’s less important what we say, and time to hand over to the certification bodies.”
“There have been between 17 and 19 battery fire issues in Germany tracked via social media this year, and only one from Senec,” says Markus Linder, Senec’s newly appointed chief technology officer. “In this case, it was only one cell burning.”
Linder says the German battery provider has a strategy of proactively reaching out to monitor non-normal issues. “We harvest the battery cells and modules produced on the same day as the ones that have displayed defect potential, as well as those in a similar use profile, and then we send them to external institutions to evaluate,” he says.
“This is why the low power mode remained for some users, but we have received no complaints. In fact, people would often say ‘I know there is a risk, but I want to run it.' But doing it properly takes time and we need to be 100% sure when it comes to the safety of our systems.”
As reported by pv magazine in March 2022, there were three reports of explosions in houses in which Senec products were installed. After those incidents, the company’s residential storage systems in Germany were automatically switched to a regulated standby mode. Earlier this year, another incident was reported.
Senec has also appointed a new director for batteries: Ramesh Natarajan.
There really is traction building for energy storage in Europe's commercial businesses, says Alfonso Escuredo, country manager for Spain at Kstar.
After a troublesome year on the energy markets, businesses are looking for ways to reduce price volatility, writes Marian Willuhn. Storage and PV are proving to be the shield of choice.
Kstar has heeded the call and is showing its new 100 kWh storage battery at Intersolar.
The system comprises two 50 kW stacks of CATL cells, neatly tucked away in a IP55-protected cabinet. The battery can be kept outside without worry, Escuredo says. The system also features air cooling which distributes any heat build-up evenly among the cells. It also features module-level and cabinet-level fire suppression, in case it gets really hot.
On the outside of the cabinet, Kstar's 50 kW hybrid inverter is screwed on. The inverter can connect to 75 kW of solar power and discharge with a maximum of 50 kW, enough to power the big loads of manufacturing operations, for example.
It is not just high power prices that storage can protect against. Power outages are a real show-stopper for any industry. In such cases, the Kstar system can create a microgrid and keep machines running. If needed, up to 20 batteries can be connected in parallel, for extra oomph and, if variety is needed, a diesel gen-set can also be connected.
Escuredo believes Kstar will sell something like 10 MWh of the systems in Iberia this year.
Life after IPO can’t keep Dean Solon, founder and former CEO of solar electrical gear manufacturer Shoals Technologies away from solar events, writes Jonathan Gifford.
The freshly minted billionaire was looking lean and full of energy on the Intersolar trade show floor.
He’s currently kicking the tires of solar and energy storage and considering making an investment – if, that is, they can stand up to his rigorous demands.
PVEL’s Tristan Erion-Lorico and Sishir Garemella say they have been contacted by multiple project owners about high levels of breakage in glass-glass modules that were not caused by hail or other extreme weather conditions, writes Mark Hutchins.
The independent testing lab representatives say breakage to glass on the rear side of modules is particularly prominent.
The cause is not immediately clear but insufficient testing for compatibility with trackers and mounting systems seem a likely place to start and the fact many manufacturers use on multiple glass suppliers muddies the waters further.
This may be a worrying development for the European module makers on the show floor this year, who for the most part have glass-glass products front and center.
Sometimes simple methods are the most effective, writes Jonathan Gifford. At least, that’s what Pawel Zieliwsk is hoping. He wants to offload 230 hectares in Poland for solar, or possibly wind, development.
The enterprizing Pawel made a t-shirt to advertise the fact. Style meets substance, you might say!
Longi presented its 2022 Sustainability Report at Intersolar Europe, bringing facts and figures to the world of ESG [environmental, social, and corporate governance] reporting, writes Tristan Rayner.
The presentation of the certified report was refreshingly honest. Benjamin Wong, associate director for strategy and public affairs, explained Longi's emissions have risen from 2020, to 2021, and 2022, with Scope 1 emissions – arising directly from Longi operations – rising, in 2022 to 158.2 tCO2e, up from 94.8 in 2021.
Longi's production rose by more than 100% during that time, however, Wong said, with Scope 2 emissions – associated with the purchase of services such as heating and cooling – falling, and the solar manufacturer's efforts to operate using 100% renewable energy remain on track.
Speaking to pv magazine, Wong said: “Without transparency, without honesty, it's just greenwashing,” and he noted Longi's internal support for accurate and detailed reporting.
Externally, the company is also supporting the EU's moves to standardize sustainability and ESG reporting as part of its Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which is being phased in for large companies. In addition, Longi has supported SolarPower Europe's efforts with its Solar Stewardship Initiative, a solar-specific sustainability assurance programme.
Enough with all the words! Let's have a wander around the show so you can get an idea of what's going on.

Because they're so unobtrusive, here's a quick reference to Elio's infrared heating elements, writes Cornelia Lichner.
The company at B5.530 of Intersolar is showing its heating panels for a wide range of applications.
Above all, infrared heaters are fast. When a person enters a room, a motion detector reports their presence and the heating starts with pleasing warmth spreading within a few minutes. The heating goes off again just as quickly as a person leaves the room.
This is a very economical way of heating, especially in rarely-used rooms and it can be easily combined with photovoltaic production, says Elio's Dirk Bornhorst.
Another possibility is combination with a small heat pump or gas heating. These take over the economical, basic temperature control of a room with infrared heating the tips.
A study by TU Dresden simulated the concept and predicted significant savings in investment costs and operation.
Infrared heating will be examined in more depth in a heating feature in the next edition of pv magazine Germany.
You never know where life is going to take you, writes Marian Willuhn. The CATL battery cells pictured above, for example, were supposed to end up in the packs of a shiny new Mercedes electric vehicle. Supply chain disruptions of parts such as micro-chips and cables, however, delayed the manufacture and, after 365 days, the cells are not permitted for use in a car any more.
Now the cells have ended up with Franz-Josef Feilmeier and are winning awards as part of the energy transition instead. The CEO of storage system maker Fenecon bought 126 MWh of the batteries and gave them a new life in large-scale storage.
The batteries have a power rating of 736 kW and a capacity of 1,288 kWh. Inside are eight 92 kW inverters – each connected to its own battery. This modular design ensures high conversion efficiency rates at partial loads, as the system can bypass inverters to increase the load on the units it uses. The design on Wednesday earned Fenecon an ees-Award for innovating energy storage.
And award jurors weren't the only ones impressed. Systems like these are sought after by German PV plant operators, Feilmeier says.
There is a visible trend of co-locating big storage with PV. The battery and PV system are economically independent but they can use the same grid connection, saving a lot of costs. With frequency services and arbitrage business thrown in, project developers can amortize the cost of storage systems in less than four years in Germany.
Manufacturing problems are similar everywhere, says Guy Schaaf, from French large battery maker Socomec.
Grid expansion in cities, and especially in the countryside, is taking too long for the fast pace of the energy transition, writes Cornelia Lichner. Consumers and industry want electric cars and photovoltaic systems now, they don't want to wait until the grid operator has laid new cables or installed a new transformer.
That is why demand is increasing for large battery storage systems which can be entrusted with tasks such as capping peak loads, boosting charging infrastructure, and ensuring the self-supply of electricity is constantly increasing.
Commercial and industrial companies are exploring battery potential and grid operators and energy producers, such as PV site owners, are also in the market.
The trend is moving away from container-based solutions towards a more open, maintenance-friendly architecture, says Schaaf. The new storage systems presented by Socomec have a modular structure and consist of a battery cabinet and a cabinet with the power electronics and grid connection.
Socomec's portfolio has been expanded by the new Sunsys HES L power storage system, with outputs and capacities of up to 600 kVA/1,674 kWh; and the Sunsys HES XXL outdoor power storage system in versions up to 1.5 MVA/5MWh. This will be exhibited for the first time at the ees Europe part of Intersolar, at booth B2.350.
The modular design is not only advantageous for maintenance it also improves safety. Any fire is limited to just one module, components can be replaced during operation, and technicians do not have to work in a cramped, hot environment.
Schaaf expects his company to continue to grow over the next few years by 10% to 15% each year and expects Socomec to benefit from its large team of locally-available technicians.
In yet another sign of solar taking center stage in Europe, chemicals giant Dow has returned as an exhibitor at Intersolar 2023 after a multi-year absence, writes Jonathan Gifford.
With its team representing various Dow departments, the company is looking to provide chemical products to module makers.
Dow is perhaps best known in the PV industry for its supply of polyolefin (POE) to module encapsulant makers. POE offers long term durability and effectiveness in preventing water ingress and degradation. With the expansion of n-type technology, and a related panel sensitivity to moisture, demand for POE encapsulants is expected to increase.
Alongside POE, Dow also supplies a range of chemicals for glass-glass modules and potting agents for junction boxes, among other products.
Filippo Bellini, a business communications specialist with Dow says helping the PV industry manufacture more durable products aligns well with the corporation’s overarching business strategy – which puts sustainability front and center.
Geneverse is coming to Europe, writes Tristan Rayner.
That's the message from the US-based team which formerly offered home storage solutions such as portable battery storage and solar and including its recently launched HomePower Two Pro, a 2.4 kW power station for indoor use that is compatible with solar.
Now the company is targeting the EU and branching out into larger-scale storage and inverters. pv magazine was given a first look at Geneverse's step-up in ambition in the form of unreleased products including a 10 kWh to 25 kWh, modular stacked battery-plus-inverter solution, for an all-in-one home system.
The team was cagey on exact details: the product will launch in the US first, around September, with pricing from $5,000 to $25,000, depending on battery and inverter sizing.
In Europe, the plan is to launch the system shortly thereafter, with pricing less certain.
It can be challenging to scale up production and maintain quality at the same time, writes Michael Fuhs. This not only applies to the photovoltaic modules, but also to connectors.
The Swiss market leader in photovoltaic connectors, Stäubli, is maintaining its grip on around half of the PV connector market, according to Matthias Mack, the company's VP for renewable energy.
Stäubli produces where its customers are – i.e. manufacturers of solar modules and module-level power electronics (MLPE) – and it follows three rules to maintain quality: Firstly, although production facilities are spread across the globe, Mack says, Stäubli uses a few key suppliers for its machines and qualifies them.
Secondly, when it comes to plastics, Mack says it is important to resist the temptation to use new, cheaper raw materials. “Quality problems, such as microcracks, are only noticed years later,” he says. The resulting damage is extensive, because you first have to identify the faulty connectors. That is why Stäubli uses well known materials with a long track record. Of the 1.1 TW of global solar generation capacity, Stäubli has supplied 650 GW worth, Mack estimates.
Thirdly, in order to maintain quality, the challenge of finding good staff at production sites and training them has to be overcome. Mack doesn't just see challenges in production, but also in installation.
“We still observe quite a lot of incidents with wrong installation,” he says – for example, with incorrect crimping and installation in bad weather conditions. Stäubli will, therefore, also expand its support of installation companies.
Not only module manufacturers are expanding, at the same time connector manufacturers have to scale up maintaining the reliability. Stäubli is keeping its market share of approximately 50%, says Vice-President Renewable energy Matthias Mack, explaining how to assure reliability. pic.twitter.com/6k5MbDyaex

Inverter maker TBEA has flexed its muscles, dropping a 363kW string inverter for the European market at Intersolar, writes Tristan Rayner.
The TS360KTL-HV-C1 is already in its second-generation design, following 1 GW of installations in China for the first model. With 6 MPPTs, the 110 kg string inverter is billed as the most powerful in Europe.
The inverter derates at 40 C, to 330 kW; and at 60 C, to 230kW, with a short circuit ratio (SCR) of 1.0 – claimed to be the lowest in the industry.
TBEA also offers a complete MV transformer station at 3 MVA (megavolt amperes) to 9 MVA, inside a standard shipping container.
A TBEA representative told pv magazine the company tests its inverters in China, in both its own facilities and with partners for at least a year before rolling out second-generation products to market.
Other new elements in the pipeline include a 4.4 MW modular inverter which packs into a 40 ft shipping container with an inverter transformer station for up to 8.8 MW of power.
Long a major player in the solar inverter business, Growatt’s Whiskey Lu and Lisa Zhang have told Mark Hutchins energy storage products are representing an increasing share of the company’s business.
Zhang estimates around 40% of Growatt’s global revenue last year came from its energy storage offering and in Europe it already represents more than half.
Looking around the show floor, Lu noted a lot more companies are coming to the energy storage industry and competition is sure to be stiff for the next few years. Growatt, though, can enjoy a “first mover” advantage, along with its established position as an inverter supplier.
The company now advises all solar customers to opt for a battery-ready inverter, even for a PV installation being built initially without energy storage. This way, the customer is “ready for the future” and it will be significantly easier for them to add a battery later on."

There are many solar options for RVs, from parking canopies to mountable solar panels and portable solar kits. Eco-dynamic Tech, an Illinois-based company, has introduced a new solar option for RVs with its rollout solar awning. The 1,000 W array extends from the side of the vehicle, providing shade below and generating electricity from the sun. The awning comes in customizable color options that are highly resistant to fading.
“Solar product should not just be a practical equipment, it can also be a shining piece of art,” said Michael Soon, vice president of business development for Eco-dynamic Tech.
Flexible heterojunction (HJT) cells power the awning, offering 1,040 W of peak power, a 108.3 V operating voltage, and a 9.6 A operating current. The array can be fully retracted for storage.
With under eight hours of sunlight, the awning can power major RV appliances. For instance, it can run a 300 W air conditioner for 26.6 hours, a 100 W refrigerator for 53 hours, a typical laptop for 36.3 hours, and even a 2,800 W oven for nearly three hours.
To store the awning's clean energy production, the company recommends using a compatible battery bank on board. It offers assistance in troubleshooting compatibility issues.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/16/canadian-solar-announces-5-gw-us-module-factory/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 16, 2023",Canadian Solar announces 5 GW US module factory,"From pv magazine USA
Solar module manufacturer Canadian Solar announced a new manufacturing facility located in Mesquite, Texas, marking the company’s first U.S. manufacturing facility.
The module manufacturing plant has a planned output of 20,000 modules per day, totaling 5 GW of annual production capacity. Production is expected to begin in late 2023.
The facility represents a $250 million capital investment in a U.S. manufacturing facility, one of the many announcements in clean energy manufacturing over the past 10 months following the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act.
“Canadian Solar’s new $250 million manufacturing plant in Mesquite will bolster Texas’ status as the energy capital of the world and secure our leadership as a global tech hub,” said Governor Greg Abbott.
Dr. Shawn Qu, founder and chief executive officer of Canadian Solar said establishing the factory is a key milestone for the company as it moves to serve the U.S. market.
“We hope that this is the first of many long-term investments we expect to make in the U.S. as we think strategically about a sustainable and resilient clean energy supply chain,” said Qu.
Canadian Solar is one of the largest global suppliers of tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cell technology. This technology will be implemented in the modules produced at the Texas facility. TOPCon has among the highest efficiencies in the commercial PV market and have high degrees of bifaciality, absorbing and converting light from both sides of the module.
In addition to producing modules in the Lone Star state, Canadian Solar’s subsidiary Recurrent Energy provides utility-scale solar and energy storage project development services. The development business, which has been in operation for 17 years, was acquired in 2021 by the module maker. Recurrent develops utility-scale projects that are among the largest in the nation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/16/wavelabs-launches-high-efficiency-cell-testing-equipment-for-production-and-research/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JUNE 16, 2023",Wavelabs launches high efficiency cell testing equipment for production and research,"Germany-based Wavelabs Solar Metrology Systems GmbH has released two new solar simulators for high-efficiency cell testing, one for use in production lines, and the other for use in research laboratories.  Like the module testing equipment Wavelabs launched earlier this week, the cell testing equipment is based on its light-emitting diode (LED) flasher technology.
The Sinus-360 PRO is designed to be fast enough to be used inline by cell manufacturers. It is made to test high-efficiency solar cell technologies, such as passivated emitter rear contact (PERC), heterojunction (HJT), and tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon).
The size of the illumination area is 260 mm x 260 mm, which means it can accommodate the newer, larger cell sizes. It has nineteen individually controlled LED channels with optional rear flasher, electroluminescence and infrared imaging modules, enabling manufacturers to run several inspection protocols in a single, small-footprint machine.
The research lab-sized, Sinus-360 Advanced, has twenty-seven individually controlled LED channels, and is optimized to test perovskite-silicon tandem cells. A prototype has been in use by researchers at the solar cell calibration laboratory (CalTec) of the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin in Germany since 2022.
“[It] gives us the greatest possible freedom in adjusting the spectral distribution of the solar simulator. Moreover, we are already prepared for measurements of tandem solar cells, which will become increasingly important in the future and whose measurement requires an adjustment of the irradiance of the individual sub-cells,” said Karsten Bothe, head of CalTec in a statement.
The Sinus-360 Advanced was selected as an Intersolar Award 2023 winner at the Munch-based Intersolar exhibition.
