The major solar event, saw solar players cut deals and report prices far below prior highs.
The 7.25% decline is the largest percentage drop in GPM so far this year. Most sources, who were contacted at SNEC or in OPIS’ market survey after, put ex-China polysilicon prices at or below the psychologically significant level of $30/kg. A tier-one module maker has agreed to buy polysilicon at $29/kg from a global producer, according to multiple sources.
Another global producer concurred that prices were in this range, but also indicated that it did not make any transactions at SNEC and planned to cut its deals afterward.

China's polysilicon prices, assessed as China Mono Grade by OPIS, continued their resolute march downwards following the SNEC as well. Domestic prices hit their lowest level in four months at 126.67 CNY ($17.7)/kg this week. Market chatter that the already-brisk rate at which domestic prices have been falling would steepen rapidly following the SNEC proved unfounded. China Mono Grade’s approximately 8% drop this week was comparable to the previous week’s roughly 7% drop.
Polysilicon prices in China are expected to drop below 100 CNY/kg very soon, with OPIS anticipating the critical number will be reached as soon as next month. With discussions of this number swirling aggressively at and since SNEC, one source summarized the discourse aptly, saying “Nothing is expected to stop the slide of Chinese poly below 100.”

AGL has signed an agreement with Melbourne-based SRC to conduct a feasibility study into establishing a facility to remanufacture end-of-life solar panels at the Latrobe Valley site.
SRC is the Australian-owned partner of La Mia Energia, an Italian consortium which has developed a panel recycling process it claims can recover up to 99% of raw materials from of all types of end-of-life solar panels.
The feasibility study will look at establishing a facility to remanufacture end-of-life solar panels at AGL’s planned Latrobe Valley Energy Hub. The study will also explore training and employment opportunities for the local community to build the new skillsets required for the energy and manufacturing industries of the future.
AGL announced last year that it will shut the 2,210 MW coal-fired Loy Yang A power station in 2035, a decade earlier than previously planned, as it seeks to develop 12 GW of renewable and firming capacity by 2036.
The company has since outlined plans to transform the Loy Yang site into an integrated, low-carbon industrial energy hub dominated by a 200 MW/800 MWh battery energy storage system. It is also exploring proposals for floating solar developments, electrothermal solar storage, and hydrogen supply chain facilities.
SRC will be the first manufacturing supply chain focussed organisation to explore being part of the transformation of the Loy Yang site and AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said the MOU marks an important first step in the site’s transition.
“It’s clear that the world is changing, and so is AGL,” he said. “We are proud to be supporting SRC’s mission to find new ways to deal with end-of-life solar PV panels.”
Brokhof said AGL will also recycle its end-of-life solar panels at the company’s facilities as looks to build a circular economy.
SRC Chairman Rob Gell said the signing of the deal aligns with the company’s ambitions to ensure solar generation lives up to the promise of providing clean energy throughout its life cycle.
“SRC was founded as part of a circular solution for end-of-life solar PV panels and to repurpose the materials for manufacturing industries,” he said. “It feels fitting that we are working with AGL as part of their ambition to reimagine the end-of-site transformation of AGL Loy Yang into a cleaner low-carbon hub.”

Its Tego Surten E products are advanced cutting fluids designed for high-speed diamond and multi-wire sawing processes. These fluids are specifically formulated to work effectively with thinner wires in cutting systems.
Evonik's wetting and defoaming solutions facilitate faster and improved wafer cutting, even when using harder or more brittle materials. These products are specifically designed to support high-performance wafer-cutting processes, faster draw speeds, and thinner wire diameters in both single and multiple circular cutting systems.
The low-foaming formulations offered by Evonik feature an “ultra-low” dynamic surface tension, effectively removing cutting swarf and maintaining clear wafer surfaces. This leads to significantly enhanced cut-quality ratios, higher cutting speeds, and reduced dosing rates compared to previous methods. Optimal system optimization can result in higher quality A+ wafers with fewer cutting-related defects, using less cutting fluid.
Additionally, the product line includes coolants that extend the lifespan of cutting wires, providing a cost-saving advantage over time.
The product launch occurred at the recent SNEC PV Power Expo in Shanghai, China. Alongside the introduction of Tego Surten E wetting agents and defoamers, Evonik showcased various other PV manufacturing products, including Dynasylan functional silanes, Vestoplast adhesives and sealants, and Polyvest plasticizers.

“The additional PV energy production achieved with this solution depends on the climate conditions where the case study is located,” Mattia Manni, the research's lead author, told pv magazine. “In particular, it depends on the amount of snow and ice accumulating on the PV surface throughout the year.”
Manni also explained that the icephobic materials tested on solar modules are still far from being available on the market since they present high degradation rates. “Therefore, it is not possible so far to provide information about their costs and the economic feasibility of the interventions,” he stated. 
The research group assessed the snow deposits on photovoltaic panels and the consequent energy losses via the PVsyst software and utilized the so-called Marion’s algorithm (MA) for evaluating the sliding coefficient.
“The proposed workflow moves from an assessment of snow deposits on PV panels and the consequent reduction of plane of array (POA) irradiance to an evaluation of the influence of icephobic nanomaterials on snow losses,” the group explained, noting that this assessment was made for three locations in Norway – Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim.
Through this analysis, which was conducted between November and April, the scientists found that snow losses reached 32.75 kWh/m2 in Oslo, 25.05 kWh/m2 in Trondheim, and 5.85 kWh/m2 in Bergen. The application of icephobic coatings resulted in a reduction of energy loss of 12.05 kWh/m2 in Oslo, of 10.00 kWh/m2 in Trondheim, and of 3.35 kWh/m2 in Bergen.
“Therefore, the effectiveness of the icephobic coatings is equal to 65% in Oslo, 60% in Trondheim, and 45% in Bergen,” they added, stressing that these data should be verified by integrating them with other experimental data from various high-latitude locations and PV systems, while also performing a sensitivity analysis of the ice adhesion strength of the PV panels.
Their findings are available in the study “The influence of icephobic nanomaterial coatings on solar cell panels at high latitudes,” published in Solar Energy.

Germany connected its 3 millionth PV system to the grid this week, according to BSW-Solar. The German solar industry association expects the nation to reach the 4 million mark by as early as next year, with nearly 350,000 new PV systems recorded this year alone. The total installed solar capacity in Germany now exceeds 70 GW.
Homeowners are making significant investments in solar energy, with more than twice the number of new PV systems installed in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year. Carsten Körnig, general manager of BSW Solar, attributed this 129% increase to rising demand for solar technology amid the energy crisis and improved framework conditions.
The popularity of plug-in solar balcony solar modules is also on the rise, and over five million households are already using solar energy from their own roofs for electricity and heat generation. Additionally, Germany has approximately 2.6 million solar thermal systems predominantly used by private households for hot water and space heating.
Germany exceeded its 7 GW photovoltaic expansion target last year, and it appears that the goal of reaching 9 GW this year will also be met. However, the federal government aims to achieve an installed photovoltaic capacity of 215 GW by 2030.
According to the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur), linear extrapolation suggests a monthly increase of 1.56 GW is required to achieve this goal. Körnig emphasized the need to install approximately 30% more solar power each year over the next four years compared to the previous year in order to reach the desired solarization rate.
Evaluation by the association reveals that one-third of Germany's PV capacity is installed on private and commercial buildings, as well as open lands. The federal government aims to distribute roughly half of the target 215 GW on roofs and open spaces.

Sonnen has been networking and controlling its photovoltaic systems, home storage systems and wall boxes in a virtual power plant for some time now.
The German battery manufacturer has implemented a new software solution to seamlessly integrate heat pumps into their energy system. It aims to operate the heat pumps smartly and in a grid-friendly manner, contributing to power grid stability by optimizing electricity consumption. This approach involves activating the heat pumps when electricity supply exceeds demand, thus smoothing out generation and consumption peaks.
In the future, heat pumps may also support the provision of control power, allowing households to generate additional income. However, this requires entering into an electricity contract with Sonnen. The integration process is made easy, as no additional hardware is needed. Installers can conveniently connect heat pumps to the network, along with photovoltaic systems and storage, with a simple click. This streamlines and accelerates the installation process, particularly beneficial for installers with limited resources.
Existing heat pumps can also be integrated if they meet certain technical requirements. Sonnen's first partner in this initiative is German heat pump manufacturer NIBE, and more partnerships are expected to follow. Sonnen Managing Director Oliver Koch emphasized that heat pumps play a crucial role in the decentralized energy system of the future, enabling the transition to clean and affordable energy for all.
With the software solution, the heat pumps are controlled to utilize excess solar power or stored energy for heating water and heating systems. This reduces reliance on the power grid, as the heat pumps tap into self-generated renewable energy sources.
If households have insufficient solar power or stored energy, the solar community provides additional green power. In summer, the heat pumps can efficiently cool the house using solar power, often eliminating the need for additional air conditioning.
“Heat pumps offer more than traditional heating,” said Klaus Ackermann, managing director of NIBE. “Intelligently integrating power generation and consumption allows customers to enjoy maximum comfort at low costs and with minimal environmental impact.”

The ceramics manufacturer and storage provider says its flagship NAS battery systems will be used under a demonstration project for the comparison of performance of stationary storage batteries, the results of which will set performance standards for large-scale energy storage batteries in South Korea.
NAS batteries consist of sodium as the negative electrode and sulfur as the positive one. A beta-alumina ceramic tube functions as electrolyte, which allows only sodium ions to pass through.
When discharging, sodium is oxidized, and sulfur is reduced to form polysufide. The charging step recovers again metallic sodium and elemental sulfur.
NAS batteries are rated at 4,500 full cycle discharges or a 15-year calendar life. The battery runs at temperatures of around 300 C. Both elements are in liquid state when the battery is operational.
The batteries are suited to long-duration applications and capable of discharge at full output for six hours, or at one-third of full output for up to about 18 hours.
NGK says that NAS batteries make 24/7 power supply feasible with solar power for 6-10 hours and a NAS battery for 14 to 18 hours at one-third of the rated output.
NAS batteries have obtained the certification based on stationary storage battery safety standard UL 1973 (cell and module level) and a test report based on UL 9540A standard.
The KEPCO project is not the first one for NGK in South Korea. In 2020, a NAS battery was delivered to electric power systems manufacturer G-Philos for the first power-to-gas (P2G) demonstration project in the country, carried out by Korea Midland Power Co., Ltd. (KOMIPO) at Sangmyung Wind Farm, Jeju Island.
According to NGK, NAS batteries have been installed at over 250 locations worldwide, with a total output of more than 720 MW and total capacity of approximately 5 GWh installed. They are used for various applications, including peak cutting through load balancing and emergency power supply, as well as stabilization of renewable energy and construction of smart grids.
Last year, NGK Insulators entered the perovskite PV module business with the acquisition of an unspecified stake in EneCoat Technologies, a Kyoto University PV technology spinoff. Enecoat develops perovskite solar cells through a wet process based on organic chemistry, a low-temperature coating process, and roll-to-roll printing.

Brazil reached 30 GW of installed solar power, according to new data from the country's energy regulator Aneel.
Of this capacity, around 15 GW was deployed in the last 17 months.
In the first five months of 2023, Brazilian developers deployed around 4.39 of new PV capacity, of which 3.1 GW comes from distributed generation systems operating under the country's net metering scheme, which in Brazil includes all PV systems not exceeding 5 MW in size.
Around 21 GW of the total installed capacity comes from distributed generation systems, with the remaining 9 GW being represented by large scale solar plants.
Of the distributed generation capacity, around 10 GW comes from residential PV systems with a capacity of less than 7 kW.
In centralized generation, there are more than 102 GW of awarded projects still under construction or under development, Aneel reports. Larger projects are expected to support the growth of the free market and supply power for the energy-intensive production of green hydrogen
Most of the distributed solar generation in Brazil is installed at the consumption site itself, with the systems supplying energy to the unit where they are installed.

The company started a demonstration experiment on May 25 in the Aran Islands, off Galway Bay in western Ireland.
As part of the European Union's Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT) project, Mitsubishi is conducting a demonstration on the Aran Islands and the island of San Pietro in Italy.
The project aims to enhance energy self-sufficiency on these remote islands by deploying Mitsubishi's heat pumps, along with solar PV, wind, storage, EV chargers, and domestic hot water cylinder solutions. These islands, which heavily rely on fossil fuels and mainland energy sources, face unique geographical and structural obstacles.
“The project will demonstrate a community-centric approach to energy management for remote islands using distributed renewable energy generation and storage technologies with demand-response to balance power supply and demand,” Mitsubishi said in a statement.
The project aims to achieve energy savings of 10%, reduce greenhouse emissions by 60%, and increase renewable energy use by 50%, compared to a baseline operation case before the project’s start.
Mitsubishi said it is using its Melco heating and domestic hot water heat pumps in the project. Heat pumps can help balance the grid during peak periods by using control strategies to reduce their electricity consumption.
Examples include setting the air temperature target at a lower point, lowering the space heating flow temperature setpoint, and programming the heat pump’s compressor to switch off during the demand response period. These strategies are discussed in real-world cases in this research paper.
The REACT project involves 22 partners including companies and academic institutions from across 11 European Union countries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/02/pv-cycle-recommends-excluding-pv-panels-from-weee-directive/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 2, 2023",PV Cycle recommends excluding PV panels from WEEE directive,"European solar recycling association PV Cycle has published a position paper evaluating the inclusion of PV panels under the scope of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which came into force in the European Union in 2012. The association argues that PV panels do not fit WEEE legislation on multiple fronts and should therefore be excluded from the directive.
PV Cycle argues that solar panels should be excluded from the European Union's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive due to their differences from other electrical and electronic equipment. The organization recommends implementing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation for all renewable energy products and equipment in the European Union.
According to PV Cycle, solar panels generate electricity rather than consuming it like other EEE products. They have long lifetimes and require financing for future costs, making them investment products. PV Cycle highlights the impact of energy policy, geopolitical decisions, and subsidy mechanisms on the solar panel market, as well as their uneven deployment across member states.
PV Cycle invites the European Commission to exclude photovoltaic panels from the WEEE directive's scope and conduct an impact assessment of EPR legislation for renewable energy products. EPR is a strategy to incorporate environmental costs throughout a product's life cycle into its market price. PV Cycle emphasizes that EPR frameworks should be tailored to investment products that generate electricity, as they differ from short-lived consumer EEE products like TVs and washing machines.
If PV panels remain within the WEEE directive's scope, the position paper offers 10 recommendations to adapt the directive. One recommendation calls for abandoning collection rates or targets for PV panels, as they are designed for long-term use and can be repowered or revamped.
PV Cycle proposes replacing collection rates with “Key Performance Indicators” that consider the extended lifetime of solar panels, highlighting the negative impact of the 65% collection target in various member states.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/02/binary-organic-solar-cell-achieves-1931-efficiency/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 2, 2023","Binary organic solar cell achieves 19,31% efficiency","Research efforts in non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) materials have led to a tremendous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs in recent years, with 18.2% certified record on the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) efficiency chart. However, further advancements are needed in non-radiative recombination loss suppression and performance boosting to help accelerate the practical application of OSCs.
Now, researchers at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University have achieved a breakthrough PCE of 19.31% for binary OSCs, which have one donor and one acceptor in the photoactive layer. The research team invented a novel OSC morphology-regulating technique to boost cell efficiency and stability by using 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene as a crystallisation regulator.
They developed a non-monotonic intermediated state manipulation (ISM) strategy to manipulate the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSC morphology and simultaneously optimize the crystallization dynamics and energy loss of non-fullerene OSCs.
Unlike the strategy of using traditional solvent additives, which is based on excessive molecular aggregation in films, the ISM strategy promotes the formation of more ordered molecular stacking and favorable molecular aggregation, the researchers explain. As a result, the PCE was considerably increased, and the undesirable non-radiative recombination loss, which lowers the light generation efficiency and increases the heat loss, was reduced.
The research team took about two years to devise the non-monotonic ISM strategy.
“Challenges in research came from the existing additive-based benchmark morphology control methods, which suffer from non-radiative recombination loss, thus lowering the open-circuit voltage due to excessive aggregation,” says Li Gang, chair professor of energy conversion technology at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
According to Li, the new finding will likely create “tremendous opportunities” in applications like portable electronics and building-integrated photovoltaics. With the OSC technology still in the early stages, further application opportunities are expected when low-cost single-junction OSCs cross the 20% PCE threshold and achieve more stable performance to complement their unique advantages such as flexibility, transparency, stretchability, low weight, and tunable color.
“The latest study shows a record low non-radiative recombination loss of 0.168 eV in a binary OSC with a PCE of over 19%,” Li says. “This is a very encouraging result for the long-standing research on OSCs that I have conducted over the past two decades.”
The researchers described their findings in “19.3% Binary Organic Solar Cell and Low Non-Radiative Recombination Enabled by Non-Monotonic Intermediate State Transition,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/02/new-york-and-ontario-steal-californias-sunshine-as-high-pressure-systems-affect-may-irradiance/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",,"JUNE 2, 2023","New York and Ontario steal California’s sunshine, as high pressure systems affect May irradiance","Solar plants and rooftops across the entire Northeast, Great Lakes and Midwest regions received above-average irradiation during May than normal. Parts of Illinois, Ontario and New York received as much as 25% more than the May average, based on Solcast's data.
New York registered a new record on May 18th, when solar power met 20% of the state power demand, as reported in pv magazine. New York's total irradiance in May was closer to California's average than its own. With California irradiance being below average during May due to winds pushing oceanic clouds pushing further onshore, Los Angeles and San Diego rooftops actually received less irradiance during May than New York's or Boston's.
The sunny May for the Northeast, Great Lakes and Midwest was caused by the dominance of a high-pressure weather pattern over North America. The anomalous high pressure was centered over central-eastern Canada, partly in association with the positive phase of Arctic Oscillation, whereby weather systems contract closer to the Arctic and pressure is higher over continental areas. The high pressure
suppressed cloud-bearing systems and brought cooler, dry air from the artic over eastern Canada and the US, from the Midwest to the East Coast.

Elsewhere, across southern and western parts of North America, including Mexico, received irradiation close to or below normal during May. In a repeat of weather patterns seen during April, the Southeast and Gulf regions, including Texas and northeastern Mexico, received more clouds and less irradiation than normal, due to stronger moist easterly winds from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.

Solcast produces these figures via its irradiance forecasting and weather API by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1 to 2 km resolution globally using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.
