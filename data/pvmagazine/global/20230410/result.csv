The team conducted a global analysis across 145 regions from 2020 until 2050 in five-year increments under a “least-cost” model. They simulated a residential rooftop PV system with SHS using the software LUT-Prosume. The analysis included detailed projections for SHS system component costs obtained from various sources. The SHS components included a water electrolyzer, hydrogen compressor, storage tank, and fuel cell.
The study considers whether SHS is cost-optimized for either on-grid or off-grid operation across eight residential self-consumption scenarios. Some include electrical vehicles, lithium-ion battery storage, and a ground-source heat pump for space and water heating.
The results show that SHS can only be expected in a niche off-grid market, in regions limited to North America, Northern Europe, and Northwest Eurasia. Lebanon, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar could also see small amounts of SHS capacity, according to the study. Regions south of Canada, Scandinavia, or the Baltics show relatively small SHS capacities of less than 1,000 kWh.
“It is presumed that regions with such small hydrogen energy storage capacities are slightly above the threshold at which the SHS with minimum capacities is more cost beneficial than a standalone PV and battery system,” said the researchers.
Notably, SHS is not the least cost option in any of the regions investigated for on-grid scenarios.
“High investment cost and low efficiency of the electricity-to hydrogen-to-electricity conversion via a water electrolyzer and fuel cell and major drawbacks for a successful introduction as a seasonal storage option in photovoltaic prosumer systems,” the scientists said.
They shared their findings in “Seasonal hydrogen storage for residential on- and off-grid solar photovoltaics prosumer applications: Revolutionary solution or niche market for the energy transition until 2050?,”  which was recently published in Applied Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/10/rock-based-thermal-energy-storage-manufacturing-moves-into-gigawatt-scale/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ISRAEL",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 10, 2023",Rock-based thermal energy storage production moves into gigawatt scale,"Thermal energy storage (TES) has shown great potential to contribute to the decarbonization of global heat and power. But while the technology has attracted funding and early commercialized installations, it has largely failed to scale well.
Israel-based Brenmiller is looking set to become one of the first companies in this field to establish a full gigawatt-scale production by the year’s end. “Our 4 GW to 5 GW automated production line in Diona will be switched on in one to two months from now,” Brenmiller’s CBO Doron Brenmiller tells pv magazine.
The equipment purchase was financed through a non-dilutive EUR 7.5 million ($8.2 million) credit facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Brenmiller’s bGen system heat crushes rocks and then stores that thermal energy for minutes, hours, or days. The stored heat energy can be used to produce energy in the form of steam for electricity, water, or hot air for industrial applications. The bGen system is said to be low maintenance, with a lifespan of more than 30 years.
“Our levelized cost of heat (LCOH) depends on what is charging the system. Typically, this is cheap renewable energy, so our LCOH stands between 30-50 $/MWh, which makes it cheaper than gas today in most places in Europe,” Brenmiller says.
According to him, the company has managed to find immediate partners in the chemicals, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and tabacco industries which consume massive amounts of heat that typically represents 60-70% of their energy consumption. “Cement and steel industries are a bit more challenging for us, as we operate in the 150 – 500 degrees C range, and these industries need higher temperatures for their industrial processes,” he adds.
The company has also partnered with large energy companies and IPPs such as Enel. In November last year, the Italian energy group started testing a 24 MWh TES system in Tuscany both as power-to-heat equipment and a thermal storage. In this first-of-a-kind application, the TES is integrated with a combined cycle gas turbine power plant to increase its overall flexibility.
“In the last couple of years, we have seen a huge uptick in demand for our technology and we already have a gigawatt-scale pipeline of projects. But it took us a long time to get there, we have invested more than $10 million over the last 10 years,” Brenmiller say.
Due to the high shipment costs for its technology, the company's strategy is to produce locally – either close to raw materials or project locations. “We are already in discussions in different markets in Europe, specifically Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, but also in Brazil, to establish manufacturing facilities there,” he says.
“Today, it’s not all about lithium-based storage technologies. We see a lot of tenders starting go out for TES solutions and companies are proactively approaching us. There is a significant change in the market compared to two-three years ago,” Brenmiller says.
According to a report from the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council and McKinsey & Co. released in November last year, TES can expand the overall installed capacity potential of long-duration energy storage (LDES) to between 2 and 8 TW by 2040 (versus 1 to 3 TW without TES), which translates to a cumulative investment of $1.6 trillion to $2.5 trillion.
“TES enables this additional LDES opportunity by providing a cost-efficient alternative to decarbonizing heat and high-temperature heating applications. This is estimated to reduce system costs by up to $540 billion per year while creating broader system value by enabling an accelerated renewables build-out and optimization of grid utilization,” the report reads.
This article was amended on April 17, 2023 to reflect that Brenmiller has invested more than $10 million over the last 10 years, rather than half a million dollars as previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/10/natural-clay-additive-promises-gains-in-perovskite-solar-cell-efficiency-stability/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TURKEY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 10, 2023","‘Natural clay’ additive promises gains in perovskite solar cell efficiency, stability","Perovskites have shown plenty of potential as a material for low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells, and PV industry and research community are hard at work to develop processes that can bring this performance to large-sized, mass-produced devices that can stand up to outdoor conditions for 25 years or more.
To achieve this, a wealth of different approaches is on trial. Many of these are based on additives to perovskite precursor materials, which can influence the structure of the material as it grows or form protective layers around more vulnerable materials.
Scientists at Konya Technical University in Turkey discovered an additive that appears to do both of these. They found that sepiolite, a naturally occurring clay mineral largely composed of silicon, magnesium and oxygen, can be used without any alterations as a scaffold layer in a perovskite solar cell.
The group worked with planar perovskite solar cells with an initial maximum efficiency of 7.92%, and found that cells fabricated with the sepiolite additive jumped to a maximum efficiency just over 16%, more than a 50% increase for cells produced under otherwise identical conditions.
The group fabricated more than 150 cells both with and without the additive, and observed that the efficiency distribution decreased markedly for the sepiolite containing cells. The results are described in full in the paper “A novel natural scaffold layer improving efficiency, stability and reproducibility of Perovskite solar cells,” published in scientific reports.
The group also found that since sepiolite is also able to absorb a lot of water, it served to protect the moisture-sensitive inner layers of the perovskite cell from damage, both from residual water inside the cell and moisture from the atmosphere.
While it didn’t work with one the more common perovskite materials that have reached much higher efficiencies than the cells described in this work, the group is convinced that sepiolite can be a useful additive in the search for large-area perovskite devices that can be manufactured at scale. “a natural clay sepiolite as scaffold layer in PSCs leads efficient, reproducible and stable PSCs,” the group stated. “Nontoxic chemical structure, low-cost availability in nature and facile processability of sepiolite may encourage researchers for large area fabrication of PSCs.”

One part of the project focuses on novel electrodes with lightweight fabric-based current collectors for LiBs using a resource-saving technology. This technology requires less use of primary raw materials such as copper and aluminum, while simultaneously enabling higher energy densities, which translates into further material savings from the cell to the system level. Another development focuses on the use of pure silicon as anode material in combination with the lightweight fabric structure of the electrodes.
The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and the work is divided into corresponding subprojects which will be run by individual partners over the next three years.
Porcher Industries Germany GmbH is developing ultralight glass fabrics as the basis for electricity collectors. In parallel, the Dresden University of Technology, Institute of Textile Machinery and High Performance Material Technology (ITM), is developing ultralight carbon fabrics based on a carbon-spreading technology.
In the next step, the developed carbon and glass fabrics are metallized by elfolion GmbH by vacuum processes for use as current collectors. elfolion's focus is on the development of the cathode, consisting of fractal porous solid structures, which are the active component of the electrode. The open-mesh and lightweight structure of the fabrics and the porous coating result in significantly reduced material usage and larger active surfaces, which in  turn significantly increases the energy density of battery cells in terms of both mass and volume.
The RWTH Aachen University, Chair of Production Engineering of E-Mobility Components (PEM), is developing processes for coating the fabric-based current collectors with slurry-based electrode materials. In addition, it is investigating the design and production of the battery cells based on the components provided by the project partners.
Fraunhofer FEP's goal in the revoLect project is to develop a process for depositing silicon on the fabric structures.
“We have to match the silicon layer and the fabric structures in such a way that an optimum is achieved with regard to the gravimetric energy density of the anode,” said Claus Luber, a scientist at Fraunhofer FEP.
One of the research partners, Customcells, coats the novel substrates with electrode paste under industry-standard conditions. Subsequently, the performance of the batteries is tested by electrochemical measurements.
The Institute for Experimental Physics at the Technical University of Freiberg is involved in the characterization of the processed individual components and button and pouch cells. From this, microstructure-property correlations as well as design proposals and processing parameters will be derived for the cooperation partners.
Romonta GmbH interconnects the manufactured cells to battery systems and carries out final practice-related application tests. In the evaluation, cell parameters such as aging and current/voltage resistance are to be analyzed and transferred to the mobile application. This is expected to ensure the powerful performance of the LiB.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/10/battery-hydrogen-vs-battery-flywheel/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 10, 2023",Battery hydrogen vs. battery flywheel,"Researchers from the University of Perugia in Italy have compared two different combinations of energy storage systems connected to photovoltaics: one based on reversible solid oxide cells (rSOC) and batteries, and one that relies on flywheel storage and batteries.
“Our analysis considered annual photovoltaic generation and electric load actual dataset,” researcher Linda Barelli told pv magazine. “We included a statistical analysis to obtain the most representative days, dynamic modeling of the storage systems, simulations to define components sizing and to extrapolate the evolution of annual battery state-of-charge, battery lifespan assessment through application of the rainflow cycle counting algorithm, and a detailed economic evaluation of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) including subsidies for self-consumption.”
The Italian group presented its findings in “Battery-hydrogen vs. flywheel-battery hybrid storage systems for renewable energy integration in mini-grid: A techno-economic comparison,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage The researchers said that the two storage system configurations are designed for applications in minigrids equipped with PV plants.
Their modeling was based on a minigrid with a 245 kW PV system connected to a common AC bus through an inverter, with the connection to the medium-voltage grid carried out through a transformer. They considered the following main parameters: the daily mean power, the daily power bandwidth, the ratio between the daily bandwidth and the mean power, and the the daily mean power ramp.
For the flywheel-battery scheme, the scientists considered a low–speed mechanical flywheel made of steel with ceramic bearings and an operating speed range is 3,500 rpm to 8,500 rpm. For the rSOC-battery configuration, they assumed a rSOC stack that can can achieve round trip efficiencies between 38% and 48%. For the battery–flywheel system, the battery had a size of 260 kWh and the flywheel had a capacity of 180 kW. For the rSOC-battery architecture, the battery had a capacity of 450 kWh and the rSOC featured a power of up to 80 kW.
The scientists assumed a cost of €970 ($1,058)/kW for the PV system and a cost of €411/kWh for the batteries. For the rSOC system and the flywheel technology, they considered initial costs of 2,930/kW and €162/kW.
“It is noteworthy to mention that, due to the current energy crisis, such an index has quickly risen from the last months of 2021,” the researcher said. “Therefore, LCOE estimation based on the short–term electricity price instability might lead to a fleeting outcome.”
The research group found that the system based on rSOC and batteries has an LCOE of €0.22480/kWh while that based on flywheel and batteries achieved an LCOE of €0.18/kWh.
“None of the systems proposed attains the market parity, and the results are rather far from the 2020 IRENA target for PV systems,” the said.
The rSOC+battery combination may potential reach grid parity when the market price is higher than €0.380/kWh and the flywheel-battery scheme may become competitive when market price exceeds €0.320/kWh.
“As main outcomes for this integrated methodology, it appears that self-consumption rewards let the flywheel/Li-ion battery storage system reach a LCOS agreeing with 2021 average market parity,” Barelli said. “I see good applications for this configuration in power smoothing and hybrid storage systems, in order to process the most fluctuating profiles by reducing the stress on other systems which can thus be dedicated to meet storage demand over longer timeframes, resulting in greater system efficiencies and durability.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/10/hydrogenated-amorphous-silicon-solar-cell-for-bipv-and-bifacial-applications/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 10, 2023","Hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell for BIPV, bifacial applications","Researchers at South Korea’s Institute of Materials Science, QCells, and Korea Aerospace University have fabricated flexible, transparent solar cells based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). They developed methods to optimize the cells for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and bifacial applications.
The academics built a 20 micrometer cell for BIPV systems with a substrate of glass and colorless polyimide (CPI), an electron transport layer made of aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO), and a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) absorber. They initially enhanced front-incidence photocurrent by using a laser lift-off (LLO) method that purportedly transfers light-scattering structures onto the CPI while avoiding thermal damage.
“The CPI film was separated from the glass substrate using the LLO method, according to which the sacrificial a-Si:H layer was removed by the laser through vaporization,” the scientists explained. “Thus, laser power had to be optimized to minimize optical losses.”
With LLO power optimized to 196.5 milliwatt, the cell showed an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 88.3% for the CPI substrate, in comparison with 89.5% for the glass substrate.
“The degree of light-scattering in T-CPI films could be controlled by varying the AZO etching time,” the researchers said. The short-circuit current density of the optimized cell improved from 9.11 mA/cm2 to 9.81 mA/cm2, whereas its efficiency for front incidence improved from 4.87% to 5.34%. Its efficiency for rear incidence was originally as low as 3.63%.
The team optimized the rear-incidence photocurrent by introducing a dual n-type rear window layer. It “decreased optical reflection losses and facilitated electron transport at the interface, reducing carrier recombination losses for read irradiance,” they said. The cell optimized for bifacial operation showed an AVT of 36.9% and its rear-to-front efficiency ratio increased to around 86%.
The scientists shared their findings in “Flexible and transparent thin-film light-scattering photovoltaics about fabrication and optimization for bifacial operation,” which was recently published in npj Flexible Electronics.
