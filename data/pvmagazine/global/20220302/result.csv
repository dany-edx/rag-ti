Solar contractors built 5.4GW of small-scale PV installations across the US in 2021, a 1GW increase over 2020. More than half the added capacity came in the “ten sunniest states” in the Southwest and West.
The US Energy Information Administration reported the data, and counts a PV installation smaller than 1MW as small-scale.
Colorado added the most small-scale PV last year relative to its population, adding 45 watts of capacity per capita. Close runners-up were Arizona, California, Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont and Nevada, all adding about 40 watts per capita.
Twelve states added less than one-fifth of that amount of small-scale PV per capita in 2021, and ten more states added less than one-tenth of that amount. That’s despite having good solar potential, as nearly every state has at least 70% of the solar irradiance found in the desert Southwest.
Hawaii maintained its commanding lead in the installed base of small-scale PV per capita, reaching 521 watts per capita. California, Massachusetts and Arizona reached more than half of that amount per capita, while Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey and Nevada all had more than 200 watts of small-scale PV per capita.
State data and regional totals are provided below for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest & Northern Tier, and the “ten sunniest states” in the Southwest and West.
Southeast
The District of Columbia and Florida had the greatest small-scale PV additions per capita. The region added 666MW of small-scale PV overall.

Northeast
Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont had the greatest small-scale PV additions per capita. The region added 1.07GW of small-scale PV overall.

Midwest & Northern Tier
Illinois and Idaho had the greatest small-scale PV additions per capita. The region added 720MW of small-scale PV overall.

Ten Sunniest States
Colorado, Arizona, California and Nevada had the greatest small-scale PV additions per capita. The region added 2.9GW of small-scale PV overall.

The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) has responded to comments by Vicente C Sotto III, the leader of the nation's Senate, about plans to roll out multi-hectare solar-powered irrigation systems, by stating it has already installed one such facility, as well as hundreds of smaller scale solar pumps and a floating solar pilot project.
In our latest edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
An article published on the NIA website yesterday said Sotto and fellow senator Panfilo M Lacson had told the Politiko news website about plans to use state funding to finance the roll-out of solar irrigation systems on plantations and paddy fields.
In response, the irrigation authority said it had already invested PHP1.52 billion (US$29.6 million) installing 333 solar pumps across the nation which could irrigate 6,480ha and benefit 8,467 farmers. Based on those numbers, the NIA said, each unit of horsepower generated by the solar pumps required PHP360,000 (US$7,010) and each hectare watered, PHP234,000 (US$4,560).
The government body said it installed a 200kW, 2,500m2 floating solar demo project at the Magat reservoir, on the island of Luzon, in June 2019 and would offer up sites for similar projects on its other bodies of water, including the Pantabangam Dam, in the Nueva Ecija province of Luzon; and the Jalaur Dam, in the Iloilo province of Panay island, in the Western Visayas region.
Regarding the larger irrigation systems referred to by the senators, the NIA said it had already installed a five-station, 50-panel facility capable of watering 25ha of cornfields in Barangay Pacuan, in the Pangasinan province on Luzon.

Billed as the world’s most ambitious regenerative tourism development, the project will feature a 320MW solar array and a 1.2GWh battery with the goal of having the mega development 100% powered by renewable energy.
The contract for the off-grid battery energy storage system, the largest of its kind, was awarded to Chinese tech giant Huawei Digital Power last year.
The system is sized to meet the initial scale of the project and can be expanded in line with the complex around it. The solar-plus-storage facility has been designed to enable the Red Sea Project to remain off-grid and powered by renewables, with phase one expected to launch late this year – with the opening of its first hotels – and to be completed next year.
The $1.3 billion financial close for the project's infrastructure has been announced by a development consortium featuring 50% state-owned Saudi energy company ACWA Power, Chinese state-owned entity SPIC Huanghe Hydropower Development Company, and the Saudi Tabreed Cooling Company. The senior debt, denominated in dollars and riyals, will be provided by a consortium of Saudi and international banks.
A joint venture in which ACWA holds a 50% stake was appointed by the The Red Sea Development Company entity – owned by Saudi wealth fund the Public Investment Fund (PIF) – to design, build, operate and transfer The Red Sea Project’s utilities infrastructure under a 25-year offtake contract. The infrastructure contract includes the provision of drinking water, wastewater treatment, district cooling, and solid waste treatment for 16 hotels, an international airport and other facilities that will make up phase one of the development.
“We’re proud to be the provider of all utility services to the very exacting zero-carbon-emission, zero waste, and zero plastic standards and are delighted to have achieved this milestone on yet another path-breaking project that is helping to meet the clean energy ambitions of Vision 2030,” said Paddy Padmanathan, CEO and vice chairman of ACWA Power.
The financing announcement comes after a financial close The Red Sea Development Company achieved last month on its debt facilities for the project, to the tune of $3.76 billion. That loan was said to be the first ever riyal-denominated green finance credit facility.
The Red Sea Project – owned by the PIF, which is at the center of the kingdom's Vision 2030 plans to pivot the economy to be less oil-dependent –has said it has already passed significant milestones and work is on track to welcome the first guests this year. Upon completion, in 2030, The Red Sea Project is set to comprise 50 resorts built across 22 islands and six inland sites.

Madrid-based start-up Polar Development has launched, at the Mobile World Congress Barcelona 2022, a portable photovoltaic power generation system for low consumption applications which looks like a pull-along travel case.
The case is available in three different sizes and can host solar panels with an aggregate capacity of 200W, 600W, and 1000W.
“It is a trolley with a robust design, conceived to be easily transported, capable of supplying electrical energy wherever it is needed,” the manufacturer said. “It is equipped to start working in a very short time and also has a battery that allows photovoltaic energy to be stored for later use.”
The device integrates various current outlets that enable it to recharge, simultaneously, mobile phones, tablets or computers, as well as all kinds of low-consumption electronic devices such as small appliances or electric tools, by simply unfolding the solar panels and connecting them.
Polar Developments has also developed this technology to create medium and high power systems, called PolarGreen Tow and PolarGreen Container, that are claimed to be capable of providing 6.5kW and 82kW, respectively.
These products are already emerging as a unique and revolutionary solution to meet the energy needs of refugee camps or housing areas that have suffered a power outage, for example due to a natural disaster, or even to be able to organize a concert or event in a remote location.

France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has published new statistics for solar and wind energy deployment for 2021.
The figures show that the country, at the end of December, reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 13.99GW, of which 13.33GW are located in mainland France.
The ministry also reported that new PV systems with a combined capacity of 2,792MW were connected to the French grid last year, which compares to 1,192MW a year earlier. Last year's newly installed capacity was also over 100MW higher than that predicted by French renewable energy association SER in mid-February.
This very strong increase can be explained by an increase in the number of installations in general and of utility scale projects in particular. In fact, around 66% of the newly installed power comes from installations of more than 250kW, which only represent less than 1% of the number of new connections. Smaller installations, of less than 9kW, account for 83% of the number of newly connected units and 7% of new power.
As of December 31, the aggregate capacity of queued solar projects with a grid-connection request reached 11.52GW, of which 9.38GW is for projects exceeding 250kW in size.
The ministry also revealed that all the PV systems were able to generate 14.8TWh of electricity in France last year. This was enough to cover around 3.1% of total power demand.

“Around 94% of this capacity comes from utility scale solar plants built without subsidies,” Flemming Vejby Kristensen, from the Danish trade body, told pv magazine. “And the remaining share is mainly represented by commercial and industrial PV systems.”
Unsubsidized large scale PV projects, according to Vejby Kristensen, are constantly gaining market share in a market dominated by the wind power renewable energy source, as more and more big corporations are willing to have clean electricity from the solar source, regardless of the economic profitability that big PV facilities can ensure for their owners. “Through power purchase agreements, these corporations may have agreed to buy power at a slightly higher price that than of grid electricity at the time of the signing of the deals, before the current energy price crises,” Vejby Kristensen further explained. “But they also ensured a stable price for several years while increasing their renewable energy share, which in Denmark is a crucial factor for a company's image and success.”
According to provisional numbers provided by Solcelleforening, large scale solar accounted for 631.2MW of the solar power installed last year while industrial and commercial installations reached 22.6MW and residential arrays reached a total 13.8MW. For comparison, in 2020 Denmark deployed a total of 244MW, of which 202.6MW were for utility scale projects.
“In 2022 and 2023, we may see even a bigger growth,” Vejby Kristensen added. “And grid-parity PV plants will still have the lion's share, despite rising modules prices.”
According to him, in fact, the LCOE of PV plants is not rising as much as panel and inverter prices and the fundamentals of building more solar parks without subsidies remain strong. “This was also shown by the most recent auctions held by the Danish authorities, which showed the price of solar has now become competitive with that of onshore wind,” he further explained. “And the wind industry is particularly strong here.”
As for the failed technology-neutral auction held by the Danish authorities last year, for which no bid was submitted, Vejby Kristensen stated that this failure was due to the possibility that the current government will introduce a grid fee for renewable energy power plants, starting from 2023. “This measure is currently being discussed and it is still unclear if it will be implemented,” he emphasized. “However, this possibility has created uncertainty among potential investors and I would say it was the main reason for the auction's failure. On the other hand, it also showed that renewables auctions are no longer necessary, as grid-parity projects keep proliferating in Denmark.”
Referring to the rooftop segment, Vejby Kristensen explained that current net metering rules are ensuring some good development levels, especially for commercial and industrial projects. “The current electricity prices have significantly reduced payback time for rooftop PV arrays and more growth should materialize this and next year,” he also stated, noting that current incentives for heat pumps may also become a driver for more volumes in the residential segment. “The Danish government is pushing for more heating powered by renewables.”
The scheme is open to companies specializing in district heating and offers rebates covering up to 15% of the total investment made to buy and install a heat pump, with developers being eligible for a maximum of DKK5 million (€672,000) for each project.

But given that they need to be same size as the batteries they are connected to, supercapacitors are often too large for most applications in consumer electronics or electric cars.
Now, researchers at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have developed a method that represents a potential breakthrough in the production of micro supercapacitors. The method addresses one of the main challenges – their compatibility with other components in a system circuit.
The researchers have developed micro supercapacitors, also known as system-on-a-chip, which are so small that they can fit on the system circuits that control various functions in mobile phones, computers, electric motors, and most consumer electronics goods. They have demonstrated a manufacturing process in which micro supercapacitors are integrated with the most common way to manufacture system circuits: complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS).
“We used a method known as spin coating, a cornerstone technique in many manufacturing processes. This allows us to choose different electrode materials,” says Agin Vyas, a doctoral student in the microtechnology and nanoscience department at Chalmers University of Technology. “We also use alkylamine chains in reduced graphene oxide, to show how that leads to a higher charging and storage capacity.”
Micro supercapacitors fabricated through spin coating graphene-oxide often suffer from insufficient electrode thicknesses, leading to low energy densities. However, the researchers have addressed this by using the alkylamine chains for enhanced electrode thickness, high capacitance, and lower series resistance. They said the method is scalable and reduces manufacturing costs.
Their research paper, “Alkyl-Amino Functionalized Reduced-Graphene-Oxide–heptadecan-9-amine-Based Spin-Coated Microsupercapacitors for On-Chip Low Power Electronics,” was recently published in Physica Status Solidi B.

Researchers at Adelaide’s Flinders University have developed a 2.8V organic polymer rechargeable battery. While the polymers used in the battery are not yet biodegradable, the team will soon switch to natural polymers like that found in seaweed – an application other Flinders researchers are examining.
The use of polymers in the battery is paramount, though hardly obvious. Plastic (a synthetic polymer) is typically used to insulate and stop electrical currents conducting, so it hardly seems a battery material frontrunner, especially for an electrode.
How Zhongfan Jia, a senior lecturer in chemistry at Flinders University’s Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, and his team have been able to use polymers is by chemically modifying them at a molecular level, something which they do in two different processes to allow both the storage and cycling of energy. (More on this modification process below.)
Currently, the Flinders polymer battery has an energy density just under 100mAh/g (milliampere-hours per gram), though the team is now working on the next generation and hopes they can double that capacity. If the polymer battery could reach 200mAh/g, Dr Jia says it would bring it in line with the capacity of lithium batteries sold just a few years ago. “That will compete,” Jia told pv magazine Australia.
What motivates the intercontinental researchers is the potential for biodegradable polymer batteries to solve the waste issue of batteries and global reliance on mined, rare materials. Moreover, the batteries could have novel high-tech applications as they are flexible and non-toxic, making them suitable for fields like biotech and beyond. “That’s something we only talk about at scientific conferences, not too much to the general public,” Jia said.
“We do know that we cannot completely replace the li-ion battery,” Dr Jia said, pointing to superiority of lithium-ion batteries voltage. “We don’t want to replace the Tesla car battery… but in our daily lives there are so many small batteries in use that are discarded.” Alongside novel high-tech applications, this is where Jia sees the most potential for the batteries, including in things like electric toothbrushes and other rechargeable appliances. Currently, his team has 100 to 200 cycles on its battery, though the plan is to reach 1,000.
Polymers and biodegradability
Most polymers used today are synthetic and come from petroleum, but they can also occur naturally in things like seaweed. Dr Gia and his collaborators’ plan is to use “materials directly from nature” in future iterations of the battery. “Next stage is we are trying to make the polymer that can degrade if you discard [the battery] in the environment only from sunshine, water and oxygen… within six months to a year.”
How it would be possible for these natural materials to store and cycle electricity is through, as mentioned, modification. The kind of battery the team has built is called a radical battery, because it uses a stable radical molecule called a TEMPO radical. A small molecule, this TEMPO radical needs to be attached to something, or else it “cannot make a certain shape, they don’t have mechanic force,” Jia said.
Which is where polymers come in. “Polymers can make your chairs, desk, boat, any shape of material that you can make. That’s the beauty of the material,” Jia stated. “We are now making this radical on the polymer… because the polymer has the property you can use [to make the battery].”
This is the first polymer modification. The second comes in the battery’s electrode, which Jia describes as “judiciously” designed. “We are now trying to store the energy in polymer,” the researcher said. “To achieve that is really difficult,” he added, noting that polymers are not conductive.
To make it conduct, the polymer has to be mixed with carbon materials on a molecular level. “Only when you do that can you use all your materials to store energy. Otherwise, if there’s some aggregation, if the polymers aggregate together, then only the surface can store energy,”  Jia said. “We try to modify the polymer not only with the TEMPO radical to store the energy, but we also modify that polymer with other function and that function can stick on the carbon materials.”
Jia has been working with polymers for over 20 years, but only started researching their use in batteries around six years ago – a period which saw a marked increase in interest in this area. Jia’s team in Adelaide has been working in collaboration with Kai Zhang from the Zhejiang Sci-Tech University in China, who was a PhD student of Jia’s in Australia. The team also collaborates with researchers in Japan, Texas, at the University of Queensland and the Australian National University (ANU).
In terms of commercialization, Jia said that is still a way off. The materials needed to make the TEMPO radical are cheap, acetone and ammonium, but creating the radical does require a few steps, Jia explained. “It’s not as expensive as you think, it’s pretty cheap. But of course, when you make this into a real material to use for the battery, there are some stages [for it] to be optimized and I think that’s probably something we need to consider in the following years.”

The scientists used two sub-three-electrode electrochemical cells in a simultaneous bifacial Cu-plating process and cyclic voltammetry (CV), which is an electrochemical technique commonly utilized to analyze the reduction and oxidation processes of molecular species, was applied to control that the process was well controlled. “The applied potential on one sub-cell on one side of the wafer would unavoidably influence the other conductive side of the wafer, thus somehow interacting with the electrochemical process in the other sub-cell on the other side of the wafer,” they explained. “In other words, the bifacial Cu deposition rates on both sides of the wafer can be controlled at the same level, but they are not the same as that of monofacial deposition.”
They also fabricated a new type of hybrid-shaped Cu finger consisting of a rectangular bottom part and a round top part and integrated it into the cell through a 2-step electrochemical deposition process. “With this approach, we improved finger adhesion and achieved relatively uniformly distributed Cu fingers,” they also stated.
The performance of the Cu-plated solar cell was compared to that of a reference device built by screen printing (SP) and relying on silver (Ag) contacts. The analysis showed that the copper-based device was able to outperform the reference cell both optically and electrically. “Specifically, the cell with SP-Ag showed lower open-circuit voltage, with respect to the Cu-plated cell,” the research team specified. “This could be partially caused by the Ag penetration into wafer bulk, which induces more recombination centers at the metal and silicon interfaces.”
The Cu-plated cell achieved an efficiency of 22.02%, an open-circuit voltage of 716mV, a short-circuit current of 38.07mA cm2, and a fill factor of 80.76%. The SC cell achieved a slightly higher efficiency of 22.12% and a lower open-circuit voltage of 710mV, with the short-circuit current and fill factor being 37.24 mA cm2 and 76.11%, respectively.
A full description of the solar cell is provided in the paper Controllable Simultaneous Bifacial Cu-Plating for High-Efficiency Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells, published in RRL Solar. The research group is formed by scientists from the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands and Nankai University in China.

Erthos produces “earth-mount” solar arrays that sit flat on the ground, with no mounts or trackers below them. It recently announced the closing of a $17.5 million Series B funding round to scale up its business. It has an active project pipeline of more than 2.5GW.
The prevailing utility-scale solar standard is to use single-axis trackers to increase production throughout the day. Erthos’ model defies this standard by instead opting to cut material and maintenance costs, while also cutting land costs by increasing panel density.
While this model might have been more challenging in the past, solar module prices have come down dramatically over the years. Erthos said that at current prices, it is more cost-effective to buy additional solar modules to make up for the loss of efficiency that occurs when developers do not use trackers.
Capricorn Investment Group, which is known for participating in the Tesla and SpaceX launch, led the Series B round.
“We see in Erthos a unique opportunity where simplicity and speed to market is coupled with an enormous ability to effect change,” says Ion Yadigaroglu, partner at Capricorn. “Additionally, declining module prices, increasing steel prices, and rampant supply chain problems are creating enormous tailwinds for Erthos.”
The investment follows a $7.4 million Series A round in 2019, which launched the company and helped it finalize its earth-mount system architecture. It also funded the development of an autonomous cleaning robot that drives over the surface of the panels to clean them.
It said it can install projects in half the time of utility-scale plants, at nearly half the cost, running under $0.50/W. Earth-mount solar requires 70% less cable, 70% less underground trenching, and very little water consumption, said Erthos.
The design eliminates the use of gaps between rows and the array is installed as a large, unified sheet, and Erthos said this allows their project to use one-third the land area of a conventional utility-scale solar design. The panels lay completely flat on the ground, which is why Erthos says its projects are resistant to category-four hurricanes.

It noted that the latest round of funding will help it begin the site selection process for its first US-based battery factory. It said it will also accelerate R&D in Michigan and San Francisco.
In January, ONE created a proof-of-concept device with 732 miles of range. In another pilot, the company paired a Tesla Model S with an experimental battery with 203.7kWh and an energy density of 416Wh/L. The battery was able to power the Model S at 55 miles per hours for 882 miles on a single charge, as validated by third-party testing.
“ONE’s core principles of doubling the range, decreasing the cost of the batteries and creating a local supply chain, resonated strongly with us at BMW i Ventures,” said Baris Guzel, partner at BMW i Ventures. “ONE’s battery factory in the US is an important step for the larger electric vehicle value chain, and ONE has the potential to truly transform the ecosystem.”
The company builds lithium-ferro-phosphate batteries, which don't need earth-rare cobalt, said ONE. It currently has two proof-of-concept battery models: the Aries and the larger Gemini, which was used in the Tesla demonstration. ONE said it will begin Aries production in late 2022, and will demonstrate a production-level prototype of Gemini in 2023.

Luminous Power Technologies has unveiled new Li-ON series inverters with integrated lithium-ion batteries as a compact, safe and efficient power backup solution for the retail and domestic segments. The new plug-and-play inverters provide solid performance with negligible maintenance compared to conventional lead-acid battery-based inverters, said the company.
The integrated lithium battery promises a lifetime that is three times longer than conventional lead-acid batteries. In addition, the inverter supports fast charging and can completely charge the battery with grid electricity in just four hours.
Li-ON 1250, the first in the Li-ON series, features a battery management system (BMS) that manages the performance of both the inverter and the battery, thereby increasing its performance and life. The 1,100VA inverter can run a maximum of 880W of load and is ideal for running up to a three-bedroom house or a large showroom with a backup time of more than three hours at 50% load. An advanced LCD screen displays running statistics like battery charging time and backup time.
“The product supports energy efficiency with less power required to charge the lithium-ion battery than the lead-acid battery. In addition, the lithium battery provides a consistent backup over its lifecycle,” Amit Shukla, senior vice president of the power solutions business at Luminous Power Technologies, told pv magazine.
Space is not a constraint with Li-ON integrated inverters, said Shukla.
“Customers need not look for a separate space to keep this inverter as it’s quite compact, approximately 60% lesser in size than lead-acid battery-based solutions,” he added.
The Li-ON power backup solution is safe because it eliminates the risk of accidental contact by doing away with wires and terminals. Its pure sine wave output protects connected appliances from voltage surges and short circuits.
“Overall, the product is designed to offer new-age features which add value to the lives of the consumer. Three times longer battery life, three times faster charging, consistent backup time, maintenance-free and five-years warranty are real differentiators and drivers for any consumer to buy this product,” said the company.
Loads supported by the 1,100VA model include lighting, TV sets, refrigerators, audio systems, fans, and computers but not air-conditioners and microwave ovens.
“The electronics part, including the battery management system, is in-house designed and manufactured by Luminous. So, we are only outsourcing the battery component. Moving forward, we plan to start assembling batteries too in-house only,” said Shukla.
Luminous plans to launch more products in this segment with this technology by the end of the year. It is also working on other lithium technology products that are ready to connect to solar power.
Its Li-ON integrated inverter is priced at approximately INR 50,000 ($660) in India. The company plans to rely on its existing sales network of more than 35,000 distributors and dealers to reach households across the country.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/02/roadmap-for-solar-module-recycling-in-bangladesh/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"MARCH 2, 2022",Roadmap for solar module recycling in Bangladesh,"Bangladesh started deploying its first solar panels in the early 2000s and now some of these modules are close to the end of their lifecycles, which means they will have to be recycled.
However, the country does not have any policies in place for solar PV waste management. Its recently enacted e-waste management rules do not consider solar module waste as electronic waste.
“PV waste management will be a big challenge if we do not take steps just now,” Mostafizur Rahman, a researcher at Bangladesh Jahangirnagar University, told pv magazine.
Rahman and a group of scientists investigated the country's potential for PV module recycling in “Current challenges and future perspectives of solar-PV cell waste in Bangladesh,” which was recently published in Heliyon. They concluded that the management of end-of-life solar modules could be turned into a huge business opportunity if decisive steps are taken as soon as possible.
“We need a national guideline on solar panel waste management and turn them into resources,” he added.
The research group said that between 2025 and 2060, PV waste in Bangladesh could reach a total of 5.496 million tons, including 874,134 tons of glass, 77,206 tons of plastic, 121,407 tons of aluminum, 39,487 tons of silicon, and 6,719 tons of copper.
“In Bangladesh, a dedicated PV cell recycling system is currently unavailable,” the report said. “Therefore, a huge scope of resource recovery from wasted PV cells might be lost along with escalating environmental threats.”
The paper also notes that there are no PV waste recycling centers in Bangladesh at present. However, recycling centers could be established by enacting guidelines that could help to turn the country into a regional hub for solar module recycling. Several neighboring countries, such as Myanmar, currently have zero capacity for end-of-life PV module management.
“In northeastern India, the seven sister states of India are the contiguous states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Manipur. It is not practically feasible to connect with the e-waste recycling centers of India for these states. In that case more practical and cheaper option to transport PV wastes from these states may be to Bangladesh,” the researchers said, noting that new provisions could help the country to take advantage of this strategic potential.
Razinara Begum, an official in Bangladesh's Department of Environment, said e-waste management rules have been prepared, but PV waste management has once again not been included.
“Various guidelines will be prepared under the rules where solar waste management can be added,” Begum told pv magazine.
Dipal C Barua, the president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, said most PV waste will start coming in 2025.
“We need to find out a mechanism for PV waste recycling. Already the battery wastes got resale value thus properly managed,” he told pv magazine. “The Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) can take a research project to check the ways for reuse of the PV waste.”
