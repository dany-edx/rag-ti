Zhonghuan set the price of its M6 wafers at RMB3.35 per piece (US$0.52) and of its G1 products at RMB3.25. For the new G12 wafers, the new price is RMB5.60 per piece. Longi priced its p-type M6 (166x223mm, 175um thickness) monocrystalline wafer at RMB3.35 per piece while, for the G1 size (158.75x223mm, 175um), the new price was RMB3.25 pcs. For large size, M10 (182x247mm, 175um) wafers, the new price is RMB4.05 pcs. The increase in price is likely due to strong demand and regular stocking up before seven days of Chinese New Year holiday.
Longi also placed a big polysilicon order with Korea-based OCI Group. The module manufacturer has agreed to buy around 77,700 metric tons of polysilicon over three years, from March. The total contract value is about RMB6.36 billion (US$978 million).
Manufacturer Flat Glass on Friday announced a top-up to its photovoltaic glass supply agreement with Longi. The volume to be supplied this year will rise 27.9 million square meters, and a further 46 GW worth (287 million square meters) of solar panel glass will be supplied next year and during 2023. The price will be subject to negotiation with the total supply agreement, which started in May 2019, set to be worth around RMB11.7 billion (US$1.82 billion). That figure is based on the latest weekly PV glass figures published by commodities data company Sublime China Information Ltd, Flat Glass said on Friday.

The model is based on a metaheuristic algorithm called Improved Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (IAEO), which the scientists claim is an improved version of the conventional Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (AEO) algorithm. The latter is a nature-inspired algorithm known for mimicking three typical behaviors of living organisms, such as production, consumption, and decomposition.
The producers are any kind of green plant and consumers are animals that cannot make their food and, therefore, obtain it from a producer or other consumers. Decomposers are agents that feed on both producers, in the form of dead plants, and consumers, in the form of waste from living organisms. In an AEO algorithm, there is only one decomposer and one producer, and the other individuals are considered consumers.
The AEO works according to these three phases and is commonly used to optimize the flow of energy in an ecosystem on the earth. “The ecosystem can be expressed as a group of living organisms [which] live in a certain space, and the ecosystem describes the relations between them,” the researchers said, adding that IAEO is mainly intended at improving the consumption phase.
The proposed energy system consists of PV and wind power generation, a water electrolyzer, a tank of hydrogen gas, a fuel cell, and an inverter that brings the generated electricity to final consumers. “The hybrid system is suggested to be located in [the] Ataka region, [in the] Suez gulf (latitude 30.0, longitude 32.5), Egypt, and the whole lifetime of the suggested case study is 25 years,” the scientists specified.
In this configuration, which the academics have assessed for both off-grid and grid-connected projects, wind and solar plants are used to power the electrolyzer that produces hydrogen, which is then stored in the tank and used to produce electricity through the fuel cell. The inverter receives electricity from the fuel cell and also surplus power from the wind and solar facilities. “When the level of hydrogen in the tank becomes below the lowest allowable level, the shortage in the electrical energy required to store the hydrogen gas in the tank is dispatched from the national grid,” they further explained.
Both the IAEO and conventional AEO algorithms were applied for generating the optimal design for the system. “In the case of the isolated configuration, when the electrical power produced from PV and wind resources is higher than the load needs plus the rated power of the electrolyzer, a dummy load is used for generation-demand balance,” the Saudi-Egyptian group stated.
The IAEO algorithm was validated in six different configurations of the proposed hybrid system and, according to the research team, has provided better results not only compared to the AEO, but also to other kinds of algorithms. “The proposed IAEO algorithm provides fast convergence characteristics, the best minimum values of the objective function, and minimum cost of energy,” it concluded. “Based on the optimal configuration of the hybrid systems, it is found that the fuel cell system has the highest contribution to the net present cost.”
The model was presented in the paper An improved artificial ecosystem optimization algorithm for optimal configuration of a hybrid PV/WT/FC energy system, published in the Alexandria Engineering Journal.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/09/mini-organic-solar-module-for-indoor-low-power-applications/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 9, 2021",Mini organic solar module for indoor low-power applications,"Swedish start-up Epishine has unveiled a semi-transparent organic solar module designed for applications in sensors, consumer electronics and other low-power devices, to reduce or eliminate the need for batteries.
The ultralight panel, dubbed Light Energy Harvesting (LEH), has a thickness of 0.2mm and is available in six versions of different size. “Under typical indoor illumination of around 500 lux, from light sources such as LED or fluorescent light, the device's power conversion efficiency is just below 15%,” the company CTO, Jonas Bergqvist, told pv magazine.
The panel size depends on the cell size, which may vary from 50x50mm to 50x20mm. The largest device has an open-circuit voltage of 3.8 V, a short-circuit current of 146 μA, and an output power of 418 μW. The smallest one features an open-circuit voltage of 5.05 V, a short-circuit current of 42 μA, and an output power of 150 μW.
The module is protected with an encapsulation barrier that protects it from oxygen and moisture. “We have developed a roll-to-roll printing process where we print all the layers and current collectors,” Bergqvist further explained. “We print all our materials in the light cell on a PET substrate and we work with organic solar cells which means that the active layer converting light energy to electricity is composed of carbon-based molecules.
“The price depends on the volume of the order and if there are any modifications on size or design to fit the product,” Bergqvist stated, adding the products are currently being manufactured at the company's facility in Linköping, Sweden. “Regarding initial factory capacity, we will be able to meet the demand we see right now and we will be able to scale our capacity to meet larger orders,” he added, without specifying how much current capacity is. 
The product can also be used in conjunction with capacitors to replace batteries or prolong their lifetime in low-power applications. “As a reference estimate, indoor PV modules are commonly sized like a credit card or two and our panel has a surface of 30cm2 [of] indoor PV module, which means that 1,000m2 allows for over 300,000 indoor PV modules,” Bergqvist said.
“Epishine's long-term goal is to be in the forefront of printed organic solar cells and, step by step, enable the world's most scalable, resource-efficient and affordable solar cell,” the company said in a statement issued on the occasion of the launch of the module. “The company was founded in 2016 and has just over 20 employees, with [its] headquarters in Linköping, and is mainly owned by a founding team together with renowned institutional investors and family offices.”
In 2019, the Swedish company was awarded a grant of approximately SEK24 million (€2.3 million) from the European Commission, within the Horizon 2020 program. Other investors include Swedish investment firms Beijer Ventures, Vigo Carlund, Almi Invest Greentech, and Potential Invest.

Getting it wrong either way can lead to a significant loss of revenue, so there is plenty of interest in the topic and the development of models to predict the effects of soiling and calculate an optimal schedule for module cleaning.
While the soiling profile can vary greatly even between two sites in the same region, there is value in looking at regional data. Scientists led by East West University in Bangladesh analyzed soiling trends in different regions, aiming to provide a global overview of the effects of soiling in different parts of the world, and to develop a model to calculate the best cleaning cycle to optimize project revenue.
The model is described in the paper Global analysis of optimal cleaning cycle and profit of soiling affected solar panels, published in Applied Energy. In their analysis the scientists assumed a project size (yield under 1-sun) of 100 MW, a cost per cleaning operation of US$2670, which it notes is at the lower end of cost estimates for cleaning, and an electricity tariff for the project of US$0.069/kWh – though they note that cleaning costs can be much higher in certain regions, which will affect optimal cycle calculation.
The group was able to show that based on studies of two solar plants located in Saudi Arabia and Chile, calculations from their model fell within 0.1% of the actual numbers, demonstrating the model’s validity to PV project investors.
The study also concluded that there is little value in seasonal variations to cleaning schedules, with only negligible increases in revenue resulting from such optimization. For regions prone to sandstorms, the modeling becomes much more complicated, and the researchers warn that investors should carefully consider the viability of projects in such regions.
And a global level, the model finds the worst soiling conditions in Asia and the Middle East, where even with optimal cleaning schedules implemented  – usually every 5-6 days – soiling losses still amount to around 2.5%. In Europe and North America, a cleaning schedule every 10-12 days is enough to limit soiling losses to below 1.5%.

GCL defaulted on the Hong Kong-issued, three-year senior notes on January 30 and gave the holders of the investments until yesterday to agree to a debt restructuring plan termed the Bermuda Scheme, in reference to the tax haven where the company is registered.
The company this morning confirmed the holders of 91.85% had signed up to a deal which will see them paid a fixed fee of US$50 for every US$1,000 of notes they hold plus take a pro rata share of a US$17.8 million fund. As part of the arrangement, GCL will also set aside a separate US$4.5 million to cover the fees of Houlihan Lokey, Hogan Lovells and Moorlander Consulting Limited as advisors to certain of the creditors.
The defaulted senior notes will be exchanged for fresh investments offering a higher, 10% return which will mature on January 30, 2024. The company added, note holders who missed the signatory deadline yesterday can still agree to the arrangement but will not receive the fixed fee paid to those who committed on time.
GCL had on Friday revealed the formation of a bondholder committee representing the holders of more than half the value of the defaulted notes. A revision to the planned debt restructure was made, under which the bondholder committee would have to approve in writing any further amendments to the Bermuda Scheme.
The revised terms also permit the holders of more than 66.67% of the value of the defaulted notes to capsize the proposed debt restructuring if any deal milestones are missed and of the scheme to be abandoned by agreement between GCL and the holders of more than 75% of the senior notes.
GCL said yesterday the solar project sell-offs it had undertaken last year as it attempted to pay down debts could be expected to incur at least RMB800 million (US$124 million) of impairment losses but that the business was expecting an exchange rate gain of around RMB300 million for 2020 due to appreciation of the renminbi against its US-dollar-denominated commitments.

Enercoop has agreed to buy more solar capacity under three new power purchase agreements.
Its Enercoop Midi-Pyrénées unit signed one of the 30-year PPAs for 1.2 GWh of annual generating capacity. The group signed a second PPA with Energie Partagée and Changeons notre vision de l’énergie for 6.5 GWh per year. And it closed another deal with Valorem and other parties for another 6.5 GWh of solar per year.
Enercoop aims to have 90 GWh of annual PV generating capacity under its belt by 2023. Nicolas Postic, head of sustainable procurement at Enercoop, noted that PPA-linked PV projects have a complex economic model. But in France, this area is still underdeveloped, as only a few PPAs have been signed for renewable energy projects thus far, he said. PPAs are currently slightly above market prices in France, at €50 ($60.50)/MWh to €65/MWh, but given the absence of incentives, they should become more common, he added.
Voltalia has also signed PPAs signed in France. In May, the developer – which has 1 GW of operational generating capacity and a 7.1 GW development pipeline – signed a PPA with Boulanger Group for a 5 MW solar project. And in June, it signed a PPA with French railway operator SNCF for 143 MW of PV capacity. SNCF issued an expression of interest in 2017 under which it said that it aimed to source around 20% of its electricity from renewables by 2025.
In mid-September, La Poste Groupe announced plans to hold a tender for at least one corporate PPA for renewables or biogas. In addition, Akuo Energy and Qwant recently signed another PPA, although it is unclear whether solar was part of the deal.
In November, Enercoop issued a request for proposals to help it select solar and wind power projects, ranging up to 10 MW in size, under which it could sign long-term PPAs. Other entities in France are also seeking clean energy deals via similar tenders.

An update issued yesterday by Xinte to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange – about plans for a 200,000-ton capacity polysilicon fab in Baotou – stated: “Investment and construction of the 10 GW [of] new energy power stations will proceed in phases according to the 14th five-year plan for new energy development and construction and load absorption on peak shaving access of [the] power grid in Baotou City.”
The update added, the framework agreement signed between Xinte and two local government bodies would harness the former's expertise in constructing large scale solar and wind projects.
Under the terms of the framework agreement, Xinte – a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned electrical equipment manufacturer TBEA – would invest an initial RMB8 billion (US$1.24 billion) in a 100,000-ton-annual-production-capacity fab in Baotou, with the municipal and the Tumd Right Banner governments providing policy support and help with identifying development sites and issuing permits. Banners are administrative divisions of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region of China, which includes Baotou.
Construction of that initial phase would start as soon as sites and permits are secured, Xinte said yesterday, with the production lines expected to be operational 18-24 months later. A further 100,000-ton-capacity polysilicon factory would be added, together with “industrial silicon [facilities] and [a] supporting project” depending on market and permitting status, said Xinte.
A separate transaction announced yesterday will see state-owned energy company Beijing Energy International Holding Co Ltd spend RMB60.2 million (US$9.36 million) on six solar projects in Inner Mongolia with a total generation capacity of 115 MW.
The sale price of the Inner Mongolia Minghua New Energy Co Ltd project company owned by an investment business and a coal wholesaler was set at RMB301 million but will be adjusted down after monies owed by the business to its parents are taken into account.
The sellers are Zhongming Capital Holdings Group Co Ltd and Inner Mongolia Weiheng Industry and Trade Co Ltd.

Germany-based Uniper and the Port of Rotterdam Authority plan to produce green hydrogen on the Maasvlakte, which is an artificial extension of the Europoort industrial facility.
A feasibility study is already underway and is set for completion by the summer. The aim is to build a 100 MW plant to produce green hydrogen on the Uniper site in 2025. The capacity will eventually be expanded to 500 MW.
“This is where everything comes together – large amounts of renewable energy, the necessary infrastructure and customers from industry,” said Uniper CEO Andreas Schierenbeck. “You can hardly imagine a better place for the production of green hydrogen.”
The Port of Rotterdam Authority said that the production of green hydrogen is another building block in its sustainability plan. Electricity generated by offshore wind farms off the Dutch coast will likely be used to generate the green hydrogen.
Uniper said the project recently successfully completed the pre-qualification process for the European Union's Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) program.
In the months ahead, the company will work out the conceptual design and the technical dimensions of the hydrogen plant. It will also evaluate potential markets for green hydrogen, both in the Rotterdam port area and in Germany.
Over the long term, for example, the project could potentially supply green hydrogen to large industrial complexes in North Rhine-Westphalia via pipelines. Finally, the project team will look at the possibilities to import, store, and export hydrogen on the Maasvlakte and define the next steps for the project.
In addition, the Port of Rotterdam is implementing the Gigawatt Elektrolysefabriek project, which was recently launched by the Dutch Institute for Sustainable Process Technology (ISPT). Under this initiative, it plans to develop a gigawatt-scale electrolysis plant in the port area.
The Netherlands annually generates around 800,000 tons of “gray hydrogen,” produced with natural gas. The Gigawatt Elektrolysefabriek project partners want to lay the foundations for the construction of green hydrogen electrolyzers in the 2025-30 period.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/09/solar-plus-storage-vs-grid-enhancement-in-sweden/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 9, 2021",Solar-plus-storage vs grid enhancement in Sweden,"Sweden is currently suffering from energy shortages in its southern regions, which rely on net electricity imports from neighboring countries. This situation is not due to an overall lack of power capacity but to the fact that most of the power generation plants are located in the northern part of the country and that the existing grid infrastructure is not strong enough to transport electricity from the north to the south, where there is the largest power demand, in an effective manner.
According to the Swedish PV association, Svensk Solenergi, solar and batteries may compensate for the sharp imbalances in the electricity system and provide a quick and scalable solution to improve power supply, especially in urban areas. The association cites a report from European engineering consultancy company Sweco which describes how power prices rocketed on the Swedish spot market during the last summer.
“Although both wind and hydropower production in northern Sweden were high, electricity production in southern Sweden was low, which meant that an unusual amount of electricity was produced far from where it was consumed,” the Sweco experts said. According to them, technical challenges such as voltage stability and short-circuit effect forced the electricity transmission system operator, Svenska kraftnät (Svk), to reduce the transmission capacity which was available on the spot market from northern to southern Sweden.
As a result, the country experienced the largest differences in electricity prices between different regions since it was divided into four electricity areas in 2011. Another undesired effect was that the oil-fired, thermal Karlshamn Power Station had to be activated during the summer. Power reserve is usually procured only in winter. Furthermore, Svk was forced to enter into bilateral agreements with other power producers including the Ringhals 1 nuclear reactor which is owned 70% by Swedish utility Vattenfall and 30% by German energy company Uniper.
According to Sweco, until the end of June, the hourly spot price remained below SEK800/MWh ($95.30) in all electricity areas. During the summer, however, spot prices in southern Sweden exceeded SEK1,000/MWh. June 25 was the day when the spot price exceeded SEK2000/MWh in the SE3 and SE4 electricity areas, which are located in the central and southern parts of Sweden, respectively, while the spot price in SE1 and SE2 areas, both located in the north, was, instead, at exceptionally low levels of around SEK100/MWh.
On June 25, PV was able to cover around 17% of total electricity generation in the SE4 electricity area, which is the southernmost in the country, during the hours when electricity prices were at their highest, in the middle of the day. The national record for solar so far this year was when it accounted for 3.8% of the country's total electricity production. 
According to Svensk Solenergi, solar combined with storage can help improve power supply during stressful situations in the future. “For 18 hours this summer, the spot price for electricity in southern Sweden was over SEK1/kWh,” the association's CEO, Anna Werner, said. “Strengthening the electricity grid is important but takes a long time, while solar and batteries are growing rapidly and can therefore be an important, complementary part of the solution.”

But this has also confused the market somewhat, with a variety of different module sizes now available, all promising to bring down project costs without significant disruption for installers or developers.
Module makers have quickly split into two camps, working with either Longi’s 182mm wafer or the larger 210mm product introduced by Zhonghuan Semiconductor in 2019. And the industry as a whole is keenly awaiting results from yield models and then from the field, to see how the promised benefits play out.
In some of the first of the results to be published, energy consultancy DNV GL has worked with Trina Solar to evaluate the performance of the company’s Vertex modules, which utilize the 210mm wafer, and to compare this with the 166mm and 182mm products also brought to the market recently. The first set of results from these simulations was published in December, and DNV GL has now published a follow up report offering further insights.
The first report analyzed the modules' performance on a one in portrait tracker, while the new results swap this for a two in portrait design, and base the analysis on a 100 MW system connected using string inverters, at two locations in Spain and the U.S. state of Texas.
The study aims to keep all external and system design factors under control, allowing for objective comparison between the different modules. The cost comparisons made by DNV GL also took into account local costs for equipment, construction and installation, labor costs, grid interconnection fees, costs of operation and maintenance, land cost, and financial costs at each of the two locations modeled.
At the Texas site, the 545 W Vertex module was shown to produce the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). This spelled out as a 6.06% saving on the balance of systems components and a 3.72% reduction in LCOE compared to a 450 W, 166mm wafer module. Compared to the 182mm, 535 W module, DNV GL calculated a 1.2% saving in the balance of systems costs, and a 0.5% LCOE reduction for the Trina Vertex module.
Trina Solar explains that these cost savings arise from the module’s ‘low voltage, high string power’ design. This translates to more power from fewer modules, meaning fewer components and less installation work are needed.

Subscribing to off-peak hot water used to mean heating your water at night when electricity prices were at their lowest. Today, with rooftop solar pouring into homes and overflowing into the grid when the sun is highest, the cheap energy tide has been turned. A new trial by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and Solahart will take active control of 2,400 residential hot water systems in renewables-endowed South Australia, to help balance the grid, but also to reduce residential electricity bills.
The trial is supported by both the Australian federal government (through ARENA) and the South Australian government. They are each contributing AUD 1.98 million ($1.5 million) to the AUD 9.9 million Active Hot Water Control project, conducted by Rheem via its renewable energy brand, Solahart.
Participating homes will be kitted out with Solahart PowerStore, a solar-smart, grid-interactive electric water heater. It will be integrated with a home energy management system to demonstrate a low-cost, scalable way for hot water systems to provide demand management services.
The Solahart PowerStore system typically works in tandem with a property’s rooftop solar system, using solar energy surplus to the household’s immediate needs to gradually heat water, rather than allowing that excess to flow to the grid. Solahart describes it as being like a battery: “It stores energy, but it’s more affordable.”
For homes without solar, it will likely be reconfigured to tap into times of cheapest grid energy supply – that is, when the grid is flooded with solar-generated energy.
“As more of Australia’s electricity comes from solar, we need to increasingly shift more of our energy consumption to daylight hours when solar PV is generating,” said ARENA CEO Darren Miller.
In preparation for this summer, South Australia, which already has one in three households living under rooftop solar, rushed in emergency measures that would allow state distribution network provider (DNSP) SA Power to switch off large amounts of rooftop generation if the influx of energy became too much for the grid to handle.
Hot water systems have traditionally been significant users of electricity in the early mornings and evenings, when the largest proportion of people are showering pre or post work, washing dishes and setting a load of laundry in motion. Helping householders to choose to switch when they heat their water and use other appliances at peak solar times is a more rewarding way to balance the system than enforced shutdowns.
The Active Hot Water Control project will trial various incentives to find out what motivates different customers — those with and without solar on the roof, and across socioeconomic groups — to participate in demand response. As part of the project, Solahart will establish a virtual power plant  that aggregates the electrical load of hot water heaters among participants, curbs electricity use at peak times, participates in electricity price arbitrage, and provides network services to the grid.

Enphase steadily expanded its U.S. inverter market share throughout 2020, challenging the sustained grip that SolarEdge has long held.
In a recent presentation for Roth Capital Partners, Chris Collins – the founder of Ohm Analytics – discussed inverter market share data across a sample of permit and interconnection sources in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Texas, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C.

The numbers for Enphase (shown in the graph in blue) do not represent the entire scope of the inverter industry, but the markets in question are all relevant. According to the presentation slide, Enphase’s market share has been rising steadily since July. After suffering a dip in September, it overtook SolarEdge for the first time in October.
As of December, Enphase held a 48% share of the selected markets, compared to SolarEdge’s 40%. The timing of its rise in market share coincides with the launch of its Encharge battery in North America in July.
Enphase is set to release its fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 9. This could shed light on how the Encharge battery system has helped to expand its market share.
