During the period, the company achieved revenue of RMB20.2 billion ($3.13 billion), which represents a 61% year-on-year increase. Net profit grew by 43% year on year to RMB706 million. Total PV module shipments in the first six months of the year totaled 10.5 GW, with more than 5 GW of that based on the 210mm wafer. The company also built 1.5 GW of solar PV plants in the first half of 2021. Trina is expanding production capacities of major chains, including solar cells and PV modules mainly using large-sized 210mm wafers. The company expects cell and module capacities of 35 GW and 50 GW to be reached by the end of 2021. Products based on the 210mm wafer will account for around 70% of all of the company's output.
State-owned solar manufacturer and project developer China Shuifa Singyes said high polysilicon prices and Covid restrictions had resulted in a drop in revenue generated by its project operations in the first half year to RMB59.4 million ($9.17 million) from RMB481 million ($74.3 million) in the same period a year ago. Despite total first-half revenue rising from RMB2.07 billion ($320 million) to RMB2.33 billion ($360 million) year-on year, China Shuifa saw profits attributable to its owners fall to RMB96.5 million ($14.9 million) from RMB228 million 12 months earlier.  The difference was mainly down to last year’s numbers benefiting from a RMB210 million ($32.4 million) uplift from a repurchase of senior notes, the company revealed in Wednesday’s first-half update. China Shuifa said its cash levels had fallen from RMB900 million ($139 million) to RMB436 million ($67.3 million), year on year, and said RMB100 million ($15.4 million) of its accounts had been sealed by a court in connection with a ruling made in June related to a quality dispute with a customer. Both parties last month lodged appeals against the decision. pv magazine reported in March that the company would have to pay state-owned parent Shuifa $12.7 million by Friday, and a further $213 million by the end of the year.
China-based power transmission and distribution equipment provider Chint Group said the combined capacity of its own PV power plants reached 6.54 GW at the end of June. The capacity comes from 1,522.7 MW of centralized solar PV plants spread across in 14 provinces and 5,024.8 MW of distributed solar PV in 19 provinces. Total revenue from sales of electricity in H1 achieved RMB2.03 billion, around $315 million. Unlike many other private companies which suffered from the central government's subsidy deficit, Chint did a lot of reverse M&A of high-quality PV plant assets in the past several years, becoming one of the largest private owners of solar PV farms.

Its Chilean unit has filed an environmental impact assessment request for a green hydrogen industrial pilot project in Antofagasta. “The project, called HyEx – Green Hydrogen Production, considers the production of green hydrogen (26 MW) based on a water electrolysis system powered by renewable energy, whose operation is expected to start in 2025,” the company said in a statement, adding that the green hydrogen would be delivered to Enaex for the production of ammonia, an essential element for the blasting process in mining. “In the long term, and once the pilot plan is positively executed, the implementation of a large scale project would be considered, also in the Antofagasta Region, with a capacity of up to 2,000 MW of electrolysis, from which Enaex would increase its production of green ammonia, with an estimated date for the year 2030.”
The C&T trading division of Korean industrial conglomerate Samsung signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday with Namhae Chemical and Korea Southern Power (Kospo) to import and use clean hydrogen and clean ammonia. “Based on the trading company's global network and overseas business capabilities, Samsung C&T is responsible for developing an overall business model from the development of overseas clean hydrogen production projects to introduction and utilization in Korea,” reads the press release. Namhae Chemical will provide supply infrastructure such as ammonia storage tanks to carry out clean ammonia transport, conversion, and utilization demonstration projects. Korea Southern Power will provide the existing power generation infrastructure.
South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group announced it would host next week a global virtual forum to present the group’s plans for a new wave of hydrogen-based products and technologies. “The group will present its vision of a future hydrogen society by unveiling its exciting plans and business strategies for new hydrogen mobility technology, next-generation fuel cell systems and applications to diverse industries beyond automotive,” reads the release issued by the Seoul-based company. Hyundai’s latest fuel cell electric vehicles will be unveiled during the forum.
The Indian government is proposing to mandate using green hydrogen in fertilizer and refining. “This is part of the government’s commitment towards replacing grey hydrogen with green hydrogen,” said power minister Shri Singh in a call on Thursday with John Kerry, US special presidential envoy for climate. Singh informed Kerry of the launch of the National Hydrogen Energy Mission, whose aim is to enable cost-competitive green hydrogen production. “He added that India would be conducting competitive bids for green hydrogen in the next three to four months to pave the road for viable usage of hydrogen as a fuel,” the ministry said in a statement. “India is looking at bids for 4000 MW of electrolyzers capacity. The other countries need to come up with more electrolyzer plants to bring down the costs.”
Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota said on Wednesday that it would begin assembling integrated dual fuel cell (FC) modules in the United States. FC modules will be destined for use in hydrogen-powered, heavy-duty commercial trucks, starting in 2023. This launch should mark the switch from prototypes to actual production. “This second-generation fuel cell system is necessary for a carbon neutral future,” said David Rosier, Toyota Kentucky powertrain head. “It delivers over 300 miles of range at a full load weight of 80,000 lbs., all while demonstrating exceptional drivability, quiet operation and zero harmful emissions.” The dual fuel cell modules, a key component of an overall FC kit, weigh approximately 1,400 pounds (635 kg) and can deliver up to 160 kW of continuous power. The FC kit includes a high voltage battery, electric motors, transmission and hydrogen storage assembly. “Heavy-duty truck manufacturers will be able to buy a fully integrated and validated fuel cell electric drive system, allowing them to offer their customers an emissions-free option in the Class 8 heavy-duty segment,” commented Tetsuo Ogawa, Toyota Motor North America's president and CEO.
Germany’s Federal Research Minister Anja Karliczek and Director General Obeth Kandjoze of Namibia’s National Planning Commission have agreed to establish a hydrogen partnership. The two countries signed a joint communiqué of intent (JCoI) on Wednesday. Germany, the first country to set up a joint hydrogen plan with Namibia, will provide up to €40 million. “Namibia … has a lot of vast unused space. High wind speeds in Namibia mean that the generation of wind power is particularly profitable. Solar power harbours an even greater potential thanks to over 3,500 hours of sunshine per year. This is almost twice as much as Germany has to offer. We therefore think that one kilogramme of hydrogen from Namibia will eventually cost between €1.50 and €2.00. This would be the most competitive price in the world,” said Karliczek. The agreement is part of Germany’s €9 billion national hydrogen strategy. Namibia is particularly susceptible to climate change. “Two thirds of our existing installed generation capacity relies on hydroelectricity, which in turn relies on rain and the flowing rivers at Ruacana. … Prolonged droughts such as the one we recently experienced are a harbinger of catastrophic news for many of our fellow citizens,” said Kandjoze.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/27/cheapest-long-duration-storage-for-systems-with-high-renewables/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 27, 2021",Cheapest long-duration storage for systems with high renewables,"Researchers at the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have assessed the cost and performance of most long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies. They have also looked at flexible power plants to help electricity systems to deal with extremely high levels of renewable energy penetration and have found that, given current and future capital cost scenarios, that geologic hydrogen storage and natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) plants with carbon capture storage (CCS) technologies offer the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for 120-hour discharge applications and that pumped hydro, compressed air, and batteries are the cheapest solutions for 12-hour discharge.
“Since energy storage technologies will compete with low-carbon power generation technologies such as NG-CC with CCS to provide the grid with electricity during times when wind and solar are not producing electricity, we compare them all together within this paper,” researcher Chad Hunter told pv magazine. “This allows for a quick comparison of technologies that have not all been looked at in the same analysis before our paper.”
The techno-economic analysis considered the LDES and flexible power generation technologies in the US Western Interconnection, which is a wide-area synchronous grid stretching from Western Canada to Baja California in Mexico, with an 85% share of renewable energy in the area's electricity mix.
“LDES requires large energy capacities so that a typical rate of charging or discharging can be sustained for days, weeks, or even longer,” the scientists explained. “In this study, flexible power plants and LDES system power generation equipment are sized at 100 MW, in the range of peaking and load-following plant sizes today.”
LDES systems are sized to supply rated power for durations from 12 hours to seven days and the LCOE is calculated for both current and future capital costs.
Through their analysis, the academics found that, for the maximum duration of seven days, NG-CC plants with CCS are the cheapest solution. For the minimum 12-hour threshold, the options with the lowest costs are compressed air storage (CAES), lithium-ion batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries, pumped hydropower storage (PHS), and pumped thermal energy storage (P-TES), which they said is mainly due to their moderate power-related capital costs and high round-trip efficiency.
“Batteries will likely play a large role in grid energy storage moving forward, especially if battery prices continue their strong decline as we have seen over the past decade,” Hunter explained. “Shorter-duration battery storage will be complemented by low-cost, longer-duration storage technologies, such as geologic hydrogen storage.”
For more than four days of storage, the least-cost solutions are diabatic compressed air energy storage (D-CAES), NG-CC, NG-CC with CCS, natural gas combustion turbine (NG-CT), and hydrogen storage in salt caverns with re-electrification in heavy-duty vehicle proton exchange membrane (HDV-PEM) fuel cells. They also determined that pumped hydro storage and the HDV-PEM fuel cells with salt cavern storage offer the lowest LCOE for the 12-hour and 120-hour durations, respectively.
“Although hydrogen systems with geologic storage and natural gas with CCS are the least-cost technology options to support high variable renewable energy (VRE) grids at durations beyond 36 h, several challenges are associated with them,” the NREL research team said. “First, neither technology offers the lowest cost for short-duration storage (12 hours), which will likely dominate the storage market until high VRE penetrations are reached; thus, market adoption and learning must be driven by other sectors or use cases, such as using HDV-PEM fuel cells in heavy-duty trucking or deploying CCS for industrial applications.”
The NREL group said that minimizing storage capital is economically convenient at durations longer than approximately 48 hours and that the LCOE is more sensitive to storage energy capacity costs than storage power capacity costs. The team presented its findings in “Techno-economic analysis of long-duration energy storage and flexible power generation technologies to support high-variable renewable energy grids,” which was recently published in Joule.

The company said the project is the world's first building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV) system relying on a perovskite solar technology.
The photovoltaic blinds are managed by an automation system known as Animeo, provided by French specialist Somfy, which makes the perovskite modules cooperate with a weather station installed on the roof. “Using live weather data and sun-tracking, they automatically change their alignment with the movement of the sun,” the manufacturer stated. “This solution ensures the facility's energy efficiency and guarantees thermal comfort and protection against too harsh light for the building users — regardless of the season.”

Saules also explained that perovskite cells are ideal for this kind of application as they can generate power when the sun's rays fall at an angle other than 90 degrees. “Thanks to these advantages and their low weight, they can be mounted even on vertical facade elements and in colors matching the facade of the buildings,” it highlighted.
According to the manufacturer, the perovskite solar modules integrated with the sunshades can be inkjet-printed on thin, flexible substrates in different colors.
Saules is part of the European Perovskite Initiative (EPKI), which unites the major European institutions involved in solar energy research, including the Benelux-based Solliance – which has the Netherlands’ TNO and Belgium’s Imec among its members; Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL); France’s Institut National de l’Energie Solaire; Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE; Italy’s Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche; specialist Oxford PV; and the University of Oxford.

Researchers from the Fraunhofer Society (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft) in Germany are currently cooperating to improve production processes for electrolyzers and reduce their production costs.
The four-year project is aimed at virtually reproducing the best and most economical processes as so-called digital twins and transferring them to a technology kit so that industrial companies can check the production costs they can expect for certain types of electrolysers before planning production. The goal is to reduce the cost of producing electrolysers for green hydrogen by more than a quarter. The federal government is funding the research project with €22 million through the H2Giga hydrogen project.
“We are building a digital library of future-proof electrolyser manufacturing processes with which the investment costs and even the return on investment can be determined in advance depending on the planned production volume, vertical range of manufacture and manufacturing variants,” said Ulrike Beyer, head of the hydrogen task force at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU. The resulting technology kit will give the electrolyzer industry a real boost and an enormous innovation impact, she added.
The researchers pointed out that there are currently only a few electrolyser manufacturers on the market and that these tend to serve niche markets with small volumes.
In addition to the Fraunhofer IWU, four other institutes of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are contributing with their expertise: The Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology IPT in Aachen; the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA in Stuttgart; the Fraunhofer Institute for Electronic Nano Systems ENAS in Chemnitz; and the Fraunhofer Institute for Microstructure of Materials and Systems IMWS in Halle (Saale). The Fraunhofer IWU is contributing a new multi-pass rolling process for bipolar plates (BPP), which implements the channel geometries in the anodes and cathodes. Quality control will also be further developed. The contribution of the Fraunhofer IPT includes the research of new production technology solutions for the manufacture of the catalyst coated membrane (CCM), the porous transport layer (PTL) and the bipolar plates.
The Fraunhofer IPA will map the individual production modules of a reference factory, which will be set up at the participating institutes. The Fraunhofer ENAS will deal with the qualification of the digital inkjet printing process as a manufacturing process for the CCM, which is a central component of electrolysers. The Fraunhofer IMWS is focusing on the characterization of electrolyzer components and systems, which enable the early identification of possible weak points and defects in industrial use.

After almost a decade of work, a team of researchers from Spanish energy companies Repsol and Enagás has managed to develop a pioneering technology for the production of renewable hydrogen from the direct use of solar energy in a process known as photoeletrocatalysis.
The consortium launched the first proof of concept of a photoelectrochemical cell, of no more than 1 cm2, in November 2020 and has now installed the 1 m2 pilot plant at the Repsol Technology Lab, in Móstoles. The next step will be the construction of a demonstration plant in the industrial complex that Repsol has in Puertollano, in central Spain, with the aim of reaching commercial maturity before 2030, the oil company said in a statement.
Both companies have created a joint venture that is intended to bring other investment partners into the project.
Ana Martínez, a researcher at Repsol Technology Lab and one of the project leaders, highlighted the role that hydrogen will play as a key energy vector in decarbonization. “It will allow, on the one hand, to store renewable energies on a large scale, and, on the other, use it as fuel in different sectors, such as mobility, in the residential and industrial fields and, also, as a raw material in industry,” she stated, noting that the electrolysis had not yet reached a sufficient level of competitiveness.
The project is a 100% Spanish R&D development, led by women and carried out in collaboration with several of the most prestigious hydrogen research centers in the country.
This technology simplifies the production process with respect to electrolysis, currently the most widely used technology for the generation of renewable hydrogen. This renewable electricity is transported to an electrolyzer where the water molecule is separated into hydrogen and oxygen. Photoelectrocatalysis, however, integrates the process in a single step. “The device receives solar radiation directly and with a photoactive material it generated the electrical charges that cause this separation”, explained Repsol researcher María Dolores Hernández.
With this alternative, the losses associated with the transport and transformation of electricity are avoided, which means that the photoelectrocatalysis technology improves the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. This simplification in infrastructure and equipment will also reduce investments in this technology, which also has the great advantage of not depending on the price of electricity. “The project's roadmap is designed so that, in 2030, the gas generated by this technology can compete in costs both with that produced by conventional processes from natural gas, and with that obtained by electrolysis”, continued Hernández .
The Energy Research Institute of Catalonia, the Institute of Electrochemistry of the University of Alicante, the Hydrogen Foundation of Aragon and the engineering company Magrana are involved in the project. “The initiative is led on both sides by women, both the technical team and the business development team,” said Enagás researcher Mónica Sánchez. “In this sense, the project shows a commitment to female researchers and is a clear example of the change in recent years in our role in large technological projects within the business world.”
The plan to reach the industrial and economic maturity of this technology has two additional scaling stages defined: A demonstrator that will start up in 2024 in Puertollano, with an area close to half a hectare and with a production of 100 kg a day of renewable hydrogen; and a final phase, scheduled for 2028, with the installation, also in Puertollano, of a plant, already in the industrial phase, of about 60 hectares and with planned production of up to 10 t a day.
Both companies are incorporating renewable hydrogen into their respective businesses. At Repsol, it will be applied both in its industrial refining and chemical processes.
Repsol and Enagás, which have so far invested €8 million in the development of the project, have proprietary rights to the technology, which has resulted in 65 patent applications in more than 30 countries around the world.

India’s electricity demand in the first half of 2021 grew just 3% from the first six months of 2019 levels due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic. This is one of the lowest increases in developing Asia amid the pandemic, according to a new report by London-based research firm Ember.
The nation met 72% of the increase in electricity demand with solar and wind. However, coal generation also increased by 4% to fill the remaining gap in demand and to offset a decline in hydroelectricity generation, almost returning to its 2018 peak.
The figures paint a better picture for India than other Asian nations, where the growth of coal and other fossil fuel sources accounted for a much bigger share in meeting the increase in electricity demand in the first six months of this year. 
For instance, China’s electricity demand rose by 14% from the first half of 2019. And it met only 29% of that increase in demand with wind and solar. About 68% was met by coal power. That pushed up China’s power sector CO2 emissions by 14% from the first half of 2019 to the first six months of this year.
Bangladesh, meanwhile, met electricity demand growth almost entirely through fossil fuels. Pakistan was the only Asian country other than Bangladesh that saw no increase in wind and solar generation, despite an increase in electricity demand.
The 4% rise in coal generation, and thus an increase in CO2 emissions, puts India among “gray recovery countries” – that is, countries where high electricity demand growth was met in part by wind and solar but also by extra coal generation, leading to higher power sector CO2 emissions. 
The Ember report showed that most Asian countries – Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and India – had a “gray recovery.”

The solar cells were interconnected using laser structuring. “We were so pleased that it worked straightaway,” stated Jan Nekarda, head of Production Technology — Structuring and Metallization at Fraunhofer ISE in regard to the process. “Now we’re working on continuing to minimize scribe width.”
Looking forward, the research team said it wants to apply roll-to-roll methods, enabling solar modules to be produced in a similar manner as films. No more technical details on the module technology were revealed.

The New England region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, is set to become a renewable energy powerhouse, with the state government confirming that a renewable energy zone (REZ) planned for the region had been flooded with expressions of interest. Investors have already tabled enough projects to create 34 GW of clean energy.
State Energy Minister Matt Kean said the response to the registration of interest (ROI) process showed huge investor confidence in the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, with more than four times the level of interest needed to build out the planned 8 GW REZ.
“The New England REZ is expected to deliver around AUD 10.7 billion ($7.8 billion) in investment and around 830 operational jobs, as well as 1,250 construction jobs each year, all while putting downward pressure on electricity prices and providing landowners with new income streams,” Kean said. “The overwhelming response shows this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to attract enormous investment into regional areas, cementing NSW’s renewable energy future.”
The New England REZ is one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the NSW government’s electricity roadmap, which will support more than AUD 32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state. REZs will also be developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, Illawarra and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.
The Central-West Orana REZ, which is tipped to deliver 3 GW of renewable energy, was the first of the REZs to be launched. The call for registrations of interest last year attracted 113 registrations, for a total of 27 GW, valued at AUD 38 billion.
Kean said the interest in the Central-West Orana REZ had triggered an adjustment from the state government which has committed to investing AUD 78.9 million to support the development of the New England REZ, which is set to become Australia’s largest.
“The nine-fold level of interest in the Central-West Orana REZ was astounding, so it makes absolute sense to go even bigger with the New England REZ,” he said. “The New England REZ will be able to power 3.5 million homes and, when coupled with Central-West Orana REZ, sets the state up to become the No. 1 destination across Australia for renewable energy investment.”
Member for Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall said the ROI process had netted a much larger catch of potential projects than expected. It has put the local community in the box seat when it came to the final design and planning of the New England REZ, he said.
“With this level of interest, we have the luxury of supporting only the best projects that benefit the community, maintain the highest and strictest development standards and maximise local renewable jobs and investment in the region,” Marshall added. “We won’t be compromising our standards and now we are in the box seat, so we can be even more discerning, which is great. By coordinating REZ development in a strategic way, we can control our own destiny, making sure the projects we host work for our community, not just developers.”

The New England REZ, centered around the Northern Tablelands city of Armidale, will deliver up to 8 GW of new transmission capacity. The region is close to the existing high-voltage power lines that connect the NSW east coast and Queensland, providing opportunities to increase the state’s own energy resilience and to export excess energy to Queensland.
While investor interest is strong, the government said it will take a number of years to plan and deliver the New England REZ, which will be built in stages. The ROI is the first step in engaging industry on the New England REZ and will help inform the next stage of design, including crucial input for the REZ’s staged delivery and network design.
Government-owned EnergyCo will use the information to inform the next stage, with participation in the REZ to be determined through a competitive tender process. The first auctions of capacity and positions in the various REZs are expected to begin in 2022.

Work is now underway on a pilot production line to demonstrate a 3D-printed solid-state battery technology.
Sakuú Corp. said the battery will be up to 50% smaller and 30% lighter than lithium-ion batteries, and will be less expensive to produce at scale. Currently, the battery has a capacity of 3 Amp hours.
Sakuú’s first-generation batteries use a binder jet printing process that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed to allow thin layers of ceramic and metal to be deposited in one build. The 3D printing process is relatively slow, but enables the batteries to be smaller and lighter – something that the company said could make them optimal for electric vehicles.
Sakuú is also testing high-voltage cathodes, which it said could achieve up to a 25% boost in energy density in its KeraCel solid-state battery.
The company said the 3D printing platform is able to print batteries for many different applications, including drones, vehicles, and cell phones, to name a few.
Solid-state batteries are still relatively unproven in terms of their longevity and stability, but some researchers have deemed the technology the “holy grail” of battery chemistry due to its high capacity and energy density.
The “raw materials in, finished product out” nature of the printer platform can help product developers reduce their dependency on other companies by streamlining their supply chains, said Sakuú.
The facility is expected to be completed and operational by the end of the year. It will serve as both a pilot production line and customer learning center for Sakuú’s additive manufacturing platform.
The California-based company is working with Relevant Industrial and Honeywell Process Solutions on the product line. The two will help Sakuú scale-up the facility in a second phase scheduled for 2022, when production may be up to 1 GWh per year.
