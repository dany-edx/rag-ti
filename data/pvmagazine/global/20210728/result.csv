The continent had 22.1 GWp of solar-grade polysilicon production capacity at that point, according to an executive summary of the latest update of the document, published yesterday. According to the report, Europe's polysilicon capacity was held by Norwegian-based, Chinese state-controlled manufacturer Elkem, and by German businesses Wacker and Silicon Products.
By contrast, Europe had just 1.25 GW of solar wafer production capacity at the end of 2020, according to the Fraunhofer ISE report, based in Norway, at Norsun and REC Silicon-owned Norwegian Crystals; and in France, at energy company EDF‘s Photowatt operation. The lack of European cell manufacturing capacity was even more glaring, with the study estimating just 650 MW of facilities, held by Finnish business Valoe, at its fab in Lithuania; by Italian energy business Enel in its homeland; and by Ecosolifer, in Hungary.

The market had 6.75 GW of solar module production capacity at the end of the year, however, spread across 29 companies identified by the research institute. That marked 3% of the world's silicon solar module market last year, stated the report's authors, with China contributing 67% as part of the 95% accounted for by the wider Asian region, and producers in the U.S. and Canada claiming 2%.
The study offered an insight into the energy payback time of a typical, Chinese-made, 60-cell, PERC, 19.9%-efficient solar module. Such a panel, mounted in India, would take only 160.6 days to generate the amount of energy consumed during its production process, with the figure rising all the way to 1.42 years – 518.3 days – in Canada. In the examples cited by the report's authors, the balance-of-system, non-generating components required the most time to displace their energy footprint, between 138.7 and 167.9 days.
The statistics offered up by the Fraunhofer ISE yesterday included the facts PV accounted for 10.6% of Germany's electricity generation capacity, 5.3% of Europe's and 3.2% of the world's. German rooftop PV systems cost between €890 and €1,850 per kilowatt-peak of capacity last year; large scale power plants in the nation offer a current levelized cost of energy of €0.031-0.057/kWh; and the lowest tendered tariff for solar electricity remains a €0.0433/kWh bid registered in February 2018.
Despite the dramatic shift in module production from Europe to Asia witnessed from 2010 onwards, Germany accounted for 7.6% of all the solar capacity installed worldwide by the end of last year, with Europe as a whole hosting 23%, China 36%, North America 12%, Japan 9%, India 6% and the rest of the world 14%, including off-grid capacity.
Referring to data provided by British market data company IHS Markit, the report estimated current inverter costs of €0.03-0.17/Wp for the string products which account for 64.4% of the market; €0.04/Wp for central inverters which cater to 33.7%; €0.08 for DC/DC power optimizers which have a 5.1% market share; and €0.25/Wp for the microinverters which occupy a 1.4% global niche.
Taking a longer view across numerous graphs, the study also illustrates how Germany's solar feed-in tariff went off a cliff just as household electricity prices began a steady rise during 2008-13, and fleshed out how the nation added peak volumes of around 7-8 GWp of solar capacity in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, immediately after production shifted to the Far East. For European manufacturers, however, it may be encouraging to see Germany's installs back rising at a steady 1 GW or so per year since 2017.

The Climate Policy Factbook published this month has monitored the progress made towards a low-carbon economy by G20 members, which include the EU alongside 19 of the world's biggest national economies.
The headline figure is that governments provided a reported $3.3 trillion of direct support for coal, oil and gas plus related fossil-fueled power for the period between 2015 and 2019. Considering 2021 prices, Bloomberg puts that sum as being able to fund 4,232 GW of new solar power plants.
That figure is listed as being more than 3.5 times the size of the U.S. grid, and close to 80 times more than the sum of total grid-connected solar installed in Germany, one of the world's leaders in PV. Still, the report lists Germany as investing $46 billion in fossil-fuel support in the 2015-2019 period – the same amount as the U.S.
China, with $793 billion spent on fossil fuels, Saudi Arabia ($440 billion), and Russia ($406 billion), were listed as the largest supporters:

Bloomberg's factbook added, support for fossil fuels in 2019 by G20 countries was comprised of investments by state-owned enterprises. Singling out Turkey, a large-scale coal plant investor, the report noted analysis that said for the cost of adding 10 GW of coal power, Turkey could build 25 GW of solar.
The Climate Policy Fact Book focuses on three areas for government action to limit warming:
Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg, and the UN secretary-general’s special envoy on climate ambition and solutions, said: “Winning the fight against climate change requires urgent and bold action across every industry and we need governments to lead the way. Our hope is that G20 members take this report to heart, use its recommendations to hit their Paris Agreement targets, and show the world the health and economic benefits of building a resilient, sustainable global economy.”
Antha Williams, environment lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, said the continued backing for coal, oil and gas is “reckless,” with urgent action required. “As a host of climate emergencies intensify around the world, the continued development of fossil fuel infrastructure is nothing short of reckless,” she said.
The G20 agreed in 2009, to “phase out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but did not define “inefficient.”

JinkoSolar Holding Co. said in a statement that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 summary affirmance upholding the International Trade Commission’s (ITC’s) conclusion that JinkoSolar’s products do not infringe a patent asserted by Hanwha Q CELLS.
In March 2019, Hanwha initiated ITC Investigation No. 337-TA-1151 against JinkoSolar, LONGi Solar, and REC Group, asserting that the companies infringe U.S. Patent No. 9,893,215.
In June 2020, the International Trade Commission issued its final determination in JinkoSolar’s favor, affirming an Administrative Law Judge’s initial determination that JinkoSolar’s products do not infringe Hanwha’s patent.
After Hanwha appealed the case, a three judge panel from the Federal Circuit agreed with the ITC.
“We welcome this decision by the Federal Circuit, which confirms what we have known from the start: our products do not infringe Hanwha’s patent,” said Xiande Li, chairman and CEO of JinkoSolar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/28/commercial-and-industrial-rooftops-in-india-could-deploy-1875-mw-of-solar-in-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 28, 2021","Commercial and industrial rooftops in India could deploy 1,875 MW of solar in 2021","From pv magazine India.
India could add 1,875 megawatts (MW) of new rooftop solar capacity across the commercial and industrial segment in 2021, a 47% increase over the previous year, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research.
As of 2020, India had deployed a rooftop solar capacity of 7,920 MW, with at least 75% of the installations done in the commercial and industrial segment.
New rooftop installation rate in the commercial and industrial segment was impacted in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. However, deployment is expected to bounce back this year as a new generation of technologies makes rooftop solar even more cost-effective for corporates looking to cut their electricity costs. 
“Adoption of onsite [rooftop] solar solutions is the low-hanging fruit for consumers that want to optimize their electricity costs or increase their procurement of renewable power,” said Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and Lead India at IEEFA.
“The pandemic has increased the price sensitivity of C&I consumers who already pay higher tariffs to cross-subsidize agricultural and residential consumers. Saving on electricity costs is absolutely critical for them.”
Falling PV module and battery prices make the transition to PV installations even more appealing. 
“Solar module and battery prices have already fallen, and with the government’s new Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic solar manufacturing, solar technology prices are expected to drop even further,” said Garg.
Other factors expected to boost the uptake of rooftop solar among C&I consumers are more accessible financing options and corporates wanting to switch to 100% renewable energy to meet their RE100 commitments.
The C&I segment is exploring bifacial and large-wafer, high-wattage (400+/500+Wp) modules to optimize costs and maximize output (kWh/m2), especially for sites with space constraints. 
The IEEFA-JMK report provides case studies of projects in India that have applied these emerging technologies.
“Some of these solutions such as higher-wattage modules and bifacial modules offer considerable value-addition in terms of energy generation,” said lead author Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.
The report notes that higher-wattage modules in onsite solar installations in India increase plant generation by 1% while reducing the cost of balance-of-system (PV system components except modules) by 1%. These benefits are particularly significant for space-constrained sites.
“As identified in the report’s case studies, bifacial modules increase total energy generation by 4-5% compared with a project equipped with monofacial modules, and so reduces the levelized cost of energy (LCOE),” said Gulia.
Battery storage, integration of solar PV with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are the other trends picking up pace.
The report expects the integration of battery storage in rooftop projects also to pick up pace as battery prices fall dramatically to US$100/kWh by 2023.
There is also a huge opportunity for rooftop solar+battery energy storage systems (BESS) to replace diesel gensets, which represent 90 GW of aggregate capacity in behind-the-meter applications in India.
According to IEEFA’s distributed energy resources (DER) specialist Gabrielle Kuiper, other nascent onsite technological models likely to be explored by developers in India include rooftop solar integrated with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and the adoption of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).
 “Government policy initiatives are already boosting the adoption of EVs,” said Kuiper. “Combining rooftop solar with storage and EVs is a cost-effective solution.
“And BIPV presents an attractive long-term opportunity for corporates that are planning to set up new commercial buildings and offices in India.”

With California-based controlling shareholder SunPower itself controlled by French energy giant TotalEnergies, the European money will go towards the cost of Maxeon using an existing manufacturing facility in Porcelette, northeastern France, to produce its frameless, glass-free, “sticky” Maxeon Air solar panels.
As reported by our pv magazine USA site in May, the Max Air panels are intended for use chiefly on roofs unable to host conventional modules. With a reported weight of 6kg/m2 and Maxeon claiming conversion efficiency of 20.9%, the company has estimated an unmet demand of more than 4 GW for the product in Europe, where the manufacturer said it would be available from the first quarter of next year.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
The project description published by the European Commission yesterday stated Maxeon hopes to install 1.4 GWp of its Air modules over the next decade.
The exact amount of grant funding to be awarded Maxeon is due to be settled in the final quarter of this year, when the EU's recently established Innovation Fund makes its first payments. The cash will come from the revenue generated by the EU's emissions trading scheme, which sells certificates generated by renewable energy operators to companies who exceed their maximum permitted carbon emissions.
With the Innovation Fund expected to have around €20 billion to disburse to 2030, an additional €623 million is already available as unspent cash from predecessor the NER300, which had allocated those monies only for the associated projects to fall through.
Other low-carbon projects which will benefit from the Innovation Fund include a bid by Spanish energy companies Repsol and Enagas to develop technology which can directly use photoelectrochemical cells to electrolyze hydrogen from water without any external energy input.
The EU cash will also back the pooling of power purchase agreements associated with 12 off-grid, agrivoltaic, solar-powered irrigation systems in Spain into a collective 7.35 MW of generation capacity large enough to qualify for green bond financial support. That project is being overseen by Spanish infrastructure and renewables business Acciona.
The Spanish port of Motril will be awarded finance to help it become an off-grid renewable energy community harnessing 4 MW of solar capacity and 1.55 MWh of energy storage, in a project featuring Siemens; and German institute the Fraunhofer ISE, Italian energy company Enel and the body representing Rome's airports are working on a plan to use second-life electric vehicle batteries to store the energy generated by a 30 MW solar plant at one of the city's airports.
Luxembourg-registered steelmaker ArcelorMittal will also receive a slice of the grant funding, to help develop full production in France of its building-integrated PV product which combines photovoltaic generation with steel roofing.
Other projects approved by the fund include an Austrian plan to aggregate 2,781 electronic household and business devices into a 6 MW virtual power plant to provide grid services, a highly energy-efficient electrolyzer in Poland to generate green hydrogen from on-site PV, and extensive vehicle-to-grid facilities in Italy and France. Swedish battery developer Northvolt will also receive funds to help manufacture lithium-ion batteries it claims offer 50% more energy density than conventional products while being 50% lighter. Production will be supported in Sweden and Poland.
As part of the Innovation Fund awards, EU lender the European Investment Bank will also offer technical support said to be worth €4.4 million to 15 companies whose projects are at an earlier stage, and including a Spanish system to store solar electricity using pumped heat. The Repsol and Enagas green hydrogen project is also among the 15 schemes to receive technical assistance, with the nature of the help also set to be determined in the final quarter of the year.

The JPMorgan Chase-controlled developer said the project would create 250 jobs during the construction phase of a ‘grid-parity' project which is expected to generate around 102 GWh of solar electricity per year. The developer did not give a cost for the project.
Sonnedix secured a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) from Norwegian state-owned renewables business Statkraft in June 2020, for 100 GWh of the annual output from the Badajoz facility. Although Sonnedix did not announce an expected date for the start of generation at the site in today's press release, pv magazine reported in June last year, the PPA would start this year.
The project, in southwestern Spain, will be connected to the Vaguadas substation, Sonnedix said, and is expected to generate enough solar electricity to power 36,500 homes. The developer has not specified how much Statkraft will pay for each kilowatt-hour generated by the Los Frailes park.
Sonnedix CEO Axel Thiemann, quoted in today's press release, said: “We are excited to start the construction of our largest project to date in Spain, a milestone that highlights both our strong commitment to the Spanish market and our potential to expand our platform worldwide. We are very proud of our hard working and committed team in Spain, which has doubled [in size] in the last year, and we look forward to continue developing and acquiring solar PV projects in the country, playing an important role in the energy transition as well as the post-pandemic economic recovery.”
Sonnedix says it has 365 MW of operational solar generation capacity in Spain and a development pipeline of more than 600 MW which, with the Los Frailes site thrown in, adds up to a Spanish footprint of more than 1 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/28/aussie-startup-invents-breakthrough-non-toxic-battery-electrolyte-thats-cheaper-by-factor-of-100/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 28, 2021",Aussie startup invents breakthrough non-toxic battery electrolyte that’s cheaper ‘by factor of 100’,"From pv magazine Australia
About a decade ago, Professor Thomas Nann realized the key to achieving a zero carbon economy was not renewably generating electricity, which was already well on its way to undercutting fossil fuels, but rather energy storage – figuring out how to make these clean electrons dispatchable, able to be summoned on demand.
Professor Nann is today the Head of the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Newcastle but became a chemist in his homeland, Germany.
In April, he launched startup Allegro Energy with two of his former students, Fraser Hughson and Rohan Borah. The startup seeks to commercialize its microemulsion battery electrolyte which, although mostly water by mass, has overcome the voltage limitations that typically hinder water-based solutions.
Electrolyte sits between batteries’ anodes and cathodes, allowing ions to pass between the two conductors. In batteries, electrolytes are usually either water-based or use an organic solvent. Both these forms present their own issues. Organic solvent-based solutions, for instance, tend to have good electrochemical stability but are expensive and potentially toxic. With water-based or aqueous electrolytes, the issue is the solution only remains stable up to 1.23 volts, at which point the water splits into its separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
So when Professor Nann began training his attention on battery storage, he came up against precisely these issues which have puzzled researchers for decades. “At some point, I just thought ‘why not do both?’” Professor Nann told pv magazine Australia. That is, why not make an electrolyte with both water and solvent components in the form of a microemulsion. “We were completely blown away at how well it worked.”
Of course, microemulsions aren’t quite as simple as adding dishwashing liquid and oil to water – rather, it’s the combination of water molecules with hydrophobic liquid, coupled with a surfactant which allows the two normally repellent solvents to bond. Basically the combination happens on such a ‘micro’ level it is not able to be split. “It’s thermodynamically stable,” Professor Nann said. “That makes them special and that’s why we can use them in a battery.”
When I asked why the concept had never been applied to battery storage, Professor Nann laughed – “that’s a really good question!”
“Actually when we submitted the patent in the first place, the patent officers came back to us and said ‘well, that’s too trivial’ and we made exactly that argument – why did no one else do that then?” he said. “I think just no one has thought of that.”
The nub of Professor Nann and his co-founders’ discovery is that if you use a microemulsion as a battery electrolyte, you can overcome water’s pesky 1.2 volt barrier. “That’s kind of the secret sauce,” Professor Nann said.
“It’s very unusual – normally when you do research, you fail 99% of the time but that worked straight away,” he added. “It opened up a whole new world of research.”
The beauty of the solution is its simplicity – which makes it extremely cheap, as well as fair, easier, and less carbon-intensive, to manufacture.
According to the startup’s modeling, 70% of the price of supercapacitors, which is the first form of energy storage Allegro plans to focus on, comes down to the cost of its electrolyte. “One liter or kilogram of the current electrolyte costs about US$10, ours costs 10 cents,” Professor Nann said.
“So it’s a factor of 100 cheaper.”
The electrolytes currently being used in supercapacitors are also air sensitive, so they require a protective atmosphere in manufacturing. “That’s not necessary with ours… and that’s a huge advantage in manufacturing because it’s way cheaper.”
“We also did some estimates in the carbon footprint of manufacturing our supercaps, and we save about 70% of carbon dioxide just by not having that protective atmosphere,” Professor Nann added.
Allegro Energy’s electrolyte also helps batteries overcome their stubborn paradox of being both a renewable energy enabler and simultaneously extremely toxic and difficult to recycle. Typically the electrolyte is one of batteries’ most hazardous and corrosive elements, but Allegro’s microemulsion electrolyte combination contains nothing “problematic,” making it compatible with long-term visions of circular economies.
After Professor Nann discovered the solution, he and his team went about screening different battery types and assessing where it worked best. There were two standouts: supercapacitors and redox flow batteries.
Supercapacitors work similarly to a battery but involve no chemical reaction. Rather the energy is stored and harvested simply by separating charges physically.
Tesla has begun coupling supercapacitors (which are tiny) with lithium-ion batteries in its cars, using supercapacitors to generate the burst of energy for acceleration, before coasting on lithium-ion. 
Eyeing this potential in transport, Professor Nann told pv magazine Australia Allegro Energy will initially focus on the mining industry, which is one of Australia’s biggest emitters. Coming under increasing scrutiny, many of the main companies have started committing to carbon reduction targets, which Professor Nann says will mean nothing short of electrifying all their processes. This, of course, offers huge potential.
Supercapacitors are able to charge and discharge extremely quickly – which has seen them used, for instance, in Newcastle’s tram which charges during the 20 seconds stops it makes on its route. Like trams, trucks and other mining transport follow predictable paths, making the rapidly transforming industry a perfect candidate for Allegro.
Grid-scale redox flow batteries are another arena Allegro plans to explore, both in terms of coupling with supercapacitors and for integrating with its electrolyte.
“When you store energy at the grid level, you want something cheap and big and redox flow is perfect for that. But the power you get out of that and the response times are really bad… it takes about a minute or so before the system can respond to demand,” Professor Nann explained.
These slow response times inhibit the battery from responding to rapid power surges and troughs, which is a problem for both grid stability and also trading on the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) market, which has proven extremely lucrative for Australia’s big batteries.
“If you now marry [redox flow batteries] with a supercapacitor, it has fantastically fast response times where you can pretty much respond in real time to any demand,” Professor Nann said.
As cheap, easy to produce and non-toxic as Allegro’s electrolyte solution is, the startup is already butting up against a barrier: the complete dearth of battery manufacturing capacity in Australia.
As far as Professor Nann sees it, there’s two solutions. The first and least desirable is to move production overseas. “That’s a last resort,” he said.
“The other strategy we are looking at is to start small and grow organically.” At the moment, the startup is working on ‘lab scale’, “so we are making our supercaps by hand.” Professor Nann’s hope is that the company can ramp up to small-scale production, and continue growing as revenue increases.
Allegro is currently also looking for commercial partners and collaborators, which could potentially also ease some of this production impasse.
Allegro Energy is one of the eight finalists in this year’s Climate Launchpad initiative, run by Climate-KIC Australia, a sister organization of Europe’s Climate-KIC funded by the European Union.
The program, which Professor Nann quips has helped turn the team of academics to business people, is offering a $50,000 prize to its winner. Money, Professor Nann says, which would help the startup step out of the lab and into manufacturing.
