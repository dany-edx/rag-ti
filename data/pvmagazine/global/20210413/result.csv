The solar panel raw material will be supplied up to 2024 with prices to be set monthly.
Chinese wafer maker Zhonghuan Semiconductor has announced its latest monthly prices, with rises across the board. The cost of 210mm wafers will rise RMB0.17 per piece (US$0.026) to RMB6.33 (US$0.966). For 166mm products, a RMB0.30 premium will raise the cost to RMB3.98 per piece and 158.75mm wafers will be RMB0.30 more costly, at RMB3.81.
State-owned China Development Bank launched a RMB26 billion (US$3.97 billion) ‘carbon neutrality’ bond two weeks ago, according to London-based international NGO the Climate Bond Initiative. Certified by the NGO, which aims to leverage the global bond market for climate change solutions, the investment is said to be the first carbon neutrality bond issued on the Shanghai clearing house and will be used to finance clean energy facilities and urban rail projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/13/chinese-solar-glass-companies-enjoy-bountiful-reporting-season/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CHINA,VIETNAM",MAX HALL,"APRIL 13, 2021",Chinese solar glass companies enjoy bountiful reporting season,"Chinese state-owned solar glass maker Irico New Energy pointed to rising sales volumes, prices and profit margins as it reported a 136% annual rise in net profits for shareholders, to RMB220 million ($33.6 million).
Reporting its 2020 figures, China Electronics Corp-owned Irico noted that, as far as demand for its photovoltaic materials is concerned: “The global carbon neutral target is a long way off.”
That meant good news for Irico's balance sheet, with the company reporting cash reserves of RMB718 million, compared to RMB405 million at the end of 2019, and even though long term borrowings rose from RMB132 million to RMB230 million over the same period, total liabilities came in, from RMB4.62 billion ($705 million) to RMB3.24 billion.
The “booming development of the domestic PV industry” reported by Flat Glass was also reflected in that company's annual figures.
Despite the costs of ramping up production capacity during 2020, Flat Glass banked a net profit of RMB1.63 billion, up from RMB717 million in 2019, with the RMB5.23 billion of solar product revenue recorded dwarfing the RMB235 million generated by other operations.
With solar manufacturing giants Longi, JinkoSolar and Hanwha among Flat Glass' biggest clients, chairman Ruan Hongliang said production capacity expansion would continue after the two 1,000 ton/day capacity furnaces installed in the Haiphong fab in Vietnam in the final three months of last year and the opening quarter of this year. Flat Glass also added a 12-ton furnace at its Anhui base in the first three months of this year and Ruan said more capacity would be added by the end of December, with a further five, 1,200-ton furnaces slated to come online in Anhui next year.
All of which appears to have prompted the Flat Glass board to indulge in a little corporate extravagance, with the 260-page annual report divulging the annual spend on “decoration cost” rose from RMB184,000 ($28,000) in 2019 to RMB12.2 million last year.
China Glass, which recently rebuffed a takeover attempt by rival Xinyi Glass, posted an annual loss despite seeing revenue rise from RMB2.37 billion in 2019 to RMB3.16 billion last year. The float glass maker noted: “In the second half of the year, product prices remained generally high thanks to the explosive growth of the photovoltaic industry.”
The loss was put down to the effect of Covid-19 on the ability of clients to pay their bills, with the company posting poor comparative figures after receiving a lump sum from the Chinese government in 2019 because the authorities expropriated one of its production sites.
The manufacturer, which is in the process of acquiring a controlling stake in rival Fujian Longtai Industrial Company Limited, thanks in part to its plans for PV glass production, lurched from a RMB72.7 million profit in 2019 to a RMB98.5 million loss last year.
State-owned Luoyang Glass also remarked: “In the second half of 2020, the photovoltaic industry saw an explosive growth trend.” It was one the company took full advantage of, with new energy glass products supplying RMB2.56 billion of revenue last year, versus RMB311 million from information display glass and RMB55.8 million from “other functional” products.
Total revenue of RMB3.05 billion added up to total profits of RMB463 million and a net profit of RMB391 million, up from just 68.6 million a year earlier.
The national entity is confident the good times will continue, and stated: “The constant growth in [the] photovoltaic industry will bring sound profitability for [the] photovoltaic glass business, as expected, in the medium and long run.”
And Luoyang is putting its money where its mouth is. Having commissioned production lines able to churn out 32.4 million m2 of products last year, plans have been made for a shares issue to raise up to RMB2 billion for two solar cell encapsulant production lines and the company has launched a bid to acquire PV glass manufacturers Qinhuangdao North Glass Co Ltd and Triumph Jinghua Glass Co Ltd.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/13/silicon-for-batteries-moves-to-commercial-production/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 13, 2021",Silicon for batteries moves to commercial production,"Battery materials startup Group14 Technologies has brought its first commercial-scale factory online in the northwest United States. The factory can produce up to 120 tons per year of the company’s innovative silicon-carbon material SCC55, designed as a direct replacement for graphite in lithium-ion batteries.
Since it has around 10 times the energy density of graphite, silicon has attracted plenty of attention from researchers as a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Challenges with the material’s tendency to expand when used in batteries, however, have largely held back commercial applications until now.
Group14 says that by focusing on large-scale solutions from the start it has been able to design a material that can both be produced at large-scale and serve as a ‘drop in’ solution for battery manufacturers already working with graphite. “We leveraged our team’s deep commercial manufacturing experience to prioritize process development and designing for cost from the beginning,” said CTO Rick Costantino. “The process to manufacture SCC55 was designed from the start to be scaled quickly and efficiently, an approach that has kept us on track to bring our technology online to help power consumer electronics, electric vehicles and more — immediately.”
The material consists of a carbon “scaffold”, inside which is a 3-5 nanometer particle of amorphous silicon. Void space inside the scaffold gives the silicon some room to expand, while the carbon surface creates a stable interface with the electrolyte. Batteries using only SCC55 as the anode have shown stability over more than 500 cycles. It can also be combined with graphite in various ratios for stability over 1000-2000 cycles, with customers able to find the optimal balance. “We have a lot of customers looking at the blending approach, and others also working only with our material to get a 50% plus boost to their battery capacity,” Group14 CEO Rick Luebbe told pv magazine. “So with all of the billions being invested in Li-ion, our material can be integrated seamlessly.”
Group14 has not shared information on the cost of its material, though says it will be competitive with graphite when the improved performance is taken into account.
Expansion plans
The company says it has already delivered SCC55 to consumer electronics and vehicle manufacturers around the world, and that battery manufacturers are currently validating for use of the material in electric vehicle batteries.

And Group14 already has plans for more manufacturing, expecting to double its capacity by the end of this year. It has partnered with solar polysilicon producer REC Silicon, taking advantage of its large capacity to produce silane gas. The company also plans to break ground on a new factory at its Moses Lake site later in 2021. “We built our technology for real-world impact,” says CEO Rick Luebbe. “This commercial factory is the first big step forward towards fulfilling our mission, and we’re excited to play our part to ensure more equitable access to cleaner electric vehicles of all forms.”

Through this call, Sasol wants to procure an energy supply for its synthetic fuel plant in Secunda, Mpumalanga. “Subsequent to setting the 2030 target [to reduce 2017-referenced greenhouse gas emissions at least 10% from South African operations], Sasol entered into an agreement with Air Liquide for the sale of the air separation units (ASUs) at the Secunda site,” the company stated. “Air Liquide also committed to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction interventions over and above those committed by Sasol.”
The two companies want to procure around 900 MW of renewable energy capacity, of which 500 MW will be for Sasol and 400 MW for Air Liquide. “It is envisaged that the successful bidder(s) will supply energy as independent power producer(s), in terms of power purchase agreement(s) to be agreed between the parties,” they specified.
Interested developers will have time until April 23 to submit their proposals.
Sasol launched a similar call for the Secunda site, and another site in Sasolburg, in Free State province, in August.
South African businesses are turning to solar and renewables to reduce their dependence on troubled utility Eskom.
In mid-July, ArcelorMittal South Africa, a unit of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal Holdings, invited independent power producers to submit project proposals for solar arrays at six sites in South Africa, with a minimum project size of 10 MW each.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/13/strong-growth-ahead-for-battery-storage/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"APRIL 13, 2021",Strong growth ahead for battery storage,"From pv magazine 04/2021
Large-scale battery deployment was subdued in the first quarter of 2020, but this slowdown was only temporary, as more than 1 GWh was deployed globally in each subsequent quarter. IHS Markit’s latest company and project database report highlighted the fourth quarter in 2020 as a record-breaking period, with more than 2.2 GWh of installations (not including residential). This brought the total in 2020 to over 5 GWh, compared to 3.2 GWh in the previous year.
Project sizes also increased significantly in 2020. In the United States, the Moss Landing project – built on the site of a former gas power plant – became the largest single-sited battery energy storage project. It even surpassed the 202.8 MWh Qinghai Solar Farm, which was completed earlier that year – although note that IHS Markit is tracking more than 5,200 projects in its project database and invites companies to submit project lists.
The first energy storage project above 100 MW came in 2017. It took another three years for both the 200 MW and 300 MW barriers to be broken. Projects in the order of 400 MW and above have been announced and are likely to be in operation before the end of 2025. Project sizes are increasing because they are inversely proportional to system prices, which have continued to decrease, making larger projects more economically feasible.
In 2021, the United States is forecast to account for 50% of the global market, following a threefold increase from 2020, as energy storage project owners take advantage of the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC). In Europe, a 70% increase in annual installations will be realized in 2021, driven by new frequency response, capacity market, and renewables co-location opportunities.
This year will be a record period for growth, but it also marks the start of a longer period of sustained growth for the industry through to 2030. Much of this growth will come from the front-of-the-meter segment, and we anticipate that larger utility-scale projects will become the real engines of growth for the energy storage industry in the coming years. The United States will continue to extend its dominance of the global market, gaining market share until 2023. However, from 2025, decarbonization plans in mainland China will lead to rapid growth in the region, driving Asia Pacific to account for 44% of annual installations by 2030.
Residential storage
The IHS Markit residential energy storage index highlights that in the fourth and final quarter of 2020, shipments saw an increase of 19% quarter on quarter, and five countries reported shipments exceeding 100 MWh. Germany saw shipments fall significantly in the final quarter of the year as inventory was cleared and system suppliers waited for delivery of batteries.
In 2020, both Germany and the United States recorded shipments of over 1 GWh. Tesla ranked first in terms of capacity because of its dominance of the U.S. market, but also geographic coverage. Sonnen was the leading supplier on a MWh basis in Germany (the largest market) in 2020.
In the latter stages of 2020, customers in Germany, Italy, and the United States were experiencing delays of between three and nine months, as demand had begun to exceed supply. Installations in 2021 are expected to rise to 1.6 GW/4.1 GWh, representing a year-on-year increase of 26%, after deployments in 2020 surpassed 1 GW for the first time (1.3 GW/3.2 GWh – annual installations in 2020). Self-consumption of rooftop solar PV generation and backup power continue to be the main drivers for new installations, as markets with support schemes keep growing rapidly.
In the short term, subsidy schemes will drive deployment, encouraging installations as solar and storage is supported. Current leading markets – Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United States – all have the same things in common: They have strong solar markets with schemes in place to encourage new and retrofit storage installations.
Toward 2030, the introduction of other revenue streams will aid future deployment. Aggregation, community balance structures, and enabling access to wholesale or capacity markets will allow owners of home battery energy storage systems the ability to stack revenue streams.
The C&I space continues to lag behind other sectors, despite promising economic value propositions for businesses. A short-lived boom in 2018, caused by lucrative renewable energy credits for renewable generation paired with storage, saw 71% of all global installations deployed in South Korea. Hindered by fires related to poor cell production – as well as the integration and management of operational systems – South Korea accounted for 35% and 24% of global C&I installations in 2019 and 2020, respectively. That was before the expiry of the REC scheme, and ultimately the demise of the C&I storage opportunity, at the end of 2020.

Globally, the C&I sector has undergone rapid consolidation, as many key players have pivoted, exited the industry, or been acquired. The developers with the strongest project pipelines through early 2021 all have access to capital from their parent companies.
The storage sector has overcome the short-term project delays caused by Covid-19. However, the long-term economic consequences of the pandemic will have a significant impact on developers’ end markets and sales pipelines. The major challenge for C&I energy storage is that the economic benefits vary significantly from customer to customer. This makes it very difficult to offer a standardized solution, which, in turn, increases the cost of building systems and acquiring customers.
California continues to lead in C&I storage deployments, which are bolstered by the state’s strong incentive programs and high demand charges. IHS Markit forecasts that the state will capture more than 50% of the North American market in 2025. The sector will lag behind the residential sector until 2030, when it is forecast to surpass it with annual installations of 3.5 GW/9.5 GWh.

In the month of March, the solar industry underperformed in the market. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) decreased by 16.3%, while the S&P 500 and DJIA increased by 0.3% and 3.5%. The five stocks in the U.S. market that saw the largest losses were Daqo (-32.5%), Sunnova (-25.9%), Array (-25.2%), JinkoSolar (-18.3%), and ReneSola (-18.0%). The reasons given for the sell-down include the rising interest rate with the 10-year treasury up 20% from 14.5% at the beginning of March, as well as sector rotation and concerns about the proposal from California Investor Owned Utilities (IOU) to increase grid-access fees.
Although they’re on the rise, interest rates remain low and the Fed has also signaled that no interest rate hikes are to be expected for the next two years. In the past earnings season, most companies reported strong fundamentals and a healthy outlook. Moreover, there is a meaningful positive message from the Clean Future Act, which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in March and aims to set a target to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas pollution by no later than 2050.
Roth hosted the 33rd Annual Conference from March 15-17, with more than 83 companies from across solar and renewables. The conference revealed that the United States electric grid has seen big growth in decentralized models and distributed power infrastructure, and residential solar installations are expected to grow by 25-30% in 2021 over 2020.
The announcement of the preliminary wind tower import tariffs are likely to slow imports in the near term. With regard to the ongoing forced labor issue in China, the AFL-CIO (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations), the largest U.S. labor federation, is calling on the Biden administration and Congress to stop imports of solar energy products from China’s Xinjiang region over human rights concerns.

The call ends on May 7. The EU Hydrogen Strategy aims to install 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024, and 40 GW by 2030. “This call is an important step forward in the work of the alliance. It will help build the project pipeline and assess and address gaps and bottlenecks in the clean hydrogen value chain,” commissioner for the internal market Thierry Breton stated.
The Netherlands has announced €1.35 billion of investment through its National Growth Fund, almost a fourth of which (around €338 million) will be used to scale up hydrogen projects. “The public investments must create a powerful and flexible hydrogen ecosystem that forms the basis for the upscaling of hydrogen and electrochemistry,” the Dutch government said in a statememt. “Industrial clusters where there are opportunities for this are [in the] north Netherlands, Amsterdam, Rotterdam/Moerdijk, Zeeland, Arnhem, Brainport Eindhoven, and Limburg (Chemelot).”
Ademe, the French environment and energy management agency, has announced that 32 developers applied for the second phase of the call for hydrogen projects that closed on March 16. According to the French Ministry for Ecological Transition, the majority of French regions are involved in the process, showing a growth in interest. Most of the projects concern heavy mobility usages. “The results of the calls for projects are encouraging: Players and regions are seizing this opportunity to develop a sector of the future,” said minister Barbara Pompili. “France has all the keys to become a European leader in green hydrogen.” The tender's first phase, which closed in December, led to the pre-selection of seven winning projects for a €45 million investment.
French tire manufacturing company Michelin said it is seeking to become a world leader in hydrogen fuel cell systems through Symbio, its joint venture with French car-parts maker Faurecia. During the presentation of its 2030 sustainability strategy, Michelin revealed it expects to generate 20-30% of sales from non-tire-related businesses by the end of the decade. Chief executive officer Florent Menegaux explained that the company will resort to internal financial resources and M&A operations. Symbio has targeted a 12% share of the global fuel-cell market by 2030.
Iberdrola subsidiary ScottishPower has applied to build a green hydrogen plant, which it will develop alongside its 539 MW Whitelee wind farm in the United Kingdom. Iberdrola explained, in a statement, that the hydrogen plant will include the U.K.'s largest electrolyzer (20 MW), a hybrid solar energy system that will power the electrolyzer and a battery storage system with a maximum capacity of 50 MW. The initiative will be able to produce up to eight tons of green hydrogen per day.
Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor and U.K.-based thermal power generation company SSE Thermal have unveiled plans to jointly develop low-carbon power stations in the Humber region, “comprising one of the U.K.’s first power stations with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, and the world’s first 100% hydrogen-fueled power station.” Equinor said that final investment decisions will depend on the progress of policy frameworks.
Linde Engineering, a subsidiary of the British multinational chemical company Linde, has won the tender to design and build an integrated hydrogen fueling station and electrolysis plant for AGR, in Herten, Germany. “The project, comprising hydrogen production and high-performance fueling technology, is receiving funding of up to €6.2 million from the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure in the framework of the National Innovation Program Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP),” read a press release. The project includes proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, compressors, storage tanks, and fueling stations.
German energy provider EWE has completed the first step of an experimental project meant to test whether green hydrogen can be stored in underground caves. “This would make green hydrogen, generated from renewable energy, storable in large quantities and usable on demand, and would become an indispensable component for achieving set climate targets,” EWE’s Paul Schneider said. The company has so far installed and cemented 160 steel pipes 1,000m deep into the ground.
The heavy-duty vehicle market could accelerate fuel cell technology, the U.S.-based Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck (M2FCT), a Department of Energy (DOE)-funded consortium, said in an article published in Nature Energy at the end of March. “This will encourage building the needed hydrogen refueling infrastructure with less infrastructure investment, since trucks travel predictable routes,” said M2FCT co-director Rod Borup. Berkeley Lab scientist Ahmet Kusoglu added that heavy-duty vehicles make up a small fraction of the vehicle fleet in the U.S. but contribute to 23% of transportation emissions of greenhouse gases in the U.S.
A study led by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory has suggested new strategies to design perovskite materials to speed up the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a process that frees up molecular oxygen from water and is key for hydrogen production. Perovskite oxides are an alternative to expensive precious metals but are not as efficient at accelerating the OER. Moreover, they tend to slowly degrade. “The study found that the perovskite oxide’s surface evolved into a cobalt-rich amorphous film just a few nanometers thick. When iron was present in the electrolyte, the iron helped accelerate the OER while the cobalt-rich film had a stabilizing effect on the iron, keeping it active at the surface,” said the study, suggesting that traces of iron can improve the OER on amorphous oxide surfaces.
Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources, Seamus O’Regan, has announced the hydrogen strategy implementation strategic steering committee, which will advance and measure the progress outlined in the Hydrogen Strategy for Canada launched in December 2020. “The committee, co-chaired by Natural Resources Canada and the Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association, is composed of senior leaders from across industry, provincial and territorial partners, non-government organizations and indigenous partner[s],” read a note.
American rocket and missile propulsion manufacturer Aerojet Rocketdyne has announced its RS-68A hydrogen-fueled rocket engine has completed its final hot-fire acceptance test for use on the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle on the B-1 test stand at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. “We’ve continued to improve the RS-68 engine, which today remains the most powerful hydrogen-fueled rocket engine in the world,” said Jim Maser, Aerojet Rocketdyne senior vice president of space. “This engine was developed entirely with company funds to be a very cost competitive and extremely reliable booster engine.”
Engineering consultancy Rina is working to certify the compatibility of Italian gas TSO Snam’s existing 33,000 kilometers of gas lines with hydrogen transportation. “For Italy, this is a great opportunity, since it has the most extensive gas infrastructure in Europe … The joint activities also include laboratory tests, which have been successful so far, and we will continue with further complex tests at high pressures,” commented Ugo Salerno, Rina’s CEO.
FIA, the governing body for many auto racing events including Formula One, has reportedly said that it will soon unveil its hydrogen plans. “It's a very interesting development of technology … Many are working on it and the FIA will give its contribution. We are doing a lot of tests in our laboratories and will soon make an announcement concerning hydrogen,” said its president Jean Todt in Rome at the weekend, as reported by Jonathan Noble for trade publication Autosport.

Axter, a French waterproofing system supplier, has developed a new process to deploy rigid solar modules on several different kinds of buildings.
The company said its technique has been validated by the Centre Scientifique et Technique du Batiment, which is a French certification organization for the construction industry. The Surfa 5 Topsolar process, which was developed at Axter's R&D center in Courchelettes, northern France, makes it possible to install rigid PV modules on buildings and roof terraces that are coated with bituminous waterproofing.
The system is a turnkey solution for installers, waterproofers, and building owners, Axter claimed. “It combines different types of insulation, single-layer or double-layer bituminous waterproofing processes, and several versions of couplings for installing flat or inclined modules,” the company said.
Surfa 5 Topsolar is suitable for three types of load-bearing elements: concrete, wood, and steel. It can be installed on rooftops with a slope of no more than 10%, with the modules laying parallel to the waterproofing plane or inclined by 10 degrees. This solution is designed to optimize the exposure of the panels and thus the performance of PV installations. In addition, the technique is said to facilitate strong wind resistance.
Axter manufactured the waterproofing membrane for the Surfa 5 Topsolar solution at its production site in Courchelettes. The aluminum components that make up the hitch were assembled on the same site. Five types of standard PV modules can be used with the Surfa 5 Topsolar system, including panels produced by France's Voltec Solar.
“It seemed important to us to be able to associate a French supplier and manufacturer of photovoltaic modules with our Surfa 5 Topsolar solution,” said Axter CEO Peter Fleischmann. “The photovoltaic roofing sector is booming, driven by the ambitious objectives of the multi-year energy program which sets a target of 20.1 GW of installed photovoltaic power in 2023.”

Abraham Cambridge: The $1.4 million Nhimbe Fresh crowdsale is phase-one funding for a three-phase project and our largest funding campaign so far, with more than 1,700 individuals from across 98 countries. This phase one funding is twice the size of our previous largest project and we look forward to completing the installation somewhere around August this year.
What challenges did you encounter while running this crowdsale?
AC: Being our 39th project, this crowdsale was everything as usual, except that we had several people using Bitcoin, unlike before. We also realized our goal to have the project sold out within the specified time limit.
Being a first phase funding, we'll have two more for the other two phases once we're done installing solar power and storage facilities for the cold store.
To what extent do you think this kind of innovative funding is changing the view on solar and climate change worldwide?
AC: This project proved that individuals across the globe are willing to invest in a more sustainable energy future provided they are empowered with innovative technology and that they can take part in an energy revolution by unlocking potential in ways … traditional finance cannot.
Through The Sun Exchange, people are also finding ways to take action and make an impact as far as clean and sustainable energy is concerned. I think people are tired of putting their money in banks; instead, they now want to see their money used in sustainable and long-term solar projects where they can also earn a competitive monthly income stream.
To Edwin Moyo: Tell us more about Nhimbe Fresh and the company's primary services and products.
EM: Nhimbe Fresh is a premier African exporter of blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, stone fruit, snap peas, and snow peas. We are pioneering new and profitable ways of doing agribusiness through sustainability and environmental responsibility.
Why did you decide to ‘go solar'?
EM: We decided to go solar a long time ago. The problem we were facing was funding the solar projects. Most of our operations require consistent power and frequent outages mean spoilage and low-quality farm produce. At Nhimbe Fresh, we need power from the irrigation points to refrigeration shelves, and The Sun Exchange presented us with the ultimate solution we've yearned for [for] years.
Why The Sun Exchange? What attracted you to its funding program?
EM: Through The Sun Exchange platform anyone, anywhere in the world, can easily buy solar cells and automatically lease those cells to be installed in high-impact solar projects such as the one we're installing at Nhimbe Fresh, powering businesses in sunny emerging markets.
Even more interesting is that these solar cell owners will offset their carbon footprint while earning a rental income stream from the clean electricity generated … Businesses like Nhimbe Fresh can go solar at no upfront cost, minimizing energy costs and climate impact.
What are the immediate benefits of using solar in your company?
EM: With reliable solar power, we'll also have more control of every company's operation. The quality of our farm produce will also increase, hence more value and increased revenue that we can then channel to our out-growers [smallholding farmers who supply produce to Nhimbe Fresh] to boost their livelihood.
Our out-growers currently produce 40% of the total production and our target is to empower and support them so we can have 70% of our produce from out-growers.
What are the financial benefits of using solar in terms of cost-saving, compared to grid electricity?
EM: First, solar is expensive to install but cheap to maintain. Secondly, our monthly solar [electricity] charges will be 10% cheaper than [grid] electricity, not to mention the [savings represented by avoiding the] cost of not having power for five days or, even worse, 10 to 15 days a month.
By accessing reliable solar power at a lower cost through The Sun Exchange platform, we'll save approximately $2 million on solar installation and reduce overall energy costs by roughly 60%.
What are the environmental benefits of using solar at your company?
EM: This is the first crowdsale of a three-phase solar-plus-storage project that will enable us to operate entirely on solar power. Since solar power is replacing coal and diesel energy sources, our carbon emissions will be reduced by more than one million kilograms per year.
How has solar impacted employee morale and retention?
EM: Our employees are so excited that we are going fully solar, and utterly independent of the national grid. There is a sense of belonging that comes with this milestone and we can already see it in our employees. Similarly, our customers and clients embrace the idea of going solar as they would want to be associated with a company that's environmentally aware and friendly.
Talk to us about Nhimbe's sustainability program of investing in the community, environment, and infrastructure.
EM: At Nhimbe Fresh, we are well aware and concerned about our farmers' and employees' welfare. We already have measures and programs in place that cater to their wellbeing, now and after their retirement. For instance, we partner with financial providers to ensure our managers [can] access mortgages at competitive rates. Similarly, we build decent retirement homes for our workers and farmers.
Nhimbe Fresh is growing, and we are putting up new technology and infrastructure to make sure our workforce has the means and support they need to deliver their best. We have schools, housing units, roads, shops, and clinics that serve our employees and farmers within the company. We are also in … talks with our London contacts as we want to import Covid vaccines for farmers and employees. These are some of the initiatives we are pushing to ensure the wellbeing of our people.
Any last thoughts about the recent crowdsale?
EM: I want to thank [The] Sun Exchange for their innovative platform that is changing the status quo as far as solar financing is concerned. Through the support of our partners, such as The Sun Exchange and [lender] Old Mutual, we are now on a path to achieving our goal of producing high-quality products that make a difference in the market.

The renewables unit of L&T’s power transmission business signed the EPC contract with a consortium led by ACWA Power and a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF).
This project is now the largest solar plant in Saudi Arabia to have a signed power purchase agreement in place. It will also be one of the biggest solar arrays in the world upon completion. 
The project in Riyadh province is being built on a 30.8-square kilometer plot of land. It will include single-axis trackers and inverters. It was awarded to PIF and its partner, ACWA Power, under Saudi Arabia’s National Renewable Energy Program (NREP).
L&T has been building efficient power transmission and distribution networks with modern substations and transmission lines in the region for more than two decades. It has commissioned more than 2.1 GW of utility-scale solar projects and is already operating and maintaining a number of installations. It has a diversified renewables portfolio featuring 32 MW of floating solar capacity, 135 MWh of energy storage capacity, 500 microgrids, and 14,000 solar water pump installations. It is also working on green hydrogen, carbon capture, and storage projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/13/solar-may-cover-75-of-global-electricity-demand-by-2050/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 13, 2021",Solar may cover 75% of global electricity demand by 2050,"Professor of solar economy Christian Breyer and his team, at the Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland, have revised upwards their outlook on the share that solar PV will have in the global electricity mix by 2050, from 68% to 76%.
In the Low-cost renewable electricity as the key driver of the global energy transition towards sustainability study, the Finnish team utilized its energy system transition model to demonstrate the economic feasibility of a global energy market based on a 100% share of renewable energy, and predicted solar, thanks to a global installed capacity of around 63.38 TW, may even reach a 69% share for total primary energy supply by the end of the first half of the century.
In the proposed scenario, in which the target to limit global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius is achieved, end-use sectors such as transport and heating are almost fully electrified. Despite the strong drop in prices for electricity provided by solar and other renewables, however, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the whole system is expected to remain constant at between 50a nd 57 €/MWh over the next three decades, as the energy transition will be also implemented with storage technologies, increased flexibility and the production of synthetic fuels. “We do not consider, any more, single-technology LCOE, but least-cost energy system solutions, which shifts the focus on[to] integrated solutions,” Professor Breyer told pv magazine.
In the study, however, the capex of all technologies required for system LCOE was indicated. “The PV capex is the most decisive,” Breyer added.
According to the group's estimations, for example, the capex for a residential PV project is forecast to drop from €1,169/kW-installed in 2020, to €826 in 2030, €650 in 2040, and €537 in 2050. The cost for commercial PV is expected to reach €397/kW-installed by 2050, from €907 in 2020; €623 in 2030; and €484 in 2040. As for the industrial roofs, the capex is predicted to decrease from €682/kW-installed in 2020, to €459 in 2030, €353 in 2040, and €289 in 2050.
Looking into the large scale business, the group provided prices for two PV plants: fixed structure and with single-axis trackers, and found the second category will experience a price drop from €638/kW-installed in 2020 to €429 in 2030, €330 in 2040, and €271 in 2050. As for the first category, it is predicted to achieve a capex of €246/kW-installed, from €580 in 2020; €390 in 2030; and €300 in 2040.
The report also forecasts that renewables-powered desalination will be able to resolve the water scarcity issue, providing 3 billion cubic meters of clean water per day, and that power-to-x technology will be fully implemented.
“The results in our study describe a scenario that has been claimed as impossible according to IPCC reports,” Breyer said. “We are, however, able to show that with … comprehensive direct and indirect electrification of the energy system, and renewables-based electricity supply, the climate targets can be met without increasing the [cost] per unit of energy.”
Two recent studies, on the other hand, have separately shown that Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios assessing global decarbonization pathways are still predicting too-low future PV capacity and too-high LCOEs for the solar technology. A study from Aarhus University, in Denmark, has shown how the 2050 integrated assessment modeling (IAM) scenarios from the IPCC have underestimated PV over the past 14 years, and previous research conducted by scientists at the University of Geneva, in Switzerland, found that European entities expect a sharply higher compound annual growth rate for solar PV than their Asian and North American counterparts. It also noted that the growth scenarios of the IPCC are more conservative than other predictions.

The More than the sun: The solar outlook report emphasizes the need for solar developers and investors to start focusing on driving up the value of the electricity generated, to avoid dwindling returns caused by price cannibalization. Increasing competition between developers and falling hardware costs are fast driving down the levelized cost of energy generated by rising global volumes of solar generation capacity, reducing profits for investors.
Faced with that prospect, developers can try to bear down further on costs and/or provide better quality electricity by firming its supply and dispatchability. Digitalization can address both strategies with, of course, DNV offering a range of such services.
While the price cannibalization issue has been around for a while, DNV has predicted when it will start to kick in and posited 2035 as the point at which reductions in module and inverter costs and, separately, total solar project costs will level off.
Though the report estimates the current global average $250/kW module-plus-inverter cost–and $725/kW total project expense–will fall to around $120/kW and $412.50/kW, respectively, by mid century, the associated graph offers little change after 2035.
Similarly, DNV predicts the volume of new solar generation capacity deployed in Europe and North America will begin to slow from 2030 and will plateau from 2040, thanks to price cannibalization. The company noted the solar ‘duck curve‘ already seen in PV-rich California, which sees gas peaker plants ramped up as electricity demand rises in the evening, as well as the grid capacity constraints which have delayed solar deployment in Australia.
Referring to its 2020 Energy Transition Outlook report, DNV reiterates the prediction the world will have 1.5 TW of solar capacity by 2026 and 2.9 TW by 2030 but adds, in one chapter heading: “Solar’s success won’t depend solely on the lower cost or greater nameplate efficiency of the hardware,” but will also require greater dispatchability through the use of short and long term energy storage, demand response, and smarter inverters.

“Using waste from landfill and upcycling plastic bottles could lower the total cost of batteries while making … battery production sustainable on top of eliminating plastic pollution worldwide,” said research co-author, Mihri Ozkan.
In the paper Upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste to microporous carbon structure for energy storage, published in August in Energy Storage, the U.S. group describes the process for upcycling PET waste bottles into an electrochemical active-carbon material that works as a double‐layer supercapacitor substance.
PET plastic bottles are first dissolved in a solvent which consists of a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and dichloromethane. Then, through a process called electrospinning, microscopic fibers were fabricated from the polymer and the plastic threads carbonized in a furnace. “After mixing with a binder and a conductive agent, the material was then dried and assembled into an electric double-layer supercapacitor within a coin-cell type format,” the academics explained, adding that the active material is able to perform as a supercapacitor with added pseudocapacitance.
Circular manufacturing has been the focus of the UP initiative’s Q3 2020 quarterly theme. We looked at if adopting circular approaches can create competitive edges and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Discover all our coverage here: https://www.pv-magazine.com/q3-2020-circular-manufacturing/.
The material is claimed to have both a double-layer capacitor created by the separated ionic and electronic charges and redox reaction pseudo-capacitance, determined by the ions that are electrochemically absorbed onto surfaces of materials. “Though they don't store as much energy as lithium-ion batteries, these supercapacitors can charge much faster, making batteries based on plastic waste a good option for many applications,” the scientists stated.
They believe the technique could reach mass production soon although they want to improve the electrical properties of the nanomaterial with compounds such as boron, nitrogen, and phosphorous. “We believe that the proposed process is scalable, with environmental and economic advantages, and this study could present opportunities for future research and development,” they concluded.
In another study published in 2019, researchers from Indiana’s Purdue University proposed a method to extract pure carbon from plastic waste and turned it into anode material for lithium-ion batteries which powered a toy truck

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/13/indiana-regulators-slash-net-metering-rate-advise-solar-owners-to-buy-batteries/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 13, 2021","Indiana regulators slash net metering rate, advise solar owners to buy batteries","From pv magazine USA
A coalition of solar, environmental, and consumer advocates have condemned a recent regulatory decision that they claim will “considerably set back” the rooftop solar market in southwestern Indiana.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) delivered a final order (Cause No. 45378) that reduces the credit received by future solar owners served by CenterPoint Energy unit Vectren South. The decision also changed the period for earning credits, so that more customer-owned solar generation is credited at the new lower rate.
In its decision, the commission ruled that instantaneous netting would “reasonably result” in new distributed generation customers paying for the energy they are supplied by Vectren South, “no more and no less.” The green energy groups called the ruling “a dramatic setback” for customer-owned solar in the utility’s service territory. They said it would solidify the utility’s “monopoly stranglehold on captive consumers.”
One solar installer told regulators that Vectren South’s proposal would cut the net metering rate of 14.3 cents for residential and 9.3 cents per kWh for commercial customers to about 3.1 cents per kWh. He said that the utility’s proposed instantaneous netting methodology would “drastically reduce or dry up” his company’s business, and he said the proposal would more than triple the expected customer payback period from seven to 10 years to about 25 years.
The utility based its net metering rate on the average marginal price of electricity that Vectren South paid during 2019. It averaged that price at Vectren South’s SIGE.SIGW load node, which it said represents the marginal price the utility paid for energy. That price of $25.47/MWh was used in a formula to yield $31.83/MWh.
In its ruling, the commission said that it found no support for continuing what it said was subsidization by non-solar customers of solar customers’ system payback periods. The utility testified that the cost to manage distributed generation customers – from interconnection evaluation to billing – are greater than those for other customers. Similarly, the utility’s witness testified that outflow produced by customer-owned resources does not reduce power plant, distribution, or transmission system costs.
The commission said that distributed generation customers could install a commercially available battery to make greater use of their solar system’s production. It acknowledged that such technology is expensive and may lengthen a solar system’s payback period. However, it rules that a longer payback period does not require Vectren South to continue allowing customers that own distributed generation resources to “use Petitioner’s electric system as their battery.”
It said that the fact that solar customers are generating behind the meter and, it said, buying less electricity, “will generate value and return on their private investment.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/13/australian-utility-to-deliver-hybrid-energy-systems-to-ci-customers/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 13, 2021",Australian utility to deliver hybrid energy systems to C&I customers,"From pv magazine Australia
Sydney-based AGL has announced plans to partner with Finland's Wärtsilä to develop systems for commercial and industrial customers who have paired renewables with behind-the-meter and off-grid technologies, as Australia’s biggest energy retailer seeks to distance itself from its reputation as the nation's biggest climate polluter.
AGL and Wärtsilä aim to provide a broader range of options to consumers with energy requirements above 20 MW. In March, AGL acquired Epho and Solgen Energy Group. The merger transformed AGL into the largest commercial solar supplier in Australia. And its new partnership with Wärtsilä will further expand the possibilities for C&I customers to embrace renewables. 
The two companies will provide “innovative systems” that integrate solar, wind, battery storage and gas-firming technologies. Wärtsilä Energy President Sushil Purohit said that intelligent energy-management software and balancing engine power plants will also be needed to support the integration of renewables into power systems in ways that maintain system flexibility, network stability and energy security.
“These systems will provide customers with certainty and peace of mind – knowing on low generation solar or wind days, flexible firming technologies are in place to meet their demands,” said AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof.
In March, AGL announced plans to partition itself into two energy businesses with separate strategies (one green, one brown). The move followed intense pressure over its poor environmental record and slumping fossil fuel assets. The announcement was met with little enthusiasm from the market, but it came off the back of news that the company would expedite the retirement of Australia’s dirtiest coal power station, Loy Yang, so it can replace it with a 200 MW big battery.
In January, AGL also secured a non-exclusive framework agreement with Wärtsilä to supply up to 1 GW of grid-scale batteries across Australia's National Electricity Market.
