Approval clears the way for the dozen EU member states to support companies in a push for innovation at all stages of the battery supply chain, under the bloc's state aid rules.
The €2.9 billion project – the second battery-related IPCEI approved by the commission – will run until 2028 and is expected to leverage a further €9 billion of private sector investment.
It is anticipated the Europe-wide project will unearth new battery chemistries and production methods as innovation is funded at every stage of the battery supply chain, from extracting raw materials through design and manufacturing to recycling and disposal under a circular economy approach.
Circular manufacturing was the focus of the pv magazine UP initiative’s Q3 theme. We considered whether adopting circular approaches could create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Browse our coverage here.
The seven EU member states involved in the initial EU battery IPCEI project – Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Finland and Sweden – which was approved in December 2019, are all involved in the latest initiative, alongside Austria, Croatia, Greece, Slovakia and Spain.
The project will see 46 direct participants backed by their member states with up to €2.9 billion of public money as they conduct 300 industrial and scientific partnerships with more than 150 external partners, including European universities, research institutes and small and medium-seized enterprizes, the European Commission announced yesterday.
Italy will support 12 of the direct project participants and Germany 11, with Austria backing six; Slovakia four; Finland three; France, Spain and Belgium two each and one representative from each of Greece and Croatia. Poland will back the research efforts of SGL Carbon jointly with Germany, which will also support Northvolt with the Swedish government.
Italy will be represented by Fluorsid, Green Energy Storage, Italmatch Chemicals, Solvay, FCA, Enel X, Midac, Endurance, FIAMM, FPT Industrial and Engitec with Manz jointly backed by the Italian and German governments. In addition to SGL Carbon, Manz and Northvolt, Germany will support ACIS, Alumina Systems, BMW, Tesla, Cellforce Group, Elringklinger, Skeleton Technologies and Liofit.
The Austrian participants in the project will be Borealis, Varta Micro Innovation, AVL, Miba emobility, Rosendahl Nextrom and Voltlabor. Slovakia will fund research by Inobat Auto and Inobat Energy, Energo Aqua and ZTS Vav. Keliber, Fortum and Valmet Automotive will represent Finland; Arkema and Tokai Carbon Group, France; Ferroglobe and Little Electric Cars, Spain; and Hydrometal and Prayon, Belgium. Greek entity Sunlight Systems and Croatian representative Rimac Automoboli complete the line-up of direct participants conducting research in the fields of raw and advanced materials, battery cells and systems, and recycling and sustainability, with several bodies working across two areas of innovation.

The six arrays, which will have a total surface of 19x6m and a combined capacity of 120 kW, will provide an increase of up to 30% in installed power for the station, which already relies on eight solar arrays. “The arrays will provide [the] ISS with electricity to sustain its systems and equipment, plus augment the electricity available to continue a wide variety of public and private experiments and research in the station’s unique microgravity environment,” Boeing group said.

In a press release, NASA said that the new solar arrays will bring the total installed PV capacity of the ISS station to 215 kW. “Each new solar array will produce more than 20 kW of electricity, eventually totaling 120 kW (120,000 W) of augmented power during orbital daytime,” the agency specified. “In addition, the remaining uncovered solar array pair and partially uncovered original arrays will continue to generate approximately 95 kW of power for a total of up to 215 kW (215,000 W) of power available to support station operations at completion.”
The solar systems will be brought to the ISS in pairs in the unpressurized trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft during three resupply missions starting this year. “The installation of each solar array will require two spacewalks: one to prepare the worksite with a modification kit and another to install the new solar array,” NASA further explained.
California-based Deployable Space Systems, a provider of deployable structures and deployable solar arrays for satellites and spacecraft, will manufacture the six new PV systems, with Spectrolab supplying its XTJ Prime high-efficiency solar cells for the arrays. “The XTJ Prime space solar cells are much more efficient than any of their predecessors and are fit to support the cutting-edge research being done aboard the International Space Station,” said Spectrolab president Tony Mueller, without disclosing further technical details.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/27/australian-storage-pricing-could-cannibalize-itself-with-latest-big-battery-announcements/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SPAIN",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 27, 2021",Australian storage pricing could ‘cannibalize’ itself with latest big battery announcements,"From pv magazine Australia
This month saw Neoen announce plans for a 500 MW battery, only to have Origin dwarf the proposal with its 700 MW battery a day later.
While the proposals are, for now, little more than best-laid plans, Cornwall Insight Australia’s principal consultant, Ben Cerini, said that announcements of such large capacities being integrated into the National Electricity Market (NEM) inevitably make developers take notice.
“The NEM will only be able to integrate a certain capacity of storage assets before pricing begins to cannibalise itself,” Cerini told pv magazine Australia. It is, however, still too soon to truly ascertain how saturated Australia’s jurisdiction are becoming. “We know that these projects are likely to take several years to get permitted and built and are usually announced in much larger sizes than the projects that get built.”
Cerini said the market’s faster-than-expected battery storage rollout means it’s likely that the NEM will have access to more storage assets to solve anticipated grid issues, but adds the proof will be in the pudding.
“The major shift in the market will come when a number of these larger projects reach the construction phase,” he said. “There are many developers and gentailers that are obtaining permits undertaking technical or grid studies to ascertain the best places to incorporate storage, but this doesn’t mean construction will begin tomorrow. As we saw with the fallout from the renewables rush, developers need to make sure that they are developing these assets in the best locations given the technical, regulatory and economic landscape to make sure the viability of their asset is robust to market changes.”
Australia’s position as the world leader of solar penetration, coupled with its arcane grid, has made it a hotbed for energy storage innovation and investment. If just 10% of Cornwall's projected 7 GW  storage pipeline is completed by 2024, it would result in a capacity more than 13x the  Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) forecast in its Integrated System Plan (ISP).
As Cerini also noted, the battery storage forecast by AEMO focuses on reliability of the grid, overlooking many of the services a big battery can provide.
“[Frequency Control Ancillary Services] FCAS markets are a large driver of revenues for large scale battery assets in the NEM … last calendar year FCAS revenues accounted for more than 90% of revenues at Ballarat ESS (c.f. to ~80% in CY19) and more than 96% for Hornsdale Power Reserve (c.f. 83% in CY19),” he said. 
“We know there are multiple rule changes that are developing new system services or ‘essential services’ under the Energy Security Boards Post 2025 Market Design work, including fast frequency response, primary frequency response, inertia services, system strength (i.e. voltage oscillation, fault levels or voltage collapse etc.), system integrity protection schemes, peak load reduction at specific network points, congestion alleviation. There is also likely to be new non-ancillary service that batteries could participate in including an operational reserve market. As we may find, Victoria and South Australia are the first states to see the full impact storage can have on market outcomes and whether or not the current rule changes will allow for trading optimisation with co-located assets behind the connection point.”

The procurement exercise, which drew bids for 831.2 MW of capacity, was once again under-subscribed. The government initially hoped to assign 1.16 GW of new projects.
Wind power was once again the leading source, with 259 MW allocated across twelve sites. The GSE also awarded 20 MW of solar capacity across three locations. These include two PV projects submitted by Trisol 82 Srl, planned to be located in the province of Nuoro, in the region of Sardinia, with capacities of 4.16 MW and 5.09 MW, respectively. For both projects, the offered price was €0.06819/kWh, which was the lowest bid of the procurement exercise.
The third project is a 10.6 MW PV plant planned by Engie Rinnovabili Sardegna Srl in the same province of Nuovo. The company offered a price of €0.0686/kWh in an auction with a €70/MWh price ceiling.
In the third renewables auction, held in October, the GSE had assigned 95.5 MW of solar capacity across four locations. The lowest bid – submitted for a PV project – was €0.06490/kWh. The big surprise in that tender was the inclusion of an 82.3 MW solar power plant to be built in the municipality of Uta, near Cagliari, which is also located in Sardinia.
In the second renewables auction, only 19.3 MW of PV capacity was allocated across four projects. The lowest price, of €56/MWh, was offered for a solar project. In the first procurement round, only one 5 MW solar plant was awarded, along with 495 MW of wind capacity. The single PV project will sell electricity for €60/MWh.
The limited success of solar in these exercises is due to tender rules that exclude projects on agricultural land. The Italian government hopes to allocate approximately 4.8 GW of generating capacity in the auction scheme, which includes smaller procurement rounds for projects under 1 MW.
Italy, which has around 20.9 GW of solar capacity, is planning to install around 50 GW by 2030.

The company has asked holders of the notes to postpone settlement for a further three years and to sign away opposition to a proposed debt restructure in the event the senior note swap fails to take take place.
GCL gave investors until yesterday to sign up for the deal but was forced to extend the deadline until Friday, with the notes set to mature on Saturday.
The company told investors on Friday, ahead of a vote on a solar project sell-off next month which could generate RMB2 billion ($309 million), it had debts of RMB7.16 billion to settle by June 30.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/27/satellite-derived-datasets-to-measure-ground-albedo-for-bifacial-pv/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 27, 2021",Satellite-derived datasets to measure ground albedo for bifacial PV,"Most natural ground surfaces have low values of albedo for bifacial PV projects compared to ice, snow, and water, or artificial surfaces in buildings or in industrial areas. For this reason, calculating the right albedo value of a ground surface can make a big difference for a solar project developer in deciding whether to use bifacial or monofacial panels in a ground-mounted array.
In order to make this choice possible, a researcher from the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Bill Marion, has created a series of datasets of measured ground albedo values using measurement network data in the U.S. and data contributed by the PV industry. A source of satellite-derived albedos is the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). The NSRDB contains solar radiation and supplementary meteorological data with a spatial resolution of 4km. It provides hourly and half-hourly values of meteorological data and the three most common measurements of solar radiation: global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance. “Albedo is the main factor for differences between monofacial and bifacial,” Marion told pv magazine. “The albedo errors we saw in the NSRDB equate to an energy production error of about 1.5%.”
The researcher compared the satellite-derived albedo from the NSRDB with the measured albedo data from the Surface Radiation budget (SURFRAD) network which is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and which is generally used by U.S. researchers to support satellite retrieval validation; modeling; and climate, hydrology, and weather research. “The purpose of the comparison is to understand if the satellite-derived albedos from the NSRDB are equivalent to measuring the albedo at a location or to what extent they differ, and with consideration for the uncertainty of the measured albedos,” the academic explained. “The uncertainties of albedo measurements are influenced by the spatial homogeneity of the ground surface, the spectral and angular response of the pyranometers and their calibration, and the shading of the ground surface by the pyranometers and their support structure.”
The comparison between the albedo values from the NSRDB and those from the SURFRAD network locations showed a bias difference varying from minus-0.044 to 0.056. “These differences are greater than the albedo measurement uncertainty of [plus or minus] 0.02; consequently, the NSRDB albedos should be used with caution for estimating the performance of bifacial PV systems,” Marion explained.
For other sources of measured data, the NREL scientists also relied on the Ameriflux Network, which is a collection of long-term, eddy flux measurement stations located across the Western Hemisphere. “The AmeriFlux Network is intended to represent major climate and ecological biomes including tundra, grasslands, savanna, crops, and forests,” the scientists specified, noting that additional data for albedo measurements were also provided by Chinese-Canadian module manufacturer Canadian Solar, U.S. panel maker SunPower Corporation, the Technical University of Denmark, and 7X Energy, which is a U.S.-based large scale solar project developer.
Canadian Solar Inc. provided albedo data for two locations in China: a project located in Changshu, in Jiangsu province, and a project in the desert of Inner Mongolia. SunPower provided data for a PV system with a light-to-medium gray gravel ground surface located in California, and the Technical University of Denmark took albedo data for a grass surface in the Scandinavian country. Moreover, 7X Energy presented data for PV projects located in Ohio and Texas. “The data are not representative for all kinds of projects but the type of ground cover is described so users can judge if it is applicable to their situation,” Marion specified.
The measured albedo datasets and a user’s guide describing the data can be seen on a dedicated online platform of the NREL’s DuraMAT website. The measurement techniques adopted in the research are presented in the paper Measured and satellite-derived albedo data for estimating bifacial photovoltaic system performance, published in Solar Energy.

German solar module and battery manufacturer Axitec has launched AXIstorage Li SH, a lithium-ion-based residential battery that can be individually adapted to the electricity needs of households with rooftop PV systems.
According to the provider, 4-6 battery modules fit into the housing of the home storage system and its storage capacity ranges from 10 to 15 kWh. The battery can be expanded at any time in 2.5 kWh steps, up to 15 kWh if a household needs this due to increased demand, the manufacturer continues.
The expansion of the device can be carried out by a single installer, according to Axitec, which said the energy pack only weighs 22kg. The high-voltage storage system is compatible with the hybrid inverters Plenticore Plus, from German manufacturer Kostal, and Sunny Boy Storage, from SMA.
“The photovoltaic home storage system is manufactured in Germany and the production partner is BMZ,” Axitec managing director Steffen Wiedmann told pv magazine. The product is sold through photovoltaic wholesalers or from Axitec directly. The prices for the high-voltage storage unit are “only available on request,” Wiedmann further explained.
Axitec is based in Böblingen, in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg. It produces there mono and polycrystalline modules with power outputs of between 270 and 445 W.

The two inverters, which were labeled PVS-10/12.5/15-TL and PVS-20/30/33-TL, have a power output ranging from 10 to 33 kW and are claimed to reach an input voltage of 1100 V (DC).
The most powerful devices of the series have been developed to deal with increasing PV module currents, as in the case of bifacial modules, the manufacturer said, noting that both inverters feature current monitoring on each string allowing for longer strings as well as the ability to operate across wider temperature ranges.
The two devices also feature potential induced degradation (PID) prevention and an integrated zero-export system, which the producer said delivers savings on BoS and removes the need for expensive additional devices. “Integrated wifi/ethernet for TCP/IP networking allows for cost efficient networking and off-the-shelf replacements,” Fimer further explained. “And, for retrofit applications, the inverter range offers unique DC-side flexibility.”
The two inverters are also said to allow for quick installation, easy handling and maintenance and fast commissioning through the company's dedicated app. More details on the products will be officially unveiled later this month.
Mostly known for its central inverter business, Fimer announced plans to enter the string inverter business in 2018.

Spain's Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (Miteco) has announced the final results of this week's renewable energy auction, with solar PV securing two-thirds of the total capacity allocations.
The Spanish government said that about 2.04 GW of capacity was awarded to PV developers, while wind farm developers took 998 MW, out of a total of 3.03 GW of capacity. The lowest bid for solar was €0.01498 ($0.018)/kWh, while the highest was €0.02890/kWh, with an average price of €0.02447/kWh. The lowest offer for wind power was €0.020/kWh.
The current minimum price is just one-third of what was paid in the renewables auction in 2017. The average price paid to all solar projects is 80% lower than the average price recorded in the 2017 auction. This is the lowest level registered in an auction in Spain for PV technology. However, the €0.01120/kWh level recorded in Portugal's most recent auction, or the prices seen in Abu Dhabi's auction last July, have not been exceeded. 
Portuguese utility EDP, Italy's Falck Renewables, and South Korea's Hanwha were the only international companies to secure projects in the Spanish auction this week. All of the other winning bidders were domestic companies, including X-Elio, Iberdrola, Endesa, Greenalia, Solaria Energía and Naturgy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/27/corporate-renewables-purchases-hit-record-23-7-gw-in-2020/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 27, 2021",Corporate renewables purchases hit record 23.7 GW in 2020,"From pv magazine USA
Corporations bought a record amount of clean energy in 2020, despite the devastation of the pandemic, with the US market maintaining its lead and new markets driving growth, according to a new report from BloombergNEF (BNEF).
The 2020 figure is up slightly from 20.1 GW in 2019 and more than 10 GW above the 13.6 GW seen in 2018. BNEF noted that the 2020 increase came despite the pandemic, global recession, and uncertainty about US energy policy ahead of the presidential election.
“To not only maintain, but grow, the clean energy procurement market under these conditions is a testament to how high sustainability is on many corporations’ agendas,” said Kyle Harrison, BNEF senior associate and lead author of the report.
BNEF found in its H1 2021 Corporate Energy Market Outlook that clean energy contracts were signed by more than 130 companies in sectors ranging from oil and gas to big tech.
Regional growth
Although the United States was once again the world's largest market, it was less dominant than in previous years. Companies announced 11.9 GW of corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the United States in 2020, down from 14.1 GW in 2019. According to BNEF, this represented the first year-on-year drop since 2016. The first half of 2020, coinciding with the start of the pandemic, was particularly subdued, with companies announcing just 4.3 GW of corporate PPAs in the United States during that period.
Latin America also had a down year, with corporate PPA volumes dropping from 2 GW in 2019 to 1.5 GW in 2020. The region was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic downturn. However, BNEF said companies in Brazil signed a record of nearly 1.06 GW of PPAs in 2020, as many continued to migrate to the country’s free market, where they can sign bilateral clean energy contracts directly with developers.
Once the main draw for corporate procurement in the Latin American region, Mexico saw deal volumes all but dissipate. BNEF claimed this is because the current administration continues to undermine the country’s clean energy sector.

While the U.S. and Latin America slipped back, other corporate procurement markets stepped up.
Corporate PPA volumes in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region nearly tripled, from 2.6 GW in 2019 to a record 7.2 GW in 2020. In Spain, companies announced contracts to purchase no less than 4.2 GW of clean energy, up from 300 MW the previous year.
BNEF said solar and wind projects in Spain yield some of the cheapest and most competitive prices in Europe, thanks to strong natural resources and a large pool of experienced developers. Companies like Total and Anheuser-Busch are orchestrating “cross-border virtual PPAs” in Spain, buying clean energy in the country to offset their load elsewhere in Europe.
Corporations also purchased record clean energy volumes in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, announcing contracts for 2.9 GW of solar and wind. Taiwan established itself as a major corporate clean energy market in 2020, with companies signing PPAs totaling 1.25 GW. BNEF said the Taiwanese market should be supported by a new policy that requires companies with an annual load above 5 MW to buy clean power. Also, the island has a high concentration of large manufacturers, many of which are feeling pressure from their customers to decarbonize.
South Korea is expected to be the next major corporate procurement market in Asia. Policymakers revised the country’s Electric Utility Act in the beginning of 2021, creating a PPA mechanism and a green tariff program with Korea Electric Power Corp. The revision will also allow companies to purchase unbundled certificates and retire them against sustainability commitments. According to BNEF, South Korean companies face similar supply-chain pressures to those in Taiwan.
“More than ever before, corporations have access to affordable clean energy at a global scale,” said Jonas Rooze, lead sustainability analyst at BNEF. “Companies no longer have an excuse for falling behind on setting and working towards a clean energy target.”
Clean companies
BNEF found that Amazon was the leading buyer of clean energy in 2020, announcing 35 separate clean energy PPAs in 2020, totaling 5.1 GW. The company has now purchased more than 7.5 GW of clean energy to date, vaulting it ahead of Google (6.6 GW) and Facebook (5.9 GW) as the world’s largest clean energy buyer. French oil major Total (3 GW), TSMC (1.2 GW) and U.S. telecom Verizon (1 GW) were the next largest corporate buyers of clean energy in 2020.

BNEF said the flow of new companies making clean energy commitments is another indicator of how much more the market can grow, with 65 new companies joining the RE100 in 2020. They vowed to offset 100% of their electricity consumption with clean energy. BNEF forecast that the 285 RE100 members will collectively need to purchase an additional 269 TWh of clean electricity in 2030 to meet their RE100 goals. Should this shortfall be met exclusively with offsite PPAs, it would catalyze an estimated 93 GW of new, incremental solar and wind build.
“Investor interest in sustainability is sky high, with inflows to sustainability-focused funds growing 300% between 2019 and 2020,” explained Harrison. “Companies in all sectors, including hard-to-abate ones like oil and gas and mining, are feeling the pressure to purchase clean energy and decarbonize. This group is only just scratching the surface on the amount of clean energy build it can catalyze.”
