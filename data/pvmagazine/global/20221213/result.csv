The material, Li8/7Ti2/7V4/7O2, is a binary system of optimized portions of lithium titanate (Li2TiO3) and lithium vanadium dioxide (LiVO2). When ball-milled down to an appropriate particle size in the order of nanometers, it offers high capacity due to its large quantity of lithium ions that can be reversibly inserted and extracted during the charge/discharge process. The researchers tested the new positive electrode material in an all-solid-state cell by combining it with an appropriate solid electrolyte and a negative electrode. The cell exhibited a remarkable capacity of 300 mA.h/g, with no degradation over 400 charge/discharge cycles, as reported in Nature Materials. “The absence of capacity fading over 400 cycles clearly indicates the superior performance of this material compared with those reported for conventional all-solid-state cells with layered materials,” said Associate Professor Neeraj Sharma from UNSW Sydney. “This finding could drastically reduce battery costs. The development of practical high-performance solid-state batteries can also lead to the development of advanced electric vehicles.”

Automaker Stellantis has signed the second-largest corporate PPA on record, in order to procure 400 MW of new solar in Michigan under utility DTE Energy’s MIGreenPower program.
With its participation in the utility program, Stellantis will be able to attribute 100% of its electricity use at 70 Michigan manufacturing and office facilities to solar by 2026. That will reduce the company’s emissions in North America by 50% and across its manufacturing facilities by 30% overall.
The clean energy commitment represents BloombergNEF’s second-largest corporate PPA on record, and the agreement with DTE Energy represents enough clean energy to power 130,000 homes each year. The 400 MW agreement trails the 650 MW solar agreement that rival automaker Ford signed with DTE Energy in August to provide clean power to its respective Michigan operations.
“While this day and this historic agreement are about clean and efficient power, I’d like to suggest that today is also about the power of partnerships in this new era of sustainable mobility,” said Mark Stewart, chief operating officer of Stellantis North America.
DTE Energy’s MIGreenPower program has procured more than 800 businesses to date as well as more than 75,000 residential customers. On an annual basis, MIGreenPower customers have contributed to 4 million megawatt hours of clean energy in the program.  More information and to enroll in the utility program can be found here.
DTE is Michigan’s largest producer renewable energy. In its CleanVision Integrated Resource Plan filed last month with the Michigan Public Service Commission, DTE proposed increasing investment in solar and wind energy, accelerating the retirement of coal plants, and investing in the development of new energy storage – all reinforcing DTE’s commitment to cleaner energy.
If the CleanVision plan is approved by regulators, the utility will add more than 15 GW of new renewable energy projects over the next two decades.
Michigan is currently ranked 24th in the United States for solar installations, receiving 0.8% of its electricity from its 937.7 MW installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The state has more than 3.5 GW of growth stage assets for deployment over the next five years.
The December print edition of pv magazine visits Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and includes coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
Stellantis committed to a 2021 plan that called for the addition of self-production and on-site renewable energy generation across its global manufacturing operations.  In 2021, the company consumed 16,058 GWh of energy, of which renewable energy was 7.5% of its usage.
In Europe, the company has signed 12,000 MWh PPA agreements in Zaragoza, Spain to procure solar power and 4,000 MWh of solar at the Mangualde manufacturing plant in Portugal. Its Zaragoza plant is Spain’s largest renewable energy self-generating project, with 19,200 PV modules installed with 8.64 MW of total power capacity.
In Asia, Stellantis powered its facility in Ranjangaon, India, with wind and solar energy of about 8.5 GWh per year.

The two companies have agreed to sell power to Swedish clothing retailer H&M Group from a 90 MW solar plant now under development in Hultsfred, Kalmar county, in southern Sweden.
Construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2023. Alight said it will use solar panels with a low carbon footprint from an undisclosed manufacturer for the project. The project will be commissioned by 2025.
“This is our first PPA in Sweden and our ninth in the Nordics. Our long-term contracts in the region include now almost half a gigawatt of renewable energy,” said Neoen CEO, Xavier Barbaro.
In December 2021, Alight signed a five-year PPA for an 18 MW solar park with Swedish restaurant group Martin & Servera. In June 2021, it signed a 10-year deal for an 8 MW solar park it wants to build at an unspecified location in southern Sweden. To date, it has closed more than 50 PPAs in Sweden.
Sweden could potentially add 750 MW of solar in 2022, according to research firm Becquerel Sweden. In 2021, the country added 499.7 MW of solar, up by about 25% year on year from 2020. Some unsubsidized projects are already under development in the country and their current growth in popularity is likely connected to generally favorable conditions for solar.

Many of the developing countries who have contributed the least to climate change are the most vulnerable to it. Not least because they lack access to modern energy services to help them develop and become more resilient. Shockingly, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates the number of people without access to electricity is set to rise by almost 20 million this year, to 775 million. It would be the first such rise for decades.

Radically expanding electricity access is a moral imperative. Decentralized renewables are the most effective option for reaching hundreds of millions of people living in energy poverty, and to replace highly inefficient diesel generators used by millions more. As the IEA states, there is no pathway to net-zero without first achieving universal electricity access. More than that, without electricity access, the energy poor will be left to combat the ravages of climate change without the tools to address it. Off-grid solar lighting, communications, irrigation, and cooling are vital to build food, energy, and water security; electrify healthcare; power emergency response; and help families, enterprizes, and nations become more resilient to climate risks.
And yet, the funds committed to the off-grid solar market remain stubbornly low. GOGLA's “Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report 2022” shows the last decade has seen just $2.5 billion invested in off-grid solar, leaving a $25 billion gap to meet the UN sustainable development goal of universal access to electricity. Just 3% of the annual international climate finance target  – $3 billion per year – is needed for off-grid electricity to contribute to that aim. This is a drop in the ocean compared to the $440 billion governments around the world spent on fossil fuel subsidies last year.
COP27 gave some hope of a step change in ambition.
The World Bank launched the DARES (distributed access through renewable energy scale-up) platform, with the objective of tripling the pace of electrification in Africa by developing innovative instruments to support the uptake of decentralized renewable energy. The Beyond the Grid Fund for Africa announced an additional €19 million ($20 million) from new donor Norway, bringing the fund to €126 million which will be used to reach many more off-grid beneficiaries and sustainable businesses.
The REACH program – championed by US nonprofit Acumen, the Green Climate Fund, US development body Power Africa, and the World Bank – was announced, with an ambition to target support to countries without off-grid solar markets to rapidly expand access.
Philantropic organizations made bold funding commitments, starting ambitious alliances and programs promising to accelerate a just energy transition and promote green growth. Top among these is the Global Alliance for People and Planet, founded by the Rockefeller and Ikea foundations, which launched its first impact report at the conference: a clarion call to end energy poverty by using distributed renewable energy.
GOGLA remains hopeful such organizations can embrace off-grid solar as part of their bold ambitions; it is not possible to end energy poverty without solar lanterns and solar home systems. These are crucial steps, which recognize the importance of off-grid solar but they are not enough. As philanthropy, donor governments, and climate finance institutions reflect on COP27 and formulate plans to achieve a faster and more just clean energy transition, GOGLA urges them to increase their support to off-grid solar in three key areas.
While the off-grid industry has already reached 490 million people, it needs many more companies if it is to play its part in achieving universal electrification. There is a particular shortage of early-stage financing, specifically for smaller and locally-owned companies, often in nascent or emerging markets. The cost of debt remains eye-wateringly high. Grants and blended, public-and-private finance are essential to build the market and unlock private capital.
This will be one of the most effective ways for philanthropic and public money to leverage private investment.
The sector needs to serve new regions and lower-income people, provide a wider range of products and services, and unlock local enterprize. More funding is needed to help companies innovate, start up, and prove their concepts.
This will create one of the most catalytic and impactful industries of the decades ahead.
With many industries creating negative effects with impunity, the off-grid solar industry, by contrast produces positive benefits which are not sufficiently rewarded. Extra income, in the form of end-user subsidies or results-based finance, could be a game-changer to enhance affordability and sustainability. Supporting off-grid solar companies to gain access to voluntary carbon markets or adaptation finance would unlock another important revenue stream.
This will be the most efficient way of subsidizing energy access.
The off-grid solar industry is ready for investment. It has established a technology and business model that delivers for people and planet. With relatively small sums; philanthropy, donor governments, and climate finance institutions could transform the lives of 700 million climate-vulnerable people. A net-zero world and the just energy transition cannot be achieved without it. Now is the time to make it happen.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/13/novel-agrivoltaic-array-tech-for-greenhouses/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ISRAEL",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",Novel agrivoltaic array tech for greenhouses,"Israeli startup Trisolar, a spinoff of the Triangle Research and Development Center, has launched a new plug-and-play PV system technology for applications in agrivoltaic projects and greenhouses.
“It is a crop-responsive PV tracking system for inside greenhouses,” the company's founder and CTO, Esther Magadley, told pv magazine. “It is commercialized including the tracking structure, motor, controller and the specially designed solar panels.”
The modules are bifacial products manufactured by an unspecified producer, based on specifications provided by Trisolar.
“They are smaller and lighter than standard PV modules and are semi-transparent, with a transparent backsheet and spaces between cells,” Magadley explained. “Parts of the system are assembled before its deployment, making the installation inside the greenhouse as easy as possible.”
The system features a programmable logic controller (PLC) type controller to alter the angles of the tracking system, so the plants get the level of light or shading they require for optimal growth performance.
“In greenhouses with coverings that ensure diffuse light, the use of bifacial panels ensures healthy generation of electricity even in low light conditions,” Magadley said, noting that the system also eliminates the need to shade crops in the summer.
The company says the system is designed to be built with one-fifth of the labor needed to install conventional PV systems. It can also be installed in a broad range of climates. The company claims the system can also be used for a wide range of purposes, including desalination and cooling.
“As far as we know we are the only group that has worked with agronomists consistently over the last five years and as a result have demonstrated over a large number of studies exactly how our system can generate substantial amounts of power without any damage at all to agricultural yields,” Magadley added. “Our system is price competitive with ground mounted PV installations and delivers the power with a far lower carbon footprint than any other system on the market.”
The company has so far built several demonstrators in Israel.
“Results from our trials showed an increase in fruit weight and number of fruit produced in the greenhouse,” Magadley said. “This shows that crop yields are either not affected or  even improved when our system is used inside a greenhouse.”
In January, the Triangle Research and Development Center unveiled research showing how organic PV modules could power polytunnel greenhouses. It found that such panels might offer advantages over conventional crystalline silicon, despite their lower efficiency rates.
Magadaley said at the time that organic PV solutions can be semitransparent, or come in different colors with different spectral transmittance properties. They transmit as much of the light spectrum as needed for plant growth, while using the other parts of the light spectrum for electricity production.
“We can produce electricity without affecting crop growth,” said Magadaley.

“The Ge heterojunction solar cell was developed as the bottom cell of the triple-junction solar cell,” researcher Makoto Konagai told pv magazine. “Concrete applied research is a future theme. It could be used as a detector in the infrared region or a light-emitting device in the infrared region.”
One of the biggest issues with Ge solar cells is cleaning the Ge wafers from impurities and reducing their reflectance.
“For Ge wafers, unlike silicon, there is no known simple texture etching method to reduce the surface reflectance,” the scientists said.
With this in mind, they built the cell with a magnesium fluoride (MgF2) as an anti-reflecting coating and an 80-nanometer indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate with antireflection properties. They said the two layers were able to increase the cell short-circuit current.
The researchers also used a passivation layer based on n-type doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (n-a-Si:H), a 317 μm thick p-doped Ge wafer that went through hydrofluoric acid (HF) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) treatment, a buffer layer made of a-Si:H, another ITO substrate, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
“In heterojunction Ge solar cells, the surface treatment of wafers and the passivation of the n-a-Si:H / p-Ge interface are very important,” they said, noting that both the HF and HCl treatments are key to increasing open-circuit voltage. “In addition, by increasing the thickness of the i-a-Si:H layer on the low resistivity substrate, the solar cell characteristics tended to improve in all parameters.”
They tested the Ge solar cell under standard illumination conditions. It achieved an efficiency of 8.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 291 mV, a short-circuit current of 45.0 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.656.
“At present, Ge wafers are expensive, so we are not at the stage of discussing the cost yet,” Konagai said. “Since the manufacturing cost is high, it is crucial to increase the conversion efficiency to reduce the power generation cost.”

Australian researchers have discovered that sound waves can be used to “divide and conquer” water molecules during electrolysis.
“The electrical output of the electrolysis with sound waves was about 14 times greater than electrolysis without them, for a given input voltage,” said RMIT researcher Yemima Ehrnst. “This was equivalent to the amount of hydrogen produced.”
The research, recently published in Advanced Energy Materials, could help to bring down green hydrogen production costs.
“One of the main challenges of electrolysis is the high cost of electrode materials used, such as platinum or iridium,” said RMIT Associate Professor Amgad Rezk.
Rezk said the use of sound waves to unlock more hydrogen could eliminate the need for expensive and corrosive materials like platinum or iridium. “As water is not a corrosive electrolyte, we can use much cheaper electrode materials such as silver,” he said.
The use of sound waves also prevented the build-up of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles on the electrodes, Ehrnst added, noting that this greatly improved conductivity and stability.
RMIT Professor Leslie Yeo said the discovery opens the door to using the new acoustic platform for other applications – especially when bubble build-up on the electrodes is a challenge.
“Our ability to suppress bubble build-up on the electrodes and rapidly remove them through high-frequency vibrations represents a major advance for electrode conductivity and stability,” said Yeo. “With our method, we can potentially improve the conversion efficiency leading to a net-positive energy saving of 27%.”
The researchers have already filed a provisional patent application for the technology, but they said they still need to overcome challenges around the integration of the sound wave innovation with existing electrolyzers to scale up their work.
“We are keen to collaborate with industry partners to boost and complement their existing electrolyzer technology and integrate into existing processes and systems,” said Yeo.

Solar, wind and other renewable energy sources are expected to continue building momentum, with installed capacity set to grow by about 2,400 GW through 2027, according to the IEA.
It said that renewable energy will account for 90% of all planned capacity expansions throughout the world, dominated by solar and wind. Cumulative solar PV capacity will almost triple under the IEA forecast, growing by nearly 1,500 GW and surpassing natural gas by 2026 and coal by 2027.
“Renewables were already expanding quickly, but the global energy crisis has kicked them into an extraordinary new phase of even faster growth,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA.
Within five years, global renewables capacity could represent an amount equal to the total installed power capacity of China, said the IEA. The growth projections are 30% more than was expected last year.
IEA said low prices and security are two major drivers for the global adoption of renewable energy.
“First, high fossil fuel and electricity prices resulting from the global energy crisis have made renewable power technologies much more economically attractive, and second, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused fossil fuel importers, especially in Europe, to increasingly value the energy security benefits of renewable energy,” it said.
Birol claimed that the current energy crisis could be a “historic turning point” on the path to a clear, safer energy system.
“Renewables’ continued acceleration is critical to help keep the door open to limiting global warming to 1.5 C,” he said. Limiting global warming to this level will be key to staving off the worst effects of climate change.
Solar will account for more than 60% of all forecasted renewable capacity expansion, setting records for annual additions every year through 2027. Although module prices have increased, utility-scale PV is the least costly option for new electricity generation in most countries throughout the world.
