AES Andes, a unit of US-based AES Corp., has switched on the largest solar plant connected to battery energy storage in Latin America.
The 180 MW Andes Solar IIb solar project is connected to a 112 MWh lithium battery with five hours of storage capacity. Battery manufacturer Fluence provided the storage systems for the project.
AES installed a 10 MW unit of the plant with its Maverick 5B pre-assembled panel technology, based on prefabricated modular structures that allow the installation of the panels in a third of the time compared to conventional solar systems and using half of their surface area.
The plant is located 230 km east of Antofagasta, in the Atacama Desert, and is part of a solar hub developed by AES Chile in the region. Including the Andes Solar IIb plant, AES currently operates 429 MW of PV in the Antofagasta region.
This year, AES completed the 379 MW Cristales photovoltaic project in the Salar Imilac sector, close to the company’s Andes Solar hub.

“Alpha150 offers up to 70% more capacity for its size and 30% more capacity per kg when compared to equivalent lithium batteries,” the company claims. “With a lifespan of over 5,000 charge cycles, the Alpha150 offers double the lifespan of most lithium batteries and ten times that of equivalent deep-cycle absorbent glass mat (MAT) batteries.”
Redarc says that the 150 Ah device has a continuous discharge rating of 200 A. It measures 353 mm x 175 mm x 190 mm and weighs 15.5 kg. The device can be charged from as low as -30 C to 45 C and discharged from -20 C to 60 C. Redarc also claims that the device can be recharged up to 80% faster than competitors with a maximum charge rate of 135 A, which reduces charging time to just 1.1 hours.
“When coupled with an appropriate inverter, is enough to power any household appliance from a single battery,” it said.
The Alpha150 Lithium Batteries come with an IP55 protection level and a five-year product warranty. They are being manufactured at an unspecified location in the Netherlands.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/27/greeces-pv-fleet-keeps-power-system-running-during-heatwave/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JULY 27, 2023",Greece’s PV fleet keeps power system running during heatwave,"Greece's Independent Power Transmission Operator (IPTO) says that the country hit a record this week, with afternoon electricity demand reaching 10,345 MW – the highest point this year.
Renewable energy, including large hydro plants, covered about half of this demand, at 5,015 MW. Specifically, solar contributed 3,485 MW of capacity, according to IPTO. The remaining capacity was sourced from power flowing through interconnectors from neighboring countries, as well as from Greece's fossil gas and lignite power plants.
The Greek power system faces a persistent challenge due to successive heatwaves and wildfires since the beginning of July. Despite this, IPTO stated that it responded to the challenge with absolute success, ensuring continuous operation of the system.
Traditionally, summer afternoons posed the hardest times for safeguarding the electricity system from blackouts in Greece. However, bulk solar installations have reversed the problem.
The Greek Ministry for the Environment and Energy has encouraged electricity consumers to primarily use grid electricity between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. when solar power injection into the network is abundant. The ministry also advised Greeks to avoid energy-intensive activities like washing during the night, when solar parks do not generate power.
Although Greece set a demand record of 10,345 MW at 3 p.m. on Tuesday of this week, nighttime demand remained high at 9,388 MW at 8 p.m. and 9,144 MW at 9 p.m. During heatwaves, wind power output tends to be low, resulting in fossil fuel plants dominating the electricity mix.
In 2022, approximately half of Greece's electricity was generated from clean power plants, and the government aims to increase the penetration of green energy in the power mix. The recent heatwave experience highlighted the urgent need for energy storage.
Currently, the tendering of 1 GW of standalone, in-front-of-the-grid batteries is ongoing, with incentives for small residential storage units and licensed, co-located renewable power and storage plants that enjoy priority grid connection. Without significant energy storage capacity, Greece will be unable to phase out its dirty lignite fleet while continuing to rely on gas.
Interconnections play a crucial role in managing the heatwave challenge. IPTO attributed its successful operation during this period to the completion of two new interconnection lines: the Megalopolis-Patras-Acheloos line within Greece and a 400 kV electrical interconnection between Greece and Bulgaria, in addition to an existing line to Bulgaria installed years ago.
IPTO also emphasized two other factors contributing to its successful operation: regular checks on critical equipment to address any technical issues that may arise and the “trial operation of two new thermal units.” However, it remains unclear whether and how Greece can phase out its thermal units.

The new tool, NIAK 4, was introduced to the market just a few weeks ago at The smarter E exhibition in Munich.
“We are thrilled to see such a positive response to the InEtchSide NIAK 4,” said Peter Schneidewind, CEO of RENA. “We have always been committed to providing our customers with the latest and most efficient technology, and the new NIAK4 platform is another great example.”
This first sale of the new tool goes to a manufacturer operating a gigawatt-scale TOPCon production line. RENA did not confirm the name of the manufacturer, other than to say it was a long-term partner of theirs based in South Asia. Given the mentioned cell technology and scale, it is likely to be a Chinese module manufacturer. RENA said that the tools are expected to be delivered and installed by early 2024, and has not disclosed any financial details of the sale.
The tool builds on RENA’s existing expertise with chemical etching processes, offering fully automated etching on just one side of the wafer, including rinsing and drying. RENA says that the customer was convinced by the high throughput of 13,800 wafers per hour.
The NIAK 4 tool presents a solution to a challenge that emerged early on in TOPCon’s commercial development – that cells require layers of different materials on each side, which need to remain isolated from each other, and fully single-sided deposition processes are more complex to run at scale. So material deposited on the rear side of the wafer during low-pressure deposition needs to be removed.
“The tool finds its application in various areas of solar cell production. It excels in rear side oxide etching for high-efficiency solar cells, as well as in the single side removal of SiO2, PSG, or BSG,” explained RENA, announcing the sale. “Moreover, the NIAK 4 is fully compatible with PERC, IBC, and TOPCon technology, offering flexibility and versatility to manufacturers.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/27/is-the-eu-doing-enough-to-establish-a-solar-manufacturing-supply-chain/,"EMPLOYMENT,FINANCE,GEOPOLITICS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,EUROPE,FRANCE,GERMANY,ITALY,NETHERLANDS,POLAND,SPAIN",,"JULY 27, 2023",Is the EU doing enough to establish a solar manufacturing supply chain?,"With the global focus on renewable energy intensifying, governments around the world are implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.
The energy crisis in Europe sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting demand for energy security has strengthened the continent’s focus on solar power and the EU has responded with a Solar Strategy which includes a plan to establish a home-grown supply chain for solar manufacturing in the bloc.
The IRA was launched in August last year and the EU response was only announced seven months later, in February, since when the latter has slowly moved towards implementation.
While the IRA primarily utilizes tax incentives as its main instrument, the EU's approach, known as the Net-Zero Industry Act, focuses on several areas including easier regulation, faster access to financial support, and fair and open trade. Upon closer examination, however, it becomes evident that the EU's plan lacks specificity on how its grand objectives will be achieved. The act sets ambitious targets and goals but fails to outline clear and simplified regulation or immediate incentives for manufacturers.
To establish a European solar supply chain, EU policymakers must prioritize the development of simple and easily accessible instruments that provide tangible advantages for manufacturers based in the EU. The current policy instruments suggested, such as better access to public government tenders, will not be sufficient to attract manufacturers to the region.
Clear financial incentives, decoupled from restrictive conditions, could be a significant motivator for manufacturers to stay, or settle in the EU. These incentives could include tax incentives, low-interest loans, grants, equity instruments, subsidized land purchases, and infrastructure commitments.
The recent announcement of Swiss module manufacturer Meyer Burger’s decision to build its new cell factory in Colorado, rather than in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, is proof that the IRA is more attractive than the EU’s approach – Meyer Burger openly admits that the $1.4 billion tax incentives on offer in the US were a key decision maker.
In addition to creating effective policy instruments, EU legislators must ensure that sufficient funds are available to implement their initiatives. The current lack of clarity in the financing of the renewable energy plan creates uncertainty and hinders market confidence. It is imperative that the EU engages in transparent discussions regarding the financing of its renewable energy goals, to provide a stable and predictable investment environment. This will instill confidence among manufacturers and help attract the necessary funding for the establishment of a robust European solar supply chain.
Determining the hottest markets for solar in Europe over the next five years requires the consideration of various factors, such as political support, solar capacity targets, and electric demand. Germany, with its revived solar capacity targets, is expected to remain highly attractive for solar investments.
Countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Poland are also demonstrating strong political backing for renewable energy. In terms of added capacity and favorable electric demand, Spain and Italy are likely to be the next most prominent solar markets in Europe.
Despite the positive outlook for solar energy in Europe, the industry faces several challenges that must be addressed. Firstly, project developers often demand exorbitant prices for project rights, leading to unprofitable projects due to increased finance costs and, high equipment prices. This misalignment between project expectations and market realities impedes the implementation of solar projects.
Furthermore, the industry faces a shortage of qualified staff along the entire value chain. This scarcity of talent hampers market growth as companies struggle to meet the demands of expanding markets.
Additionally, some companies that experienced rapid growth during the solar boom may face downsizing or failure if planned projects and revenues do not materialize as expected. Even if the future of solar looks bright, these challenges still need to be overcome. The EU and member state governments could do more to help tackle these challenges.
The recently revised migration laws in Germany might be a good signal for foreign talent to join the ever growing renewable energy industry.
The EU's renewable energy policy response, particularly its focus on establishing a European solar manufacturing supply chain, falls short when compared to the IRA.
The bloc needs to move faster and demonstrate greater ambition to establish a strong and competitive European supply chain for solar manufacturing. The European Commission, parliament and Council of Ministers must finally get going, instead of just talking.

Construction of the facility in Silistra, northeastern Bulgaria, will start by the end of this year. Completion is scheduled in early 2025.
“Once constructed, it will be the largest solar plant in Bulgaria,” the renewable energy developer said in a statement. “The plant will be connected to the main 110 kV transmission grid via two independent connection lines totaling about 6 kilometers in length. The power will be sold to commercial and industrial users through long-term power purchase agreements.”
Rezolv Energy is currently also building Romania's largest PV array – a 1,044 MW solar project that was acquired from Romanian developer Monsson in November 2022. Rezolv Energy was launched in August, backed by €500 million ($487.8 million) from sustainable infrastructure investor Actis. It has said it aims to “provide subsidy-free clean energy at a long-term, stable price for commercial and industrial users, and other off-takers” in central and southeastern Europe.
In October 2022, Bulgaria‘s electricity system operator revealed that it had accepted applications to build new renewable energy projects with an aggregate installed capacity of more than 24 GW – double the country's installed generating capacity.
According to SolarPower Europe (SPE), Bulgaria reached 1.5 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of 2022. SPE says the country could hit 3.8 GW by 2024, exceeding its 2030 target. Momentum will be mainly supported by unsubsidized large-scale solar projects built under power purchase agreements.

The partners are anticipating that demand will be driven by the forecasted 800,000 tons of solar panels expected to retire each year, starting in the mid-2030s. Another potential source is damaged material caused by natural disasters which can create several thousand tons of waste each year.
A key part of the solution is a one-stop online platform to buy and sell used panels that Marubeni has been working on since 2021, a Marubeni spokesperson told pv magazine. The spokesperson said that the platform contains information about used panels, such as panel specifications, usage history, performance data, and it also supports requests for recycling services. The plan is that the platform will provide the infrastructure system for future PV reuse and recycling, according to the spokesperson.
To date, initiatives to refurbish used solar panels have stalled in Japan due to difficulties in guaranteeing their quality. To avoid that issue, Rexia offers services to assess and purchase panels based on an established performance inspection methodology. It can then sell the panels with a product warranty, providing defect liability insurance through a previously announced partnership with a major insurance company.
Solar panels that cannot be reused will be collected and transferred to solar panel recycling companies throughout Japan that have advanced recycling equipment to separate panels into glass, cell sheets, and other resources.
Marubeni’s spokesperson told that the partners expect to provide the management of reuse and recycling but are also still “looking for partners with expertise on PV modules, recycling technologies.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/27/going-beyond-renewable-non-renewable-dichotomy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 27, 2023",Going beyond renewable/non-renewable dichotomy,"Researchers at the Vellore Institute of Technology in India have proposed a new classification of energy sources that is intended to go beyond the usual dichotomy between renewable and non-renewable, or conventional, sources.
“The drawback of conventional taxonomies is that they fail to adopt and define emerging technologies, which is solved by this new classification,” the research's lead author, Ramkumar Alajingi, told pv magazine. “What we call renewables are sources whose origin is Earth/gravitational force. Whilst for bioheat, for example, the origin is ourselves. Our classification of energy sources allows proper knowledge of each energy source's behavior.”
In the study “Novel classification of energy sources, with implications for carbon emissions,” published in Energy Strategy Reviews, Alajingi and his colleagues described the proposed classification as a 3-tier taxonomy based on each source's characteristics with respect to the environment.
“Selecting low carbon emissions as criteria for promotion will effectively counter the hidden strategies of individual nation/organization energy policies for self-economic growth,” they specified, claiming that current taxonomies are subjective and rely on personal definitions attributed to each source.
The proposed new classification includes three categories: Renewable energy sources, which comprise solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass, as well as wave and tidal energy; Reserve energies, including coal, gas, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, and hydrogen produced via electrolysis; and Capture energy sources, which embrace heat losses from turbines and engineering processes, movement of air mass due to the passage of cars and trains, heat liberated from the human body, and vibration evolved due to pressure disturbance.
“Never categorized energy sources are added to the newly coined term capture energy sources,” the researchers explained, referring to the third category, noting that the old classification uses the non-renewable term for mostly brown energy such as coal, gas, and petroleum. “All man-made actions as primary causes to produce energy are grouped in this classification. The energy is in any form as heat, light, pressure and friction, etc. but unlike traditional methods, the harvesting of these sources requires modern techniques.”
This category is then divided into discharged energy sources and evolved energy sources. The latter includes all energy coming from man-made or engineered actions and the former comprises all energy forms discharged from a process as a waste or by-product.
Referring to the first of the three main categories, the Indian group said that these sources generate low carbon emissions, are location-dependent, and are proven cost-effective energy conversion solutions. “These sources never deplete from the earth,” they stressed. “It must be noted that solar, wind, tidal, and wave energies have the nature of immediate dispersion into the atmosphere if not captured.”
As for the second category, which includes conventional sources, the team said it also includes geothermal and water electrolysis of hydrogen, as these sources are based on the source reserve nature in the environment and avoids the space for conflicts.
“It is insisted that the nature of availability and present usage are vital parameters in assuring the reliability of sources for uninterrupted supply,” the academics concluded. “The terms replenish energy, reserve energy, and capture energy sources replaced the conventional 2-tier renewable and non-renewable energy sources classification.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/27/new-milestone-reached-for-teknisolars-lamination-technology/,"SPONSORED,EUROPE,GERMANY,WESTERN EUROPE,WORLD",,"JULY 27, 2023",New milestone reached for Teknisolar’s lamination technology,"Teknisolar has been chosen to become a partner of the PEPPERONI project, a four-year research and innovation project co-funded under Horizon Europe and jointly coordinated by Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin and Qcells. The project aims to support Europe in reaching its renewable energy target of climate neutrality by 2050, and it will also help advance perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaic (PV) technology’s journey toward market introduction and mass manufacturing.
In its role in the PEPPERONI project, Teknisolar will design a pilot lamination line through a series of in-house tests on perovskite solar panels to later improve upon the design through implementation on the pilot line. Teknisolar’s ultimate goal is to extend the lamination technology from pilot line to gigawatt scale (mass production). PEPPERONI comprises 17 partners from 12 countries, combining European knowledge and expertise from fundamental research to small-scale testing and development of solar cells, all the way to high-throughput industrial manufacturing of large solar modules.
After 13 years of research and development, Teknisolar, born from an idea of Vittore De Leonibus, has developed the laminator with the fastest cycle time in the world, able to solve the problems that traditional laminators cause on photovoltaic modules. For example, laminators currently on the market are equipped with a membrane that exerts pressure on the panel, which is heated only from below. Traditional laminating technology requires rigid protection around the panel (e.g., frames or angles) to counteract excessive bending of the outer edges of the top glass due to the pressure exerted by the membrane. This phenomenon is referred to as edge pinch. If it is not prevented, this edge pinch could lead to glass breakage and over time, could be the cause of so-called “delamination,” as the panel will tend to resume its initial configuration.
Teknisolar’s “Robostak” technology does not use a diaphragm or release sheet, and the rigid press applies controlled mechanical pressure without use of a diaphragm or release sheet. The super-fast vacuum system features double-sided heating, and there is no chance of the edge pinch that is experienced with traditional laminators.
Another element that differentiates Teknisolar from other laminator manufacturers is the cycle-time, which is 2 minutes for G2F (Glass to Backsheet) and 3 minutes for G2G  (Glass to Glass) modules. The cycle time for competitors is 6-10 minutes. This equates to a productivity increase of more than 300%.
Teknisolar recently participated at Intersolar 2023, where the company showed its customers its flexible and totally customizable solutions for the lamination of solar panels.
The company reports that the event was filled with inspiring conversations, innovations, and new business opportunities. Oscar Travaglini, the recently-appointed General Manager/COO of Teknisolar, said of the event, “We report particular interest from BIPV module manufacturers, also the main trends point to roof applications for general distribution and bifacial modules for the utility-scale market segment.”

The heating system will be mainly used for washing and cleaning the production lines and floors twice a day. The feed water is tap water and the hot water is stored in two tanks of 70 m3 each.
“The client is currently using steam to heat the feed water for this application,” a spokesperson from Tigi Solar told pv magazine. “The steam generator is fed by Mazut, which is a low-quality heavy fuel oil. It will now be dismantled and help the client reduce operating costs and maintenance efforts.”
The industrial heat pump used for the project has an output of 780 kW and a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.6. It measures 1.7 m² x 5.3 m² and has a weight of 6.6 tons. It uses existing ammonia chiller waste heat as the heat source, thereby improving the performance of the existing chiller, and can reportedly provide a hot water temperature of 65 C.
The heat from the heat source is transferred to the heat pump by a closed loop with an intermediate heat exchanger that allows control of the inlet temperature to the heat pump's cold side at about 17 C. A 5 m3 buffer tank helps to flatten occasional spikes and smooth the operation.
The tap water is also heated by a closed loop with an intermediate heat exchanger, to avoid scaling of the heat pump’s heat exchanger with Calcium carbonate deposition. There is also a redundant heat exchanger to allow periodical cleaning of the heat exchanger without stopping the normal operation.
“The heat pump is sized to heat the tap water from 15 C to 65 C at a flow rate of 14 m3/h,” the spokesperson said, adding that the company is also implementing machine learning for optimization of the generation cost based on energy usage patterns, varying cost of electricity, and use of thermal storage.

This tariff, which will go into effect on Aug. 1, is paid by domestic and industrial consumers in the country that want to buy electricity produced by renewable energy sources such as solar and hydropower.
“This new tariff is based on the benchmark of retail pricing of green electricity supply in neighboring countries,” the Malaysian government said in a statement.
It said that customers who now subscribe to the GET program will not be charged the Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT), a mechanism reflecting changes in the cost of electricity generation every six months. Local utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) will now adjust the electricity bill for the electricity users involved in the program.
The Green Electricity Tariff (GET) program went into force in January 2022 and offers 4,500 GWh of power per year. GET customers are charged the additional tariff for each kWh of renewable energy purchased. The energy is sold in 100 kWh blocks for residential customers and 1,000 kWh blocks for industrial consumers.
The Malaysian government is currently supporting distributed solar via net metering and large-scale PV through a series of tenders. At the end of 2022, the country had around 1,933 MW of installed solar generation capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

RMIT University researchers are planning to develop a  megawatt-scale version of their patented proton battery energy storage system, which uses a carbon electrode as a hydrogen store, coupled with a reversible fuel cell to produce electricity.
The team said it has demonstrated the proton battery as a working device and will now collaborate with Italy-based international automotive component supplier Eldor Corp. to produce a prototype unit with a storage capacity that meets the needs of a range of domestic and commercial applications including large-scale storage and electric vehicles.
Lead researcher RMIT Professor John Andrews said the aim of the collaboration is to “scale up the system from the watt to the kilowatt and ultimately to the megawatt scale.”
Andrews, from RMIT’s Sustainable Hydrogen Energy Laboratory (SHEL), said recent design improvements to their proton battery technology meant it is becoming competitive as a carbon-neutral alternative to the dominant lithium-ion technology.
“As the world shifts to intermittent renewable energy to achieve net-zero greenhouse emissions, additional storage options that are efficient, cheap, safe and have secure supply chains will be in high demand,” he said. “That’s where this proton battery, which is a very equitable and safe technology, could have real value and why we are keen to continue developing it into a viable commercial alternative.”
The RMIT proton battery uses a carbon electrode to store hydrogen that has been split from water, and then works as a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity.
During charging, the carbon in the electrode bonds with protons generated by splitting water with the help of electrons from the power supply. When discharging, protons are released from the carbon electrode and pass through a membrane to combine with oxygen from the air to form water, a reaction that generates power. Unlike fossil fuels, carbon does not burn or cause emissions in the process.
Andrews said the proton battery avoids the energy-wasting steps of storing hydrogen gas at high pressure, and then splitting these gas molecules again in fuel cells.
“Our proton battery has much lower losses than conventional hydrogen systems, making it directly comparable to lithium-ion batteries in terms of energy efficiency,” he said. “Our battery has an energy-per-unit mass already comparable with commercially-available lithium-ion batteries, while being much safer and better for the planet in terms of taking less resources out of the ground. Our battery is also potentially capable of very fast charging.”
The researchers also pointed to the environmental and economic advantages of its technology, saying it does not rely on scarce natural resources and avoids the end-of-life challenges associated with some renewable energy technologies.
“The main resource used in our proton battery is carbon, which is abundant, available in all countries and cheap compared to the resources needed for other types of rechargeable battery such as lithium, cobalt and vanadium,” the researchers said. “There are also no end-of-life environmental challenges with a proton battery, since all components and materials can be rejuvenated, reused or recycled.”

UK-based Drax Group, the project developer, said that the new pumped hydro facility will be built underground and will require an investment of GBP 500 million ($645.3 million).
Cruachan has a pumped hydro storage capacity of 440 MW and is one of only four pumped storage power stations in the United Kingdom. According to Drax, the plant currently runs for short periods to meet peaks in demand but can also operate continuously at full output for around 15 hours if necessary.
“The expansion of Cruachan requires an updated financial stabilization mechanism from the UK government,” the company said. “The current absence of a framework for large-scale, long-duration storage technologies has resulted in no new plants being constructed in the UK since 1984, despite their critical role in the decarbonization process.”
The Scottish government said that it is currently urging the UK government to provide an appropriate market mechanism to support pumped hydro and other long-term storage technologies.
Drax acquired the Cruachan Power Station for GBP 702 million from Spanish energy giant Iberdrola in 2019.

An Indiana-based utility company, AES Indiana, has submitted a request to build the state’s largest energy storage system at a semi-operational coal facility. The proposed site for the Pike County Energy Storage Project is the Petersburg Generating Facility.
The planned battery will have a peak output of 200 MW, with an “expected output [of] 800 MWh at 80% of discharge level,” according to the statements. This suggests that the facility could actually house a 1 GWh battery capacity, with AES Indiana having access to 800 MWh of it. The utility has signed an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with Fluence, the battery manufacturer that will also lead the construction of the facility.
The 200 MW will be divided into two 100 MW units, each with a capacity to last for four hours. Each 100 MW segment will connect to its own 34.5 kW to 345 kW transformers, which will supply the Petersburg Substation through a single 345 kW transmission line. The project will occupy 26 acres of the Petersburg Generating Station property.
Indiana's small-scale solar sector has faced challenges.
