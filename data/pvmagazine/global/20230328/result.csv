The company implemented a storing solution at room temperature, instead of liquefaction. “Its principle is to attract hydrogen atoms into the metal voids through a chemical reaction between hydrogen gas and new alloy materials to achieve storage purposes. At this time, if the ambient temperature of the alloy is raised, the hydrogen in it will be released, converted into electrical energy through the fuel cell, and can be incorporated into the grid.”
The European Parliament and the European Council have agreed to expand the number of publicly accessible electric recharging and hydrogen refueling stations across the European Union's main transport corridors. “Hydrogen refueling infrastructure that can serve both cars and lorries must be deployed from 2030 onwards in all urban nodes and every 200 km along the TEN-T core network, ensuring a sufficiently dense network to allow hydrogen vehicles to travel across the EU,” said the European Commission. The political agreement reached this week must now be formally adopted.
Germany and Denmark have agreed to further integrate their energy systems. They will cooperate on advancing the rollout of transmission infrastructure for green hydrogen between western Denmark and northern Germany from 2028. The two countries have also agreed to support coordination between the national regulatory authorities in the hydrogen sector. 
Algeria’s commissioner for renewable energy and energy efficiency, Noureddine Yassaa, and Minister of Energy Mohamed Arkab presented a national strategy for the development of hydrogen. The North African country wants to produce 40 TWh of hydrogen by 2040. It intends to sell most of the produced hydrogen to European markets. Algeria also sees hydrogen as an instrument to improve energy security. 
Hyundai Glovis has signed a deal with GS Energy to promote clean hydrogen and ammonia. “Under the agreement, Hyundai Glovis will provide maritime transportation services for the clean ammonia and hydrogen projects promoted by the two companies; GS Energy will be responsible for ammonia and hydrogen production and building-related import terminals,” said the South Korean companies. Hyundai Glovis has invested KRW 200 billion ($153.9 million) in two gas carriers (VLGC). The two 86,000 cubic meters vessels, to be delivered in 2024, can transport LPG and ammonia. According to the logistics company, only 20 VLGCs can ship ammonia worldwide at the moment.
BAE Systems has agreed to supply electric power and propulsion systems for three hydrogen fuel cell buses in Rochester, New York. Its electric propulsion system is integrated with a 125 kW Progen hydrogen fuel cell engine from Plug Power, which will also provide fuel infrastructure. “The Gen3 Series-H system includes an electric motor, energy storage system, and modular power electronics to create a clean mode of transportation for the buses,” said UK-based BAE Systems.

What makes this product different from other TOPCon panels?
Zhang Yingbin: The 210+N series products have outstanding characteristics, including low-temperature coefficient, low photovoltaic attenuation, high bifacial rate, low first-year attenuation, and linear attenuation, and also adheres to the advantages of high-power output, high efficiency, high power generation, and high reliability of the Vertex family, which the module power is 30 W to 70 W higher than n-type competitors on the market.
Efficiency improvement and cost reduction are the eternal themes and unremitting pursuit of the entire PV Industry. Trina Solar led the 600 W-plus alliance which has established a strong industry chain alliance with high power output, high conversion efficiency, high reliability, and low cost of electricity. While the combination of 210 mm wafer and n-type cell tech will be an amplifier for module performance. Compared with 182 mm wafer products, 70 W more power will be generated for each piece of panel, and the efficiency is around 0.2% higher. At the same time, the low voltage design can increase the string power with a same string voltage.
In terms of power generation, according to our more than half year long verification study with TUV and CPVT in areas with different latitudes, the experimental data has proved that the 600 W-plus product based on 210 mm wafer can increase the power generation gain by about 1.6% to 2.1%, which mainly from the better low-irradiation performance of 600 W-plus product. The latest sales data also reflects the growing popularity of 210mm products. To third quarter 2022, nearly 76 GW of 210 mm modules have been shipped worldwide, among which Trina Solar has shipped a cumulative total of 40 GW.
The 210+N series includes different products. For which applications are these panels intended?
Currently, Trina’s main n-type products are the new generation of Vertex N 605 W, Vertex N 695 W, and Vertex S+ 445 W. The Vertex N 605 W module is suitable for utility-scale power plants and some C&I distributed PV, adhering to the advantages of the Vertex family, with high power, high efficiency, high power generation and high reliability, etc. The highest power output reaches 605 W, compared with the competitive n-type modules on the market, the power is increased by up to 30 W, and the module efficiency reaches 22.4%. Based on 210mm rectangular silicon wafer (210R) cell technology, with extreme shape design and low voltage advantage, n-type 605 W module perfectly utilizes the tracking bracket length of 104 meters. Compared with the industry's general n-type 72- and 78-cell modules, it can string 6-12 more modules on each string, without wasting any length. It is the “best partner” of tracking bracket. This can help to reduce the cost of BOS.
Vertex N 695 W module is with significantly higher power, 70 W higher than similar general n-type competitors on the market. The efficiency is also increased to 22.4%, and perfectly suitable for various utility-scale power plants. Ultra-low attenuation for the whole life cycle of power generation escort, optimized bifacial power generation performance to bring higher bifacial income, ultra-low operating temperature coefficient makes power generation more secure, coupled with the innovative low voltage, high power design to achieve higher string power, reduce the cost of electricity to a new lower level.
Vertex S+ is for rooftops and some C&I scenarios, specially designed for European and Asian households based on EU and Asian regulations. With size of less than 1.8 meters, weight of less than 22 kg, this 1.6 mm+1.6 mm double glass module is accessible for individual to move alone.
Does Trina Solar have an efficiency roadmap for the 210+N series?
Trina Solar started the research of n-type solar cell since 2015. We built a pilot line of 500 MW in 2018 with promotion of the PV Top-Runner Program. In 2022, our total 8 GW n-type capacity has a mass production efficiency of around 25%, hopefully the efficiency will climb to 25.5% in 2023 and 26% in 2024 with an average annual increase of 0.4-0.5%.
Does Trina Solar plan to build up capacities for this module series?
In H2 of 2022, Trina Solar started mass production of new generation 210+N module products, and by the Q1 of 2023, Trina Solar will have a total of over 10 GW of n-type module capacity which is expected to grow to 30 GW by the end of 2023.
Trina Solar has set up a new production facility of 210+N in the Integration PV Industrial Park located in Xining, Qinghai province. The new production base is expected to have annual capacities of 300,000 tons of silicon metal, 150,000 tons of high-purity polysilicon, 35 GW of ingot casting, 10 GW of wafers, 10 GW of solar cells, 10 GW of PV modules and 15GW of supporting module auxiliary materials. We planned to complete all construction and commission all the capacities by the end of 2025. The company is also investing in the construction of 15 GW of solar cell and 15 GW of PV modules per year in Huai'an, Jiangsu Province. We provide full guarantee of the supply of n-type production capacity and optimize the overall layout of the upstream and downstream of the n-type industry chain.
I think the production capacity will increase quickly along with the quick acceptance of 210+N by the market. Besides, vertical integration will eliminate the shortcomings of the p-type era of unexpected bottlenecks.
How will Trina Solar's shift to n-Type technology affect the industry and the market?
The concept of 600W+ has become a global consensus. By the end of 2022, there was total 90 GW module capacity achieved for 210 mm based products, and the penetration grew to 10% and is now heading for a 30% market share. We believe the 210 and 600W+ are collaborating a new ecosystem of the industry value chain.
The concept of 210+N is somehow an extension of 600W+, which will become the trend of the whole solar PV industry. As you know, not only TOPCon, but also HJT and IBC can be based on 210mm product technology platform.
What is your view on future technology development? Will TOPCon compete with heterojunction?
I think the 210+X is the direction. There are more cell technologies rather than n. 210+N solves the ecological problems we faced before including glass, junction box, frame, bracket, and etc., and greatly reduces the duplication investment in the industry.
Those in line with the four high and one low (higher power, higher efficiency, higher power generation, higher reliability, and lower LCOE) will become mainstream.

C2F, a French composite aluminum facade supplier, unveiled a PV facade at the recent BePositive trade show in Lyon, France. Its Ultracade solution can be integrated with the solar panels of any manufacturer, up to 1.98 meters in length.
“In the end, as our solution is entirely modular, the only limit is the imagination,” C2F CEO Jean-Charles Battut told pv magazine France.
The facade's metallic aluminum cladding can be directly affixed to new or existing buildings. The company says the facade limits the impact of hot and cold in weather, improving the energy coefficient by approximately 30%. C2F claims that the natural ventilation behind the solar panels reduces the temperature on the rear side.
“We are in the process of completing the installation of our first project, on the facade of a company active in the rental of construction equipment in Clermont-Ferrand,” said Battut. “BIPV solutions are also a vector of communication for companies.”
C2F works with PV panel manufacturer Soluxtech, which has specially developed a module for Ultraçade. It also offers two plug-and-play panels for residential use.

Every country has its energy guru and France is no exception. Jean-Marc Jancovici – through books, conferences, and now a comic – is the definitive voice of his nation’s nuclear industry.
I have always enjoyed listening to Jancovici’s keynote speeches. He has a remarkable talent for storytelling. He can explain the most complex physical concepts and even make them funny. Where we differ is on the relevance of renewable energy for reducing carbon emissions, and the primacy of nuclear energy over all other power sources.
As we are of the same generation, I know the emergence of nuclear technology in the 1970s sparked fascination for many young talents with a passion for science. If I had not been born into a family of electronic engineers – pioneers of telematics – I too could have chosen to join “those who want to control the atom.”

It was at that time that France instituted a major industrial turnaround that would see the construction of 58 nuclear reactors in 29 years – four presidential terms.
With 70% of the French electricity mix comprised of nuclear power plants, my country is today a singularity in the energy landscape of sovereign states, to say the least. Nowhere else in the world does nuclear make up more than 20% of the power mix.
French exceptionalism is a speciality anchored in our national DNA. But it turns out, as Jancovici has stressed repeatedly, physics are also quite stubborn. We are talking about an energy source that is by nature predestined to produce the baseload of daily electricity demand, and one does not need to be a brilliant engineer to understand that speaking of a “baseload,” when nuclear is close to 70%, is perhaps going a bit too far.
Nuclear fleets are generally regarded as non-dispatchable, even though some reactors can perform load-following operation. Our literature shows such adjustments of energy output are always devoted to specific reactors, never the full French fleet, even in cases of extreme excess-energy waste. As this is a recurrent topic on social networks, though, I would be interested in a fuller explanation of the dispatchability or otherwise of nuclear. Grid flexibility instead typically focuses on “peaker” energy sources, mainly thermal and hydroelectric power plants.
As a result, France has found itself with an electricity surplus since the late 1980s that it has had to learn to absorb. Our country has incredible talents, however, and we developed energy storage – as much as it is possible to “store” electricity – by increasing the capacity of our hydro pumping stations by 84% through the invention of “off-peak hours” to direct consumer demand, and by deploying more than 11 million heaters to store night-time surpluses in the form of domestic hot water.
Those who advocate nuclear power as the sole electricity source likely to offer our planet a carbon-free energy mix are doubly mistaken, because the technology does not meet the challenges of magnitude or speed of deployment. The power of the atom is only suitable for a very limited number of countries for technological, infrastructural, and safety reasons. Moreover, the speed of nuclear power plant construction is not compatible with the timeframe imposed by our climate crisis.
Even if it surpasses all other energy sources in terms of the density of its production units – a nuclear power plant can accommodate more than 5 GW of power generation capacity per square kilometer – the complexity of each reactor project makes them increasingly long to develop and build. That requires thinking on a scale of 20 to 30 years, as opposed to just a few years for renewable energy projects. The speed of reactor construction is particularly slow compared to photovoltaic energy sites, whose installation period is ultimately a reflection of the level of permitting complexity desired by legislators.
Added to those two failings is a fear of nuclear energy that has always animated some people, and which has been amplified following the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents. Such concerns are reflected by the development curve of global nuclear power generation. Even at the height of its accelerated deployment, the world never saw more than 17% of nuclear generation capacity added than had already been installed, and nuclear came close to that rollout rate for only five years – thanks to French enthusiasm in the 1980s. Today, nuclear generation capacity has reached a ceiling of 2.8 PWh per year, whereas wind and solar energy sites, notwithstanding their intermittency, have been growing continuously at a rate of more than 17% per year since 2010 and surpassed nuclear in 2019, to jointly produce more than 4 PWh today.
China, a country with a robust energy infrastructure which includes a substantial nuclear fleet, has understood this well. Starting from a blank slate for nuclear, wind, and solar, it began implementation of the former in the 1990s, then wind power in the early 2000s, followed by solar power around five years later. The production curve for wind power doubled that of nuclear from 2010 onwards and solar caught up at the end of last year. China is on its way to becoming the dominant industrial player for these three sources of electricity.

When the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases makes a commitment to the United Nations, through the voice of its leader, to reach peak CO2 emissions before 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, it does so based on sound planning that favors the combined effect of two renewable energy sources – wind and solar – rather than relying solely on nuclear.
This ambition should alert the world to the strategic value of solar and wind energy and the commercial potential they already represent on a global basis. Countries all over the world are adopting these energy sources on a massive scale, including through ambitious industrial reinvestment programs.
The French parliament has just approved a heavily revised version of a new bill related to acceleration of the production of renewable energy. The bill is a text that adds more constraints than it takes away from one of the most complex legislative systems in Europe and which, until now, has failed to out-perform any of its neighbors in rolling out clean power. The concerns expressed by both senators and MPs, and transcribed into as many additional conditions as possible, are being interpreted by the renewables industry as “no,” “go elsewhere,” and “not here.”

The country which displays the strongest ambition regarding renewables will be considered the most attractive by manufacturers of clean power technology and investors in such businesses. The existence of a domestic market is a prerequisite for any entrepreneurial clean power initiative.
What place will France claim for the technology that may be the key to tomorrow’s energy model? Will legislators enable the emergence of a French, or European, offer that will embrace youth, research, and the industry for the next two decades?
Focusing exclusively on a single electricity source is a risk because, whatever France decides, the 21st century will be the age of renewable energy. By fine-tuning the law by issuing the necessary decree, the industry must solemnly appeal to the French government and energy minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher: “Be bold.”

The study is to be led by VDMA, along with PV factory experts RCT Solutions and research institute ISC Konstanz. They are calling on other industry stakeholders in Germany and Europe to participate in the study, which they plan to kick off with an extensive workshop to be held during the Intersolar Europe exhibition and conference in Munich in June.
“Germany is in a position to set up large-scale, fully integrated production immediately. Even if this requires investments in the billions,” says Wolfgang Jooss, CTO of RCT Solutions. “Currently, over 90% of solar components are manufactured in Asia. But we have shown with large-scale projects in Turkey and India that, given the right framework conditions, the industry with the entire value chain can emerge anew.”
Europe and Germany, in particular, were among the regions hardest hit by the need to quickly reduce reliance on gas supplied by Russia. The European Union has reacted to with plans to bring some manufacturing of clean energy technologies back to the region, but these actions have been criticized by many as too little. With ambitious PV manufacturing plans moving ahead in other regions – the United States and India, in particular – critics say that Europe risks being left behind.
The German study aims to analyze the entire PV supply chain and work out the fastest ways to establish an entire ecosystem, including supply chain materials, manufacturing, research and development and qualified personnel. Producing competitive, high performance products, and establishing CO2 neutral operations will also be priorities.
The current issue of pv magazine focuses on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
The study’s leaders note that Germany was formerly a market leader in solar manufacturing, and its universities and research institutes maintain a strong position in the research and development side of the industry, which should leave it well placed to once again establish itself in manufacturing these technologies at scale.
“All important innovations in the modern crystalline silicon solar energy come from Germany,” says Radovan Kopecek, head of research at ISC Konstanz. “The research institutions here are working on the technologies of today and tomorrow. It is the dream of all of us to have large factories here again where these developments are used and further developed.”

It reduces the 2030 renewable energy target from 30.2% to just 21.6%.
Last week, a group of 9 Korean citizens filed to revoke the plan at the Seoul Administrative Court.
“The government said that the target reduction was in consideration of the public acceptance and feasibility related to renewable energy deployment,” Yebin Yang, a researcher at Seoul-based NGO Solutions for Our Climate, told pv magazine.
Yang said the change will act as a signal to the market and will affect the entire renewable energy market.
“With government goals and policies drastically changing from one administration to the next, the unpredictability will unsettle investors who would shy away from actively investing in clean energy businesses and projects in the weakening renewable energy industrial ecosystem,” she added. “Moreover, this makes it difficult for changes favorable to renewables to take place.”
Kim said the South Korean government plans to scale back its feed-in tariff policy and reduce the amount of renewable energy certificates (RECs) issued under the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) scheme for 2023 and onwards.
“The size for the solar PV bid under South Korea’s Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) scheme has been set to 1,000 MW – a 50% decrease compared to the same period last year, when 2,000 MW for each procurement exercise was allocated,” Yang said. “It looks like the renewable curtailment problem will only get worse as the latest plan proposes building new LNG plant facilities while lacking the roadmap that would resolve the renewable energy curtailment issue.” 
The South Korean Energy Agency held two 4 GW of PV tenders last year. In the two tenders held in 2021, it allocated capacity in 2 GW and 2.2 GW rounds, and contracted 1.2 GW and 1.4 GW in 2020. South Korea's new electricity plan has increased the 2030 target for nuclear power from 23.9% to 32.8% and the target for liquefied natural gas (LNG) from 19.5% to 20.9%.

RWTH Aachen University has reported that Germany deployed around 220,000 new residential batteries with a combined capacity of 1.2 GW/1.9 GWh last year, up 52% from the preceding year. The country's cumulative annual residential battery capacity reached 5.5 GWh at the end of 2022.
The researchers also revealed that the commercial and industrial (C&I) battery market grew by 24%, adding 0.4 GW/0.8 GWh of cumulative installed capacity last year.
In 2022, 47 utility-scale storage facilities with a capacity of 0.43 GW/0.47 GWh were installed in Germany, which corresponds to 910% year-on-year growth. The researchers said that Germany's total installed storage capacity hit 7 GWh across all segments.
RWTH Aachen also compared battery prices and noted an increase for the first time ever in 2022.
For residential devices, they estimate average costs at €1200 ($1,297)/kWh, which was 30% higher than in 2021. For commercial storage, the researchers gave a range of €580/kWh to €710/kWh. Depending on the size, this is an increase of 23% to 92%, they said.
Prices for large-scale storage batteries, meanwhile, ranged between €310/kWh and €465/kWh, which is between 42% and 54% higher than in 2021. Global prices for battery packs increased by 7% last year, according to the report.

The total output of rooftop solar in Australia over the summer was 8,046 GWh, up 19.5% on the preceding year, according to the Clean Energy Council.
The Clean Energy Council says that an increase of 15% to 20% in Australian electricity bills in 2022 underpinned strong demand for rooftop solar. Rising power prices also made rooftop solar’s payback times even more attractive.
“We’re seeing a fundamental shift; consumers are becoming energy generators,” said Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton, noting that these figures only measure what enters the grid.
At the state level, rooftop solar generation in New South Wales jumped 35% from the preceding summer. Tasmania also saw a massive uptick, clocking a 31.7% jump from the previous year.
Home battery installations are also growing in Australia, with 7% of new solar systems now including batteries. In total, 2.8 GW of rooftop solar was installed in 2022.

The Norwegian Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) supported the company in measuring the performance of the array, which is located in Vestby, near Oslo.
“Overall yearly specific yield is up to 30% higher than for conventional flat roof solutions,” CEO Trygve Mongstad told pv magazine.
In 2022, the vertical PV system generated 1,070 kWh per kilowatt installed. Mongstad says this compares to around 800 kWh per kilowatt installed for a conventional rooftop array installed in the same location.
“Two other 5 kW installations with HJT cells have also been in operation since February and May 2022 in Oslo, Norway, and have showed over 30% higher energy yield in the periods compared to conventional 10-degree tilted flat roof solar installations,” Mongstad added. “Snow is normally not a problem for the energy production, the panels are sticking up on the rooftops even with 1 m snow on the ground.”
The company currently uses PERC cells with a bifaciality of 77% to 81% or HJT cells with bifaciality of 90% in its demonstrators.
“The ground cover ratio of the installations is about 50%,” Mongstad explained. “The solar panels are about 20 cm tall and the pitch between the rows is 40 cm. The installations were placed on generic dark or lighter gray bitumen roofing membranes.”
The units include a mounting system and solar panels in a single pre-assembled package, which the manufacturer said makes them easily mountable. Every unit measures 1,600 mm x 1,510 mm x 350 mm and weighs 24.5 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure rating and 3.2 mm double-tempered glass.
Over Easy said it plans to work with production partners in China and Spain and aims to begin producing the solar modules in the fall. Currently, it uses solar cells provided by undisclosed Asian manufacturers.
“We are doing assembly at locations in Norway and Spain, and the units for our pilot installations so far are 100% manufactured in Europe, including the solar panels,” Mongstad told pv magazine in May.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/28/more-than-500-mwh-of-standalone-storage-capacity-starts-in-texas/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 28, 2023",More than 500 MWh of standalone storage capacity starts in Texas,"From pv magazine USA
Eolian LP, a portfolio company of Global Infrastructure Partners, has finished building what will purportedly be the largest merchant energy storage facility in the world. The Madero and Ignacio energy storage plants have a combined power capacity of 200 MW. The grid storage projects will participate in the retail energy power market in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid.
Each phase of the combined storage project is greater than 250 MWh, and the combined facilities have two-hour discharge, putting the system at well over 500 MWh, a Wärtsilä Energy spokesperson told pv magazine USA. However, the spokesperson declined to provide a specific value for the total discharge of the combined system.
Eolian first contracted with battery systems supplier Wärtsilä Energy in February 2021 to procure batteries for the large merchant power system, with construction of the project taking approximately 26 months to complete, according to the supplier. The Madero and Ignacio facilities’ multi-hour continuous dispatch capability provides the longest duration of any energy storage assets operating under ERCOT, and as a combined site, the project is the world’s largest (by MWh) fully merchant, market-facing energy storage facility in the world, the supplier said.
The Texas project is the first US storage installation to make use of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for standalone utility-scale energy storage systems, which was introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The grid storage facility reacts instantaneously to sustain electricity output and keep the lights on when power generation fails or cannot respond quickly enough to rapidly changing conditions.
“Texas needs more flexible capacity solutions like energy storage for grid support and energy resource optimization,” said Risto Paldanius, vice president Americas for Wärtsilä Energy. “This will help the state as it faces the natural replacement cycle of older inflexible generators and adapts to more frequent extreme weather events.”
The Maderos and Ignacio projects use Wärtsilä’s smart energy management system, the GEMS Digital Energy Platform, to monitor and control the flow of energy, while providing grid support during periods of grid instability. The facilities will also deliver ancillary services required for grid stability, such as frequency response and regulation in the ERCOT grid.
According to Wood Mackenzie’s Q1 2023 energy storage market review, Texas and California represented 94% of the 1.07 GW (3.03 GWh) of energy storage projects brought online in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the two states continue to show the dominance of solar plus storage across the two markets.  The fourth-quarter installation rate was a 41% decline year over year from the fourth quarter of 2021, as the US energy storage market continues to be hamstrung by project delays related to supply chain disruption.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts 79 GW or 253.2 GWh of energy storage projects to be added through 2027, a revised estimate from what was reported in pv magazine USA’s 2023 energy storage outlook from early this year, in which the research firm forecast 65 GW of added capacity storage.
