In a review process initiated by Hanwha Solutions, the parent of Hanwha Q Cells, the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board declared on Dec. 9 that all contested claims of REC Solar's US patent No. 10,749,060 (Patent 060) are not patentable. It determined that the challenged REC Solar patent claims are directed to a well-known arrangement of solar components within a solar module, and fail to satisfy the requirements of patentability.
REC challenged Hanwha Solutions in a patent infringement lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware in 2020. The court’s judges suspended the dispute for the duration of the inter partes review procedure. In early January, the deadline was extended again.
Q Cells said in a statement that the US decision follows similar rulings in relation to REC Solar's global patents. Last year, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court and European Patent Office issued favorable rulings for Hanwha Solutions over a Chinese patent, 201480038577.X, and a European patent, EP3017520. The two patents are related to REC Solar’s 060 patent. However, REC Solar declined to comment when contacted by pv magazine.
In March 2019, Hanwha Q Cells filed patent infringement complaints in Germany against Jinko Solar and REC Group, and followed this with a similar lawsuit against Longi Solar. The complaints claimed that the companies had unlawfully included Q Cells’ patented passivation technology in their own products. In June 2020, the Düsseldorf regional court determined that the three defendants had infringed upon the German part of the patent. The appeal process is still ongoing.
Hanwha Q Cells has also filed patent-related complaints in France, the Netherlands, and the United States. The US Court of Appeals has determined that the complaint over the disputed patent was invalid. The European Patent Office, meanwhile, confirmed the validity of the passivation tech patent in June 2020, with only minor changes.

Angola was the biggest installer, commissioning two large-scale projects and a total of 284 MW to push usual leaders South Africa and Egypt into second and third place respectively.
AFSIA found plenty more evidence that PV in Africa is growing beyond the two countries that have typically represented the bulk of installations on the continent. The association’s Annual Report 2022, published this week, notes that every single country on the continent has plans to build some new solar in the short term, and that 29 countries are working on at least 100 MW of new installations.
While these numbers are small compared to other regions with comparable size and population, AFSIA finds plenty to be positive about in terms of solar industry development.
“One must recognize that Africa is still very much underperforming. Africa now hosts less than 1% of the global solar capacity installed and installed less than 0.5% of the 2022 global new capacity installed,” the authors state. “Yet, Africa offers lots of opportunities when it comes to solar.”
The reports set out the commercial and industrial segment as the first big opportunity for solar in Africa. It notes that, unlike some other regions where C&I solar is only about securing cheaper electricity, companies in Africa are often further motivated by the possibility of a secure electricity supply. Across Africa, the C&I market grew by more than 60% in 2022 and represented 28% of all installations. And South Africa will likely remain a leader here.
“If we zoom in on South Africa, we notice that 22.2% of all projects currently announced are already related to C&I (including wheeling projects),” the authors state. “This should not come as a surprise though when taking into account the need for companies for take their power supply into their own hands given the failure of ESKOM and the simplified procedure to supply up to 100 MW of capacity for own consumption.”
Green hydrogen projects are also expected to drive big demand for new PV: AFSIA finds 52 GW of new PV in development for projects exclusively using the power to produce hydrogen. And while it warns this number – more than five times the whole continent’s current PV installations – should probably be taken with a pinch of salt, Africa may be able to keep up with other regions in developing a green hydrogen industry.
“The combination of attractive economics of green hydrogen in Africa and developed economies pushing for these projects to be developed so they can import cheap green hydrogen for their own consumption back home, push us to believe that green hydrogen in Africa is based on solid fundamentals,” says AFSIA.
The final trend AFSIA expects to drive new solar installations is a growing trend for electric vehicles. Motorbikes and other small vehicles represent the biggest share of mobility across much of the continent, and drivers of these can realize much lower fuel costs by switching to electric models. According to AFSIA, many countries will need to double or even triple their electricity generation capacity to keep up with this trend, and solar will often be the cleanest and most economic way to achieve this.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/19/rethinking-soiling/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SOILING,WORLD",,"JANUARY 19, 2023",Rethinking soiling,"From pv magazine 01/23
Soiling loss – the reduction in irradiance absorbed by a solar module due to the accumulation of particulate matter on its surface – is an important variable to characterize and monitor at utility scale PV plants. Surface contamination disrupts the optical processes dictating the fate of photons, meaning more solar energy is directed away from the module due to enhanced scattering at this interface.
Quantifying the overall impact of soiling comes with its own challenges, which are due in large part to the extreme variability in both the optical effects of deposited materials and the susceptibility of a site to adverse accumulation of dust and other particles. The magnitude of soiling loss for a given project depends on several parameters including those associated with geographic location, the physical properties of deposited-material, and the aggregated effects of local environmental processes that vary temporally and spatially.
Such variance makes it difficult for project developers and owners to define optimal mitigation strategies across their portfolios, which means asset owners are vulnerable to both cost inefficiency and reduced performance. Additionally, inadequately quantifying the impact of soiling increases performance uncertainty and financial risk. However, thanks to a variety of promising technical solutions now available, there appears to be progress towards a deeper and more evolved understanding of soiling-loss estimation. This knowledge will play a critical role in defining industry best practice when it comes to successful management.
There are, currently, two dominant technical approaches to measuring soiling loss. The first method, represented by the IEC 61724 technical standard, includes methodologies used to directly measure current or power losses of both a clean reference module and a soiled product.
Learned experience from implementing this method has concluded that severe over- and under-estimation of true power loss can occur in scenarios involving non-uniform soiling when only the current metric is compared. Further conventional wisdom recommends using representative panel geometry and positioning as well as self-cleaning references, to reduce costs when possible. This approach has demonstrated high accuracy but is expensive and limited in that it requires an assumption of soiling loss uniformity across a site.
The other prevailing approach is the use of sensors to exploit the observable optical effects of deposited materials on the surface of a module. These devices are designed to operate autonomously to measure energy transmitted through, or reflected from, a soiled glass surface.
Equipped with these observations, it is possible to fully account for all terms in the equation that represents the partitioning of incident solar irradiance, and soiling loss can be inferred. What is problematic however, is that the relationship between transmitted energy at a single wavelength and the precise associated PV soiling loss is not fixed. This methodology, therefore, neglects two important realities: the first is that the deposited material which causes soiling has several physical properties that have a wavelength-dependent effect on incident irradiance; and the second being that each module design has a unique spectral response curve which describes how the material converts energy at different wavelengths.
Looking ahead, ongoing investigation and development initiatives are likely to advance the utility of current methodologies and generate new solutions aimed at further reducing the inefficiency and uncertainty related to soiling loss.
Perhaps most notable of the possible approaches, is the opportunity to enhance the capacity for empirical models linking more readily observable or more informative features of soiled-module measurements to a corresponding reduction in performance. For example, to overcome the inadequacies of single wavelength transmittance measurements, it might be possible to leverage observations at a combination of wavelengths to model the expected soiling loss.
It is also possible to augment soiling-loss measurement data with models that forecast and predict the relationship between environmental conditions and soiling-related diminished PV performance. Variables such as soil component particle size, aerosol optical depth, precipitation statistics, and relative humidity can be used to understand a location’s future potential for soiling and to estimate soiling impact from an aggregation of variables plus direct observations of electrical losses and transmittance. This approach reduces the dependence on single point observation accuracy and allows for a contextualization of data for holistic predictive modeling.
Finally, if the relationships between optical features and PV losses continue to be empirically proven and refined, the use of aerial imagery for estimating soiling could become more prevalent. Platforms for collecting and processing this type of data can be an effective tool for estimating transmittance by way of surface reflectance approximations represented by pixel brightness, to complement and scale, in-situ, observations, so that more complete estimates of project wide soiling loss are obtainable.
As solar energy development continues to grow across the globe, the need to optimize soiling measurements is paramount. By investigating these methodologies thoroughly and by leveraging data, it will be possible to refine recommendations to pave the way for more efficient and successful solar energy development.

With India’s reliance on imported crude oil, opportunities exist to plan for and grow the use of green hydrogen as a zero-emissions fuel source for the country’s transport sector, including commercial fleets and aviation.
“The commercial credibility of hydrogen development is absolutely key, particularly around securing viable off-takers for the product. There are a few emerging business models that are being studied and developed more closely in India, for domestic consumption and export,” said Ruturaj Govilkar, country manager and managing director, India, Black & Veatch. “This includes the use of hydrogen for transport fleets, the use of hydrogen derivatives as aviation fuel, and the production of green ammonia.”
Black & Veatch is involved in building 245 MW of electrolysis capacity. The company is building the world’s largest hydrogen hub in the United States.
India serves as an integral part of Black & Veatch’s innovation network exploring and providing hydrogen and other emerging sustainable solutions for clients globally. Countries throughout the world continue to announce new decarbonization and hydrogen strategies, and India recently approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an initial outlay of INR 19,744 ($2.3 billion). The mission aims to make India a global hub for the production, utilization, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives.
Speaking at the Hydrogen India Summit 2023, Govilkar proposed that, together, electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicles powered by hydrogen – in particular, commercial fleets – are an alternate form of transportation that may eventually be more cost-effective that their fossil fuel-powered counterparts, given the rising cost of fossil fuels.
Other promising commercial models include the production of green ammonia for export, whereby importing countries could substitute ammonia directly for natural gas and use it for critical applications like power generation, or the use of ammonia as a fuel for shipping. A significant advantage is that outside the electrolysis process to produce green hydrogen, the production of ammonia is a well-established technology.
Similar to the ammonia synthesis loop, Black & Veatch notes that the basic method for producing synthetic fuel for aviation or other uses is proven, and pending wider usage. The Green Solutions (TGS) has appointed Black & Veatch to study the production and storage of green hydrogen in Vietnam using solar or wind power supplied through the grid.

Green Energy Systems, a subsidiary of Sydney-based building systems company New Building Systems Pty Ltd., has unveiled its prefabricated modular Solar Waves solution, a PV array in which panels come preassembled on an all-aluminum framing system.
Green Energy Systems Chief Executive Officer Glenn Carless said the design of the Solar Waves system “is revolutionary in that we have increased the strength, achieved a number of new outcomes has dramatically lowered the cost, by simplifying the framework to be a sliding assembly … Our mission was to produce an entirely new system to deploy solar PV. We had two aims: devise a method to get rid of most of the labor out of the system because that is expensive; and to reduce the system down to its bare bones as far as traditional methods of construction and deployment. And that included removing nuts, bolts, screws, rivets, clamps … all of that stuff is gone.”
Carless said the Solar Waves system has been designed to eliminate as much manpower from both the project site and factory as possible with the company having also engineered machinery that allows for the full automation of the in-factory assembly process.
“That’s where we have been able to make some very big inroads in the way of costs,” he said. “We have invented and patented what we believe to be the strongest and cheapest solar deployment system in the world. The complication is all gone. It’s very, very simple.”
The solution is reminiscent of the Maverick technology offered by fellow Sydney company 5B, but Carless said there are significant differences. Solar Waves uses no concrete pre-cast footings and, without changing the assembly, it can be ground mounted, floated on bodies of still water or installed as a waterproof roofing system over car parks or agrisolar applications.

“There has been a strong level of interest expressed in this key project so far, and we look forward to seeing proposals from pre-qualified companies and moving to the next stage of development,” said EWEC CEO Othman Al Ali.
The Emirates’ News Agency reported that 43 companies and groups submitted expressions of interest in May, with 19 companies qualifying for the current tender phase. The project will involve the development, financing, construction, operation, maintenance, and ownership of the plant, as well as associated infrastructure.
EWEC said the installation will be “fundamentally important” to Abu Dhabi’s energy transition. Following the start of commercial operations, the Al-Ajban solar park is expected to slash Abu Dhabi’s carbon emissions by more than 2.4 million metric tons per year, according to EWEC.
The latest edition of pv magazine considers how industry heavyweights are increasingly planning gigawatt-scale assets, looks at the huge potential repowering could unlock for German solar, and examines how solar can help trucking companies in the energy transition. A packed edition also features a focus on the Middle East.
The utility said it will sign a long-term power purchase agreement with the selected developer. The PPA will be structured as an energy purchase agreement, under which EWEC will only pay for the net electrical energy supplied by the solar plant. It did not reveal a deadline for proposals on its channels.

In  “Not All Light Spectra Were Created Equal: Can We Harvest Light for Optimum Food-Energy Co-Generation?,” recently published in Earth’s Future, they claim that their discovery could lead to efficiency improvements for agrivoltaic systems.
“Today’s solar panels take all the light and try to make the best of it,” said Matteo Camporese, one of the paper’s authors. “But what if a new generation of photovoltaics could take the blue light for clean energy and pass the red light onto the crops, where it is most efficient for photosynthesis?”
The scientists developed a photosynthesis and transpiration model to account for different light spectra. The model reproduced the response of various plants, including lettuce, basil, and strawberries, to different light spectra in controlled lab conditions.
The results suggest that the blue part of the light spectrum carries more potential energy, while also being “the less efficient in terms of carbon assimilation and water use and could be effectively filtered out to produce solar energy,” the academics said. On the other hand, the red spectrum could efficiently produce biomass and increase crop yield.
The academics believe their model could be used to inform future development of wavelength-selective semi-transparent solar modules.
“Organic PV … provide unique opportunities to ‘harvest' some parts of the incoming light spectrum to generate energy and letting through mostly the parts of the spectrum that are more useful for the plants,” the researchers said. “To fully reach this potential, accurate plant models are needed that explicitly consider light … spectra to compute the crop productivity.”
The study suggests that wavelength-selective agrivoltaic systems might be sensitive to environmental factors and crop type. The authors recommended using such systems in water-limited areas, rather than in areas with limited solar irradiation. They also noted that certain crops, like strawberries, are less sensitive to light treatments using different light spectra.
“Therefore, this model could be used to preliminarily assess the suitability of different plant species for use in agrivoltaics,” they concluded.

TSE inaugurated its first agrivoltaic demonstrator on field crops in France last year. The experimental project is equipped with its “agricultural canopy,” which is a large canopy equipped with rotating solar panels fixed on cables 5 meters above the fields.
The field crop farm grows soya, wheat, fodder rye, winter barley, and rapeseed, in addition to housing 150 cows. It has has faced very hot and very dry summers for the past 10 years. TSE installed the PV system to benefit from its shade, as well as the drop in evapotranspiration and temperature during the summer. The agrivoltaic system produces 3.2 GWh of electricity per year.
The French developer has now presented the project’s first results. Soybeans were sown in early June 2022 on an area spanning 3 hectares. The site was covered by the PV canopy. For the first trial, six different varieties of soybeans were planted, with harvesting on Oct. 12, 2022.
The teams observed solid vegetative growth of the soybeans, with normal flowering, fertilization, and physiological maturation. The six varieties tested presented a diversity of yields: up to 25% difference in yield under the canopy and 19% on the control field.
“Despite a strong heterogeneity of the environment and in particular of the soil, the data obtained, in particular for the Soprana variety, announce extremely promising results for future harvests: no significant difference for the overall yield and the number of pods of the soybeans outside and under the canopy, with higher 1000 kernel weight under the canopy,” said TSE.
Regarding temperatures, the agrivoltaic canopy provided better protection against thermal stress during heat stroke: the maximum temperature observed under the canopy is 1.2 C lower than the control area. The ground under the PV system remained cooler and retained the humidity better: on average, the readings indicate -3.5 C at a depth of 30 cm in the center of the system from June to mid-August.
In addition, the water potential was found to be higher under the canopy. At the time of flowering and the start of grain filling, the soybeans in the control zone were under water stress, unlike the soybeans under the PV canopy.
“Following this episode, I could see damage on the control area, whereas the soybean planted under the panels was better protected,” said farmer Sylvain Raison.

Pexapark has reported a sharp decline in European PPA activity for December. Prices fell an average of 15% month on month, mainly due to declining prices of electricity futures, which are contracts for future physical delivery of power to the grid, according to the Zurich-based renewable energy consultancy.
The prices of Dutch TTF gas futures fell throughout December. The one-year TTF gas reference contract fell 28.4% to close at €76.0 ($82.30)/MWh, compared to the maximum price closing price of €193.80/MWh in August.
Lower heating needs due to mild temperatures across Europe and healthy gas reserves have reassured buyers and sellers, leading to less aggressive pricing for future PPA contracts, according to Pexapark. However, despite the rosy outlook, analysts say that it is too early to rejoice and declare a possible end to the energy crisis, as gas supply prospects for 2023 remain fundamentally different from a year ago.
The Netherlands and Italy were the markets that experienced the most pronounced price decline, with -32.1% and -23.8%, respectively. The Iberian Peninsula registered the lowest prices, with €48.40/MWh and €48.70/MWh in Portugal and Spain, respectively. The United Kingdom registered the highest price once again at €113/MWh, followed by France at €93.80/MWh. Prices in Germany fell 7.9% to €92.40/MWh.
For PPA agreements in December, activity remained relatively stable in terms of the number of closed deals. However, Pexapark recorded a sharp decrease of 81% in terms of contracted volumes.
Now that there is more clarity on how the EU's revenue cap on renewables will be implemented, PPA activity is expected to increase in the coming weeks.

Nextracker, a specialist in solar trackers, has filed a registration statement with the SEC related to a proposed IPO. The company said in its filing fee schedule that it expects to raise $100 million. Nextracker plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol NXT.
J.P. Morgan, BofA Securities, Citigroup, and Barclays are acting as joint lead book-running managers for the proposed offering. Truist Securities, HSBC, BNP Paribas, Mizuho, Scotiabank, and KeyBanc Capital Markets are acting as joint book-running managers.
Nextracker was acquired in 2015 by Flex for $330 million. It has since become a leader in the US solar tracker market, with its integrated solar tracker and software solutions used in utility-scale and distributed generation solar power plants around the world. The company is known for its innovative technology as well as its dedication to made-in-America products.
In June 2022, the company announced the opening of its third dedicated steel production line in the United States. Other steel line locations include Phoenix, Arizona and Corpus Christi, Texas. Nextracker President Howard Wenger told pv magazine that each of these locations was chosen “to help Nextracker better serve some of its strategic growth and development markets across the US.”
