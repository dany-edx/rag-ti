While there have been plenty of encouraging developments, many countries still have a long way to go.
And for renewable energy specifically, the situation is similar – in many parts of Africa small rooftop PV systems have proved vital in plugging the energy gap for underserved communities, and development funding has flooded the renewables sector, enabling many projects to go ahead in regions that might otherwise struggle to find investment.
At the same time though, recent analysis of energy developments in Africa points to national utilities wary of renewables as a threat to their business model, inaction on the part of governments, and a lack of financing options as factors holding back the development of renewable energy. These trends are borne out in new research from Oxford University in the UK which looks at planned, completed and abandoned electricity projects in 54 African countries, to try and paint a picture of the continent’s future electricity mix.
The study, A machine-learning approach to predicting Africa’s electricity mix based on planned power plants and their chances of success, published in Nature Energy, forecasts that electricity generation capacity across Africa will double by 2030, with 269 GW set to come online. More than half of this new capacity is expected be fossil fuel powered, with non-hydro renewables representing 17.4% of new projects and just 9.6% of generation.
“Africa’s electricity demand is set to increase significantly as the continent strives to industrialize and improve the wellbeing of its people, which offers an opportunity to power this economic development through renewables’ says Galina Alova, study lead author and researcher at the Oxford Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. “There is a prominent narrative in the energy planning community that the continent will be able to take advantage of its vast renewable energy resources and rapidly decreasing clean technology prices to leapfrog to renewables by 2030 – but our analysis shows that overall it is not currently positioned to do so.”
Despite the continuing trend towards fossil fuels, Alova’s analysis finds that the prospects for solar projects in Africa have improved significantly in recent years, with more projects successfully developed. “Our results suggest steep learning curves for recent solar projects as both the number of planned plants and their commissioning success have sharply increased,” the paper states. Across Africa 49 GW of new solar is expected by 2030, with almost 40% of this to be located in South Africa. The country will reduce the share of coal in its energy from 75% to 49%, with solar growing from 4% to 24%.
The report expects an overall reduction in the dominance of fossil fuels across Africa from 80% today to around 60% by 2030, though noting that the hydro projects comprise much of planned new capacity, and these already have the lowest success rate of any fuel type, and will face further challenges from climate change in the coming years.
To ensure a larger role for solar and wind, the authors state that major a shift in policy and planning will be necessary. “The development community and African decision-makers need to act quickly if the continent wants to avoid being locked into a carbon-intense energy future,” says Oxford University researcher Philipp Trotter. “Immediate re-directions of development finance from fossil fuels to renewables are an important lever to increase experience with solar and wind energy projects across the continent in the short term, creating critical learning curve effects.”
By outlining the factors that have been central to the success or failure of recent energy projects, the paper’s authors hope the study will be able to contribute to energy planning and reducing the level of risk associated with renewables projects. And their work has already received praise from the government in Namibia:
“We welcome this study and believe that it will support the refinement of strategies for increasing generation capacity from renewable sources in Africa and facilitate both successful and more effective public and private sector investments in the renewable energy sector. The more data-driven and advanced analytics-based research is available for understanding the risks associated with power generation projects, the better.” said Namibia Water Minister Calle Schlettwein. “Some of the risks that could be useful to explore in the future are the uncertainties in hydrological conditions and wind regimes linked to climate change, and economic downturns such as caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.”

The London-based data company said the kingdom had failed to commission any of the 1,040 MW of solar expected last year under its National Renewable Energy Program.
Globaldata on Thursday cited the example of a 1,090 MW engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract in Saudi Arabia which Indian company Sterling and Wilson removed from its order book because of delays caused by an attempted renegotiation between the Saudi authorities and the project developer.
Speculating that the EPC contract related to the 2 GW Sudair solar project, Globaldata said the commissioning authority had attempted to restate the price of solar power to be generated by the giga-scale project in the light of new record low solar tariffs witnessed elsewhere in the region during 2020. With the Middle East vying with Portugal to set a new low price for solar power, the UAE's Emirates Water and Electricity Co in July awarded the 1.5 GW Al Dhafra solar project in Abu Dhabi to EDF and Jinko Power for AED0.0497/kWh ($0.0135).
The delay resulting from haggling over the electricity price forced Sterling and Wilson to remove the EPC contract from its order book according to Globaldata, which cited an update by the company to the Bombay Stock Exchange.
The data company stated Saudi Arabia is pursuing a twin track approach to solar. The energy ministry's Renewable Energy Program Development Office is holding competitive tenders for 30% of the PV capacity called for by the the kingdom's clean energy ambitions and the balance is  being awarded directly by the government's Private Investment Fund (PIF) to project developers. Globaldata claimed the desire of the PIF to keep pace with the ever lower prices produced by tenders was a stumbling block to getting projects on the ground.
pv magazine has contacted Sterling and Wilson and the Saudi energy ministry for more details.
Globaldata reports Saudi Arabia raised its renewable energy ambition for 2023 from 9.5 GW of generation capacity to 27.3 GW, with solar supplying the lion's share – up from 5.9 GW to 20 GW – as part of an ambition to hit 58.7 GW of renewables this decade. That figure would equate to 12-14% of the Saudi energy supply in 2030, according to Globaldata.

They demonstrated the model through the Transient System simulation program (TRNSYS) software on a PV system that was linked to a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. It provides electricity to the system when the load power exceeds the power generated by the PV plant. The 21.4 kW solar array has an annual power yield of 127.3 kW h/m2 under standard conditions.
“The total area of the PV power plant is approximately 205.3 m2, and the PV model of 100 Wp and a 1 m2 area is chosen,” the academics said. “The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is applied to the PV array to harvest the maximum PV power.”
The electrolyzer was designed with a capacity of 5 kW, which would be enough to absorb electricity generated by the solar plant and produce hydrogen for the fuel cell at times of intermittent PV power, the research group said.
‘”The electrolyzer efficiency in this model was 90%,” they explained. “The voltage of a single cell was 1.64 V for the 220-V stack voltage, which requires a total of 134 cells.”
This combination is able to produce hydrogen at seven bars and with high density. The hydrogen tank was sized at 22 cubic meters to store all the hydrogen production at 150 bars. The fuel cell was sized at the peak load power rate of 3 kW for on-peak loads.
The researchers conducted the simulations on a system in Beijing over a period of 12 months. Their project showed that the fuel cell operated at full capacity between March and September, when the PV system had higher energy production. The academics said the proposed system configuration and sizing ensured that the annual amount of hydrogen that was consumed would be the same as the annual amount that was produced.
“The results verify that the system was sized correctly,” the researchers said. “The overall system efficiency was estimated to be 47.9%, which was higher than that obtained in previous studies with the same configuration.”
They described the energy management system in “Efficient photovoltaics-integrated hydrogen fuel cell-based hybrid system: Energy management and optimal configuration,” which was recently published in the Journal of Sustainable Energy.

The 35 MW Spectra Solar Park Limited joint venture, formed by Bangladeshi company Spectra Engineers Limited and Hong Kong-based Shunfeng Investments Limited, has achieved grid connection in Manikganj district, 85km west of Dhaka.
The plant, funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), German development lender KfW and the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia, has started supplying electricity to the grid and is expected to begin commercial operation this week.
The ADB in June signed off a $17.7 million loan package with the Spectra Solar Park JV to finance the project and make it the first private-sector solar plant funded by multilateral institutions in Bangladesh. The government will purchase the solar electricity generated by the plant for 20 years at a rate of BDT11.12/kWh ($0.13).
Some 137,520 panels were installed across 132 acres at the site, powered by 12 Sungrow central inverters, each of which has a 3.125 MW rating. Chinese company Sungrow Power (Singapore) carried out the engineering, procurement, and construction of the plant.
“The project has used [a] highly efficient central inverter solution which is [a] first of its kind in Bangladesh,” said Imran Chowdhury, country head for Sungrow Bangladesh. He added, Sungrow wants to be country’s largest solar developer within five years, including in floating solar and energy storage.
The plant is the latest utility scale addition in the nation following the connection of a 50 MW plant in the Mymensingh district of northern Bangladesh in November. A 7.6 MW project in Sirajgang district is awaiting grid connection.
Bangladesh has 700.84 MW of total clean energy generation capacity, of which 369.81 MW is grid connected. Solar accounts for 466.91 MW of the total clean power figure.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/11/australian-industrial-precinct-to-host-28-mw-56-mwh-grid-balancing-battery/,"UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JANUARY 11, 2021",Australian industrial precinct to host 28 MW/56 MWh grid-balancing battery,"From pv magazine Australia
A joint venture between Australian companies Edify Energy and Precinct Capital has lodged a development application with Newcastle City Council to build a utility scale battery on 0.6 hectares of land within the Steel River Estate industrial area, on the South Channel bank of the Hunter River, in the Newcastle suburb of Mayfield West.
“Deploying this battery in the heart of Newcastle’s industrial precinct will help balance the power system for the city, keeping the lights on for industry and households throughout the region,” said Precinct Capital’s chairman, Bruce Baudinet.
Although not directly associated with solar or wind generation – but intended to charge and discharge directly from the grid in response to disturbances or market signals – the 28 MW/56 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) “will facilitate the further deployment of renewables by providing grid stabilization,” Edify Energy’s chief executive John Cole told pv magazine today.
He added: “The project is aligned with the objectives of the NSW Electricity Strategy and NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap,” as well as with the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO’s) 2020 Integrated System Plan, all of which “call for dispatchable electricity technologies to enable a firmed renewable energy supply from Renewable Energy Zones.”
The Hunter region was recently identified as the state’s fifth key Renewable Energy Zone by the New South Wales minister for energy and environment, Matt Kean, but remains some way down the planning track after the 3 GW Central West Orana and 8 GW New England REZs.
Steel River, pending development and planning approval, will get ahead of the REZ curve, supporting, in the short term, both additional utility scale renewables and rooftop solar penetration into the grid to meet local and state renewable energy targets.
Edify Energy is one of a handful of renewable energy investors and developers to have successfully brought a large scale battery to the Australian energy market.
It is responsible for Victoria’s 25 MW/50 MWh Gannawarra Energy Storage System (GESS), the first such system to be retrofitted to work in tandem with a solar generator, in this case the 60 MW Gannawarra Solar Farm. Supported with grant funding by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Victorian government, it was commissioned in late 2018 and continues to deliver learnings on how batteries can be deployed.
“One of the things we’ve learned is the multi-use application of these lithium ion batteries and what they can do for the network,” says Cole, who adds, “It’s such a dynamic space at the moment, if you stand still for five minutes, everything’s changed.”
An operational report on the GESS released by Edify in August 2020, provided key insights into the asset’s first two six-month periods of operation, including that the battery’s “performance in the energy market … was assisted by highly volatile days where the supply/demand balance was tight”; and that, “regulation FCAS performance has exceed[ed] expectations and has been the standout revenue generating performer for the asset since becoming registered in June 2019.″
Steel River BESS is expected to be given the go ahead to begin construction in late 2021 or early 2022 by which time, Cole says, the price of battery technology will likely have fallen further and markets will have evolved for “ancillary services that batteries can operate into”; the potential is always for capitalizing on volatilities in the energy spot price, buying low and selling high, and network companies will increasingly contract for system support and grid stabilization services.
“There are myriad ways” to contract batteries, says Cole. At Steel River, the company has already received interest “from utilities, retailers, even businesses looking to diversify into energy,” he adds.
The project is the first of its type for Precinct Capital, a family office which has been investing in and developing business parks, self-storage facilities and residential construction on Australia’s eastern seaboard since 1981.
A statement released by Precinct and Edify just before Christmas said: “The decision to build the battery followed research by Precinct Capital which pointed to a growing large scale battery storage industry in Australia.
“It recognized that the land it held within the Steel River Estate was suitable for battery development and strategically located close to large industrial energy users such as the Tomago aluminum smelter. Other high-energy neighbors include Horan Steel, Port Hunter Conveyors and Ullrich Aluminium.
Mayor of Newcastle, Nuatali Nelmes, said the project aligns with the City of Newcastle’s objectives as outlined in its Climate Action Plan, for firming renewable energy supply and building resilience in the local electricity network.
The city has been a leader in sustainable practices, including powering many council facilities with solar, building the 5 MW Summerhill Solar Farm for its own supply and, in January 2020, it became the first NSW council to be powered by 100% renewable-sourced electricity.
Construction of the new BESS is expected to take between six and nine months and will create around 20 jobs during that period, as well as opportunities for local subcontractors in civil works, electrical installation, landscaping and so on.
Tesla provided the battery technology at Gannawarra and Cole says that for Steel River, Edify and Precinct Capital are in discussion with “a number of equipment providers.” The decision has not yet been made whether to go with a turnkey solution from one provider or to take on development themselves, combining technologies from different OEMs.
Edify Energy operates one of the largest portfolios of solar farms in Australia, including Darlington Point, Whitsunday, Hamilton, Gannawarra, Daydream and Hayman solar farms, and Cole says the company has learned that what it originally viewed as passive assets must be viewed as dynamic participants in the NEM.
“They don’t operate like a conventional machine or a large spinning mass. We’re bidding those power plants into the market every five minutes.”
Batteries, he says, will also be operated dynamically, according to market needs and opportunities.
He likens the “generational” change of the Hunter region to that of Collinsville in Queensland, where Edify Energy operates four solar farms – those with “island” names in the list above. “That was a big coal mining town and the solar farms have been very well received up there – we’ve had every school student – primary and secondary – visit those solar farms. It’s all part of the transition,” he says.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/11/water-splitting-tech-to-reduce-moisture-in-pervoskite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 11, 2021",Water-splitting tech to reduce moisture in perovskite solar cells,"One of the main challenges for the scientific community and the PV industry to bring perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to commercial production is the need to improve moisture stability. Protecting the perovskite layer from moisture is key to preventing excess water from forming on the layer itself, as it can damage the crystallinity of the cell structure, which affects overall performance.
An international group led by the University of Padova in Italy has proposed a solution to this problem. It integrated water-splitting (WS) hydrophobic layers to the perovskite absorber of a standard perovskite cell. The ancillary layers can purportedly convert incoming water into oxygen and hydrogen.
They used copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) – an air-stable, white solid coordination polymer with high optical transparency and p-type conductivity – to build the WS-active hole-transporting material (HTM) of the solar cell. In particular, the scientists used ligand-free CuSCN nanoplatelets (CuSCN-NP), which are basically short stacks of platelet-shaped sheets that are produced through continuous flow hydrothermal synthesis (CFHS). The latter is an emerging process technology for the production of nanomaterials, which has recently been widely adopted due to its simplicity and versatility in synthesizing a large range of nanomaterials.
The CuSCN compound was dispersed on a polymeric hole-transporter such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), which the scientists described as a well-established, inexpensive, organic p-type polymer.
“By dispersing CuSCN-NP in P3HT, a nanocomposite HTM is produced, that can be defined as CuSCN@P3HT,” they explained, adding that it can act as a WS-active combination to prevent the moisture-mediated degradation of the cell efficiency. The CuSCN@P3HT composite was prepared by blending the ligand-free CuSCN-NP in solid powder form in a P3HT solution,” they added.
The HTM was integrated into a standard perovskite cell based on Indium tin oxide (ITO), Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), perovskite, gold, and the HTM itself. The direct contact between P3HT and CuSCN-NP in the HTM purportedly favors charge transfers between the adsorbed oxygen dissolved in the solution and the P3HT film. In particular, the incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PV device was improved, according to the Italian group, thanks to the CuSCN nanoplatelets embedded in P3HT, which are able to construct a favorable energy level alignment by making the energy level of the hole transport layer lower.
“This virtuous physico-chemical process ensures the maintenance of a good power conversion efficiency of over 9% in a perovskite solar cell stored for one month in a water-saturated atmosphere,” the scientists said. “When water diffuses within the top layers, some photoexcited holes immediately convert it to molecular oxygen, that, due to the very short distance between CuSCN-NP centers and P3HT, p-dopes the semiconducting polymer. In this way, water molecules can be in situ degraded, while perovskite layer integrity and, consequently, PSC operation can be preserved from undesired chemical degradation.”
They presented the WS technique in “Moisture resistance in perovskite solar cells attributed to a water-splitting layer,” which was recently published in Communications Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/11/new-mounting-system-to-integrate-small-pv-into-wind-farms/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JANUARY 11, 2021",New mounting system to integrate small PV into wind farms,"From pv magazine Germany
Experts agree that solar PV and wind power are equally needed to support the energy transition. The two technologies are rarely located at the same site, but this could change in the future.
At least, that is the dream of Werner Palm, the managing director of Swiss mounting system manufacturer Smartvolt AG. The company is now working with German wind specialist Westfalen Wind, which has deployed an innovative 96.8 kW pilot PV project in the gravel crane parking area of a wind turbine. The two companies used a Smartvolt mounting system to deploy pre-assembled solar module strings, which can simply be folded out on site.
“Thanks to our patented crane beam, it can be erected in three minutes per kilowatt, and dismantled in around six minutes,” said Palm.
The PV system can be easily dismantled if the wind farm's floor space is needed for maintenance work, he noted.
“As a rule, this is only necessary once every 20 years,” added Daniel Saage, the managing director of Westfalen Wind.
Then the solar modules can be folded up and installed again after the maintenance work has been completed. Thus far, Smartvolt has not subjected the system to a long-term load test.
“But five to 10 times shouldn't be a problem,” Palm said.
Both companies see the advantages of this combination because the technical infrastructure to connect the PV system to the grid via the wind turbine is already in place. In addition, there are no additional space requirements and an area that has already been sealed can still be used. The annual yield of the PV system is around 85,000 kWh, which could cover around two-thirds of the wind power plant's own requirements per year. This is around 96,000 kWh and is usually generated by the wind turbine itself.
The local network operator has agreed to approve the PV project as a classic self-consumption system. Whenever the wind turbine is not spinning, its own electricity requirements can be covered with photovoltaics, which ensures that the wind generator is significantly more profitable.
However, Saage said bureaucratic factors are still preventing a breakthrough. The pure manufacturing costs for a 100 kW system are around €600 ($730) per kilowatt installed. In addition, there are building permit fees and compensation payments, as well as other costs. But if such obstacles are eliminated, a few hundred kilowatts of solar could be installed at wind farms without additional costs.
“This would significantly reduce costs and make the overall concept more economically attractive,” he said.
Westfalen Wind has said that around one-fifth to one-eighth of crane parking space could be used for PV systems. However, the wind turbines towers must not face south – ideally, the PV systems should be built with an east-west orientation. In the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone, Saage sees the potential for 60 MW of solar at crane parking areas. Throughout all of Germany, capacity could reach 300 MW, he added.

A wonky financing deal is the latest evidence that solar is entering the mainstream among big institutional investors.
Lightsource BP has secured what’s known as a proxy generation power purchase agreement (pgPPA) with the Capital Solutions unit of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS), in partnership with Nephila Climate. The pgPPA covers electricity generated by Lightsource BP’s 153 MW Briar Creek solar farm, which is now under construction in Navarro County, Texas.
In simple terms, a pgPPA is a renewable energy contract designed to manage weather-related risk. In practice, it settles energy transfers from facilities based on a proxy generation index, rather than on metered generation. That means proxy generation is an hourly index that determines the volume of energy that a project would have produced if it had been operated as specified by the developer or owner.
The arrangement hinges on both the owner and the offtaker agreeing on a set of weather metrics to establish the proxy generation component. In the case of Lightsource BP’s Briar Creek facility, REsurety will serve as the calculation agent over the life of the contract.
The pgPPA reflects the fact that solar “can stand on its own two feet” and not be so tied either to a purchase power agreement or public policy directive, said Lee Taylor, REsurety’s founder and CEO, in a recent interview with pv magazine USA.
Early adopters
Taylor said that the pgPPA structure emerged a few years ago in the wind energy sector, and variations are now common in agribusiness, as well as ski resorts, among other weather-risk-related markets. One of the technique’s first uses in renewable energy was with the 178 MW Bloom Wind facility in Kansas – part of the Southwest Power Pool. U.S. Capital Power operates Bloom Wind under a 10-year fixed price contract with Allianz Risk Transfer that covers 100% of the project’s output.
Under the terms of the contract, which was signed in 2016, Capital Power swaps the market revenue from the wind project’s generation for a fixed annual payment over a period of 10 years. The agreement secures long-term predictable revenues and mitigates generation volume uncertainty related to the intermittent nature of the wind resource.
Taylor said that similar structures have been used on wind projects in PJM and ERCOT in the United States, as well as in Australia. The Briar Creek deal is considered to be the technique’s first use in a U.S. solar project.
“This deal is a great example of the evolution of renewable energy products here in the U.S.,” said Kevin Smith, CEO of Lightsource BP in the Americas. He said that innovative power contract structures such as virtual and pgPPAs are “valuable tools we can leverage to meet the needs of our corporate partners, manage risk, and continue to finance and build new solar projects.”
Ariane West, director of structured finance at Nephila Climate, said that risk-transfer approaches “are essential to support investment and financing of infrastructure on the scale needed to achieve zero carbon targets.”
Related structures
Purchase power agreements are commonly used structures between a solar facility’s owners and an energy offtaker – often a utility or large manufacturer. In a variation known as a virtual PPA, contract terms focus on the amount of energy the facility delivers to the grid. Typically, the quantity is measured by an electrical meter at the point of interconnection. By settling the energy delivery at the interconnection point on an “as generated” basis, the buyer is exposed to a number of operational risks.
In a pgPPA, the focus is the amount of energy that should have been delivered to the grid had the plant operated according to equipment efficiency factors and operational best practices. The approach shifts operational risk away from the offtaker and onto the seller.
The pgPPA measures the actual wind or solar resource at the facility. It then runs that measurement through an agreed-to formula that estimates how many megawatt-hours should have been produced given the facility’s size and operations under best practice standards.
In the case of Briar Creek solar, REsurety is providing the hourly solar radiance data, which will be managed using PVsyst photovoltaic software. The Briar Creek solar farm is about 40 miles south of Dallas, and is expected to start commercial operations at the end of 2021.
