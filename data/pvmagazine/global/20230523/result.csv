The Renewable Energies in Rural Areas Program was carried out by Germany’s Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) – an international cooperation agency – and the Chinese Academy of Science-affiliated, Institute of Electrical Engineering (IEE), with China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) serving as a political counterpart.
The project – covering Gansu, Qinghai, Tibet, and Yunnan provinces – focused on solar because it was part of China’s Brightness Program to deploy PV in 1,066 townships across 11 provinces. Beijing had apportioned around €470 million ($514 million) for hardware purchase from 2002 to 2004 under the Brightness Program.
That program spurred demand and drove more production capacity at established solar players including Canadian Solar, Sungrow, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar, and Suntech as well as attracting new entrants to PV manufacturing. Suntech’s NYSE listing in December 2005 added further market impetus and triggered a wave of overseas IPOs.
Hundreds of solar manufacturers were established in the wake of Beijing’s Renewable Energy Law, introduced in February 2006 at the opening of the nation’s 11th five-year plan. The legislation provided a framework for investment in renewables, particularly from the private sector, and dozens of local authorities saw the employment and tax opportunities offered by the new industry and gave enthusiastic support to remove market entry barriers.
At its peak, China hosted an estimated 550 solar module manufacturers, with industry clusters in Greater Shanghai and neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The more-than 50,000 solar companies in Jiangsu in 2020 produced around 34% of the world’s solar cells and modules.
The NEA was not keen on the Western model of offering fixed, long-term feed-in tariff (FIT) payments as an incentive and discontinued the approach after two national solar auctions in which state-owned enterprises used their vast assets to shoulder aside privately-owned competitors. The government department instead instituted its National Rooftop and Golden Sun Program but the associated capital subsidies did not attract high-quality equipment, and ownership and maintenance responsibilities of the solar arrays were not clear. Provinces including Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang – unusually for China – struck out with their own FIT schemes, albeit limited to local champions who secured the available quotas.
In early March 2011, China’s National People’s Congress laid out a guiding principle for its economy to reach global leadership via an initial made-in-China phase and a second designed-in-China period. The approach concerned seven strategic emerging industries: new energy, energy efficient and environmental protection technology, new energy vehicles, high-end equipment manufacturing, new materials, IT, and biotechnology.
The impact on solar was so startling then-Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for “a prevention of blind expansion” in his “Report on the work of government.” Moreover, in July 2013 the State Council – which oversees provincial governments – in its “Official Opinion” stressed the need for greater PV industry consolidation and to strengthen indigenous R&D capabilities. To date, though, China’s strategic emerging industry plan remains in place.
Interestingly, numerous provinces including Guangdong, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan have of late officially released their own “PV Industry Action Plans” which envisage double or even triple-digit gigawatts of annual production capacities by 2025.
During the early years of the 12th five-year plan, which began in 2011, trade disputes threatened the export-oriented Chinese PV industry. A nationwide FIT scheme was introduced in late 2011 as a result but it was abolished a decade later. The FIT program ensured annual installations skyrocketed from 3.5 GW in 2012 to 87.41 GW(AC) in 2022. China appears to be on track to install up to 120 GW(AC) to 130 GW(AC) this year.
In late 2015, China set in motion its unique, multi-year, quality-driven Top Runner Program, which focused on cell and module conversion efficiency. In essence, compliance with such technical standards enabled developers to bid for gigawatt-scale central and provincial government project tenders.
The Top Runner Program – which took off in conjunction with China’s 13th five-year plan, from 2016 – had a profound impact on the upstream solar sector in particular, resulting not only in ever better-performing components, but also initiating a greater sense of continued innovation within the industry, something that was needed to maintain pole position globally in the longer term. Recently, the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME) announced the nation exported 575 GW of modules, worth $220 billion, between 2012 and last year.
In 2002, China’s PV industry was in its infancy. The domestic demand created by rural electrification programs, the implementation of the Renewable Energy Law, and the ability to raise capital abroad enabled significant production capacity expansion and booming international markets.
A long-term designated-industry policy and the ever-increasing competition which spurs innovation among rivals has always been considered a high priority in governmental circles, and thus enjoys fast-track approval. All of this, combined with an entrepreneurial spirit, has enlarged China’s global solar footprint at an unprecedented pace.

“Thanks to the innovative shade-proof smart control technology developed by Sungrow, the SP600S can separately optimize mismatched modules,” the company said in a statement. “To cope with the ever-changing shading conditions, resulting from varying sunlight angles and orientations, Sungrow’s shade-proof control technology automatically detects the sun exposure status of the modules in real-time.”
The device has a rated input power of 600 W, with a maximum efficiency of 99.4% and a weighted efficiency of 98.8%. It offers a maximum output current of 16 A and a maximum output voltage of 80 V.
The device measures 86 mm x 108 mm x 25 mm and weighs 0.5 kg, featuring an IP68 enclosure. The manufacturer said the new product could increase the power yield of a PV system by 4% to 30%, depending on the operating conditions of the array.
“It can accommodate up to 30 modules per string to achieve the optimal installation capacity and it supports mixed installation of strings with different lengths and modules with different power ratings, making the system design process more flexible,” said Sungrow.

“The cell is suitable for production, and there is a startup from Louisville – SoFab Inks – that is doing just that,” researcher Thad Druffel told pv magazine. “The was awarded $200,000 from the [US Department of Energy] in the perovskite solar startup challenge.”
The researchers said ETLs based on SnO2 offer low-temperature solution processability, good photostability, high chemical stability, high electronic conductivity, good optical transparency, wide band gap, and favorable band alignment with perovskites.
“Additionally, the wide and tunable optical band gap and deep conduction band (−4.3 eV) of SnO2 result in optimal charge injection,” they said.
They synthesized the yttrium-doped SnO2 nanoparticles to improve their electronic properties while maintaining low-temperature annealing conditions required for the fabrication of perovskite cells on substrates made of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
The cell has a p-i-n architecture and an active area of 0.1 cm2. It relies on a flexible substrate made of PET and indium tin oxide (ITO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA), an interfacial layer made of the PFN polymer, the perovskite absorber, the yttrium-doped Sno2 ETL, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
“PTAA, PFN, perovskite, and SnO2 layers were deposited by one-step blade coating methods, whereas BCP and silver were deposited by thermal evaporation,” the academics said.
The group tested several of the cells under standard illumination conditions and found that they achieved a power conversion efficiency of 16.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.08 V, a short-circuit current of 22.40 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 68.4%. As a way of comparison, a reference device with an ETL without yttrium doping reached an efficiency of 14.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.01 V, a short-circuit current of 22.40 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 63.3%.
The scientists attributed the increased performance of the cell to the novel SnO2 ETL design.
“This material possesses minimal cost, scalability, and manufacturing advantages over traditional organic ETLs that could improve the competitiveness of commercial perovskite solar modules,” they concluded.
They introduced the device in “High Performing Inverted Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells via Solution Phase Deposition of Yttrium-Doped SnO2 Directly on Perovskite,” which was recently published in Applied Energy Materials.

It showcased new technologies harnessing, storing, and using solar energy. The expo served as a platform for East and Central Africa, attracting exhibitors from over 24 countries.
“We have seen a significant rise in attendees, with a 30% increase. This year's event has exhibitors from over 24 countries, an increase from 14 in 2018, in different categories such as batteries, inverters, and rural power generation systems,” said Duncan Njage, Regional Director of Expogroup, which organized the event. “There are over 4,000 visitors this year and over 75 exhibitors in different categories.”
Over 25,000 to 30,000 solar PV products are traded annually in Kenya. This attracted many companies to the event, especially from China and India, including Luminous Solar, Techfine, One-Inverter, Solis, Omnivoltaic, Snadi, and Solar X. Several exhibitors shared their views about the region's potential, saying it's the right time to invest in Africa's solar industry.
One-Inverter sales manager Irene Lyu said they were happy to attend Solar Africa 2023 and showcase their products in the region. “We are yet to set base in this region. However, we are open to working with industry suppliers and bringing our solutions to customers. Our 10 kWh battery is a great solution, and we hope to partner with local suppliers in the region.”
“I am happy to be here. We are a battery, inverter, and UPS solutions company. The event has been great, with many visitors interested in solar energy. Our goal now is to partner with suppliers as we will not set base in the region at the moment,” said Kyra Zhang, sales manager of Techfine.
“We are thrilled to participate in the Solar Africa exhibition and showcase our latest energy solutions to potential customers and partners in Kenya. Our products are designed to meet the energy needs of individuals, households, and businesses. Our solutions provide a reliable and sustainable source of power, reducing reliance on traditional grid power and contributing to a cleaner and greener future,” said Joy Wu, EcoFlow's Head of Latin America and Asian Pacific.
According to the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA), Kenya's renewable energy capacity reached 3 GW in June last year, with solar having a share of around 120 MW. The majority of this is from hydropower distributed by the country's utility KPLC. However, the recent drought led to low water levels and increased power costs, making electricity expensive, with a kWh unit costing Ksh 26 ($0.20).
Many projects are currently being developed in the county. In Kisumu, Ergon Solair Africa Limited is developing a 48.25 MW plant in Kibos, expected to commission in 2024 and endorsed by the Kenyan government. The Kenya Ports Authority plans to commission a 10 MW solar power plant at the Mombasa poart as part of its green energy strategy and to reduce electricity bills.
Kenya plans to spend $2.1 billion to power off-grid areas by using renewable-powered mini-grids. This shows the change to solar power is inevitable, especially with the high cost of power from the national grid. The Rural Electrification Authority in Kenya aims to install 450 mini-grids as part of the country's 2016-2021 Strategic Plan.

A unique planned, mixed-use neighborhood of 155 solar homes is now under construction in South Burlington, Vermont. The homes in Hillside East are designed with climate and storm resiliency in mind, as each one is equipped with Tesla Powerwall batteries, charged by 8 kW rooftop solar systems. There will also be a community microgrid with utility-scale batteries to keep the whole neighborhood powered up.
The neighborhood plan includes a mix of 155 single-family, multi-family and “permanently affordable” homes, according to utility Green Mountain Power (GMP). The three homes listed as currently available on the Hillside East website range in price from about $599,000 to $770,000 for three-bedroom homes.
The mixed-use neighborhood will include walking trails, playgrounds and a dog park. It is the second phase of a development that the Hillside East website says will include a variety of residential styles, access to employment opportunities, shopping, dining, and more.
Senator Welch joined Governor Phil Scott and Evan Langfeldt, president and chief executive officer of construction firm, O’Brien Brothers, along with Mari McClure, president and chief executive officer of GMP for a groundbreaking celebration.
“Vermonters are facing two overlapping challenges: a dire housing shortage and the ongoing climate crisis,” said Welch, a longtime environmental steward and co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. “This project helps tackle both problems head-on, creating more than 150 100% fossil fuel-free homes using Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. It’s the kind of ambitious project we need more of — in Vermont and across the United States.”
In addition to solar and backup batteries, the all-electric homes will have cold weather, ducted heat pump systems for heating and cooling, all electric appliances and a Span Drive level 2 EV charger in the garage. Span Smart Panels will also be installed. These electrical panels double as a home monitoring system that let the homeowner monitor energy use through a mobile app. The panels work with the Span Drive charger. All power lines will be buried underground to add to the resiliency of the neighborhood during high winds and winter storms.
Homeowners will pay an estimated $85 a month for the resiliency package of home batteries paired with solar panels with no upfront costs, according to GMP.
The utility reports that it was the first in the world to earn B Corporation certification, indicating that it meets rigorous social, environmental and accountability standards for its customers. The utility’s annual energy mix is 100% carbon free and 78% renewable.
“This is the future of the grid happening right here in Vermont. Our customer programs for energy storage, heat pumps, discount EV charging and smart panels are pulled together to bring real resilience to this community, decentralizing the grid and lowering costs for all customers,” said GMP’s McClure. “ Devastating climate impacts are here and we must move quickly to use this innovative model to bring solutions to Vermonters all over the state.”
“The energy efficiency measures, solar power generation and battery storage capacity will all work together to significantly decrease homeowners’ carbon footprints, strengthen the overall power grid and help Vermont move towards its climate goals, all while providing housing to 155 families,” said Langfeldt.
 The community will be built in multiple phases, with the first units ready for occupancy estimated for this fall.

The company, formerly known as Zero Mass Water, claims their new panel is “the world's first renewable drinking water system” and can operate independently in various locations throughout the world.
The Commercial Hydropanel and R3 Residential Hydropanel, with a lifespan of around 15 years, can function with as little as 10% humidity in the air.
While specific details about the patented technology were not disclosed, Source Global explained that the panel's PV unit produces electricity to power fans extracting water vapor from the air. The collected vapor is then converted into liquid water using the panel's internal heat.
A self-contained system maintains water circulation and cleanliness in a storage tank, followed by mineralization for ideal composition and taste.
Commercial panels are already deployed in remote areas, indigenous communities, camps, and arid deserts, such as Oman, where the company established its inaugural “water farm.”

Spanish renewable energy company Acciona Energía has commissioned what it claims is “the largest photovoltaic plant in the world associated with an irrigation system directly connected to the grid, without backup batteries.”
Acciona has built a 1.58 MW solar plant in Montesusín, near Huesca in northeastern Spain. Equipped with 2,400 solar modules and trackers, the facility covers 35,585 m2. With an average annual production of 3,000 MWh, the plant will directly power irrigation pumps for 150 irrigators across 3,400 hectares.
Acciona Energía announced the project in 2021, when it launched the “Innovation of photovoltaic pumping in irrigation communities” initiative, which aims for the installation of 7.3 MW.
The project incorporated two major innovations. The first is the technology used to stabilize the injection of energy into the system. This technology has been developed and patented under Maslowaten, a European-funded research project that develops smart irrigation solutions powered by solar energy, led by the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM).
The project calculated the power requirements of PV irrigation systems, addressing intermittent power issues without batteries, and integrating them into existing irrigation systems using innovative approaches to maximize solar energy utilization.
“The energy generated by the plant drives the pumps responsible for raising the water from the catchment basin to the crown basin, from where it is distributed to all irrigators by gravity,” said Óscar Dupla, manager of the distributed-generation technical office at Acciona Energía
The new system includes decentralized monitoring, automated analysis, fault detection, and reporting, enhancing irrigation efficiency and management, according to the company. Irrigators no longer need to manually activate irrigation as the system is programmed to do it automatically. Additionally, Acciona will sell water to irrigators through a 26-year contract. The company plans to expand the project solution across Spain.

While preparations for the industrial production of highly efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells and modules are already underway worldwide. Precisely measuring tandem solar cells and modules could help pave the way for their industrial implementation, according to Fraunhofer ISE.
Exact measurements are necessary to make objective comparisons between different cells and modules and to make technological improvements. In contrast to conventional silicon PV modules, however, the calibration is considerably more challenging.
Fraunhofer ISE is leading a research consortium in developing methods to better characterize perovskite-based tandem modules as part of the Katana project, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate. A solar simulator specially built for this purpose by Wavelabs Solar Metrology Systems is now operating at the institute's CalLab PV Modules.
“It is important to provide highly precise and reproducible measurements for this emerging technology as soon as possible so that there can be objective competition,” said Stefan Glunz, division director for photovoltaic technologies at Fraunhofer ISE.
Martin Schubert, project head at Fraunhofer ISE, said that all cell layers need to be irradiated by different light sources under conditions that closely imitate those under sunlight, in order to make reliable statements about the efficiency of the entire cell and module.
The new solar simulator makes this possible by measuring lab-scale perovskite-silicon PV cells with an area of 5 by 5 millimeters up to PV modules of 2.40 m by 1.30 m. The simulator's large wavelength range, spanning 320 to 1650 nanometers, is due to 28 different spectrally adjustable light channels distributed over 40 light sources with a total of 18,400 LEDs. This forms the basis for the test procedures developed by researchers for perovskite-silicon tandem technology. The solar simulator also enables the characterization of multi-junction solar cells and modules made of other materials.
“The new solar simulator is a milestone towards a standardized calibration procedure for perovskite-silicon tandem modules,” said Falko Griehl, project manager for the SINUS-3000 Advanced solar simulator at Wavelabs. “During its construction, we had to ensure that the LED illumination homogeneously irradiates the modules over the entire surface and that their light spectra can be adjusted so that all cell layers are realistically activated. With this technology, beyond the standard spectra, we can also simulate light at arbitrary times of day and regions, which allows this influence on tandem modules to be analyzed.”
From 2024, the heat generated by the longer illumination times during module characterization will be compensated by a climate chamber, in which the tandem PV cells and modules will be placed for measurement.
Perovskite solar cell manufacturer Oxford PV is an associate partner in the Katana project.
“The development of a new calibration capability for accurately determining the performance of perovskite-on-silicon cells and modules will enable high-quality independent measurements of this breakthrough technology,” said David Bushnell, Oxford PV’s test and measurement department manager. “We are pleased to be supporting the wider PV community by helping to fund this project.”
The classic flash simulators, or flasher, from silicon photovoltaics cannot be used for the characterization of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells and modules since they cannot variably adjust the light spectrum that the tandem cells convert into electricity. In addition, the flasher's illumination time is too short to account for the effects between the sub-cells.
“For the metastable behavior of perovskite technology, the solar cells and modules must be tested under continuous light,” Fraunhofer ISE added, noting that until now, the efficiency of perovskite-based tandem modules had to be measured in complex and weather-dependent outdoor tests.
