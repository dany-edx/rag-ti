https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/15/nigerias-pv-potential/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NIGERIA",,"AUGUST 15, 2023",Nigeria’s PV potential,"From pv magazine 07-08/23
Nigeria mainly uses fossil fuels and hydro in its 4 GW power generation fleet. It has been estimated around 30 GW of capacity would be needed to fully cover its population of 200 million people.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated Nigeria had 33 MW of grid-connected solar at the end of 2021. With solar irradiance ranging from 1.5 MWh/m² to 2.2 MWh/m² why does the country remain shackled by energy poverty? IRENA has estimated renewables could meet 60% of Nigeria’s energy demand by 2050.
Thermal power stations generate around 70% of Nigeria’s electricity today, with hydro providing most of the remainder. Five main generation companies (GenCos) dominate and the Transmission Company of Nigeria is the sole transmission entity, responsible for the development, maintenance, and expansion of the transmission network.
The distribution sector has been completely privatized. Power produced by the GenCos is sold to Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) which is the only bulk trader of electricity. It buys electricity from the GenCos through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and sells to private distributors through vesting contracts. This structure ensures that the generating companies get a guaranteed price irrespective of what happens on the distribution side. There are fundamental problems with the system which also affect the adoption of solar technology as a part of Nigeria’s energy mix.
The first discussions about grid-connected renewable energy technology in Nigeria happened around 2005, when the “vision 30:30:30” initiative was introduced. The aim of this program was to achieve an increase of up to 32 GW in generating capacity by 2030; 9 GW from renewable sources, including 5 GW of solar.
More than a decade later, 14 solar independent power producers (IPPs) finally signed PPAs with NBET. The government thereafter introduced feed-in tariffs (FITs) to make solar more attractive to investors. Interestingly, none of those original IPP projects reached financial close, due to policy uncertainty and lack of grid infrastructure.
A key issue was a government U-turn on a previously agreed tariff, offering a lower FIT, citing a drop in the cost of solar as the reason. Only two out of the 14 IPPs accepted the reduction in FIT payments with the rest stating the revised figure was too low to be viable.
NBET also requires a partial risk guarantee, an agreement between itself as the off-taker and a finance body. Essentially, this is a guarantee to give NBET more liquidity in case it needs cash, and the guarantee has to be paid back by the government to the finance entity. The IPPs will not be able to reach financial close without this guarantee. So far, though, it has not been forthcoming, partly because some finance institutions have now rescinded their offer to provide guarantees due to a lack of trust in the electricity market.
Ultimately, the lack of lender trust in the Nigerian power market also stems from fundamental issues with the electricity grid, especially with regards to its reliability and flexibility. That is why most lenders and developers require guarantees to safeguard their investments. Much of Nigeria’s grid infrastructure is unreliable.
Favorable government policies for solar and other renewables are fundamental to the success of clean energy development. One strategy which could be considered is unbundling the offtaker market by allowing businesses to buy electricity directly from IPPs. This takes away the need for price regulation, to a large extent, and enables those who do not mind paying a premium for stability and flexibility to do so. This in turn takes away the need for most of the complicated guarantees that lenders require to finance projects, and positively improves liquidity.
In addition, upgrading grid infrastructure and increasing transmission capacity is key, so that more solar can be connected to the grid and energy security can be increased. There is also a role here for multilateral development banks (MDBs). The reason why thermal power plants have been successfully developed and remain in use is because of the risk guarantees provided by MDBs for them. If these can be extended to the emerging solar market in Nigeria, it will increase the adoption of PV.
Nigeria is a potentially big market for solar mini-grids as there are towns and communities without any connection to the grid.
Mini grids are also an opportunity for developers and financiers to serve those without access to electricity, and for the development of captive solar power facilities for heavy energy consumers, such as mines, to ensure their own reliable and affordable power capacity. There is also opportunity for development of energy storage solutions to stabilize local grids.
Tapping Nigeria’s PV potential will require a synchronous effort between the government, developers, lenders, and consumers. And time is of the essence now that many countries are in the race to net zero. Decarbonizing power infrastructure is key.

Perovskite technology startup Caelux announced it has secured a series A funding of $12 million, bringing total funding to $24 million to develop and commercialize its perovskite glass for tandem use. The company will open a 100 MW perovskite-glass manufacturing facility outside of Los Angeles, California.
Caelux said tandem cells using its technology can push efficiencies past 30%, while retaining the same cost per Watt.
Perovskites are under focus for many global research teams as an abundant, highly efficient photovoltaic material, but they suffer from resilience and lifecycle limitations. New records of efficiency and stability are continually being demonstrated in laboratories, moving the technology closer to commercialization.
Caelux is among first movers on this road to commercialization as it netted the new Series A fund in a round led by Temasek with participation Reliance New Energy, Khosla Ventures, Mitsui Fudosan and Fine Structure Ventures.
The company has developed a method for depositing a perovskite layer in glass, enabling it to be readily integrated with existing solar cell manufacturing lines for a boost in module output. Caelux said its solar glass alone offers greater than 17% efficiency, and when deposited in tandem with other cell technologies, it can boost the overall conversion efficiency rating by six percentage points.
Caelux said its perovskite glass layer can be deposited in existing manufacturing processes with minimal changes to the facility. It is technology-agnostic, allowing for integration with all conventional cell technologies, including PERC, HJT and TopCon.
“This investment will support our mission to usher in the next generation of solar innovation, including our production of full-size perovskite sub-modules,” said Scott Graybeal, chief executive officer, Caelux. “We are excited to have attracted visionary, global investors to help us on our journey to multi-gigawatt scale.”
The company said its U.S.-made perovskite-glass sub-module, called Caelux One, qualifies as a solar cell under Treasury Department analysis, making it eligible for manufacturing tax credits as well as contributing to a project’s domestic content percentage.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
“Companies should be incentivized to scoop us up into part of their manufacturing value chain, because now they have a solar cell that was produced right here in the United States,” said Leslie Chang, director of strategy and policy, Caelux in an interview with Solar Power World. “By incorporating Caelux, not only are you able to increase the overall power conversion efficiency of your module, but also you better qualify for these domestic content regulations.”
The company said it targets a commercial launch of Caelux One in 2024, with aims to secure Series B funding and reach gigawatt-scale production after launch.
In June, another U.S. manufacturer, CubicPV, secured equity commitments in excess of $100 million to scale a U.S. solar wafer production facility. Formed in 2021 in a merger of Hunt Perovskite Technologies and 1366 Technologies, the company has a history with perovskite development, and said it will continue its research and development of tandem modules as part of the funding led by SCG Cleanergy.

Adelaide-based 1414 Degrees has commissioned a 1 MWh SiBox pilot unit that uses its SiBrick proprietary molten silicon energy storage solution to store intermittent renewable energy and produce clean, high-temperature heat for industrial settings.
The company said the SiBox is a complete thermal energy storage system, comprising a heating element and the SiBricks, which are contained within an insulated heat store, integrated with an energy recovery system. The heat is then available for use, providing a potential zero-carbon heat source for industries requiring temperatures above 800 C. This is a requirement of minerals processing and manufacturing industries – including the cement, alumina and iron and steel sectors.
The company said the commissioning phase of the demonstration unit involved extensive trials that showed the SiBox storage system’s ability to convert electric energy into a controlled hot air stream.
It said the unit had successfully undergone 32 cycles of phase change, operating at outlet temperatures ranging from 700 C to 850 C and delivering six to 12 hours continuous output at each set point.
“Data from these trials closely align with the expectations from the engineering design tools and models developed, providing confidence for scale-up designs of SiBox technology,” 1414 Degrees said. “The 1 MWh of internal SiBricks performed robustly and were found in excellent condition on visual inspection.”
It said the demonstration unit is now operating autonomously and is ready for continuous cycling and discharge testing over the next 12 months to complete the validation phase.
“In the coming months our engineers will use the performance results from the demonstration module to design a commercial scale SiBox of up to 100 MWh,” said 1414 Degrees.
Kevin Moriarty, the chairman of 1414 Degrees, said the SiBox has been designed to be retrofitted into industry processes and offers a cost-efficient sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.
“Over the next 12 months, we anticipate that SiBox will emerge as an important emissions reduction solution for the industrial sectors that manufacture the infrastructure of our societies,” Moriarty said, adding that the company os “well-positioned to make significant contributions to industries’ transition to clean energy.”
The development of the demonstration unit has been backed by oil and gas giant Woodside which contributed up to AUD 2 million ($1.3 milion) for the project. As part of that deal, Woodside now has the opportunity to jointly develop and commercialise the SiBox technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/15/top-5-solar-inverter-suppliers-accounted-for-71-of-shipments-in-2022/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 15, 2023",Top 5 solar inverter suppliers accounted for 71% of shipments in 2022,"From pv magazine USA
The top 10 global solar inverter vendors accounted for 86% of the market in 2022, up 4% year on year from 2021, according to a new study by Wood Mackenzie.
The market grew 48% year over year, due to easing supply chain challenges and strong government support, as seen in the United States with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Wood Mackenzie said that the top five vendors shipped more than 200 GW (AC) and accounted for 71% of total global PV inverter shipments in 2022, up 8% from 2021. The report notes that fir the top vendor of 2022, Huawei, shipments increased by 83%. Ginlong Solis posted growth of 86%.
For the eighth consecutive year, the top two vendors were Huawei and Sungrow. Huawei held the first position with a 29% market share in 2022. Sungrow, the winner of the pv magazine award in 2021, increased its market share by two percentage points, from 21% in 2021 to 23% in 2022. Ginlong Solis moved up to third place in 2022, driven by the company’s shipments in China.
The top eight vendors of 2021 were very similar to the lineup in 2022, with only Ginlong Solis and Growatt swapping third and fourth positions from 2021. Aiswei and Sofar jumped up three ranks to enter the top 10 ranking, holding the ninth and tenth positions respectively in 2022.
In the Asia-Pacific region, China led the market with 78% of inverter shipments as solar experienced unprecedented growth. India retained its position as the second largest inverter market in the Asia-Pacific region in 2022, but Wood Mackenzie said that it had a 25% decrease in shipments year over year. Japan had 7 GW of inverters enter the country, overtaking Australia as the third-biggest market, with growth of 23% year-over-year growth.
The European region experienced the highest shipment growth, with an 82% increase in 2022, following its 44% year-on-year growth in 2021. Wood Mackenzie attributed this to the move toward carbon neutrality by 2050, as part of the European Green Deal plan. Europe accounted for 28% of the global market, with 92 GW shipped.
While the US market is beginning a strong growth trajectory, it accounted for only 13% of the global market with 42 GW shipped to the country. Solar-plus-storage hybrid inverters made up 10% of the regional shipments as the curtailment of net metering in some markets are leading to a strong energy storage market.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/15/new-study-claims-pv-industry-is-neglecting-overirradiance-issues/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,PERU,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 15, 2023",New study claims PV industry is neglecting overirradiance issues,"An international research team has investigated how overirradiance (OI) may impact the performance of PV installations at low- and mid-latitudes and have found several issues may arise when OI conditions last more than one minute and at ambient temperatures above 30 C.
These events may affect the operating performance of photovoltaic plants, the stability of the electrical grid, and the efficiency of inverters. These effects are due to the increase and drastic fluctuation of irradiance, which can vary by more than 900 W/m2.
“To our estimation, the industry in the last decades, the PV industry, has been neglecting overirradiance, possibly due to unawareness or the belief that these events are rare and isolated,” the research's lead author, Marco Zamalloa, told pv magazine. “We ourselves were not aware of such events before seeing them in our irradiance data a few years ago. However, since we are relatively new to this topic, we cannot say with absolute certainty whether some PV energy industry branches and project developers now consider these overirradiance conditions.”
 According to Zamalloa, OI conditions are common and occur everywhere with cloud formation. “They can be imagined as a wandering focal point of a magnifying glass,” he further explained. “With the movement of the cloud, it wanders over the earth's surface. We become only aware of the irradiance enhancement when the focal point passes a sensor.”
In the paper “Overirradiance conditions and their impact on the spectral distribution at low- and mid-latitude sites,” published in Solar Energy, Zamalloa and his colleagues analyzed the spectral distribution of OI conditions in Lima, Madrid, and Berlin using spectroradiometers, tilt and azimuth angles, and sampling interval. They measured, in particular, the spectral distribution of solar irradiance in W/m2/nm, ranging from 350 to 1050 nm, via two years of measured spectral data.
Through their analysis, they found that OI conditions cause red-shift and cloud a blue-shift of the clear-sky spectrum. “The red-shift caused by overirradiance conditions results in different spectral distributions, depending on the average photon energy of the clear sky,” they explained, adding that the spectral red-shift indicates a cloud-enhancement of the direct normal irradiance.
“We believe the photovoltaic industry requires a quantitative evaluation of the impacts of overirradiance on the operation of photovoltaic systems, which are just beginning to be carried out,” co-author Jan Amaru Töfflinger said. “The sudden change in irradiance makes it necessary to improve the response time of the inverters and the MPPT algorithm, both to take advantage of the increase in irradiance and to avoid heating the cables, fuses, and photovoltaic modules due to the high current generated by the overirradiance events.”
Töfflinger also stressed that overirradiance conditions are frequent in Brazil and can have technical and economic effects on photovoltaic plants. “We have contacted colleagues from Brazil, where, so far, most papers have been written regarding the impact of overirradiance conditions on PV plants,” he concluded. “They say they are quite aware of the potential risks and are taking precautions in sizing the inverter and protective fuses.”
The research group is formed by scientists from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Germany's Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie GmbH, and the University of Jaén in Spain.

Their work, exposed in the study “Renewable energies and biodiversity: Impact of ground-mounted solar photovoltaic sites on bat activity,” published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, consisted of analyzing species-specific bat activity and bat species richness at 19 ground-mounted solar PV developments in southwest England.
The researchers stressed that bats usually avoid anthropogenic alterations and that the research was launched with the idea that solar plants would inevitably reduce activity and species richness. “We also predicted that bat species would be mainly affected at their foraging/commuting habitats, that is open space foragers will show reduced activity in fields containing solar PV panels, whereas species that utilize edge and cluttered habitats would be more affected along boundary habitats,” they specified.
The average size of the grassland surfaces of the 19 solar farms is 59.6 hectares, and the grassland is grazed, mowed, or providing cut arable crops. Bat activity was monitored via bat detectors for 7 consecutive nights at each site. This resulted in 51,464 call sequences, comprising 10 species or species groups.
The researchers compared bat activity registered at the solar plants with that of reference sites with no photovoltaic installations. “We found statistical evidence that the activity of six of eight species/species groups were negatively affected by solar PV panels,” they said. “The panels may be causing some bats to alter their flight paths, potentially resulting in further fragmentation of the ecological landscape.”
The research team, which also includes academics from the ELTE Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences, believes that solar PV sites may reduce bat activity over broad geographical scales. “We conclude that assessing, mitigating and monitoring bat activity needs to be factored into solar PV development planning and operation,” they stressed.
