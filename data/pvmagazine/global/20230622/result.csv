Germany’s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has reported that 1,040 MW of new PV systems were registered in May. The figure marks a significant increase from April, when new additions hit 881 MW, and considerable growth from May 2022, when newly installed PV capacity reached 548 MW.
In the first five months of this year, newly installed PV capacity hit 4.97 GW, from around 2.65 GW in the same period a year earlier.
Around 1,235 MW of the PV capacity deployed in the first five months of the year was installed in the southern state of Bavaria. North Rhine-Westphalia ranked second with 750 MW, followed by Baden-Württemberg with 661.5 MW.
By the end of May, Germany's cumulative installed PV capacity had reached 72.5 GW. In order to reach its 2030 solar target of 215 GW, the country needs to add at least 1.55 GW of new solar every month.

The engineering services firm performed inspections in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, India, Japan, United Arab Emirates, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and France.
It shared the main results of the audit in a new report identifying the top 10 most common safety problems in the audited systems. It said that 49% of sites have grounding issues, 47% have damaged modules, 41% have cross-mated connectors, 40% have poor terminations and improperly assembled connectors, 31% have module hotspots, 27% have cables on sharp edges, 26% have broken or damaged connectors as well as water ingress, and 19% have enclosure hotpots.
“The vast majority of these hazards are caused by poor installation practices,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “This means most of them can be identified and resolved relatively easily before they lead to fires, safety risks, and potentially costly liabilities.”
CEA discovered that most grounding issues occur at the inverter or equipment pad, between PV array blocks and module rows, and along extended conduit runs, addressing the most common safety concern. It also found that damage to modules is often caused by incorrect installation or cleaning methods, including walking on modules, as well as extreme weather events like hail or wind.
CEA said that sites displaying cross-mated connectors often result from an incorrect understanding of UL-listed connector pairings and the use of field-made connectors that do not match the module connector.

“In the event of disconnection of busbars and solder ribbons in silicon solar modules, it will be possible to repair the faulty part on the spot,” the research's corresponding author, Yu Kawano, told pv magazine. “We have developed a low-cost technology to extend the life of the solar cells, allowing them to recover their output directly at the outdoor installation site, without disassembling the solar module or removing it from the solar array.”
The novel methodology utilizes a portable induction heating system provided by Japan-based technology provider Toray Engineering Co., Ltd to repair the solder joint and interconnection failures. “It has a spot diameter of 2.0 mm and operates under a power of 3.5 kW, a frequency of 900 kHz, and a distance between the system and the PV module of 2.0 mm,” the researchers explained.
The team tested the induction heating system by applying it only to the region with the interconnection failures in damaged modules, with the heating time varying from 0.1 s to 10.0 s, and said that a heating time exceeding the 10.0 s threshold may result in further damage to the panels.
For the testing, the scientists utilized damaged and non-damaged modules with a back sheet/EVA/Si solar cells/EVA/cover glass structure, with the dimensions of 145 mm × 145 mm, and series interconnected solar cells with a size of 26 mm × 120 mm.
“According to the result, the optimized heating time of 2.0 s results in a more homogeneous bright across the entire module with high electroluminescence (EL) intensity lines in both horizontal and vertical lines,” they specified. “The too-long heating time of 10.0 s deteriorates the fill factor (FF) value to 0.765.”
The scientists said the system proved to be effective in decreasing the series resistance and recovering the performance of the damaged panels.
“It is noted that the more obvious recovery of the performance can be seen using this proposed repair method in the silicon PV module with the many failures of joints of solder and electrodes, solder, and interconnection ribbons,” they stated. “The optimized heating time for the disconnected Si PV module results in the recovery of the FF value close to that for the standard Si PV module, consistent with the recovery of the EL imaging.”
The new technique is described in the study “Development of repairing technique for interconnection of silicon photovoltaic modules using an induction heating system,” published in Solar Energy. The research group includes scientists from the Ritsumeikan University and Japanese copper wire manufacturer Showa Seisakusho Co., Ltd.

Climate studies have shown that potential solar irradiation is subject to both regional and local variation over time, with many contributing factors. No clear way has yet been found to predict irradiation far into the future and historic variations have shown strong correlation with air pollution, meaning climate change is not the only driver for changes in solar irradiation.
The global increase in temperature will affect the performance of PV plants. Solar panels are subject to losses as their operating temperatures rise, with a coefficient ranging from 0.3 W/C to 0.5 W/C.
The likely outcome spelled out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) would see average global temperatures rise 2 C by 2060, and up to 3.5 C by 2100. We are already experiencing a 1.1 C increase. While those few degrees might not seem so relevant for the performance of a solar plant, they will be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, as has already been observed in the past few years.
Solar power generation also depends on other factors such as wind speed and the spectral composition of light, which is linked to humidity or aerosols. Many of the variables are uncertain and difficult to predict. Other extreme weather-related events can be expected to happen more frequently thanks to a warming planet, such as fires, droughts, and storms. This increases the uncertainty of solar yield predictions and can lead to higher risk and longer project construction timelines.
We know that climate change will have an impact on solar power generation but because the effects will differ by region, the impact on solar yield cannot be assessed with precision. With nothing certain, energy assessments will have to develop ways to factor in the potential effects of a changing climate.
Energy production assessments, often made with the PVsyst software, have been getting more and more accurate. One of the main inputs of these models is global horizontal irradiation, which is obtained from meteorological models and databases. Other input parameters, such as temperature, wind speed, and spectral content have an impact on energy assessments. As the studies depend directly on meteorological conditions, the impact of climate change on solar projects can no longer be ignored.
The current market approach to predicting solar yield involves using a typical meteorological year to assess the future performance and production of a solar project. Since this typical year is based on historical data, it may not always be suitable in a changing climate.
This risk intensifies the already heated debate about which solar resource database or model is best suited to the task. As a technical advisor, Everoze is often challenged on these topics because using one source or another will directly affect performance figures and the potential profitability of a project. It can be difficult to judge whether we are being too optimistic, too pessimistic, or well balanced. The results already differ when using data based on the past 10 years, rather than the past 30 years.
We could adapt our methodology with regards to one or more SSP scenarios and suggest a potential energy production result and performance ratio that depends on selected socio-economic pathways. This means adapting our meteorological database and models to consider future radiative forcing levels, which can be done (and already is, by some), since these radiative forcing levels give us an overall change in temperature, radiation, and wind speed.
We could also consider changing the uncertainties when assessing potential solar yield. All of this would affect performance figures, so central in project development and finance. Any change in assumptions will lead to a change in results and this needs to be studied very carefully.
For now, we do not have a consensus or clear solution to accurately consider the impact of the climate crisis. Working towards it is necessary, however, especially for projects expected to last for decades. Solar projects are clearly going to be subject to different figures for irradiation, temperature, and wind speed, as well as other parameters, in the near future.
We expect changes in yield and performance ratios and new risks are emerging that are related to project design, construction, and timelines. That means an impact on energy production assessment but also on due diligence and provisional calendars. As independent technical advisors, we have the responsibility to evolve our expertise, develop new services to assess climate change-related risks, and to not shy away from revealing unpleasant results. One thing is sure: the PV market is ever more popular and solutions to address this topic will emerge. But we need to act as soon, and as quickly, as possible.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/22/solar-to-reach-unassailable-position-as-cheapest-electricity-source-says-dnv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 22, 2023","Solar to reach ‘unassailable position’ as cheapest electricity source, says DNV","From pv magazine USA
DNV, a global risk management firm, has offered its annual outlook on the global energy transition. It placed solar in the spotlight as the frontrunner in renewable energy supply.
“In 2050, solar PV will be in unassailable position as the cheapest source of new electricity globally,” said DNV. 
As the world transitions toward carbon emissions-free electricity generation, DNV expects the share in the generation mix for coal to decrease 4% and gas to fall by 8% by mid-century. As the global fossil fuel industry becomes a metaphorical fossil itself, DNV expects the world energy mix to be 70% reliant on variable renewable sources like solar and wind power. Fossil fuels will represent just over 10% of the energy mix by that time. 
Along this path, solar capacity increases 22-fold in DNV’s energy transition vision. The firm said it views variable renewables as the cheapest and quickest route to both decarbonization and energy security. 
Costs are expected to improve by mid-decade. The global weighted average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar is currently around $50/MWh for solar and $120/MWh for solar-plus-storage. DNV expects solar LCOE to drop to $30/MWh by mid-century, with some individual project costs well under $20/MWh.
“The main driver for this reduction in LCOE is the reduction of unit investments costs, which are around $900 per kW as a global average now,” said DNV. “This will fall significantly with every doubling of solar PV installation globally, reaching $650 per kW in 2050.”
Currently, the levelized cost of solar-plus-storage is currently more than double that of standalone solar. A continuous decline in battery prices will narrow this gap to around 50% by mid-century, said DNV.
Despite its higher costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.
“PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants,” said DNV.
In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%. 
“By mid-century, total installed capacity will be 9.5 TW for solar PV and 5 TW for solar and storage. The resulting 14.5 TW of solar capacity is 24 times greater than in 2020,” said DNV. “While solar will have a share of 54% of installed capacity in mid-century, it will account for 30% of global on-grid electricity generation.”

The average system price for rooftop PV systems in German single-family homes with and without battery storage rose by around 10% to €1,557 ($1,711)/kW in the second quarter of 2023, in comparison with the first quarter of the year. The prices are 21.9% higher than the second quarter of 2022 when they stood at €1,277/kW.
Although module prices are currently falling on the international market, there is no reason to postpone investment decisions in the hope of cheaper prices.
“We don't expect system prices for small systems to drop significantly in the next few months,” said Finn Bee, an analyst at EUPD Research. When questioned directly, however, only 28% of installation companies stated that prices had risen. “Last year it was sometimes more than 90%.”
A common reference value for PV systems on single-family homes is 10 kW of solar power and 10 kWh of battery storage capacity. In a survey of 100 installers, EUPD Research found that prices for such systems range from €18,500 to €45,500. The values vary so largely because they are calculated by adding the minimum and maximum values of the storage and the solar systems for size classes below and above 10 kW. The average price is also not a very meaningful metric for comparison with a particular offer. Rather, these figures are best used to determine price trends.
The real prices depend heavily on the installation context, among other things. For example, it depends on whether a new meter is required, on component choice, on the system’s functionalities, and whether a hybrid inverter or several inverters are installed.
The region in which a house is located also plays a role.
“The prices differ regionally by up to 20%,” said Bee.
And, of course, the origin of the products and the type of guarantees differ. Particularly in the last year, many cheaper battery storage devices from previously unknown Chinese manufacturers have entered the market. Minimum prices have fallen as a result, but average and maximum prices have risen.
In the case of solar modules, the price depends on the efficiency, among other things. With the same output power, high-efficiency modules require less space, producing more electricity on the same roof area. Of course, that comes with an extra cost.
In the current issue of pv magazine Germany, experts for large systems have calculated how high the additional costs can be depending on the efficiency without the profitability suffering as a result (“Topcon, HJT, IBC – which new module products are really worthwhile?” and “Only pay for what you get“).
The price range for battery storage is particularly large, as more functionalities play a role in these systems. Those with emergency power functions that take weather forecasts into account usually cost extra.
Overall, homeowners should consider all of these factors when comparing prices between two offers. With the offer on a flyer from Enpal, which is likely to have ended up in many mailboxes at the moment, you not only have to pay attention to whether the price is somewhere in the middle of the large price range, but also whether the components correspond to the price.
pv magazine asked Peter Knuth, the co-founder of Enerix, about prices and components.
“Our partners also usually offer below the average price range,” said Knuth.
The company offers PV systems nationwide via specialist franchise companies. He sees different customer groups. While some are happy to find the cheapest possible prices online, others would appreciate the support provided by regional specialist companies.
These local companies not only provide video advice, but also dedicate one to two hours on-site to assess specific conditions, including electrical installations.
“They then advise, for example, on the installation of metal roof tiles, if necessary,” said Knuth.
In regions with heavy snowfall and potential risks of tile breakage from roof hooks, this scenario might apply. The guidance enhances confidence in the quality and durability of the product because customers, as stated by Knuth, often struggle to evaluate the technical aspects independently.

Rodrigo Silva, the project leader, told pv magazine that he recognized that so far the public had access to two kinds of information: official statistics from the Directorate General for Energy and Geology (DGEG) or the national association for renewable energy (APREN), offering limited data on installed capacity, or scattered details from companies promoting their work through various online platforms like websites and LinkedIn pages.
Silva launched the “PV Map” in March 2023. He already manually mapped more than 1,000 PV projects across the country, corresponding to roughly 60% of Portugal’s total installed capacity, and is now looking for companies to volunteer information on projects not yet mapped.
The map can currently be filtered by region, project developer, and exploration type, including self-consumption, energy communities, large-scale, feed-in-tariff, mini-generation, microgeneration, PPA, and off-grid. When selecting a particular project, it also shows information about its installation size, year of commissioning, and media links.
A lot of the identified projects still have missing data, but Silva hopes the process will be sped up as more companies volunteer their information. A partnership with DGEG or APREN would be a welcome development for the project, which aims to facilitate access to quality information about solar in Portugal.
The platform launched a new feature this week and has other announcements in the pipeline.
“I noticed that as the number of projects increased, it became more difficult to have an overview of their applications,” said Silva. “So, I found a way to classify the entity that benefits from solar production according to their sector of activity. This gives companies insight into the sectors where they have the most or fewer customers, as well as political entities insight into how the adoption of this technology evolves in the various sectors.”
The provisional results, currently published as infographics on LinkedIn and as exclusive reports to partnering companies, show that the food industry benefits the most from solar production, followed by the mineral industry, education, and the textile industry.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/22/protecting-solar-cells-from-uv-light/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 22, 2023",Protecting solar cells from UV light,"Lamination and encapsulant materials play a key role in protecting PV modules’ inner workings from heat, cold, dust, damp and, somewhat ironically, from the light they are built to absorb. Ultraviolet light is a factor in several types of degradation and performance loss observed in the field, and is likely still a problem with the latest cell technologies.
For the encapsulant material itself, yellowing over long periods of exposure to light is a common problem that can cause performance loss by itself, and also reduce the level of protection against other degradation. And this was the focus of a group of scientists led by France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES), a division of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), who conducted accelerated testing on modules built with a range of different encapsulation materials.
The group fabricated single-cell modules, using heterojunction solar cells laminated at 160 degrees with five different commercially available PV encapsulant materials – two based on ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and three based on polyolefins (POE). These modules were illuminated for 4,200 h, and samples were also tested for up to 1,300 h under ultraviolet radiation and an elevated temperature, to test the effects of UV light alone.
The experiments are described in full in the paper “Solar cell UV-induced degradation or module discolouration: Between the devil and the deep yellow,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics. After testing, the modules were inspected visually and measured for fluorescence and current/voltage performance.
Results showed that the EVA encapsulant was most affected, and two of the POE samples also exhibited minor yellowing. Notably, the three samples that did have yellowing were those that contained additives designed to absorb UV light. After 4,200 h of testing, the EVA module was shown to have lost 4.2% of its initial performance.
The study concludes that UV-absorbing additives tend to degrade, affecting PV module performance over time. However, the researchers note that the protection they provide against other degradation mechanisms would likely still justify their use – as long as the solar cells they are protecting remain vulnerable to UV-induced degradation. “The destruction of UV absorbers is an issue affecting the integrity of the whole PV module and can lead to accelerated delamination, among other critical types of damage,” the researchers explain. “There is then a challenge to find new ways to bolster the photoprotection of the device, especially for the most stringent environments, such as those located in deserts.”
As for solutions to this challenge, they suggest trialing mineral-based rather than organic UV absorber materials, and also note that quantum dots may eventually become an alternate solution, though this is still in earlier stages of research. Finally, they suggest investigating UV-absorbing glass, replacing the need for encapsulant additives.

The scientists said they have added 21 new results to the new tables since December.
“The highlights are a large increase in small-area kesterite (CZTSSe) cell efficiency by the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) from 13.0% to 14.9%, with less dramatic increases in small-area organic PV cell efficiency to 19.2% by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and in small-area perovskite cell efficiency to 26.0% by the Institute of Semiconductors, CAS,” Green told pv magazine.
“Notable perovskite progress is also reported in the 2-terminal tandem cell area, with all-perovskite tandem cell efficiency increasing to 29.1% for a 0.05 cm2 device and 28.2% for a larger 1 cm2 device, with both devices fabricated by Nanjing University in collaboration with Renshine Solar,” he added.
Greener also stressed that new results are reported for perovskite/silicon tandem cells with 33.7%, for a 1-cm2 device fabricated by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and 28.6% efficiency for a much larger, full-sized 258-cm2 cell fabricated by Oxford PV.
“Good progress is also reported in the encapsulated module area, with a large increase for an organic PV module efficiency from 8.7% to 13.1% for a 57-cell module fabricated by Ways Technical Corporation in conjunction with Nanobit,” he explained. “Efficiency gain to 19.2% is also reported for a 39-cell perovskite module fabricated by UtmoLight and to 24.7% for a much larger 112-cell, 1.8m2 silicon module fabricated by Maxeon.

US-based startup Lunar Energy is releasing a residential integrated energy management cabinet system that stores solar energy on 5 kWh battery system to provide up to 30 kWh of backup power.
The company has announced the release of its first consumer hardware product, Lunar System, which is a residential distributed generation cabinet that integrates rooftop solar generation, battery storage, and load control in one product suite.
The DG cabinet by the company features the Lunar Battery, a lithium-ion battery with capacities ranging from 10 kWh to 30 kWh, in 5 kWh increments, along with a 10 kW hybrid inverter to support home HVAC systems and household appliances.
The residential cabinet can be connected to an on-site solar array and utilizes the Lunar Bridge, an electric panel monitoring system that seamlessly switches between grid and off-grid battery power within 30 milliseconds. During grid outages, the Lunar Switch prioritizes essential appliances by automatically turning off non-essential ones like EV chargers or pool pumps.
The company claims that its residential battery is 47% smaller and more compact compared to other similar batteries available in the market.
Lunar Energy stated that an average home in California could achieve a payback period of seven years by installing a 20 kWh Lunar System paired with a 5 kW solar array, given recent net energy metering changes that reduce the value of solar output. The company estimated the cost of such a configuration to be between $20,000 and $30,000.
Sunrun, the solar installation partner of Lunar Energy, announced that it will start accepting orders in the fall of 2023 to install Lunar Systems together with Sunrun solar systems. The company provided a link for installers to learn more about the Lunar System, including information on how to become a licensed installer.
In February, Sunrun and Lunar Energy partnered on a nationwide virtual power plant (VPP) network. The solar installer currently has VPP operations in New England, New York, California, Arizona, and Hawaii, with plans tens of thousands of new home distributed generation systems in additional states and territories. Before partnering, Lunar Energy had deployed 35,000 Lunar Gridshare interconnected home battery systems in Japan and 1,600 across Europe.
