Distributed batteries “offer utilities an under-utilized, flexible resource,” says a report from the United States Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Batteries that customers purchase for use during power outages, and batteries used to increase solar self-consumption, could both provide grid services at other times, the report says.
To capture the value of batteries, policymakers and utilities can “improve distributed battery storage economics” in a way that also reduces grid operating costs. That involves compensating customers so they are more likely to buy a battery and operate it in a way that provides grid services. Grid services from batteries will then reduce the need for utility-provided grid services, reducing costs for all customers.
Beyond batteries’ obvious ability to provide energy, batteries can also provide capacity, as well as grid services such as ramping support, frequency regulation, and voltage regulation, the authors note. Batteries can also reduce solar curtailment, and help defer transmission and distribution investments.
The report aims to guide decision-makers on the challenges of updating utility rate designs to “capture” the value of distributed batteries, and describes some approaches that states and utilities have taken so far.
The authors foresee greater adoption of distributed batteries as battery costs fall, and a greater ability for batteries to provide grid services with “advanced technology that enables a higher level of visibility, communication, and control.”
They point to three such technologies: smart inverters for batteries that are compliant with the IEEE 1547-2018 standard; virtual power plants that aggregate customer-sited batteries using automated controls and communication; and distributed energy resource management (DERM) systems operated by utilities.
The authors focus on the retail utility perspective. A distribution utility “typically has very little visibility of the real-time operation” of distributed resources, they say, adding that this can impair the utility’s ability to “ensure real-time reliable and safe operation of the distribution system.”
The report does not discuss sending real-time prices to smart batteries and other devices that can automatically respond to price signals. That approach was proven to work in a pilot study on a distribution circuit served by the California utility SCE, funded by the California Energy Commission. Even so, the LBL study projects that over time, “more dynamic, automated programs could become prevalent.”
In regions with a grid operator known as an ISO or RTO, grid services that batteries can provide may be priced through organized markets that “produce a transparent assessment of value,” the report says, but grid services “procured outside of organized markets must rely on avoided costs.”
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory report is titled “Opportunities and Challenges to Capturing Distributed Battery Value via Retail Utility Rates and Programs.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/12/utility-scale-ocean-battery-a-bedfellow-for-floating-pv/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NETHERLANDS",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 12, 2022","Utility scale ocean battery, a bedfellow for floating PV","Dutch start-up Ocean Grazer grabbed the limelight at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2022) in Las Vegas last week, where its new design for an offshore energy storage system based on hydro dam technology garnered the “Best of Innovation” award.
The Ocean Battery is a pumped hydro system in a box. Buried in the seabed, the battery provides storage up to the gigawatt-hour scale by connecting rigid reservoir elements, each with a storage volume of 10MWh. The system can be adapted to various forms of renewable power generation such as floating PV, offshore wind, tidal and wave energy.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

“There is a perfect match between the Ocean Battery and floating PV arrays,” Ocean Grazer CEO Frits Bliek told pv magazine. “As we can adapt the charging capacity independently from the discharging capacity, we can tune the capex [capital expenditure cost] to rapidly absorb the solar peak around noon and discharge the accumulated power of the rest of the day. In this way we can optimally tune into the business case of a floating PV array.”
The Ocean Battery features technology that has been in use at hydroelectric dams for more than a century. While it has identical functionality and performance, it comes with one big difference, as the hydrostatic pressure comes for free and there is no need to build an entire hydro dam.
In other words, the Ocean Battery stores energy by pumping water from low-pressure rigid reservoirs, each holding up to 20 million liters of freshwater, into high-pressure flexible bladders installed on the seabed. During discharging, water stored as potential energy flows back from the flexible bladder to the rigid reservoir via hydro turbines that generate electricity.
“Minimal discharging time is 0.5 hours, sufficient for the highest demands in the utility sector,” said Bliek. “Any lower power-capacity-to-storage-capacity can be created, to support bulk shifting, for example. There is no self-discharge whatsoever so power can be stored as long as you want.”
The round trip efficiency of the Ocean Battery stands at around 78%. Its technical lifetime is rated at a minimal 20 years but is most likely 30-50 years, according to its developer. Ocean Grazer said the battery has low maintenance costs and is designed with sustainability in mind, enhancing marine life. It is made from readily available global materials steel, concrete, and rubber/PVC and uses clean water as the energy carrier.
 
According to its product sheet, the Ocean Battery is able to provide a wide range of grid services including frequency control, black-start power, and energy arbitrage. In addition to the traditional services provided by utility scale storage – such as curtailment prevention and congestion management – Ocean Battery can also allow “over-planting,” to maximize the energy yield of wind farms per square kilometer, ie it can make room for more turbine capacity at the same project, improving its economics.
Developer Ocean Grazer was spun out of the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands. The start-up describes itself as “the only company that provides a reliable, affordable and eco-friendly energy storage system that provides a flexible and modular solution for offshore and inshore energy storage at [a] gigawatt-hour scale.”
Ocean Grazer is developing its first commercial demonstrator for an inshore lake in the north of the Netherlands which hosts a floating solar installation. That system is slated for completion in 2023. “Next to that we are developing an offshore project connected to a wind farm,” Bliek added. “Potentially, a floating solar installation could be included in that project but details [have to be] worked out as we are in the middle of the scoping phase. The project will be completed in 2025.”

The distinct role of “renewable” hydrogen is secured with a new definition of “low-carbon” hydrogen, while proposals to create an open and integrated hydrogen market will empower consumers and ultimately support the development of renewable hydrogen. The boost for renewable hydrogen should further encourage the development of solar and wider renewables.
In a clear benefit for solar, the EPBDII is set to support the deployment of on-site solar and storage during building renovations. Following the policy’s adoption, after negotiation through the European Parliament and European Council, newly suggested building standards are also set to favor the installation of decentralized energy resources in new buildings – notably through a zero-emission building standard. In a constructive step, we can expect a European framework to accelerate the renovation of the worst-performing buildings, with a view to reaching a zero-emission building stock by 2050. A new European-wide common template for Energy Performance Certificates should harmonize different member state approaches to energy frameworks but ultimately could do more to value the role of distributed energy sources like residential or SME solar installations. Let’s not forget that more than 90% of roofs in the EU go unused today when they could support the fight against climate change with solar installations.
Buildings are key to our daily lives and significantly impact our health and wellbeing. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints, employing heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from their construction, use, and demolition phases. In Q4 2021, pv magazine’s UP Initiative focuses on the role solar and energy storage can play in greening the world’s urban spaces. Read our Urban Solar coverage
The European Commission’s proposals on Dec. 15 came only a few hours before SolarPower Europe published its latest EU Market Outlook for Solar Power 2021-25. In stellar news, the report revealed yet another banner year for European solar – smashing 2020’s installation levels with 34% growth, equating to 25.9GW additional solar capacity for the EU. This makes 2021 the best year yet for European solar – topping a decade-long installation record from 2011. While we celebrate, we must learn from our successes and accelerate our ambitions to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.
More and more EU member states are reaching (or returning to) GW-scale annual installation levels for solar. At least two member states – Estonia and Lithuania – have already hit their National Energy and Climate Energy solar targets, with Poland, Ireland and Sweden expected to do so through 2022 – well before their 2030 deadline. In 2021, all but two of the EU27 countries grew their solar capacities more than the year before. The forecast is brighter than even the most optimistic predictions could have hoped for a few years ago – in just the most-likely Medium Scenario, the cumulative capacity of the EU solar fleet will double within four years, up to 327.6GW by 2025, and on to 672GW by 2030. We have more than reason to hope, we have a responsibility to act, and level up EU solar ambitions.
In anticipation of record-breaking solar figures in our EU Market Outlook, and more proof than ever that solar can drive the renewable transition, SolarPower Europe has launched the Yes to 45% RES campaign. Supported by eight energy and city associations, and endorsed by increasing numbers of leading scientists – including contributors to the IPCC’s recent climate crisis report – the campaign calls for the European Institutions to level up their renewables target to a minimum 45% goal for 2030. Research from global top-10 climate action institution, Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology, finds that a minimum 45% EU renewables target will set the continent on the most cost-efficient path to meet 2030 climate goals, and limit dangerous warming beyond 1.5 ⁰C. Luxembourg Minister for Energy, Claude Turmes, has backed the campaign, noting the immense role rooftop solar can play in the commercial and industrial sector.
The European solar sector forecast is nothing but bright  – cautious estimates already predict 672GW of solar installations by 2030. The necessary 45% renewables target requires 870GW cumulative capacity. With the increasing support of policymakers, and the redevelopment of European solar manufacturing (check out our new Solar PV Manufacturing Map within our EU Market Outlook), we can get there.
In 2022, the European Commission will continue its negotiations with its co-legislators on the EPDBII file, and the revised, target-setting, Renewable Energy Directive (REDIII). Through these legislative proposals, we must not miss the opportunity for solar to decarbonize European buildings or set the necessary renewables' targets we need to protect the planet. SolarPower Europe is charged and ready to work on these files and take the continent to a brighter future in 2022.

Robert Habeck has headed the newly created Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection – or BMWK, for short – since December. On Tuesday, the Green politician unveiled his “balance sheet for climate protection” and presented his plans for the coming months. “We start with a drastic deficit,” he stated in a press conference. “The previous climate protection measures are inadequate in all sectors and it is foreseeable that the climate targets for 2022 and 2023 will not be achieved.”
The new measures will be implemented through two different legislative acts. First, several provisions that could be implemented quickly will be included in what Habeck called the “Easter package,” which is expected to come in the spring and to go through the parliamentary process in the early summer. In addition, there will be a “summer package” with further measures that will then be decided by the two branches of the German parliament – the Bundestag and Bundesrat – in the second half of the year. Habeck is aiming for the necessary state aid approval by the European Commission for both climate protection laws this year.
Central to the new German government coalition, which is formed by the Social Democrats (SPD), the Green Party and the liberals (FDP), is to increase the share of renewables to 80% of gross electricity consumption by 2030. This goes hand in hand with higher targets for photovoltaics and wind power. Installed photovoltaic capacity is expected to increase by around 140-200GW by 2030. In Habeck's opening balance, a step-by-step increase in the annual expansion to 20GW, by 2028, is planned. In 2029 and 2030 it should then remain stable at 20GW per year. For the current year, the ministry is only assuming a slight increase, of around 7GW.
The minister wants to ensure a strong surge in demand for photovoltaics with a new version of the German renewable energy law, the so-called EEG. In the law amendment, which is to be made in the spring, the course is to be set for bigger volumes in tenders. “The technology-specific capacities are designed to be increasing, starting from a very ambitious level from the start,” said the minister.
But higher tender volumes alone will not be enough and solar should be unleashed with a “broad bundle of individual measures.” This includes raising the current size limits in tenders and providing more surfaces for solar parks while observing nature conservation criteria. The government has also agreed on mandatory photovoltaic systems for new commercial buildings while, for residential new buildings, the coalition wants the installation of photovoltaic systems to become the rule.
The lowering of the electricity price is also of central importance for the new federal government in order to more strongly electrify the heating and transport sectors, in particular. In the coming year, the EEG surcharge should therefore be financed through the federal budget and no longer through the electricity bills paid by consumers. The government hopes that heat pumps and electric cars will become more attractive and this should also be triggered by the Easter package.

The innovative solar tech company, founded and chaired by “Sun King” Dr. Zhengrong Shi, has touted what it calls the world’s largest production facility for lightweight solar PV.
Sunman Energy specializes in lightweight crystalline modules which use polymer composite materials instead of glass. Whereas most conventional solar panels weigh at least 20kg/m2, Sunman's eArche modules shave the weight off rooftop installations to around 5kg/m2.
The company’s latest product, the eArc SMF430F module, launched in October, is bigger than previous devices and weighs in at 11.2kg. Unlike glass modules, the eArc is akin to a flexible “solar skin” 70% lighter and up to 95% thinner than conventional products of the same wattage.
Sunman says its panels can be bonded directly to roofs, no matter their shape or curves, using structural-grade silicon, which also eliminates the risk of water penetration that can plague traditional solar mounting systems. The modules are based on standard half-cut monocrystalline PERC cells and are available in framed and non-framed versions.
Sunman founder and CEO Shi previously founded one-time giant Suntech, a company that revolutionized solar cell and module production, and acted as Suntech chairman and CEO until 2013. Before that, Shi had received a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, where he studied under scientia professor Martin Green – “the father of photovoltaics.”
Green prepared a video message of congratulations for the launch of Sunman's 1GW factory. He looked back on the company’s projects in Australia he has been involved with, including Byron Bay’s solar train and a 235kW solar installation unveiled at the Australian National Maritime Museum’s heritage center. Another showcase of Sunman technology in Australia is a 72.5kW curved-roof solar installation on the Noosaville Library in Queensland. “There is clearly a large market out there for this new product and I wish all those involved every success in the future,” Green said in the video message.
Shi told pv magazine in 2019 his company’s production capacity stood at 100MW. According to recent media reports, the 1GW factory will be commissioned in two phases, with the first already operational and the second due to come online mid-year. In addition to the production base, the facility will also incorporate R&D and testing centers and composite material production lines.

“Museon-Omniversum is a museum about important global issues, currently focusing on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals,” a spokesperson from the museum told pv magazine. “Currently we are preparing an exhibition titled ‘One Planet Now.' In a part of this exhibition in which the theme is ‘sustainable living,' the solar panels will be displayed as an experiment from the past toward a more sustainable world.”
The PQ/10/20/01 polycrystalline module measures 45.8 cm × 56.4 cm × 1 cm and is made with 20 solar cells connected in series. It has a power conversion efficiency of around 9%, an open-circuit voltage of 9V and a short-circuit current of 2A.
The product is one of 2,748 panels that were used to build a 50kW PV system linked to 18kWh of battery storage and a 40kW wind turbine at the Maritime Institute Willem Barentsz (MIWB) in Terschelling, an island in the northern Netherlands, in the West Frisian Islands archipelago.
The project was one of 17 European solar-related pilot projects that were co-financed by the European Commission in the 1979-93 period. The system was completed by Dutch engineering company Holec Projects in 1983, with the support of local consultancy Ecofys.
According to the “Solar-Wind Project Terschelling” paper, which was published in Photovoltaic Power Generation in 1983, the grid-tied project was developed to investigate the interaction with the local network and to ensure completely reliable energy delivery to consumers, while increasing the use-factor of the system.

“Our device processing method can be prepared in a large area, which will help promote its further commercialization,” the research's corresponding author, Yue Zhang, told pv magazine. The cell was built with a top donor material known as PBDB-T and an electron acceptor made of the polymer PYT. The microstructures of PBDB-T and PYT were processed through LbL processing assisted by solvent additive and thermal annealing.
“By adding a small amount of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) during the deposition of the top layer (PYT) and applying a post thermal annealing treatment on the PBDB-T/PYT active layer, the lamellar crystalline coherence length (CCL) of PBDB-T was improved significantly, and polymer fibrils were formed in the PYT phase,” the scientists explained. “Besides, BHJ-like morphology with intimate interdiffusion between PBDB-T and PYT in the vertical direction, yet favorable vertical composition distribution, has been formed in the PBDB-T/PYT film.”
According to them, this cell architecture creates the conditions for a longer exciton lifetime, improved exciton dissociation, reduced trap densities and charge recombination losses, as well as more efficient charge transport and extraction.
Tested under standard radiation conditions, the device achieved an open-circuit voltage of 0.91V, a short-circuit current of 23.07mA/cm2, a fill factor of 0.77, and a power conversion efficiency of 16.05%, which the academics described as the highest efficiency ever reported for an all-polymer solar cell based on polymerized small molecular acceptors (PSMAs).
“This study demonstrates an effective strategy to finely regulate the microstructures of the polymer donor and acceptor in all–polymer solar cells,” the academics concluded. “In combination with the intrinsic advantages in controlling vertical composition distribution and phase separation, via LbL processing, these findings suggest broader implications for the efficiency enhancement of all–polymer solar cells.”
The cell was presented in the paper “Layer-by-layer processed binary all-polymer solar cells with efficiency over 16% enabled by finely optimized morphology,” published in Nano Energy. The research group includes scientists from the South China University of Technology, the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, in Germany, and the Eindhoven University of Technology, in the Netherlands.

An announcement of the project on the website of the EU's EDFI Electrifi organization did not specify what battery storage capacity the mini-grids would have.
The mini-grids will be installed by the OnePower, U.S.-based non-profit out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and will reportedly supply power to 20,000 people and seven health centers via 7,300 new electricity connections. The panels will generate up to 3.48GWh of electricity annually, according to European finance development institution (EDFI) the Electrification Financing Initiative (Electrifi), and will generate 100 jobs during construction and six permanent roles.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
The local power networks will offer clean electricity to customers for an “almost cost-reflective tariff” of LSL5/kWh (€0.28) after PowerOne received help with its business plan from EU investment body Get.Invest.
EDFI Electrifi, which said it contributed LSL75 million (€4.23 million) to the project in a mixture of a loan and investment in PowerOne stock, said the mini-grids would be mounted on solar trackers designed and built by an unspecified company in sub-Saharan Africa, and would also feature smart meters.
The EU-funded electrification body said the Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP) backed by the U.K. government and managed by London-based financial services company Camco Clean Energy had matched its equity and loan investment in a PowerOne project the former described as “Africa's second largest project-financed mini-grid transaction.”
The EU body said the mini-grid project also received unspecified volumes of grant funding from the UN Capital Development Fund; UN Development Program; The U.S. Agency for International Development's Power Africa fund; and U.K.-government backed UK Aid. The PowerOne portfolio also received an unspecified loan from New York impact investor the Open Road Alliance, according to EDFI Electrifi, plus legal support from Chicago-based Sidley Austin and Washington DC's Covington & Burling, via the Thomson Reuters Foundation‘s TrustLaw program.
OnePower CEO Matthew Orosz also paid tribute to the assistance offered by Lesotho's Ministry of Energy and Meteorology.
EDFI Electrifi said the funding it provided built upon an earlier €100,000 loan it gave PowerOne for a feasibility study to lay the groundwork for the mini-grid scheme and added, REPP lent LSL7 million (€395,000) to the company in 2019 to fund Lesotho's first solar-battery mini-grid, which became operational last year in the village of Ha Makebe. The scale of that project was not specified.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/12/us-geothermal-lithium-offers-significant-potential/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 12, 2022",US geothermal lithium offers significant potential,"Against the backdrop of growing demand for battery production, the availability of certain materials and the environmental impact of mining them have become central to the energy transition debate throughout the world. For one of the key materials, lithium, pressure has been rising to alter extraction methods or take an entirely different approach.
Commercial lithium now comes from conventional saline salar brine and spodumene ore extractions, but efforts to retrieve lithium from geothermal brine before cycling it back into the ground are increasing in popularity, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. In a paper published in the journal Resources, Conservation & Recycling, scientists at the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have evaluated the United States’ potential to supply geothermal lithium using Systems Dynamics modeling.
Their goal was to assess the viability of US lithium supply from geothermal brines and the potential supply chain impact of extracting lithium from this source. They found that the supply of this type of lithium could reach around 60,000 tons by 2030, which would represent around 4% to 8% of total US lithium supply. By means of comparison, the country's only large-scale lithium mine, Silver Peak in Nevada, produces roughly 4,500 tons a year, which is less than 2% of the world's annual supply.
The researchers have discovered that extracting lithium from geothermal brines is economically viable. With projections of 23 million to 43 million electric vehicles on the street by 2030, lithium extraction from geothermal could generate up to $258 million to $311 million. They found that this type of lithium extraction might also offset geothermal capital costs, making electrical generation from geothermal more cost competitive.
“(This) provides not only a viable option to meet demand in the long term but also a reliable source for lithium extraction domestically,” said Ange-Lionel Toba, an INL systems modeling researcher. “The technology risk is apparent, but the upside is worth exploiting.”
The circulatory systems of geothermal power plants are a plentiful source of lithium. While producing heat and carbon-free electricity, geothermal plants extract hot, briny water that is loaded with minerals, including lithium. This salty water, or geothermal brine, is pumped to the surface and converted to a gas that turns a turbine to generate electricity. In repurposing the extracted fluids already used for electricity production as a lithium source, the environmental footprint is tiny in comparison to traditional forms of lithium extraction, including very low carbon emissions.
Earlier research led by the US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, showed that as much as 15,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate could be recovered from a single geothermal power plant in California’s Salton Sea area, the most mineral-rich brine source in the United States. There are currently 13 geothermal plants in the region and more are planned.

In May 2021, Woodside Energy revealed plans to build a utility-scale solar PV facility near Karratha, in the northwestern part of Western Australia, to help power its Pluto LNG export facility.
In documents published by Western Australia’s Environmental Protection Authority (WAEPA) this week, it can be confirmed that Woodside Energy aims to build a 500MW (AC) solar PV facility, including battery energy storage infrastructure capable of storing up to 400MWh per year. 
“Woodside Energy proposes to construct and operate the Woodside Solar Facility in the Maitland Strategic Industrial Area, located approximately 15 kilometers southwest of Karratha, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia,” says the proposal. 
The facility would cover approximately 975.6 hectares within a development envelope of 1,100.3 hectares. According to the proposal, the solar facility will see the installation of approximately 1 million solar panels, along with supporting infrastructure such as a battery energy storage system and an electrical substation. 
Woodside Energy says all transmission of power from the solar facility to customers “would be delivered via the North West Interconnected System (NWIS), through existing, upgraded, or new infrastructure constructed, owned and operated by Horizon Power for all users of the NWIS.” 
Construction of the solar facility would progress in 100MW phases, with each expected to take six to nine months. And while each constructed phase would result in CO2 emissions in the realm of 212 kilotons, the resulting green energy in the NWIS could “reduce customer electricity emissions by approximately 100 kilotons of CO2 per annum.” Those customers would be industrial customers. 
According to the The Sydney Morning Herald, the Burrup Peninsula is home to more than 1 million images carved into rocks over a period of up to 50,000 years. The area has been nominated for a World Heritage listing, due to concerns that industrial pollutants may be damaging for the art. Those industrial activities include Woodside’s North West Shelf and Pluto LNG plants, Yara’s ammonia and explosives plants, and the Dampier Port Rio Tinto uses to export its iron ore. 
The WAEPA will now review the referral. The seven-day public comment period opened on Jan. 10, with Woodside Energy hoping to commence construction later this year.

Florida Power and Light (FPL), which is owned by renewable energy powerhouse NextEra, has spent the past two years mulching the cardboard boxes and wooden pallets used to ship solar panels.. The mulch is then applied on site.
It released images were of the ongoing process at a facility in McDavid, Florida. The Cotton Creek Solar Energy Center is the company’s standard 74.5 MW (AC) facility, with an estimated 200,000 to 250,000 panels installed, translating to roughly 90 MW (DC) to 120 MW. The site manager estimated that 9,900 pallets and cardboard boxes were used to deliver the solar panels.
Generally, trash removal from a facility involves paying for rented construction dumpsters to collect the material, plus the disposal fees of the garbage that fills the dumpsters. FPL’s project manager suggested that this project offsets costs by $180,000 per site, compared to a standard trash management process.
The new process saves approximately $130,000 per site, even after accounting for the $50,000 cost of renting the grinding machine. Apply that over the company’s goal of installing 30 million modules by 2030, and the company says they expect to save close to $10 million via this technique.
The utility’s environmental team researched the specific materials in the pallets and boxes. They chose products that would be in compliance with the US Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program regulations on what can be mulched.
The company first tested the process at the Lakeside Solar Energy Center in 2019. Since then, they’ve repeated that process on 16 more sites, saving over $2 million in 2020 and 2021. The technique has become FPL’s standard disposal process for packaging.
