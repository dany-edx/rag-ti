The researchers noted that base transceiver stations (BTS) are being built for 4G and 5G broadband cellular networks. And they said that off-grid PV systems are more frequently being used to provide the energy needed by these stations in isolated areas with no connection to power networks.
The scientists considered, through 3D modeling, an electromagnetic field with an energy of less than 12 eV, and a frequency ranging up to 3.10 Hz. Its field orientation was perpendicular to the junction of the solar cells. An isotropic antenna radiating power in free space was the emitting source.
The researchers said the presence of the magnetic field initially causes an increase in the PV system's electric voltage and then makes the current produced by the solar panels decompose into two components.
“One is transferred to the external load, named the transferred current, and the other is lost in the pn junction,” they explained. “The magnetic field strength is weak, but it cannot be neglected and be deleted in the electromagnetic field produced by the BTS as assumed in some studies.”
Their analysis also showed that the variation of the electromagnetic field depends on the distance between the source and the PV system.
“In the presence of an electromagnetic field, an important current in the open circuit is created which can reach the short circuit situation current when the distance source-PV cell is weak,” the research team said, adding that the electromagnetic field is strong enough to cause an accumulation of the carrier’s charge at the junction by deflection. “That accumulation of the carrier’s charge will have an increase of the voltage as a consequence. Thus, the electric field is the main cause of the presence of the current in an open circuit situation.”
The academics said that the reported increase in the conduction current does not result in an improvement of the PV system efficiency. In turn, it causes an increase in the lost photocurrent density.
“The conduction current provides an increase of the current and contributes to the increase of the quantity of the extracted photocurrent of the solar cell,” they said. “The heating of the junction causes the quality degradation of the PV cell mainly due to the electric component.”
They said one should not install a solar power generator near an electromagnetic field emission source. They revealed their findings in “Polycrystalline Silicon PV Cell Efficiency in 3D Approximation versus Electromagnetic Field under Monochromatic Illumination,” which was recently published in International Journal of Photoenergy.

Revealing an arrangement to supply panels to New York-based energy company Convalt Energy, the press release quoted Solitek boss Julius Sakalauskas as saying that, against the backdrop of the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow: “The U.S. is looking for partners in Europe as an alternative to Chinese production.”
The Solitek statement went on to point out the majority of the company's modules are exported to European companies “as Europe [is] increasingly focused on the quality of the solar module components, the origin of the components, and production quality, while being uninclined [sic] to purchase modules from Asian manufacturers.”
Pick up the November edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
Revealing further details of the memorandum of understanding signed with Convalt, however, Solitek said the two-way arrangement would give it the option of purchasing U.S.-made semiconductors and solar cells from its transatlantic partner, “which will allow the company to diversify its essential elements and reduce its dependency on the Asian market.”
The terms of the agreement signed with Convalt – which is owned by New York-based financial services business ACO Investment Group – indicate 15 MW of Solitek panels are set to be supplied to the U.S. company in the second and third quarters of next year, “as soon as module certification is completed.” A spokesperson told pv magazine, on behalf of SoliTek, that the European manufacturer will supply panels as a bridge arrangement until Convalt has its own production facilities up and running, with the possibility of the former supplying more to the U.S. firm in future, if required to meet demand.
Convalt's LinkedIn profile states the U.S. company is developing “up to” 2 GW of solar capacity in India.
The partnership arrangement also includes plans by the two companies to develop “up to 1 GW” of solar and wind power generation capacity in Lithuania.
Solitek CEO Sakalauskas used the press statement to call for more “stable support” for Lithuanian renewables. “In Lithuania, households can use … government support for the installation of solar panels,” said the chief executive, “but in 2021 the financing mechanism was very unstable.”
The Baltic business, which last year completed the protracted sale of a module production fab in Vilnius to Finnish company Valoe, said it is planning to raise its annual solar module production capacity from 100 MW to 170 MW next year on the back of sales which more than doubled to Finland in the summer, rose 25% in Sweden, and were up 13% in Norway.

The plant has been described as “the first operational large scale solar wheeling project” in South Africa.
South Africa-owned SOLA – in which mining and football magnate Patrice Motsepe‘s African Rainbow Energy and Power business holds a 40% stake – on Friday said it had installed more than 24,000 bifacial, single-axis tracker mounted solar panels across a 20ha site on the Northern Cape.
Trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather and more will be discussed tomorrow at pv magazine‘s virtual Roundtables USA 2021 event. Join us as solar experts discuss the big issues. For more information and to register free for the event, click here.
The solar project, which the developer said will generate 28 GWh of clean power annually, will transfer electricity using the grid of national utility Eskom. The South African unit of the Amazon Web Services, cloud computing arm of the U.S. retail titan will buy the solar energy generated.
Cape Town-based SOLA did not reveal the price Amazon has agreed to pay under the corporate power purchase agreement, nor the rate of any wheeling charges which will be applied by financially troubled Eskom, for the use of its electricity transmission network.
The solar project is more than 63% Black owned and its shareholders include the Black women-owned Johannesburg investment and advisory firm Mahlako a Phahla Investments.
The developer, in a press release issued on Friday, praised the assistance offered by South Africa's Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, Eskom, and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, in getting the nation's first solar wheeling project up and running.
SOLA added, the 10 MW solar project created 167 jobs in its construction phase – 63% of which went to locals – and waste wood, from items such as pallets and electrical cable drums, was donated to nearby furniture businesses.

Most of the highest-performing perovskite solar cells produced by researchers to date have been fabricated using spin coating, which is difficult to apply to larger surface areas. Other solution-based techniques such as inkjet printing, blade coating and slot-die coating have strong potential for low cost, high throughput manufacturing, but also tend to see high-performance losses as the device area increases. Many are investigating controlling these processes via additives to the precursor materials, but other routes could also be possible.
Scientists led by the Karlsruher Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany investigated vapor-based deposition techniques for deposition of the cell layers, along with laser scribing for cell interconnections – both of which are established processes used in the production of other thin-film solar cells – CIGS or CdTe for example.
The group claims its work represents the first time these two techniques have been investigated in combination for a perovskite PV module, and demonstrates some encouraging results: They fabricated a 4cm² device that achieved 18% efficiency, and scaled this up to 51cm², reaching 16.6% efficiency.
The techniques are described in full in the paper Upscaling of perovskite solar modules: The synergy of fully evaporated layer fabrication and all-laser-scribed interconnections, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. “The comparison of the achieved upscaling losses of only 3.1% (relative efficiency)/dec of upscaled area with other upscaling approaches as well as established thin-film PV technologies like CIGS, c-Si, and CdTe highlights the excellent upscaling efficiency of the developed process,” says the group.
They note that while initial efficiencies for perovskite cells fabricated with vapor-based deposition are lower than for solution-based, the vapor processing has lower losses associated with the increase in area. And regarding the laser processed interconnections, the results were achieved using a 532 nanosecond laser already suitable and established for industrial use, while other studies have relied on much more expensive and complex short-duration lasers.

The Thor charging station is available as both AC and DC chargers.
The AC products are the Thor 03/07AS–S and 03/07AS–P chargers, which have an output of 3 and 7 kW, respectively, and a charging time of about 7-15 hours; and the Thor 11/22AS–S and Thor 11/22AS–P stations, which feature both a nominal power of 11-22 kW and a charging time of between one and four hours.
The DC chargers are the 750 V(DC) Thor 40DD–P and Thor 40DS–P stations, both with charging times of about one to two hours. All charges integrate the company's internet-of-things (IoT) “GroHome” technology, which Growatt says allows remote control, multi-zone control, voice control, and smart scheduling. Users are reportedly able to monitor the system through a dedicated app called “ShinePhone.”
All systems are compatible with all branded electric vehicles and PV modules, the manufacturer said.
“Thor supports three different charging modes — Fast Mode, Off-Peak Mode and PV Linkage Mode,” the manufacturer explained. “With Fast Mode, the EVs can be charged with maximum speed, while Off-Peak Mode allows users to charge their EVs during off-peak hours, with less charges from the grid.”
With fast mode and off-peak mode, the charger can be powered by surplus solar power and the grid, and under these two modes, it doesn't require the surplus solar power to be greater than minimum operational power. This is, however, required under PV Linkage Mode.
“Thor’s advanced, built-in, type A+ 6 mA DC fault protection saves the cost of installing an extra 6 mA DC RCD, while its smart load balancing function can adjust its charging power dynamically according to the limited home power, and avoid breaking the fuse and causing [a] power outage, making it safe to use for customers,” Growatt added.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA), the Indian presidency of the ISA, and the U.K. COP presidency unveiled plans for the first transnational network of solar power grids last week at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
The global super-grid project, known as the Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG) initiative, aims to harness solar energy wherever the sun is shining. It is spearheaded by the Indian and U.K. governments of India and implemented by the ISA, in partnership with the World Bank Group.
Under the plans released in Glasgow, the ISA plans to push for a network of interconnected green grids in the years ahead. As part of its first phase, the project will drive interconnectivity across the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia. The second will focus on African power pools, while the third will drive global green grid interconnections.
The GGI-OSOWOG plan announcement was accompanied by the One Sun declaration endorsed by 80 ISA member countries.
“Realizing the vision of One Sun One World One Grid through interconnected green grids can be transformational, enabling all of us to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement to prevent dangerous climate change, to accelerate the clean energy transition, and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,” it stated. “These efforts can stimulate green investments and create millions of good jobs. By sharing the sun’s energy, we can help to build a more peaceful and prosperous world.”
The GGI-OSOWOG initiative will bring together a global coalition of national governments, international financial and technical organizations, legislators, power system operators, and knowledge leaders to accelerate the construction of the new infrastructure needed for a world powered by clean energy. In doing so, the project aims to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy such as coal by enabling them to purchase affordable solar power from other countries.
As the chief agency leading and delivering the project, ISA aims to help mobilize $1 trillion of funding by 2030 to assist developing countries in expanding their solar power grids to meet their energy access, energy security, and energy transition needs. The initiative is widely seen as a big and bold move ahead on the ISA’s solar transition roadmap and will go some way towards realizing its vision for a solar energy future.
The global grid concept was first announced by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2018 during the first assembly of the ISA. In May 2021, the United Kingdom pledged technical, financial, and research support for the OSOWOG project.
The ISA, launched at COP21 in Paris, recently expanded its membership scope to include all UN member states. There are 90 signatories and 193 prospective members. The ISA provides a dedicated platform for cooperation, through which the global community, including governments, bilateral and multilateral organizations, corporates, industry, and other stakeholders, can contribute to help achieve the common goal of increasing the use and quality of solar energy in meeting energy needs of prospective ISA member countries in a safe, convenient, affordable, equitable and sustainable manner.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/08/solar-tile-with-anti-glare-coating-from-switzerland/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"NOVEMBER 8, 2021",Solar tile with anti-glare coating from Switzerland,"From pv magazine Germany
Swiss manufacturer Megasol launched, last year, a photovoltaic tile that is claimed to be compatible with a wide range of roof tiles.
Megasol is offering three standard formats that can be combined with one another, as required. “Compatible means that a ‘Match' solar module can replace one or more tiles in an existing tiled roof without any further adjustments,” explained Michael Reist, marketing manager at Megasol, to pv magazine.
The solar tile is not only compatible with the most common roof tiles, it is also available in different colors. The Full Black and Terra Cotta variants have proven to be popular optics and other individual colors could also be created. According to the manufacturer, the photovoltaic roof tiles could be freely designed for any architecture.
“It is also possible to give the Match solar modules an individual look using glass structures,” Reist explained. “Classic solar glasses or, for example, the Creek, Diamond, River or Wave glass surfaces can be used.” For this, Megasol was also awarded the international Red Dot Award design prize this year.
The photovoltaic roof tile is also suitable for various roof shapes. In addition to being used on tiled roofs, it can also be combined with clapboard-like roofs such as fiber cement shingles.
One reason why photovoltaic roof tiles are still more of a niche product is that their energy conversion performance is rather lower and, at the same time, they have higher costs compared to conventional rooftop panels. But technological advances do not stop at solar roof tiles either. According to Megasol, Match consists of glass-glass modules which also work as the roof tiles. The product works without an aluminum frame or plastic housing. Since there are several standard formats for each type of tile, the performance of the photovoltaic roof tiles also varies accordingly. According to Megasol, the two standard products have a power output of 22 and 55 W and its most-power product reaches 99 W. With the colored variations, performance losses are normal, but these also showed “good performance values,” the manufacturer continues.
In addition, the photovoltaic roof tiles have a high load-bearing capacity and resistance to hail protection. The Swiss photovoltaic manufacturer assumes a service life of up to 50 years and offers guarantees for up to 35 years.
The system consists of two components: the glass-glass solar module and a mounting hook. According to Megasol, the photovoltaic roof tile is also suitable for integration into existing tile roofs and the existing roof battens can be used. Each individual module has a plus and minus connector. With the long cables, the photovoltaic roof tile Match can be wired both horizontally and vertically, as the provider explained. The simple structure also allows a simple replacement if a photovoltaic roof tile is damaged.
The watt-peak prices for in-roof solar modules are higher than those of conventional panels but, at the same time, the photovoltaic tile also has a roof function. “With Match, not only a photovoltaic system but also a new roof is installed,” Reist went on to say. “If the costs for a new roof covering are deducted from a Match roof, the result is more or less the costs of a rooftop PV system.” If the longer service life of the glass-glass solar modules is also taken into account, compared to the use of glass-foil solar modules in conventional roof systems, the costs for a Match system over the operating time could be even cheaper.
In the recent past, Megasol has taken on yet another topic which is a big issue for many operators of photovoltaic systems – or rather their neighbors: the glare effect of solar modules. Objectively speaking, the actual glare effect of solar modules is significantly lower than that of large window fronts or skylights, according to the Swiss photovoltaic manufacturer, due to the solar glass used. However, the subjective perception of glare effects caused by solar modules is sometimes different. This is why the manufacturer developed the ZeroReflect surface which is claimed to have zero glare.
Megasol developed this special surface coating independently of its photovoltaic roof tiles. “Existing solar systems can also be equipped with ZeroReflect. The costs incurred can be many times lower than the potential expenses for anti-glare reports, court hearings, or even just for lengthy discussions in a possible neighborhood dispute,” said Reist.
*The article was amended on November 8 to reflect that the manufacturer's name is Megasol, and not Megasolar as we previously reported.

Automated cleaning robot systems for solar panels are costly and also threaten human employment in the operation phase of a solar project. An engineer in India has developed a handheld drycleaning tool that is cost-effective and can be operated easily by unskilled labor with little training. 
“The panel cleaning tool runs on a 12V, 20Ah lithium battery that provides enough power to run the motor for 6 to 8 hours on a single charge and clean around 800 solar panels daily without water,” tool developer, Hariram Sharma, told pv magazine. 
As the tool is manually operated, it can be used in any type of solar project, whether rooftop or ground-mounted. 
The tool weighs less than 3 kg. It is equipped with a 12V permanent magnet DC motor with over 200 revolutions per minute (RPM). The brushes are made of 340gsm soft-spun microfiber cloth to safely clean the panels.

Wind events affect solar power projects. Case in point: In New England, at least one solar power project felt the effects of a major wind event in late October.
On the night of Oct. 26 and into the morning of Oct. 27, New England experienced a Nor’easter weather event, the season’s first. Gusts across the eastern coast of Massachusetts topped hurricane strength. According to utility companies, more than 500,000 electricity accounts lost power in the state during the storm. Those accounts were concentrated on the Atlantic coast, with large swaths of the region showing 50% to 100% of accounts without power from the Cape Cop region to just south of Boston.
Each account represents one electric meter, which typically supplies power to several or more people. In the adjacent map, black represents 90% to 100% of accounts without power, red is 50% to 90%, and brown/orange is 20% to 50% without power.
While supporting one of our electrician’s operations and maintenance contracts, my team and I were asked to visit a site within a heavily impacted wind region. A segment of the project was signaling that strings of solar panels were not connected to the inverter. Upon arrival, we found multiple, distantly located rows of solar panels were flipped, and at least one solar panel flew 100 feet from its original location.
Additionally, an edge of the thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) roof, which had been securely nailed to sides and edges of the building on its north and northeast sides, had been torn away and flipped over the edges of the building back onto the roof. And, a sinister looking 60-foot line of nails pointed up through the layers of TPO.
In total, fewer than 40 of the 4,000 solar panels were affected. The electrical and mechanical teams were able to take pictures of the affected hardware, move them back to their original positions, reattach all components, and fully repower the system. Ongoing testing will determine if any solar panels will need to be replaced.
Happily, it does seem that only minimal damage occurred.
A few miles away, this author’s team was installing around 186 kW of solar panels on a very exposed rooftop. The hardware – solar panels, racking components, and ballast blocks – all was palletized and thus very heavy. Other than a garbage can used by the electrical team, none of the hardware shifted.
Arguably, three separate events occurred on the site. The first two occurred to two different rows of solar panels located in fundamentally different wind risk areas of the project. The third event affected the roofing material, which was torn up along the corner of the building and was located away from the affected rows of panels.
This author was not the developer of the project and doesn’t know the specific wind code this project was designed for. But regional wind codes in the area have a minimum of 110 mile per hour uplift requirements. The peak winds measured in this area were in the 80 to 90 miles per hour range.
One could speculate that since the wind tore the roofing material upward from the northeast corner of the structure, and that the building itself sits among several other large industrial buildings, then perhaps a complex interaction between southwestern blowing storm winds greatly increased as they were bent upward by the immovable, 1800s-era multiple story brick structure.
The main thing to look for in a ballasted solar power installation is to understand if the proper amount of ballast has been deployed. This ballast – literally engineered bricks of a certain weight – is what holds the solar power project down against winds. The racking company will do a wind analysis based on site feedback from the solar developer and engineering teams, and specify via a professional engineer-stamped drawing the weight of the ballast that must be used.
After the Nor'easter and while walking the site where the damage occurred, I saw that every solar panel and racking piece had multiple pieces of ballast in place. My quick observation did not provide enough information, however, to know if enough ballast was there.
If it turns out there was enough ballast in place for a standard roof analysis, then it may just be that a standard roofing analysis wasn’t enough. For example, I have never seen a multi-building air flow wind analysis on any projects my company has built for commercial and industrial rooftop customers.
As we increasingly build in environments where complex winds blow, we may well need to step up our engineering and design practices.

In the context of COP26's achievements so far, a moonshot is called for, and one Australian company is calling it. Behind the scenes of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference, eleXsys Energy is agitating for businesses and municipalities to Just Look Up for a simple solution to the huge problem of global warming. It’s positing that if 50% of all global rooftops hosted solar, their combined output could provide 100% of the world’s current electricity needs.
What the world doesn’t yet fully understand, says Richard Romanowski, executive director and co-founder of eleXsys Energy's combined hardware and software solution, is that the problem of connecting huge amounts of variable solar and wind generation to the grid can be solved by taking renewables-powered commercial enterprises, villages and regional towns off the grid. This allows them to sell services and energy back into the network, as required, via participation in wholesale energy markets.
Licensed in its home country to Planet Ark Power, eleXsys Energy is in the process of installing 1.9 MW of solar generation on the rooftop and car park of the Adelaide Airport IKEA store in South Australia, alongside a 3.36 MW/3.45MWh lithium battery supplied by CATL and the unique eleXsys Energy management system. The flagship for hundreds more such C&I installations, the IKEA microgrid will allow the homewares megastore to be 100% powered by onsite renewables by 2025, while reducing its energy costs by a forecast 25%.
In addition, the eleXsys control platform has allowed a system more than 10 times the accepted “safe” size for grid interaction to be connected in solar-rich South Australia, which leads the world in addressing the problems associated with renewable-energy exports.
For regional towns that link rooftop solar on businesses, community buildings and residences to grid-scale storage, an eleXsis-managed microgrid will supply cheap electricity that lowers the cost of doing business, provides a sustainable point of difference to the locality’s products and produce, and helps new enterprises thrive.
“When you take a village or a small city that is struggling and give it clean, cheap energy, it can start new businesses, integrate vertical farming, it sparks a whole range of different things that will grow a community rather than having it slowly diminish,” says Romanowski.
EleXsys, says Romanowski, solves the problem of backward flow of energy from distributed generators – utility scale and small scale – destabilizing electricity grid voltages.
The compact, scalable hardware device is controlled by AI-based software to deliver services previously provided by deploying multiple devices. It is a grid-forming inverter, a battery charger and speed controller with power-factor correction capabilities – call it a dSTATCOM, or a distribution static synchronous compensator. Developed over several years by former energy utility engineer Bevan Holcombe, and brought to market by clean-energy entrepreneur Romanowski, eleXsys Energy has solved the problem of solar curtailment. But another crucial part of its appeal is that it enables an investable solar-powered business model.
In the context of commercial and industrial transition to solar in particular, it allows the the entire solar-generation, storage and market-participation ecosystem to be independently owned by an entity paying rent to the property/building owner, then selling the world’s cheapest electricity (without added network costs) to the building tenant(s) or owner, and making money by providing services to the grid.
The IKEA project, for example, is owned by a superannuation fund, “and the reason they’ve invested is because with eleXsys they get a 20-year secure income stream,” Romanowski tells pv magazine Australia.
