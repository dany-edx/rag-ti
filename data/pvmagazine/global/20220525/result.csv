The latest selection of public sector decarbonization projects across England and Scotland, updated this week, includes solar in around GBP 262 million ($328 million) worth of plans. Solar panels in the projects are typically included alongside air and ground-source heat pumps, which are replacing fossil-fuel-powered heating systems.
Phase 3a of the government funding program includes plans for solar on fire stations, police buildings, the National Football Museum in Manchester, and a nuclear decommissioning site at Sellafield, in northwestern England.
Other solar-related plans will be funded at a tennis center, a market, on buildings owned by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, above car parking spaces, and on aircraft hangars. The list also includes schools, hospitals, community centers, biomass boilers, water source heat pumps, solar thermal technology, and a ground-mounted solar site on a disused school sports court in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.
The Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, London, secured GBP 4.48 million for a project that includes installing solar on its Jodrell laboratory, which includes the UK's National Mycology Archive.
The grants range in size from GBP 21,000 for an air source heat pump to replace a kerosene boiler at Berkshire College of Agriculture to GBP 71.9 million for Nottingham Hospitals NHS Trust, for water and air source heat pumps at two hospitals.
None of the three awards for Scotland included solar.
The UK government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy published the list.

Green Gravity is turning to the former cornerstone of Australia’s wealth, coal mining, to remove the final hurdle for a fully renewable electricity system. It is proposing to lift and release ultra-heavy weights in legacy mine shafts, in a reimagining of how the universal force of attraction, gravity, can be used to store renewable energy.
While the hyped Swiss startup Energy Vault recently hit rocky waters, Green Gravity CEO Mark Swinnerton is adamant that his company has distinct merits, many of which stem from the fact that its concept is rooted in redeploying abandoned but very abundant infrastructure. In recent weeks, Green Gravity secured AUD 1.4 million in its first formal fundraising round with a range of private investors, “with plenty of surplus interest,” Swinnerton told pv magazine Australia.“We are working toward a larger raise in a few months time when we firm up the capital cost for the demonstration plant.”
Swinnerton added that he has been engaging with bigger funds and received strong interest. It's notable that Energy Vault attracted investment from Leonardo DiCaprio, among other big names.
Green Gravity’s new team has also launched studies of its supply chain and manufacturing footprint. This is something Swinnerton, who spent almost two decades at mining giant BHP, insists will be far easier than with other storage solutions.
“We don’t have to go and mine the lithium, or process it with new systems, we don’t have the recycle the chemicals because we don’t have any chemicals,” said Swinnerton. “People ask sometimes, ‘why suddenly are you able to find something so simple and yet it’s an open market?’ and my answer is, ‘it’s really because it’s never been needed before.' The only reason it’s needed now is because renewable penetration has increased past an inflection point where now all of a sudden natural hedging doesn’t work in the market, you need more storage assets.”
Tech proposition
Green Gravity’s technology is flexible in two keys ways, according to Swinnerton.
“The first one is the power of the system is associated with how fast we move the weights through the mine shafts. Of course a motor can go at different speeds, therefore we can elect to change the duration and ratings of that dynamically, if we need to,” he said. “Which is unusual – most energy systems can’t change their duration dynamically.”
How the company plans to be do this is using advanced software and artificial intelligence (AI).
“What we’re going to be doing is move multiple objects around without being able to see them. So the AI is going to be able to help improve the responsiveness of the sensing systems, to be able to learn how to optimize the movement, and how to better respond to the needs of electricity grid in real time to be able to learn how to make our system match and support the grid,” Swinnerton said. “We’re looking at models that can provide inertia potentially, we’re looking at models which can certainly play in the grid stability and the variety of frequency and voltage markets. We’re also designed to have multiple durations and we think these deep mine shafts [which can be double the height of the Sydney tower in depth] have a real opportunity for mid- or long-duration storage.”
Green Gravity is ultimately seeking to bring a range of storage products to market. The first, Swinnerton said, will offer between two to three hours of duration, but he says there’s potential for shorter duration which focuses on grid support as well as a long duration model. The second realm where Green Gravity can offer flexibility, Swinnerton says, comes back to the infrastructure it will be using.
“Because we can use infrastructure that is already there, we can get a very low cost footprint,” he said. “We can attach the capacity in at similar unit costs to pumped hydro, but for a lot less capital. So you don’t have to pay AUD 700 million dollars like you do in some of the big pumped schemes. You just say, ‘well, we’ll pay AUD 30 million’. You’ll get less energy, but you’ll get a similar unit cost outcome to the pumped hydro and there’s lots of them.”
That is to say, Green Gravity isn’t seeking to do one big project, but rather lots of littler ones – a model which lowers risks and affords greater financing flexibility. Which brings us to another important facet of the proposition: Australia is littered with mine shafts. “Australia’s mining history was everywhere,” Swinnerton said.
The company has discovered at least 3 GWh of potential storage capacity from the 175 sites it has assessed and found to be suitable. “I can guarantee you unequivocally that there is more than that available – and that’s just in Australia. There are many, many gigawatt-hours that are up for grabs in the rest of the world that Australia should be looking at,” said Swinnerton.
He added that he thinks the Green Gravity’s concept will also offer legacy mine sites a valuable exchange, providing them with an income stream to fund their rehabilitation.
Again, this is a fairly straightforward concept: Green Gravity would come in and reuse the site’s shafts and possibly other infrastructure, providing mines which are no longer selling product with a constant trickle of cash to restore the sites. This would be especially useful for mine sites owned by government, for which taxpayers need to foot the rehab bill.
Australia's recent ‘greenslide’ federal election, coupled with the ongoing fight to secure battery materials, has only boosted Green Gravity’s prospects, according to Swinnerton. “I think there is a real chance of an acceleration and am certainly keen to engage with the incoming government around this point,” he said.
The company is now in the final stages of settling a significant operating partnership, with an announcement anticipated in the coming weeks.

The solar facility, which is Romania's first and largest project developed for pure self-consumption, will exclusively power the operations of the factory and cover around 20% of its electricity demand.
“In a dynamic and volatile energy market, the production of electricity from renewable sources on the customer's site is a sustainable solution, which provides predictability on costs and, at the same time, a significant reduction in the carbon footprint,” Engie said.
The Romanian government introduced new rules for bilateral power purchase agreements last year.

The funds were taken from the country's National Recovery Plan to reduce energy dependence on Russia, the government said in a statement. A call to select eligible projects has been launched and applications may be sent by Aug. 31. Solar-plus-storage projects will also be able to participate.
The rebate for solar installations will not exceed 35%. The rebate for storage systems will not be higher than 50%.
The ministry said that it had registered 1,760 applications by May 20, for a total budget of CZK 2.9 billion. The projects all related to the previous program's call, which was launched in March 2021. 
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Czechia had 2,119 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2021 – 4 MW less than it had at the end of 2020. The nation has also provided incentives for rooftop PV through a Green Savings Program and for solar-plus-storage projects via a separate, dedicated scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/25/ja-solar-introduces-n-type-solar-panel-with-22-4-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",VINCENT SHAW,"MAY 25, 2022",JA Solar introduces n-type solar panel with 22.4% efficiency,"JA Solar has launched its first solar module series based on n-type wafers.
“The DeepBlue 4.0 X Panel is based on low-oxygen n-type wafers with 182 mm size. We utilized a self-developed bifacial solar cell with optimized passivation and contact technologies,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The  DeepBlue 4.0 X panels are available in three different versions, with 54, 72 and 78 cells. The smallest product has a power output of 435 W and a power conversion efficiency of 22.3%. It measures 1,134 mm x 1,722 mm x 30 mm and weighs 21.5 kg. The mid-sized panel measures 1,134 mm x 2,278 mm x 35 mm and weighs in at 31.8 kg. Its efficiency rating is 22.3% and its power output is 575 W.
The largest module measures 1,134 mm x 2,465 mm x 35 mm and weighs 33.4 kg, with efficiency and nominal power levels of 22.4% and 625 W, respectively.
“The smallest panel is for residential PV and the larger two are for C&I and utility scale PV plants,” the spokesperson said.
All three panels operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius. They come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty, with minimum annual degradation of 0.4% per year.
The modules were encapsulated with round welding and a specially designed cushion, which the manufacturer ensures minimizes cell gaps close to zero while increasing efficiency by 0.2%.
“Our n-type panel shows a bifaciality of 80%, which is much higher than 70% for p-type PERC products,” the spokesperson said. “A PVsyst simulation showed it achieves 0.9% more power generation due to this factor.”
JA Solar said that mass production of DeepBlue 4.0 X will start in the third quarter of 2022. The total production capacity preserved for this new product will be 6.5 GW by end of 2022 and 15 GW more in 2023.

That is a headline finding by researchers at Danish and German universities, who said the continent annually needs 400 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity from 2025 to 2035.
Academics from Denmark's Aarhus University modeled the European energy system's route to net-zero – and to limiting global temperature rises this century to 1.5 C – with the help of colleagues from Technische Universität Berlin. The findings were published last week in Joule, and highlighted on the EurekAlert science website.
The electricity grid will need strengthening to host the flood of intermittently generating renewables needed, according to the research. Power-to-X technology, including green hydrogen production, will also be needed to power hard-to-abate industries, aviation, shipping and freight transport. Clean hydrogen will be required to help even out power supply from solar and wind farms.
To date, Europe's record for new annual solar and wind generation capacity is 50 GW, according to the paper's authors. The researchers said raising the maximum temperature rise this century to 2 C would require less annual renewables capacity, but would be more costly once the effects of worsened climate change were factored in.
The modeling was performed with the Prime computing cluster at Aarhus University.

Of the 100 Italian PV installers it interviewed, only one said they had no plans to also offer energy storage systems.
Some 89 respondents said they offered energy storage, up from 64% last year, with 10 installers saying they intended to offer storage products this year. EUPD Research said this week that 45 of the Italian respondents also offered electric mobility-related products.
The market data company quoted figures from trade body Italia Solare, which indicated 431 MWh of energy storage capacity was sold in Italy last year, up from 112 MWh in 2020. The data company said Italy added around 1 GW of solar generation capacity last year to reach 22.6 GW.
EUPD Research said the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto encouraged energy storage sales with funding schemes. In Italy, rooftop PV is incentivized by net billing and a 110% “superbonus” tax deduction for some types of building renovation. Net billing enables electricity generators to deduct the value of power they feed into the grid from their final electricity bill, with the exported electricity holding a lower value.

The Chinese-Canadian manufacturer and developer had said in its third-quarter update last year that no new wafer and cell production lines would be added this year.
The Ontario-headquartered company's first-quarter update, however, saw Chairman and CEO Shawn Qu announce “an acceleration of our upstream capacity expansion plan for 2022.” The CSI Solar manufacturing business, due to be spun out with an initial public offering in China, will now aim to reach 20 GW of annual wafer production capacity this year, up from 11.5 GW currently, and 19.8 GW of cell output, up from 13.9 GW.
With the company's 23.9 GW of annual module production capacity due to rise from the current 23.9 GW to 27.9 GW, in June, the target of reaching 32 GW this year remains unchanged. The effect of rising input costs – specifically polysilicon price inflation cited by CSI Solar President Yan Zhuang – was spelled out in the latest update.
First-quarter net income of $9 million was down from $26 million in the previous window, and $23 million in the first three months of last year. Zhuang said Canadian Solar partially mitigated the rise by raising its own prices and also stockpiled inventories of raw material to hedge against inflation.
During the first quarter, “logistic[s] costs started to come down,” the CSI Solar chief said, with currencies “starting to move in our favor after two years of headwinds.” The company banked a currency gain of $3 million in January to March, up from $1 million in the fourth quarter of last year and a loss of $7 million a year earlier.
Qu said currency gains and bigger sales would help the company to $7 billion to $7.5 billion of revenue this year. The quarterly figures were also helped by a Canadian tax refund which contributed to a three-month tax benefit of $5 million. Total debt rose from $2.5 billion at the end of 2021 to $2.7 billion at the end of March.
Canadian Solar's Global Energy project development business booked a first-quarter net loss of $1 million, down from a $14.7 million loss in the previous quarter and an $85 million profit a year earlier. CSI Solar contributed a $31.9 million quarterly profit, down from $81.6 million, quarter over quarter, but up from a $52.7 million loss a year earlier.
The manufacturer shipped 3.63 GW of panels in the first three months of the year. Canadian Solar expects to ship 4.9 GW to 5.1 GW of modules in the current window for 20 GW to 22 GW this year.
The company owns 800 MWp of solar generation capacity and wants 1.3 GWp in 2026. Global Energy has 1.1 GWp of projects under construction and another 4.2 GWp due to be built within four years, with an emphasis on Latin America.
North America is the focus of the company's energy storage projects at present. The company expects revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion in the current quarter, at gross margin of 14.5% to 15.5%.
Canadian Solar expects to sell 2.1 GW to 2.6 GW of project capacity this year. It plans to install 1.8 GWh to 1.9 GWh of battery storage capacity.
