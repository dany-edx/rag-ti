Contractor Visser & Smit Hanab will build the first section of the national grid. From 2030, the national hydrogen network, which will cost around €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) to build, will connect major industrial areas across the country, as well as points in Germany and Belgium. Last year, the Dutch government contracted Gasunie to develop the hydrogen network. The first section, stretching over 30 kilometers, will be built in Rotterdam and will connect the Tweede Maasvlakte industrial park to Pernis. It is expected to be operational in 2025. Around 85% of the Dutch hydrogen network will feature repurposed natural gas pipelines.
Fortescue has invested close to NOK 100 million ($8.96 million) to acquire a 12.5% stake in Norwegian Hydrogen, making it the third largest shareholder. Norwegian Hydrogen is now building its first hydrogen plants in Hellesylt, Norway, and in Hjørring, Denmark.
ABB has supplied low-harmonic insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) rectifiers and DC-DC converters for the HyPilot project to achieve precise voltage and current control for simulating different operating regimes. This project aims to demonstrate Hystar's 1MW containerized PEM electrolyzers and validate their patented technology in real field conditions. The demonstration will conclude by the end of 2023 at the Kårstø Gas Processing Plant in Rogaland, Norway, with ABB collaborating alongside Equinor, Yara, and Gassco.
Germany has started talks with Nigeria to import hydrogen. “Germany has a considerable demand for natural gas and, going forward, hydrogen to fuel its economy and energy transition,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a recent interview with Nigerian daily The Punch. “Concrete amounts should be agreed on in negotiations between Nigerian gas producers and German gas traders.” At a recent press conference, Scholz noted that Germany operates a hydrogen office in Nigeria and wants to support renewable energy expansion in the African country.
Duke Energy has announced plans to build and operate the first system in the United States to produce, store, and combust 100% green hydrogen in a combustion turbine. The system is the result of collaboration between Duke Energy, Sargent and Lundy, and GE Vernova. It will be located at Duke Energy Florida's DeBary plant in Volusia County, Florida. The end-to-end system will begin with the existing 74.5 MW DeBary solar plant, providing clean energy for two 1 MW electrolyzer units.

It said it will delay the launch of production until the second quarter of 2024, from its original year-end 2023 target, due to a “critical assessment and synthesis.”
JinkoSolar said its third-quarter report shows a 61.3% year-on-year increase in sales revenue to CNY 85 billion ($11.8 billion). Profits attributable to shareholders rose by 279% to CNY 6.4 billion, and PV product shipments reached 55.7 GW from January to September, with PV modules accounting for 52.2 GW of the total. Its total PV product shipments were 86.9% higher than they were in the same period of 2022, with N-type products accounting for 53.5%.

The scientists optimized a perovskite solar cell using SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent. The cell features a hole transport layer (HTL) of copper and antimony trisulfide (CuSbS2). It also has various electron transport layer (ETL) configurations, including indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), zinc oxide (ZnO), CeOx, tungsten disulfide (WS2), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and cadmium telluride (CdTe).
The researchers fine-tuned the cell by analyzing factors such as thickness, carrier density, defect density, bandgap, temperature, and resistance.
The optimized cell used a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a ZnO ETL, and achieved a 26.96% efficiency with an open-circuit voltage of 1.0478 V, 31.6486 mA/cm2 short-circuit density, and an 81.35% fill factor under standard illumination.
“Results also indicate that the IGZO and CeOx are showing a similar performance as compared to ZnO,” the scientists said in the paper, adding that the ideal energy bandgap of the perovskite absorber layer was 1.4 V. “Due to its decreased ability to absorb sunlight, a device with an absorber bandgap that is larger or lower than the optimal value of 1.4 eV is undesirable for solar cell applications.”
They described the new cell design in “Numerical investigation of lead free Cs2TiBr6 based perovskite solar cell with optimal selection of electron and hole transport layer through SCAPS-1D simulation,” which was recently published in Results in Optics.
“It is expected that this study's results will play a role in the development of reliable and highly efficient PSCs that are free from the use of lead or any other type of toxic materials,” the paper concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/31/transformer-shortages-new-bottleneck-of-the-energy-storage-supply-chain/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 31, 2023",Transformer shortages: New bottleneck of the energy storage supply chain,"While the BESS supply chain has stabilized in terms of prices and supply of raw materials, lead times for certain components, such as transformers, have greatly extended.
“While global battery supply eased in 2023, after experiencing tightness in supply the previous year, the limited supply of transformers has become the new bottleneck of the energy storage supply chain,” says Kevin Shang, a senior research analyst in Wood Mackenzie.
Transformers are critically important as they enable the BESS connection at all grid levels by stepping up the output voltage to the same level as the grid voltage. Presently, the global transformer market is observing shortages and subsequent increases in prices, mainly due to increased raw material demand, pandemic-related shortages and backlogs, labor constraints, shipping issues, and geopolitical tensions. In some parts of the world, the shortages are acute.
“We have seen a significantly tight supply of transformers in the US and European markets. The prices of transformers used to trend with metal prices. Nowadays, the prices of transformers are more driven up by demand and the industry will have to pay whatever is needed,” Shang tells pv magazine.
According to Shang, there is a minimum lead time of more than one year for transformers of all sizes. “This has a direct impact on system integrators as transformers are integral for grid connection,” Shang says.
In 2022, the global BESS integrator market grew increasingly competitive. According to WoodMac, the the top five global system integrators accounted for 62% of overall BESS shipments (MWh).
Leading vendor, Sungrow dominated the market with 16% of global market share rankings by shipment, followed by Fluence (14%) and Tesla (14%), Huawei (9%), and BYD (9%).
“A common feature behind the leading BESS integrators is that their global presence allows them to access a larger customer base and unlock additional revenue streams. In addition, many BESS integrators have been seeking to enhance the vertical integration of their supply chain,” Shang says.
BESS integrators are usually responsible for procuring individual components, assembling the system, providing a wrap on warranties, integrating the controls and energy management system, and often providing project design and engineering expertise. The are also providing operation, monitoring, and maintenance services.
As the energy storage market continues to expand so does the number of companies active in this space. In China, the BESS integrator market is becoming increasingly competitive, squeezed by both upstream and downstream supply chain participants.
“Possessing manufacturing capacity on key components, like cell, PCS, BMS and EMS, tends to be a necessity rather than a plus as bid requirements for energy storage projects become more detailed and stringent,” Shang says.
In such a surrounding, price has become the most significant distinction and key winning bid factor in the region.
“The price war among system integrators has started in China. We’ve observed an increasing number of players willing to sacrifice profits in exchange for market share, dragging down the profitability of the whole industry,” Shang says.
Consolidation seems imminent in the short and middle term. “We forecast that aggressive bid strategies with little margin will not be sustained. Intensifying market competition will make it difficult for companies with low profitability and no clear competitiveness to survive over the coming years,” Shang says.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, mainland China battery energy storage market grew by over 400% in 2022 and is exclusively supplied by local players. This has led to Chinese system integrators moving up on the global rankings. “Competition in international markets will intensify as these Chinese suppliers look to expand globally offering highly competitively priced products,” says S&P Global.
According to the number of installed projects completed as of July this year, S&P Global ranks Sungrow, Fluence and Tesla as the top three BESS integrators globally, followed by Wartsila and Hyperstrong.  Together, these five company have installed over a quarter of global BESS projects, S&P said.
The analysts have also highlighted oversupply as a key reason behind the intense competition in the BESS integrator market amid a large number of battery manufacturing announcements targeted exclusively at the energy storage industry.
“By offering easy-to-install direct current (DC) containers and looking to offer standardized alternating current (AC) solutions in the future, cell manufacturers will further add to the competition in the space,” S&P Global writes in its recently released article.

Jack McKellar, UK Power Networks’ innovation lead for bids and opportunities, told pv magazine that the company received a total of £6.2m ($7.76 million) on Oct. 10, 2023 as part of the latest Strategic Innovation Fund financial allocation. He said one of the projects, which received £500,000 in funding, involves heat pumps in residential dwellings.
The Heat Risers project aims to “accelerate the decarbonisation of multi-occupancy buildings and reduce costs for all, using whole building solutions,” a document provided by UK Power Networks to pv magazine said. The project will be rolled out across London and Greenwich, a borough located southeast of the capital.
UK Power Networks will use the funding to develop the Heat Risers concept, and once completed, the project will compete in the final round of funding for demonstrator scale projects.
According to a UK Power Networks webpage on the Hear Risers project, there will be “energy network innovation” involved, which will include the design of novel network incentives, connection products and services that favoring the uptake of whole-building solutions.
The webpage said the most common solution for helping property owners decarbonize in the UK is the installation of electric boilers and heat pumps. These technologies are marketed to the owner of private and rented properties when a “whole-building solution” – a lower energy demand per household – could be proposed.  This would “accelerate connections and reduce costs for the energy system and consumer,” the webpage said.
The project aims to help consumers slash their energy bills and deliver “increased flexibility” to the energy market, the webpage said.
The UK’s solar PV cumulative capacity was 15,292.8 MW at the end of July, with newly installed capacity for the first seven months of this year reaching 643 MW, recent data published by Great Britain’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) show.

The researchers said in a recently published academic paper that on average, bifacial solar panels produce 6.81% more electricity than monofacial PV modules.
“This research emphasizes the significance of considering albedo values and system type during the design of solar PV systems in Palestine, offering valuable insights for future solar energy projects in the region,” the paper said.
The academics used PVsyst simulation software to conduct a series of tests on PV systems in the city of Nablus. They compared the performance of a monofacial installation with a capacity of 72.8 kW and the performance of a bifacial system with the same output. The systems were south-oriented and had a tilt angle of 28 degrees.
Their simulation considered surfaces made of black asphalt with 12% albedo, artificial green grass with 26% albedo, sand with 35% albedo, and white paint with 90% albedo.
“Each of these surfaces has a distinct albedo, which influences how much solar energy the panels can absorb,” the researchers said.
On average, the bifacial PV modules produced 143,737.75 kWh of electricity per year in simulations, while the monofacial panels produced 134,575.25 kWh – a 6.81% difference. The lowest yearly production of 132,877 kWh was achieved with monofacial solar on black asphalt, while the highest of 145,719 kWh was achieved with bifacial PV on white paint.
The researchers said that both systems suffered PV output losses due to higher temperatures.
“In monofacial modules, the PV loss due to temperature ranges from 10.87 % for black asphalt to 11.21% for white paint,” the researchers said. “In bifacial models, the PV loss due to temperature ranges from 9.28 % for black asphalt to 9.56 % for white paint.”
The scientists noted that the losses due to temperature were slightly lower in bifacial models than in monofacial modules.
“That could be due to the improved cooling effect of the additional exposed surface in the bifacial panel design,” they said.
They explained their findings in “A comparative simulation between monofacial and bifacial PV modules under Palestine conditions,” which was recently published in Solar Compass.
“The case study demonstrated that the use of white albedo values resulted in optimal performance for both system types, with the bifacial system surpassing the monofacial system in energy yield,” the researchers said.
The research team includes scientists from Palestine’s An-Najah National University and the German Jordanian University. They specifically focused on albedo levels and surface types.

BayWa re has started building a fleet of semi-transparent modules to be mounted on a fruit farm in Brumath, France.
The Munich-based renewable energy producer said in a press release this week that the project will be the first to feature its semi-transparent panels in France.
The company said it aims to install 1,440 semi-transparent PV modules across 4,900 square meters of strawberry farmland. The modules will be installed above the farm's produce and will replace the current protective plastic sheets. The new system allows 49% of light to pass through.
BayWa re said the plant will produce the equivalent of 464 MWh per year. After it is commissioned in the first quarter of 2024, it will be connected to Strasbourg Électricité Réseaux. The electricity will be sold on the spot market or through power purchase agreements.
The site owners have grown produce in the region since 1978, but they are now seeing the effects of climate change. Agrovoltaic shades provide favorable conditions for crops, limiting excess heat, the site owners said. They also noted that the sheets improve working conditions by creating a cooler environment compared to working under plastic tunnels. Their goal is to reduce irrigation by 25%.
A plastic tunneling control plot will be used to collect accurate data on fruit production. The data will include fruit size, taste, sugar level, yields and water requirements. Sensors under the panels will measure temperature, light incidence (PAR) and humidity, among other indicators.

Rethink Energy expects several gigawatts of perovskite PV generation capacity to be built in 2026, in what will be just the start of a rise to prominence. Clear advantages are expected for the technology in every market segment.
The first movers will be the handful of companies leading the field today, at least five of which – Microquanta, UtmoLight, GCL System Integration, Caelux, and Oxford PV – have commissioned 100 MW pilot production lines. By 2026, every mainstream silicon manufacturer will have committed to perovskite products.
Rethink believes multiple companies are already capable of making perovskite solar panels that would be competitive today. These companies also have a second generation of perovskite cells in the laboratory. Within three years, next-gen products will be scaled up to full size panels and viable for mass production.
Second-generation perovskites will be superior to current mainstream options and will outcompete silicon PV on rooftops, with consequences for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Outcompeting thin-film solar, perovskites will make BIPV a relevant business.
The perovskite cells currently being scaled are good enough to enable startups to compete with the $100 billion mainstream industry, which will soon have to adopt perovskites. Rethink Energy expects perovskites will completely take over solar during the 2030s, regardless of whether the industry reaches 1 TW or 2 TW in scale.
These expectations are supported by the commissioning of multiple production lines in the past 12 months, with many more in progress. Another positive development is the expansion of production capacity by manufacturing equipment companies supplying the laser scribing and other kit needed for production lines.
The strongest proof that perovskite commercialization is just around the corner is that the first major investments are being made by mainstream companies. Qcells, in South Korea, has invested in a $100 million perovskite pilot line. In the United States, First Solar has acquired Swedish perovskite startup Evolar AB for $32 million, with an additional $42 million contingent on the business hitting R&D targets. The world’s biggest silicon solar manufacturer, Longi, is continually reporting ever-higher perovskite-heterojunction tandem cell efficiency results.
Each month brings several new companies into perovskites, whether startups completing a round of series A financing, companies entering the solar industry via semiconductor manufacturing, or silicon giants getting ahead of the curve. Since Rethink Energy’s report was written, these companies have been joined by Sekisui Chemical, a Japanese plastics company promising to sell perovskites in 2025.
Most of the startups, especially those in China, will focus their efforts on thin-film product and this will take BIPV from its current, negligible scale to a large percentage of all distributed solar installations. These thin-film products will initially be perovskite single-junction devices but, over time, more and more will switch to tandem technology in combination with potentially every other thin film.

The tunability of perovskite absorption spectra is a major advantage of the technology over other thin films. This factor means perovskites can be combined with every other PV semiconductor, including other perovskites. Where single-junction silicon has a theoretical efficiency limit of 29.4%, a perovskite-perovskite tandem could reach 43% – there is already one Chinese startup pursuing this route. As more junctions are added, the technical potential grows: the theoretical limit for a triple-junction perovskite is 50%.
Much of the technology’s potential will be unlocked in the next decade, continuing the rollercoaster of record-setting results that perovskites have been on ever since they emerged from dye-sensitized solar in 2009. They are now drawing level with existing options and will soon surpass them.
While most startups pursue thin film, the first and biggest perovskite companies in the west are already pursuing tandem devices. When the mainstream manufacturers enter the fray, they will also do so via tandem devices. In First Solar’s case, this will be with perovskite-cadmium telluride, while others will find entry through silicon heterojunction-perovskite. Rethink Energy expects that these tandems will first dominate the rooftop segment by the mid-2030s, then the entire solar industry by 2040.

Single-junction perovskites may find a niche as a cost-effective repowering option and perovskites have inherent advantages in every conceivable segment – electric vehicle roofs, satellites, indoor devices – and in every case, there will be a dedicated sub-type of perovskites.
Rethink Energy’s forecast is a minimum case on two levels. Firstly, perovskites will be so disproportionately cost-effective that once the tipping point is reached, they will be adopted at least as swiftly as we have forecast, and possibly much more rapidly. Secondly, perovskites’ superior performance and price have the potential to enable immense additional solar demand, including futuristic green hydrogen complexes, among other things, on a scale that silicon alone cannot enable.
China will dominate the field of perovskite manufacturing and installation but this will only be because it is the biggest market, with the biggest solar industry. Perovskites will not be anything like as Chinese-dominated as silicon PV has been. Perovskites will play a part in European and United States efforts to reclaim a share of global solar manufacturing while India, which is still switching from multicrystalline to monocrystalline passivated-emitter rear contact solar, will be slower to adapt.

Canadian Solar has announced plans to invest $800 million in the development of a 5 GW solar cell factory in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Once complete, the facility is expected to produce enough cells to support the production of about 20,000 solar modules per day.
The company said it expects to begin production at the plant in 2025. More than 1,200 jobs will be created once the facility is operational.
“Indiana’s strong advanced manufacturing sector positions the state to help lead the global energy transition, developing and powering new solutions in batteries, solar and hydrogen,” said Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb. “Canadian Solar’s new US location in Jeffersonville will put our skilled Hoosier workforce at the center of cultivating solar power, making energy efficient panels more accessible to consumers across the country.”
The company said the cells produced at the Indiana facility will be used at its new Mesquite, Texas module assembly plant, which was announced in June.
A total of $12.3 million in tax credits and workforce training grants were offered to Canadian Solar through Indiana Economic Development Corp. The funds are conditional on the company following through on investment and hiring plans.
Canadian Solar has been publicly traded on the NASDAQ since 2016, and was established in 2001 in Guelph, Canada.
In a recent pv magazine USA webinar, Clean Energy Associates discussed how solar cells are a critical part of the supply chain that needs to expand capacity to make a meaningful impact on energy independence for the United States.
Along with raw polysilicon, ingots, and wafers, cells are under-represented in the US supply chain when compared with module assembly capacity and overall PV module demand.

Trina Storage, the battery-focused unit of China's Trina Solar, has introduced its Elementa 2 utility-scale battery system, featuring cells manufactured by the company. 
The lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery features 2 MW/4 MWh units that fit into a 20-foot shipping container. Like most utility-scale batteries, the units can be joined in parallel to expand project capacity. 
The Elementa 2 is the second-generation version of the Elementa battery, which the company launched in 2022. The new version almost doubles the storage capacity of the previous model, which stored 2.2 MWh. The higher density comes from the fact that the first-generation Elementa battery used third-party cells, whereas the second generation uses Trina’s own cells. 
Trina has opted for full vertical integration on its storage products in order to control its production costs and ensure that it can deliver orders on schedule. This includes in house R&D, cabinet design, and components manufacturing, Trina representatives told pv magazine Australia.
Trina Storage began in 2015, but the company’s cell manufacturing line only became operational in 2021. It has two bases in China, and is aiming for 12 GWh of cell production capacity by the end of 2023, and 25 GWh by 2025. While the company will supply cells for its own product ranges as the priority, it may also sell its battery cells into the broader market.
