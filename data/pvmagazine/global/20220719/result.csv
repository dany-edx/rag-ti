The Merganser project will have a capacity of 500 kW. It is expected to go online next year, the two companies said in a statement.
“Merganser will provide RWE and SolarDuck with important first–hand experience in one of the most challenging offshore environments in the world,” they said. “These learnings will enable a faster commercialization of the technology from 2023 onwards.”
The two companies also revealed that RWE is currently participating in the Dutch offshore wind tender for the Hollandse Kust West (HKW) sites VI and VII. SolarDuck was chosen as a tech partner, with the aim of building an offshore floating solar plant at pre–commercial scale with a capacity 5 MW at the future wind power complex.
“We are very keen to further explore the potential of offshore floating solar together with our partner SolarDuck,” said Sven Utermöhlen, CEO  of wind offshore for RWE Renewables. “For countries with lower mean wind speeds but high solar irradiation, this opens up attractive opportunities. With the SolarDuck pilot we are gaining experience with a highly innovative offshore floating solar technology.”
In 2021, SolarDuck unveiled the first demonstrator project to feature its floating structure technology for solar projects at offshore sites in estuaries, natural harbors, and near-shore sites. The 64 kW system was deployed on an inshore site in the Waal (Rhine), the widest river of the Netherlands, near IJzendoorn, a village in the province of Gelderland.
The structure holds the solar panels more than 3 meters above the water, and is able to handle coastal sea conditions and hurricane-force winds. It is optimized for offshore sites in estuaries and natural harbors, as well as near-shore sites. The basic floating platforms are triangular structures measuring 16 meters x 16 meters x 16 meters. They resemble offshore floating wind platforms or floating oil platforms. They can be flexibly connected together to form large plants.
“The idea is based on our offshore heritage,” Burgers told pv magazine in a recent interview. “Our company is a spin-off from the research department of the Damen Shipyards Group in the Netherlands, a company which uses the best of industry practice to design a reliable solution which is able to cope with the harsh maritime environment.”

The Hong Kong-based renewables company said that Si+ is a suitable material because it is compact and easily transportable. It generates ultra-pure hydrogen through the reaction, starting from a molecule of Si and two of water, leading to two molecules of hydrogen and one of silicon dioxide. The on-demand reaction can be performed at moderate temperatures of between 0 C and 80 C. EAT said the material could solve problems with the storage and transportation of hydrogen. “Our Si+, which is in solid form and packed in containers (carrying 10,000 20-foot equivalent containers), can ship up to ~30,000 tons of hydrogen per average sized cargo ship,” said the company. 
Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon researchers in Germany have shown that hydrogen storage materials can be produced from recycled industrial waste. “These findings allow for the first time to use a circular economy strategy to produce metal hydrides,” the researchers said, adding that the production of metal hydrides could capture large amounts of otherwise non-recyclable materials. “Metal hydrides seem to be rather insensible to the exact alloy composition in contrast to metallic alloys, e.g. for high performance construction purposes.” Metal hydrides can bind hydrogen in large quantities and rerelease it quickly, decreasing pressure or increasing temperatures. The researchers employed volumetric analysis, D-ray diffractions (XRD), synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential thermal analysis (DTA) to test high-quality NaAlH produced from the Al-based automotive recycled alloy DIN-GDAlSi10Mg(Cu). The investigations suggest that NaAlH4 was successfully synthesized, demonstrating its properties are comparable with those of high-purity commercial NaAlH4.
Shell New Energies, ENGIE, Vopak, and Anthony Veder have signed an agreement to study the feasibility of producing, liquifying, and transporting green hydrogen from Portugal to the Netherlands, where it would then be stored and distributed for sale. “The consortium envisions hydrogen being produced by electrolysis from renewable power in the industrial zone of the Sines port. The aim is to deliver a first shipment of liquid hydrogen from Sines to Rotterdam by 2027,” said the Port of Rotterdam. The Netherlands is also looking into the option of importing hydrogen from India. In addition, Air Products and Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam recently signed a development agreement for the import terminal in Rotterdam, with the first hydrogen to the Netherlands expected in 2026. 
Johnson Matthey is building a GBP 80 million (€93.8 million) gigafactory at its existing site in Royston, England, to scale up the production of hydrogen fuel cell components. Johnson Matthey aims to sell hydrogen technologies for more than GBP 200 million by the end of 2024. “The gigafactory will initially be capable of manufacturing 3GW of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell components annually for hydrogen vehicles and is supported by the UK government through the Automotive Transformation Fund,” said the company. The site should be in operation by the first half of 2024.
The EU Commission has approved IPCEI Hy2Tech, the first-ever Important Project of Common European Interest in the hydrogen sector. It involves 35 companies and 41 projects from 15 member states: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain. The total related investments could reach €14.2 billion ($14.5 billion). 
Nel has secured its largest-ever purchase order from an undisclosed US customer for 200 MW of alkaline electrolyzer equipment. It will be used for industrial applications, said the Norwegian company. 
Hyundai Motor Group and Rolls-Royce have signed a memorandum of understanding to bring hydrogen fuel cells, storage systems, and infrastructure to the aerospace markets.

Germany's Centre for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW) and Augsburg-based TubeSolar AG have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 14% for a perovskite-based photovoltaic film that TubeSolar developed.
TubeSolar uses the flexible photovoltaic film for its lightweight thin-film solar modules encapsulated in a glass tube. It said the film was fabricated with a roll-to-roll technology and slot-die coating, which is a coating process used for depositing thin and uniform films with limited material waste and low operational cost.
“The speed of the coating process was over one meter per minute,” the manufacturer said. “The partners' objective is to transfer the high efficiencies currently achieved in research on small areas to larger solar films and thus to commercialize slot die deposition as an industrially suitable coating method for flexible perovskite solar cells. By further optimising the solar cell layer stack and the absorber as well as the conductivity of the electrodes, the technology can be significantly improved even further.”

It said  its products can be permeated by light and water for optimal plant growth and require simple, inexpensive mounting and assembly. The tubes offer partial shading to crops, as well as protection from heavy rain, hail and bird droppings. Tube Solar says their rounded surface also offers a self-cleaning aspect.
Tube Solar aims to expand its annual production capacity at Augsburg to 250 MW. The factory belonged to German multinational lighting company Osram, which previously owned some shares of the patent for TubeSolar's panels.
TubeSolar increased its share capital from €12 million ($12.2 million) to €13.2 million by issuing more shares in June.
“The expected proceeds from the capital increase are to be used to finance the further growth of TubeSolar AG and in particular for investments in the development of the highly automated production of TubeSolar photovoltaic modules,” it said at the time.

The Pure Signal technology works with its own rapid shutdown transmitters.
The DC power optimizer specialist said it specifically designed the new product for large, complex systems in the commercial and industrial solar segments.
“Designed to enhance powerline communication (PLC) signal quality, Pure Signal technology reduces the impact of electromagnetic interference in large-scale solar systems,” the manufacturer said. “Built on patented advanced rapid shutdown technology, Tigo RSS Transmitters with Pure Signal technology pair with an industry-leading list of third-party solar inverters, deliver a new level of design and installation flexibility for solar installers and EPCs, and enable significant reductions in balance of system (BOS) and labor costs.”
The device has a transmitter input voltage of 12 V and a transmitter input current of 1 A, with average and maximum power consumption of 0.85 and 5.5 W, respectively. It measures 38 mm x 41.3 mm x 90.9 mm and features an IP68 enclosure.
Tigo Energy said the device eliminates the risk of disturbances in programmable logic controller (PLC) signals, as so-called “crosstalk” can reduce the effectiveness of system communications in large-scale systems. The new product was certified by US-based Underwriters Laboratories and is compatible with hundreds of inverter models.
“The new generation of RSS Transmitters with Pure Signal technology are compatible with the company’s TS4-A-F and TS4-A-2F rapid shutdown product family and can be easily integrated into new projects or retrofitted into existing installations,” said Tigo Energy.

Researchers at Deakin’s Institute for Frontier Materials have discovered a new method, “ball milling,” to store gas in a special nanomaterial at room temperature. The method relies on mechanochemical reactions, meaning machinery is used to produce unusual reactions, and the team believes the discovery could help solve the key challenge of hydrogen storage, which is currently a major barrier to uptake.
The breakthrough marks such a departure from accepted wisdom on gas separation and storage that one of the lead researchers, Dr. Srikanth Mateti, said he had to repeat his experiment 20 to 30 times before he could truly believe it himself. “We were so surprised to see this happen, but each time we kept getting the exact same result, it was a eureka moment,” Mateti said.
The special ingredient in the ball milling process is boron nitride powder, which is small but has a large amount of surface area for absorption. The boron nitride powder is placed into a ball mill – essentially a grinder containing small stainless-steel balls in a chamber – along with the gases that need separating. As the chamber spins at progressively higher speeds, the collision of the balls with the powder and the wall of the chamber triggers a mechanochemical reaction, resulting in gas being absorbed into the powder, the researchers said.
Different types of gases are absorbed into the powdered material at different speeds, meaning they are easily separated from one another through repetition of the process.
“The boron nitride powder can be re-used multiple times to carry out the same gas separation and storage process again and again,” Mateti said. “There is no waste, the process requires no harsh chemicals and creates no by-products. Boron nitride itself is classified as a level-0 chemical, something that is deemed perfectly safe to have in your house. This means you could store hydrogen anywhere and use it whenever it’s needed.”
The researchers described the method as having a “remarkably high gas storage capability.” This, they say, is due to the novel way gas molecules stick to the powder during the ball milling process, which does not break the gas molecules. The ball-milling gas absorption process consumes 76.8 KJ/s to store and separate 1000L of gases. This at least 90% less than the energy used in the petroleum industry’s current separation process, known as cryogenic distillation.
Once a gas, like hydrogen for instance, is absorbed into the solid state material, it can be transported safely and easily, the researchers say. When the gas is needed, the powder is simply heated in a vacuum to release the gas unchanged. The breakthrough is the culmination of three decades of work led by Professor Ying (Ian) Chen, the chair of nanotechnology at Deakin’s Institute for Frontier Materials, and his team.
“The current way of storing hydrogen is in a high-pressure tank, or by cooling the gas down to a liquid form. Both require large amounts of energy, as well as dangerous processes and chemicals,” said Chen. “We show there’s mechanochemical alternative … It doesn’t require high pressure or low temperatures, so it would offer a much cheaper and safer way to develop things like hydrogen powered vehicles.”
As it stands, the Deakin team has only been able to test their process on a small scale, separating about two to three litres of material. They are hoping to attract industry support so the discovery can be scaled up to a full pilot. A provisional patent application for their process has already been submitted, with the breakthrough findings published in the journal Materials Today.
“We need to further validate this method with industry to develop a practical application,” Chen said. “To move this from the laboratory to a larger industry scale we need to verify that this process is cost saving, more efficient, and quicker than traditional methods of gas separation and storage.”
More specifically, the researchers said for the method to be able to scale, they must perfect the milling process.
“There’s a sweet spot in milling which creates the weaker chemical reactions we want – without producing stronger reactions which can destroy the gas molecules,” Chen and Mateti wrote in an accompanying article. “We will also have to figure out how to get the best storage rate for each material based on milling intensity and pressure of the gases.”

Batteries are already competitive for consumer energy storage in behind-the-meter applications in several Brazilian states. Marcio Takata, the director of consulting company Greener, Marcio Takata, described this market opportunity during the Greener Business Summit earlier this month in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
He presented a case study involving an industrial consumer in the area of Cosern, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. The difference between the tariff at peak hours and the off-peak tariff is BRL 3.004 ($0.55)/MWh.
According to Greener, such consumers could reduce their annual bills from approximately BRL 273,600 to BRL 173,600. They would achieve 36% savings on the energy tariff by installing a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 0.6 MW/2.5 MWh.
In the simulation, the consumer would have a reduction of BRL 123,800 in the peak tariff, from BRL 173,400 to BRL 49,600, and an increase of BRL 21,800 in the off-peak tariff, from BRL 103,200 to BRL 124,000. The net savings with storage would therefore be BRL 102,000.
The investment, for a useful life of 15 years, was estimated at BRL 11 million, with an operating cost of BRL 55,000 per year. There is a need for reinvestment in the tenth year of the asset, consisting of 15% of capex, or BRL 1.65 million. The tariff adjustment for the period was 6% per year.
The difference between peak and off-peak tariffs is crucial to the viability of battery storage to manage the load. According to the Greener survey, this difference can range from BRL 354/MWh in the CEA concession area, in the state of Amapá, to BRL 3,971/MWh, in the Equatorial concession area, in the state of Pará. In addition to the distributors in Pará and Rio Grande do Norte, other distributors such as Coelba (BA), Enel RJ and EMS (MS) have peak and off-peak rates with differences above BRL 3,000/MWh.
Battery storage is seen as a way to diversify for companies that already operate in the solar sector. Sao Paulo-based Brasol, for example, is expected to invest in its first storage projects this year.

The US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has issued the final approval for construction of the Oberon solar project on about 2,700 acres of BLM-managed land near Desert Center in Riverside County, California.
“This solar project is the third project approved for full construction under the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan and an example of how public land in California plays a big role in achieving the Biden-Harris administration’s goal to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035,” said Karen Mouritsen, BLM California state director. “The BLM is committed to responsible renewable energy development that balances conservation and utilization of public land.”
The Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) is a collaborative, interagency planning effort covering 22.5 million acres in seven California counties and it has two primary goals. First, to provide a streamlined process for the development of utility-scale renewable energy generation and transmission in the deserts of southern California consistent with federal and state renewable energy targets and policies. And second, to provide for the long-term conservation and management of special-status species and desert vegetation communities, as well as other physical, cultural, scenic, and social resources within the DRECP Plan Area using durable regulatory mechanisms.
Both the BLM and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) have legal responsibilities to conserve wildlife under the Federal Endangered Species Act and the California Endangered Species Act. The BLM must ensure the needs of wildlife, fish and plants are taken into consideration when authorizing land use. The CDFW requires that project developers avoid, minimize, and/or compensate for impacts to fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats.
Despite these safeguards, environmental groups have expressed opposition to the Oberon Solar Project. Basin and Range Watch is one such organization, which has the following statement on its website: “In spite of BLM’s new mitigation measures negotiated between the contentious environmental assessment and final decision under the DRECP, this project will still kill a significant amount of desert ironwood trees–an imperiled vegetation community in California.”
In January, the Desert Sun published an opinion piece by Palm Desert resident Ruth Nolan, who expressed her opposition to the project.
“For our federal government to give license to corporations who stand to gain money by exploiting and destroying our public wilderness in this way is a disgrace and is the antithesis of environmental sustainability;” she said. “Siting large-scale renewable energy projects in California’s desert wilderness areas is not only unnecessary – rooftop solar is a viable alternative – but deeply unethical.”
Last week, the BLM Palm Springs South Coast Field Office authorized Oberon Solar LLC to begin full construction of Oberon 1 and II, which together will generate up to 500 MW or enough to power approximately 146,000 homes. The project will also have 500 MW of battery storage. Both are expected to be operational in 2023.
The BLM said it is currently processing 64 utility-scale onshore clean energy projects proposed on public lands in the western United States, including solar, wind and geothermal projects. These projects have the combined potential to add over 41,000 MW of renewable energy to the western electric grid.
The BLM is also undertaking the preliminary review of 90 applications for solar and wind development, as well as 51 applications for wind and solar energy testing. These clean energy projects will move the US closer to achieving the Biden administration’s goal of 100% carbon free electricity by 2035 and also supports the California Senate bill that sets a 60% renewable energy portfolio standard by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/19/sodium-ion-batteries-for-evs-renewables-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 19, 2022","Sodium-ion batteries for EVs, renewables storage","Scientists from the US Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed a sodium-ion battery (NIB) that can purportedly overcome the main challenge with such storage systems – the ability to hold a charge after repeated cycles of charging and discharging.
The researchers said this issue is strictly correlated to the instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is generated on the anode of lithium-ion batteries during the first few charging cycles, in order to prevent electrolyte decomposition and maintain cycling ability. The SEI layer should be well adhered to the electrode material, exhibit good electronic insulation properties, and be able to conduct lithium ions.
“The instability of SEI layers is a critical barrier for the long cycling performance of NIBs,” the US group said. “Electrolytes usually decompose at a low voltage to form the SEI on the anode surface. Ideally, the SEI should be electronically insulating but ionically conducting for ion transport, insoluble and inert with respect to the electrolyte to prevent continuous side reactions between the anode and electrolyte.”
In order to avoid SEI dissolution, the academics replaced the high-polarity carbonate solvent in conventional electrolytes with a new liquid solution with low polarity. It consisted of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) salt in a solvent mixture of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and tris (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFP). This low-solvation electrolyte (NaFSI/DMC:TFP) was designed to operate in 4.2 V high-voltage sodium-ion batteries.
“The current electrolyte recipe for sodium-ion batteries results in the protective film on the negative end (the anode) dissolving over time. This film is critical because it allows sodium ions to pass through while preserving battery life,” the researchers said, noting that electrolyte also creates an ultra-thin protective layer on the cathode, which ensures additional system stability. “Our electrolyte lowers the solvation ability for SEI components and facilitates the formation of insoluble SEI components, which minimizes the SEI dissolution.”
The battery was able to retain 90% of its capacity after 300 cycles, with minimized SEI dissolution.
“Sodium-based batteries would be more environmentally friendly and less expensive once the technology is established,” researcher Jason Zhang told pv magazine. “The sodium-ion battery developed in this work is suitable for solar energy storage because it has advantages of long cycle life, low cost and materials abundance over lithium-ion batteries; it also has the feasibility for large-scale production using the existing infrastructure of  lithium-ion batteries.”
“We also measured the production of gas vapor at the cathode,” said researcher Phung Le. “We found very minimal gas production. This provides new insights to develop stable electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries that may operate at elevated temperatures.”
The US group described the battery in “Low-solvation electrolytes for high-voltage sodium-ion batteries,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. “Our findings provide a promising recipe for a battery that may one day power electric vehicles and store energy from the sun.”

They fabricated the multifunctional film with phosphor particles measuring 10 μm in diameter. They are able to block ultraviolet (UV) light and silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles with a diameter of 10 nm to increase the ability of a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell to absorb visible light.
The scientists said the phosphors increase the reflectance of the ARC film, due to their large particle size, thus causing a backward light scattering issue. This in turn is compensated by the addition of the spherical SiO2 nanoparticles.
“Experimental and computational results show that SiO2 nanoparticles in the ARC film decrease the reflectance by increasing the diffuse transmittance,” they said, noting that the phosphor particles are able to absorb ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 380 nm and convert it into green visible light with a wavelength of 530 nm.
The film allowed the scientists to raise the efficiency of the solar cell by 4.5%. The cell was also able to retain 91% of its initial efficiency after 120 hours, while a reference device without the film only retained 50% of its efficiency after 20 hours.
“This optically engineered ARC film successfully promotes the light absorption of the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell, leading to the improvement of power conversion efficiency of the tandem cell from 22.48% to 23.50%,” the academics said.
The scientists described the cell technology in “Improving Light Absorption in a Perovskite/Si Tandem Solar Cell via Light Scattering and UV-Down Shifting by a Mixture of SiO2 Nanoparticles and Phosphors,” which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.
