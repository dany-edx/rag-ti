The Norwegian consulting firm said that the stored solar panels are worth about €7 billion. It noted that solar module imports from China continued to increase this year, despite the high inventory levels.
“Imports in January were 17% higher compared to 2022, with February up 22%, March surging 51%, April up 16%, and May growing 6% over last year,” Rystad Energy explained. “If current import levels continue, 2023 will be a record-breaking year for imports and inventory. Annual imports look set to hit 120 GWdc, far surpassing expected capacity installations of 63 GW (DC).”
 

 
Rystad Energy said that Europe is “desperate” to secure PV components at affordable prices. It warned that made-in-Europe products may not be immediately available.
“Although efforts are underway to build a reliable solar supply chain in Europe, the need for panels now means leaders cannot wait until 2025 or later to buy European,” said Marius Mordal Bakke, senior supply chain analyst at Rystad Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/19/thermal-energy-storage-system-based-on-recycled-ceramics/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SERBIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 19, 2023",Thermal energy storage system based on recycled ceramics,"Although TES has largely failed to scale to date, solutions have emerged to deliver on the technology's promise to decarbonize heat and power.
Now, Serbia-based Storenergy has developed a modular, packed-bed TES solution that uses recycled ceramic as a storage medium. The material is sourced from Masdar City-based Seramic Materials, which obtains recycled ceramic from industrial solid waste, such as steel slag, and can store temperatures up to 1,250 C.
“We opted for this material as it involves no complicated parts, toxic chemicals or materials,” Marko Vuksanovic, CEO of Storenergy, told pv magazine.
In Storenergy's system, the ceramic is heated up to 900 C, after which heat is transferred by air to the heat exchanger and then steam is generated in a classical steam turbine cycle.
“The electric air heater, storage design, and steam generator are the novel parts and everything else is standard equipment, including steam turbine, condenser and the power station,“ said Vuksanovic.
The company has already obtained patents for its technology in the United States, Australia, and South Africa, while the European documents are in the works.
“We decided to develop our thermal storage solution because of its efficiency and the price we can achieve with it,” said the CEO.
The solution’s capex stands at €12 ($13.49)/kWh. For an installation coupled with a PV plant, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is calculated between €42/MWh to €50/MWh for a 1.6 GWh thermal storage system with an electricity output of 10 MW. The levelized cost of heat (LCOH) is calculated at €23/MWh for a thermal storage system with 330 MWh capacity and with 5 MW of heat output.
The system has high energy content per volume of 450-500 kWh of heat per cubic meter. “If you compare this to hydro power plants, the difference is huge. A 100-meter high water column can store only 0.27 kWh/m3.  Our system is more compact and has a smaller footprint and can be built close to the source of energy with no locational constraints,” Vuksanovic says.
For heat, Storenergy envisages efficiencies of around 90%, while for co-generation, the figure stands at 60%. For power generation alone, the company expects an efficiency of around 30- 40%.
The system is said to be low maintenance, with a lifespan of 35 years. It is designed to store energy for up to a month. “It does not make sense to use it for longer time periods, as the losses are around 1% a day,” Vuksanovic says. According to him, optimally, the storage duration should be 10 days resulting in 5-10% heat loss.
The company’s test project is a 3 MWh TES system deployed at the CIEMAT institute in Spain. It is coupled with a small Organic Rankine Cycle containerized turbine, and has a footprint of 2m X 2m, and it’s 7 meters high.
“Now, we are on the lookout for investors who could help us deploy larger-sized systems,” Vuksanovic said. “We are working on a couple of more projects in Serbia and one more abroad. We are also seeing a great interest in our technology coming from India and the Middle East.”
Given the bulkiness of the system and shipment costs, the company’s strategy is to produce close to the project location and in cooperation with local partners in places of projects realization for most of the civil and fabrication works.
“We would like to relocate our business to the US, and negotiations are already ongoing. It’s because it’s the biggest market and always ready for new ideas,” said Vuksanovic.

The Niger government had initially planned the project to have a capacity of 50 MW.
The facility, which is located about 10 kilometers from the capital, Niamey, was developed as part of improving the city's electricity supply under the aegis of the national electricity company, Nigelec.
Production will hjit 53 GWh in the first year and will be fed into the Nigelec network. The project secured €30 million. Nigelec said that the 55,608 polycrystalline modules were deployed on fixed structures.
In 2020, Niamey had an electrification rate of 92.95% according to figures from the national statistics institute. However, the city suffers from load shedding, despite the extension of thermal production capacities in 2017. At the national level, electrification increases to 15.72% in 2020, with a large disparity between rural areas and urban areas.
To strengthen its generation capacities, Niger raised €129 million last year for solar energy projects from the African Development Bank.

TW is a wall-building design made with basic building techniques that draws in heat from the sun and then distributes it throughout a building without the use of electricity or other machinery.
The Photovoltaic/Trombe wall (PV/TW) system is described by its creators as a system that can provide hot water, hot air, and electricity, with the TW system also being used to cool down PV module temperature. TWs are also often designed with reflective mirrors to boost the efficiency of energy production and porous materials, phase change materials (PCM) or nanofluids may be utilized to boost the system's overall efficiency.
With their work, the scientists sought to find the best inclination angle of the reflective mirrors with the ultimate goal of improving both the thermal and electrical performance of the system. “The influence of reflective mirrors was studied with the introduction of a DC fan and heat exchanger, with a study of the influence of different weather conditions for the two systems to verify the functions of the photovoltaic Trombe wall,” they explained.
The experimental setting consists of two chambers equipped with solar panels and reflective mirrors. One of the two chambers utilizes a heat exchanger placed behind the PV modules, while the other one has no heat exchanger. The mirrors were placed on the right and left sides of the south face of the system and were fixed to the ground using an iron base. Each chamber has a length of 1.25 m, a height of 2 m, and a width 1.25 m.
The researchers tested three different inclination angles for the mirrors, of 30, 45, and 60 degrees, respectively. The performance of the system was tested via temperature sensors and an Arduino system. Two DC fans were set up on top and two at the bottom of each chamber and a water pump was used to circulate the water inside the heat exchanger.
“The electrical and thermal performance of the (PV/TW) system was assessed in this study by determining the heat absorption rate of the duct’s air and the heat exchanger’s heat absorption rate and calculating the electric power that can produce by the PV panel,” they explained. “The value of temperature, current, and voltage of each of the PV panels and the temperature of entry and exit of water, fans, and indoor room are recorded every hour.”
Through their analysis, the academics found that the best inclination angle for the reflective mirror, when using the heat exchanger, is 30 degrees. They said this system configuration enables the greatest daily electrical efficiency of 13.86%. “The use of water passing via the heat exchanger behind the PV panel increases overall performance by lowering the PV panel temperature,” they added, noting that the PV panels’ temperature is also lowered by the DC fan in the PV/TW system.
The system is described in the study “Optimum angle of reflective mirrors integrated on PV/Trombe wall: An experimental assessment,” published in Energy Reports. The group includes scientists from Al-Kitab University and the Northern Technical University in Iraq. “For future recommendations, it is suggested to study the influence of phase-change materials (PCM) for the PV/Trombe system with the presence of mirrors and the use of a double air duct,” they concluded, indicating directions for future research.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/19/reintroducing-co-extruded-backsheets-in-pv-industry-not-a-lost-battle/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 19, 2023",Reintroducing co-extruded backsheets in PV industry? Not a lost battle,"A group of researchers led by the Polymer Competence Center Leoben in Austria has investigated the cracking propensity of co-extruded backsheets based on three layers of polypropylene (PP) in an effort to assess their reintroduction in the solar module manufacturing industry.
“For a few years, we have been testing co-extruded backsheets based on polypropylene with respect to its properties, performance and reliability,” said the research's lead author, Gernot Oreski, told pv magazine. “The biggest risk for these new backsheet types is the occurrence of cracks after some years of field operation.”
In the paper “Investigation of the crack propensity of co-extruded polypropylene backsheet films for photovoltaic modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the scientists recalled that these backsheets have been already used in the industry leading to the so-called “polyamide backsheet disaster,” which they say refer to several faulty installations developed between 2009 and 2015 across several countries with this technology.
“To my opinion, it was a really innovative idea of using co-extruded backsheets, where each layer has different requirements and therefore different fillers and additives,” Oreski said. “However, the material selection and especially the material qualification was not done thoroughly. The commonly used test protocols back then focused on the exposure to single stresses, and therefore the problematic long-term behavior of polyamide was not revealed, and so the cracking of the backsheets occurred after some years.”
“Meanwhile, new test protocols have been developed specifically to provoke such backsheet failures, and the solder bump coupon test is one of them,” he continued. “Unfortunately, this led to a reluctance on the part of the PV industry not only to use polyamides, which is understandable but also to use co-extruded backsheet films in general.”
The academics explained in the study that co-extruded PP backsheets have lower stiffness and higher flexibility than laminated backsheets. Moreover, they noted that PP backsheets exhibit low water vapor transmission rates comparable to their PET counterparts, but have high permeation rates for oxygen and acetic acid.
With a standard encapsulant, the scientists fabricated test specimens, which they called solder bump coupons, and subjected them to accelerated aging tests together with reference laminated backsheets.
They tested five different specimens: a co-extruded backsheet based on PP; a co-extruded backsheet based on polyamide (PA); a laminated backsheet based on polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF); a laminated backsheet based on polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) and PET; and a laminated backsheet based on fluorinated coating (fc), PET, and PVDF.
The Austrian group exposed then the specimens, after lamination, to 5 cycles consisting of 500 hours of xenon and 100 thermal cycles, with temperatures ranging from −40 C to 85 C. “Two specimens of each coupon material combination underwent the accelerated aging tests: For one sample the backsheet was directly irradiated, for the second sample the front glass was irradiated,” it explained.
The testing showed that only the second and third backsheet types listed showed severe cracking. The other three types, by contrast, did not exhibit any cracks or outer layer embrittlement.
“The results of this study confirm previously published results on the long-term stability of co-extruded backsheets based on PP, indicating an excellent stability towards temperature, humidity and UV,” the group said referring to the remarkable group of the first backsheet type. “Overall co-extruded PP back-sheets show great potential to be a valid replacement of standard PET-based backsheets in PV modules.”
The research team also includes scientists from the Austrian Research Institute for Chemistry and Technology, Silicon Austria Labs, Kioto Solar, and Borealis Polyolefine GmbH.
“Co-extrusion allows tailoring the backsheet exactly to the requirements needed for specific conditions, as the process itself is much more flexible than the lamination process,” Oreski said, referring to the real possibilities of co-extruded backsheets reentering the PV industry via the adoption of the PP material.

German utility RheinEnergie has unveiled plans for a large-scale heat pump that will use the energy of the Rhine River to deliver 150 MW of heat output. The heat will be available to the district heating network in central Cologne as “green heat.”
The system will be able to heat around 30,000 residential units and is poised to increase RheinEnergie’s existing district heating network capacity by 15%. Construction is scheduled to start early next year and commissioning is planned for early 2027. Another 50 MW heat pump will be installed in the Merkenich district in northern Cologne.
Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, Gateshead Energy Company has delivered what is described as “the largest mine water heat network in Great Britain and one of the largest in Europe.” The system will use warm water from the extensive network of old coal mining infrastructure 150 meters below the town of Gateshead, in order to supply heat and hot water to different building types, including homes, businesses, and community buildings.
A 6 MW water source heat pump recovers heat and distributes it via the existing district heating network over five kilometers long. The mine water at 15 C is taken from drilled boreholes and passed through a heat exchanger which transfers heat, via a heat pump, into a network of underground pipes that supply hot water at 80 C to homes and buildings.
Mine water does not flow through the network, which heats the buildings, but is instead returned to the ground once the natural heat is extracted. The scheme took about three years to deliver and went live in late March.
Separately, Danish utility DIN Forsyning says it is poised to supply the seaport town of Esbjerg, Denmark, with zero-emissions district heating by using two large-sized heat pumps. MAN Energy Solutions supplied two 50 MW pumps. They will be powered by nearby wind farms and will use the Wadden Sea as a heat source.
The heat pumps, which will replace coal-fired heat, will provide 25,000 households with heat and produce 350,000 MWh of heat per year. The heat pump can reach a maximum temperature of 150 C and will deliver water to the city’s district heating network at 90 C. The systems are expected to be commissioned in the fall.
Implementing heat pumps in district heating systems is a relatively unexplored application. However, it offers enormous potential for large-scale heat decarbonization.
In Germany, specifically, large-scale heat pumps could provide about 70% of district heating by 2045, according to a recent study commissioned by think tank Agora Energiewende and conducted by Fraunhofer IEG. This would mean that the country would need to add as much as 4 GW of large-scale heat pumps per year. Currently, Germany has just 60 MW of installed capacity, with another 600 MW under development, according to Fraunhofer IEG.

Sydney-based battery developer Firm Power has been granted development approval for the proposed Muswellbrook Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), a 150 MW/300 MWh standalone battery in New South Wales.
The project is to be built in the designated Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), on land owned and managed by New South Wales network operator Ausgrid. The plan aims to connect to the grid via the existing Ausgrid Muswellbrook substation.
The New South Wales government has also given the green light to Melbourne-based developer ACEnergy to build the planned Aspley BESS about 60 kilometers south of Dubbo in the coordinated Central-West Orana REZ. The project involves the development of a standalone battery with a capacity of up to 120 MW/240 MWh, and a new 132 kV transmission line which would connect to the existing transmission line to the east of the project site.
ACEnergy expects to reach financial close on the project early next year, with the state government saying both batteries are expected to be operational towards the end of 2025. New South Wales Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the batteries will help balance the grid and support the performance and future uptake of renewable energy in the state.
“Giving these batteries the green light will play a critical role in securing reliable, renewable energy across [New South Wales],” she said. “The transformation of our energy system needs to occur as soon as possible. Batteries are not only critical to supporting our state’s transition to net zero, they will assist us to get there sooner.”
The state government’s Renewable Energy Roadmap calls for at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation and 2 GW of energy storage by 2030 to replace the state’s ageing coal-fired power generators.
Sharpe said there are currently 27 large-scale renewable energy, transmission lines and storage projects under assessment in the New South Wales planning system. If approved, they would provide 9 GW of renewable energy and 5.5 MW of firming storage.

Solar PPA pricing in the United States may be stabilizing, reports LevelTen Energy. After three years of sequential price increases each quarter, PPA contract prices declined 1% from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2023. Solar PPA prices increased 25% year over year in the second quarter.
“While 1% is a small change, this is the first time since Q1 of 2020 that we’ve seen the market-averaged continental solar PPA price decrease,” said Gia Clark, senior director of strategic accounts at LevelTen Energy. “It’s a promising indication that conditions are starting to stabilize.”
Developers have been challenged by inflation, supply chain complexity, rising interest rates, and regulatory uncertainty over the last few years. Despite these issues, the industry is a year removed from the US Inflation Reduction Act passage, and developers are beginning to incorporate benefits from the legislation into their strategies.

Increased mobility in the solar supply chain is also likely contributing to the second quarter solar PPA price trends, said LevelTen. More than 12 GW of PV modules crossed the border into the United States during the first quarter of 2023 alone, compared to only 29 GW imported during all of 2022, reported Wood Mackenzie.
Meanwhile, wind PPA prices continue to climb due to low supply, rising 13% in the second quarter.
“As a result of permitting and interconnection issues, fewer wind projects are entering the market compared to solar,” said Clark.

Dealing with the losses caused by the buildup of dust on the surface of a module is big business for the PV industry, since these losses can quickly to significant amounts of lost revenue. Cleaning modules too frequently or investing in the wrong type of cleaning equipment can also hurt the economics of a project. And so the ability to accurately predict losses from soiling on both long and short term timescales is something that PV project developers and system operators value greatly.
Various approaches exist, employing different combinations of on-site sensors, historical climate data, local weather data, satellite imaging and more. A group of scientists led by the University of Cyprus sought to compare the accuracy of a few of these, by comparing modeled forecasts of soiling loss with data from a test installation at the University of Cyprus campus in Nicosia.
Soiling losses at the test site were calculated by comparing a cleaned and uncleaned module set side by side. Six different models – three using a physical modeling approach and three based on machine learning – were evaluated for accuracy against the site data.
The three “physical” models are well-established methods to model soiling, while the machine learning methods are open-source programs being applied to soiling measurement for the first time. Full details of the models used and how they were evaluated can be found in the paper “Characterizing soiling losses for photovoltaic systems in dry climates: A case study in Cyprus,” published in Solar Energy.
The evaluation showed that the physical models, fed with field observed data, achieved the highest accuracy, with error rates (root mean square error) of 1.16% on daily soiling losses and 0.83% for monthly soiling losses, for the highest performing machine learning model, called CatBoost.
The machine learning approaches, however, were not far behind with 1.55% error in daily soiling losses and 1.18% for monthly. The researchers note that, given shortcomings in the availability of field-observed data covering a whole site over a sufficient period, the machine learning models, based on environmental data gathered by satellite, could also be a useful approach.
“Modelling soiling with this kind of satellite-derived environmental data might help in scheduling O&M strategies and operations along the year to minimize the soiling loss; particularly, in dust and arid regions where sudden changes in the aerosols loading can happen and precipitation is much less frequent,” the researchers explained.
