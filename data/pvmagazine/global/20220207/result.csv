The silicon is recycled through a technique conceived by German specialist Reiling GmbH & Co. KG and the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP, which is claimed to recycle silicon from different types of modules, regardless of manufacturer and origin.
“At Fraunhofer CSP, the cell fragments with sizes from 0.1 to 1 millimeter are first freed from the glass and plastic by various sorting processes,” the Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “This is followed by the step-by-step removal of the backside contact, the silver contacts, the anti-reflective layer and finally the emitter by wet chemical etching. The silicon cleaned in this way is processed into monocrystalline or quasi-monocrystalline ingots in standard processes and then into wafers.”

The German scientists said the cells were fabricated only with wafers relying on recycled silicon and that no commercial ultrapure silicon was added during the manufacturing process.
The performance of the first trial PERC cells was tested and the devices were found to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.7%. “This is below the efficiency of today's premium PERC solar cells, which have an efficiency of around 22.2 percent, but it is certainly above that of the solar cells in the old, discarded modules,” said Peter Dold, project manager at Fraunhofer CSP, without providing more technical details.

Spanish renewable energy company Acciona is using a robot dog to monitor the performance of a utility scale solar plant it is operating in the Desert of Atacama, in northern Chile.
Called Spot, the robot is being used as a replacement for drones, the company explained. “The maximum payload of a drone can be about five kg, while Spot can carry almost 15 kilos,” said Carlos Crespo, head of Acciona's robotics and artificial intelligence group. He also explained that drones are able to move faster than Spot and, however, their batteries usually last only up to 30 minutes of autonomous operation, while the robot dog can operate for up to 90 minutes.
The device has a built-in thermal vision system that generates thermographic reports on the status of the different PV plant components, as it walks between the panel rows following a programmed route. According to the robot developer – US-based Boston Dynamics – the big benefit of the robot legs is that they are terrain-independent.
“A robot with legs has the most traversability, and it can be used regardless of the type of terrain at a given site. And Spot’s built-in, state-of-the-art navigation stack – all of the software and the hardware that the robot needs to get from point A to point B – is quickly making Spot the ‘go-to’ resource,” the company said in a statement.
Boston Dynamics sold its first robot dog in 2020 at a price of $74,500. It has been used so far by various industries for a wide variety of applications. Initially, Spot was used to inspect the construction works of active infrastructure tunnels, according to the US manufacturer.
Acciona decided to incorporate the quadrupedal robot into its operations in 2019.

“The FIT rates have been divided into three phases in 2022, and are based on capacity size and category,” the ministry said in a statement.
The FIT for ground-mounted projects over 1 MW will be ranging from NT4.0031 ($0.14) and NT3.8680 per kWh and that for floating PV arrays exceeding 1 MW in size will be between NT4.3960 and NT4.2612.
Residential installations ranging in capacity from 1 to 10 kW will be awarded a tariff between NT5.8952 ($0.21) and NT5.7848. PV systems with an installed power of 20 to 100 kW will be granted a FIT between NT4.5549 ($0.16) and NT4.4538.
Furthermore, installations ranging in size from 100 to 500 kW will be entitled to a FIT between NT4.0970 ($0.14) and NT3.9666. For projects with capacity comprised between 500 kW and 1 MW, the FIT will be ranging from NT4.1122 ($0.14) and NT3.9727.
PV systems of all types will be applied a grid tariff of NT0.0656/kWh. The funds raised through this fee will be used to set up a PV module recycling scheme, the MoEA stated.
The Taiwanese government aims to install 20 GW of solar by 2025, with 3 GW of rooftop PV and 17 GW of ground-mounted capacity. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the island had around 5.8 GW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020.

The regional government hopes to use the funds to build up to 6,000 “energy communities,” for a total installed capacity of up to 1.3GW.
“These resources can be added to those of the National Recovery Plan in support of energy communities which provide funding of €2.2 billion euros for municipalities with less than 5,000 inhabitants and those of the regional program to support the diffusion of energy communities, which amount to €55.5 million,” it said in a statement.
Energy communities in Italy are awarded special tariffs for all shared power in renewable energy systems not exceeding 200kW in size. Surplus power can be injected into the grid, but with no remuneration, which may encourage the members of such communities to resort to storage. Self-consumed electricity is not subject to bill charges, but it is not granted a direct incentive. The indirect incentive is an avoided electricity cost ranging from €0.13/kWh to €0.20/kWh.
Italy introduced new provisions for solar energy communities in March 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/07/net-metering-would-offer-a-solar-rooftop-alternative-to-uneconomic-kenyan-utilities/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,KENYA,NIGERIA,RWANDA,SOUTH AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",COSMAS MWIRIGI,"FEBRUARY 7, 2022",Net metering would offer a solar rooftop alternative to uneconomic Kenyan utilities,"An online event held to consider Africa's rooftop solar market has been told Kenya is crying out for net metering – the system which rewards solar generators for excess electricity they feed into the grid.
Geoffrey Ronoh, co-founder and director of Kenyan solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services business Ofgen, told the Africa Rooftop Solar Congress: “We need net metering regulations to expand our network.”
It was a sentiment echoed by Martin Baart, CEO of Berlin-based developing-world solar crowdfunder Ecoligo, who said Kenyan policymakers had been discussing the need for net-metering since 2012 and promising to deliver it year after year, without doing so.
In tomorrow’s print edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
“These uncertainties are what are causing us investors … projects headaches,” said Baart, to the online event held on Wednesday and Thursday. “We need to know what we are getting into before we invest and the policies should be long-term, not only up to the election period for the next government. Some regulations are well-defined, others not so much.”
Ronoh called for net-metering against fears of renewed blackouts in Kenya where the government last month mandated a reduction in the price of grid electricity, from $0.18 to $0.15. The solar EPC director said utilities would be unable to generate power at the new lower rate, hampering reliability and network investment. If blackouts are the result, Kenya's need for net-metering to drive rooftop solar would only become more pressing, Ronoh said, adding he expects the East African nation to hit 100MW of rooftop commercial and industrial (C&I) solar generation capacity this year.
The event also heard a prediction, from Daniel Pasker, southern Africa sales manager for Chinese solar brand JA Solar, that South Africa will add around 2GW of solar capacity this year. Notably, Pasker indicated last year's rising solar panel prices could soon be forgotten as he said the nation would build on the 4GW or so of solar capacity reached at the end of 2021.
With the South African government having decreed solar plants with a generation capacity of up to 100MW can be developed without a license, Pasker said: “There is expansion in [the rooftop solar] C&I space, as well as [in] agriculture [and] mining.” He highlighted grid electricity prices he said are set to rise 15-20% in the nation, further improving the solar business case, and added: “There is massive growth driven by prices coming down from manufactur[ing], raw materials [and] cost[s] dropping [and] technology is becoming more efficient and affordable and easier to install.”
The continent as a whole could be expected to add 4-5GW of solar capacity this year, Pasker said.
Although the Nigerian government is shying away from the idea of renewing oil and gas subsidies – according to Segun Adaju, CEO of Nigerian rooftop solar installer Consistent Energy – grid electricity is still far cheaper than self-generated power in the country. In that market, said Adaju, president of the Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria, solar is instead competing with the off-grid options offered by petrol and diesel.
The unreliable nature of that cheap grid supply, however, is reflected by the estimate the 25-30GW of self-generation power systems operating in Nigeria is more than five times the scale of the nation's grid capacity. With grid electricity uneven, Adaju added, small and medium-sized businesses who need power for manufacturing, drying food, and irrigation are turning to solar.
The progress of solar in Rwanda was highlighted by Dan Klinck, CEO of Kigali-based hydro and solar developer East African Power, who told the event the nation has around 200MW of photovoltaic generation capacity at the moment and will be heading towards 500MW by 2025.
The Africa Rooftop Solar Congress was organized by Solar Quarter and backed by Chinese solar manufacturers JinkoSolar and JA Solar and trade bodies the Uganda National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Alliance, the Kenya Renewable Energy Association, and the Uganda Solar Energy Association.

They complemented their qualitative review with an assessment that considered a broad spectrum of technological advances for storing compressed gaseous hydrogen.
“Most of the technologies discussed in this study are immature and under development, which means that the research is still ongoing,” they said. “Furthermore, the infrastructure and facilities behind some of the technologies are massive, which would require significant resources and costs.”
They also noted that storage projects should be big enough to ensure low costs and profitability.
“The lesser the size, the more costly and unrealistic option it would be. Furthermore, geological nature and viability are crucial factors for some technologies,” they warned, in reference to the constraints of the geological options.
Storage vessels
The scientists grouped storage vessels into four categories: pressure vessels made of metals like carbon steel and low-alloy steel, thick load-bearing metal liners based on steel or aluminum, thin metal liners with fiber resin composites, ultra-thin metal liners fully wrapped with fiber resin composites, and linerless fully composite pressure vessels based on fiber-reinforced shells.
The scientists noted the importance of different components such as valves, sensors, and storage containers for this kind of hydrogen storage. They also considered the most common fiber-reinforced composites used for hydrogen storage tanks, including carbon fibers, glass fibers, and glass fibers. They also looked at polyester, phenol, and epoxy resins for manufacturing pressure vessels. They said the latter are the best candidates due to their high mechanical properties and resistance to temperature and corrosion.
They also looked at seamless hydrogen storage vessels in hydrogen fuel stations and multifunctional layered stationary hydrogen storage vessels. The former can be cascaded in multi-vessel assemblies through valves and interconnection piping manifolds, leading to more hydrogen leak points. The latter are considered ideal for large-scale hydrogen storage operating at high pressure, without restrictions on size. The scientists also looked at steel-concrete composite pressure vessels and natural gas metallic vessels.
Geological storage
The Swedish-Finnish group assessed several options for geological hydrogen storage, including depleted oil and gas reservoirs, aquifers, salt caverns, abandoned mines, and rock caverns.
“The geological storage system typically includes injection and withdrawal wells and a confining layer. The injection and withdrawal wells are the devices responsible for getting the hydrogen in and out of the underground geological formations,” they said.
In addition, they assessed the viability of blending hydrogen into natural gas pipelines and underground methanation reactors.
“Despite the benefits of hydrogen injection into the natural gas network, there are also drawbacks that limit the amount of hydrogen (%) that can be injected. Hydrogen embrittlement is one of the main issues concerning pipelines safety and leaking risk,” the scientists said, in reference to the first of the two technologies.
They see the methanation reactors as a potentially good alternative, but they still have concerns about the methane production rate.
“The resulting methane then could be added to the natural gas network, which can provide one big storage that can be accessed by renewable sources that are close to the natural gas grid,” they said.
The academics said that they eventually want to conduct distance assessments for hydrogen transport, storage losses and all uses of stored hydrogen.
“The knowledge of these factors shall help the decision-makers to analyze and identify the tradeoffs among the different factors concerning the different technologies based on case by case requirements that can include specific technical parameters such as discharge or storage size,” they said.
They presented their findings in “Large-scale compressed hydrogen storage as part of renewable electricity storage systems,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. The research group includes academics from Sweden's KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the Aalto University in Finland.

They said that curved solar cells are able to capture sunlight more efficiently than conventional ones on cloudy days.
“One way to produce curved electronics is with rubber-like substrates, but solar cells on such substrates usually have much lower performance,” they said. “In contrast, solar cells fabricated on flexible sheets have high efficiency, but can be difficult to attach to curved surfaces.”
In order to overcome this hurdle, the scientists used heat-shrinking films, which are generally used to encapsulate nonprescription medicines. This reduces the area of a non-stretchable but flexible polymer sheet by up to 70%.
“When a material becomes thinner, it becomes more flexible – that’s why we can crumple aluminum foil by hand, but can also use aluminum to make bicycles,” said researcher Steven Rich. “Although we use rigid materials such as metals and plastics, they are three times thinner than a grocery bag and can bend very sharply without breaking.”
The heat-shrinking films formed tiny wrinkles when the were applied to the polymer sheets. By controlling the size of these wrinkles, the Japanese group was able to build shrinkable touch sensors and prefabricated organic photovoltaic modules that could be used on round objects. They said that the photonic properties of the shrink-induced wrinkle structures enhanced light-harvesting and improved the PV device's power conversion efficiency by up to 17%.
The organic PV devices can be laminated to several non-developable surfaces without loss of performance, claimed the scientists. They described their findings in “Developing the Nondevelopable: Creating Curved-Surface Electronics from Nonstretchable Devices,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials.

It launched the system in March.
The battery is included in the Bee Flat leasing package, through which Japanese homeowners can also lease solar panels. Modules can now be leased for a set monthly fee, with waived initial fees. The offer is only for Japanese homeowners.
Itochu will perform regular maintenance during the contract period and grant an additional five years on top of the conventional 10-year product warranty, as well as a charging and discharging service through its GridShare AI software.
The battery has a rated capacity of 13.16kWh and maximum power of 5.5kVA. It measures 1,182 mm x 1,008 mm x 392 mm and weighs 265 kg. It can be used for grid-connected and offgrid operations, with a charging feature for electric vehicles.
“As Smart Star 3 accurately measures the electricity generated by a household solar power system and charges this clean energy into EVs, we will promote EVs driving powered by clean energy and contribute to the enlargement of the EV charging network,” the manufacturer said in March. “Specifically, EVs can be charged by Smart Star 3 and then travel to commercial facilities, retail stores, and similar facilities and discharge the power, enabling the use of clean energy.”

Airstream, builders of iconic travel trailers known for their rounded shape and aluminum exterior, announced the release of eStream, a camper built for the electric vehicle revolution.
The eStream takes Airstream’s famous design features and adds integrated solar PV in the roof, as well as an electric motor that can be used to drive and park the trailer. The electric motors within can also be used while towing the trailer, taking load off the towing vehicle. It’s estimated that the F-150 Lightning truck may reduce its range to less than 100 miles of range when towing at its maximum capacity, so the eStream helps to keep drivers going longer distances.
The roof has 900W of solar built-in, which Airstream said is about one-fifth the average power draw of an American home. In addition to solar, the system has a fast plug-in charging port and an 80kW battery. Airstream said the battery can reach full charge in about 30-45 minutes at a fast-charging station.

While you can’t drive the eStream down the road on its own, it can be parked autonomously using a tablet or other web-connected device. Its range of motion makes it easier to snug the trailer into a tight spot as opposed to working it in with a tow truck, said Airstream.
The on-road trailer motors use a unique tow hitch with built-in sensors to continually measure the forces between the trailer and the vehicle, so that the trailer does not push or pull on the tow vehicle. Like an electric car, the trailer uses regenerative braking to recharge its batteries.
The company said the eStream can be taken completely off-grid for a week or two, running all systems including A/C and heat. When foregoing deeper power draws like heating and cooling, the trailer can remain powered off-grid for significantly longer.
Fast Company reports that it may still be a couple of years before this design is on the market. As more EVs take to the road, the eStream may be more representative of the trailers and campers of the near future.

The New South Wales state government in Australia has reported a “huge” response to the registration of interest (ROI) process for the South-West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ). More than 34GW of wind, solar PV and energy storage proposals have been received – more than 10 times the zone’s proposed capacity.
The state government conducted a ROI process in October and November for the South-West REZ, one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in its electricity roadmap, which is expected to support more than AUD 32 billion (USD 22.7 billion) of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission.
The South-West REZ is one of five REZs planned to help replace the state’s aging coal-fired power stations. Four of its five fossil-fueled power plants are expected to close in the next 15 years, starting with the 1,680 MW Liddell Power Station in 2023-24.
REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, Illawarra and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage online.
The Central-West Orana REZ, centered on the inland town of Dubbo, was the first of the REZs to be launched with the call for registrations of interest in 2020 attracting 27GW of proposals when it sought 3GW. The ROI process for the New England REZ, based around Armidale, was also flooded with expressions of interest, with investors tabling 34GW of proposals for a likely capacity of 8GW.
EnergyCo, the statutory authority established by the NSW government to lead the delivery of the state’s REZs, said the capacity of the South-West REZ will be no less than 2.5GW. The area was chosen due to “an abundance of high-quality wind and solar resources, relative land-use compatibility and existing strong investor interest.”
Its proximity to the 900-kilometer EnergyConnect project, an interconnector being built by Transgrid and ElectraNet between the town of Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and Robertstown in South Australia, with a connection to Red Cliffs in Victoria, is also considered key. The project will also upgrade the 330kV transmission line to 500kV between Wagga Wagga and Dinawan, which links to the eastern edge of the REZ.
EnergyCo Chief Executive James Hay said the information provided in the latest ROI process will inform the timing, capacity, design and location of the South-West REZ.
“Through this process, the NSW government will take the important first steps to ensure all voices are heard as this vital piece of clean energy infrastructure is delivered,” he said. “The number of responses to the ROI reflects the strong level of interest in the south-west and helps ensure only the best projects which benefit the community and maximise local renewable jobs and investment in the region will be picked.”
Hay said the South-West REZ is a significant undertaking and will take several years to plan, design and build and will most likely be delivered in stages.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/07/us-government-extends-section-201-tariffs-on-imported-pv-panels-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 7, 2022","US government extends Section 201 tariffs on imported PV panels, cells","From pv magazine USA
The US government has revealed that it will extend the Section 201 tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar panels and solar cells above an annual 5GW tariff rate quota, thus upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and doubling the tariff rate quota for cells.
The proclamation is seen as a “balanced solution” by many in the solar industry.
“While we are disappointed with the decision to extend Section 201 tariffs on imported solar cells and panels, we are grateful to the Biden administration for clearly considering the range of issues affected by this decision,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “Administration officials arrived at a balanced solution in upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and increasing the tariff rate quota for cells.”
The saga surrounding the solar tariffs began after a Section 201 trade petition was filed by Suniva and SolarWorld that sought relief against what the companies said was unfair competition from overseas imports.  In 2018, former President Donald J. Trump imposed duties on solar panels and solar cells for a period of four years. In the ensuing years, many countries – including China, South Korea, and Taiwan – filed complaints with the World Trade Organization in opposition to the graduated tariffs.
One of the outcomes expected by those supporting the ruling was an increase in solar manufacturing in the United States, but that did not come to pass. It also had a negative affect on US solar installations, with the number of installed gigawatts missing projections for the first time in years, said Tony Clifford in pv magazine in 2019. Clifford was then chief development officer at Standard Solar and a board member of SEIA.
The new ruling extends the exclusion for bifacial solar panels – something that SEIA has been fighting for for three years.
“Today’s decision recognizes the importance of this innovative technology in helping to improve power output and lower costs in the utility-scale segment. It is a massive step forward in producing clean energy in America and in tackling climate change,” said Hopper.
However, not everyone in the solar industry is seeing the proclamation as offering a good balance. First Solar Chief Executive Mark Widmar said that the extension to the Section 201 safeguard excluding bifacial panels is no safeguard at all.
“This exclusion un-levels the playing field by providing unlawfully subsidized bifacial panels an instant, artificial advantage over other panel types, an advantage that is based not on real-world performance or true competitiveness, but merely on distinguishing where the cells happen to be located on the panel. With bifacial being the dominant Chinese solar product today, this decision effectively allows China to outflank American efforts to grow self-reliant solar supply chains,” said Widmar.
In order to incentivize domestic solar manufacturing, the next step is the passage of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act.
“Failing that, today’s decision places at risk billions of dollars in existing investment, thousands of jobs, our country’s energy security and a climate-critical transition to net-zero emissions,” said Widmar. “It also places at risk the over 10 gigawatts of new American manufacturing capacity announced since May 2021, as well as the thousands of new jobs here at home that were set to be created both directly, on the manufacturing floor, and indirectly across domestic supply chains.”
In writing about the extension of the solar tariffs and need for the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, Brian Lynch, director of solar plus storage at LG, wrote in an op-ed in pv magazine that “the actions we take today – as an entire industry – will affect our ability to continue to grow as we meet the imperative of installing solar to help protect our environment and grow our economy.”
