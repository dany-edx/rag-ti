“This development will provide end-users with the ability to power the heat pump with excess PV, all controlled from a single point via the mySolarEdge app,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Users will also be able to control home temperatures via the app. It will reportedly allow homeowners to optimize their energy consumption using excess PV or shifting consumption in accordance with optimal energy rates.
SolarEdge estimates yearly savings of around €100 ($108) by optimizing the consumption of the heat pump at alternative times, it said in a statement.
“Smart homes have mainly been about convenience and interconnectivity, but the next step is building a comprehensive and integrated ecosystem,” said Alfred Karlstetter, general manager of SolarEdge Europe. “By merging home devices with the value of smart solar energy through this integration with Vaillant, we are leading the way in making the power of smart solar energy more accessible, intuitive, and convenient for more people.”
The integration is expected to become available in the second half of this year.

It has announced a limited production run of what it calls “the world’s first bifacial solar panel utilizing an advanced thin film semiconductor.” The cells feature thin-film CdTe for the semiconductor.
The bifacial product line is now undergoing field and laboratory testing. It builds on the company’s Series 6 Plus monofacial modules, which were first launched in 2019.
First Solar's R&D teams have reportedly developed a transparent back contact for the module. This innovative feature allows infrared wavelengths of light to pass through the back of the module instead of being absorbed as heat. It also enables bifacial energy generation. The manufacturer said that this technology will reduce the operational temperature of the module and increase its specific energy yield.
“This module combines the quality, sustainability, reliability, and long-term performance of our Series 6 Plus platform with our first increment of bifaciality,” said Pat Buehler, chief product officer at First Solar. “Once commercialized, we expect Series 6 Plus Bifacial to represent the first real alternative to crystalline silicon-based bifacial technology, effectively combining bifaciality with the industry’s best warranted degradation rate, CdTe thin film’s ability to deliver more energy per nameplate watt, best-in-class reliability and durability, and innovative module design.”
The monofacial series 6 Plus modules have power ratings from 455 W to 480 W and up to 19.0% efficiency. They offer a 0.3% warranted degradation rate, spectral response, shading behavior, and an anti-reflective coating to enhance energy production.
“Moreover, unlike crystalline silicon (c-Si) panels, First Solar’s Series 6 Plus module does not experience losses from Light Induced Degradation (LID) and Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID),” said First Solar.
In October 2022, First Solar said that it would build a new R&D innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio. The facility will be completed in 2024 with a pilot manufacturing line to produce full-sized prototypes of thin-film and tandem PV modules.

The system includes a lattice-shaped floating PV array with four solar panels arranged in a dual-pitch configuration. This design reduces shading and wind loads while maintaining a streamlined profile, according to the scientists. The floaters are connected with a low-carbon mooring system using tethers that combine elastomeric elements and synthetic ropes. Splitters are employed to link one mooring tether to multiple floating modules, providing structural capacity and reducing the need for additional mooring lines.
“The floating PV arrays are electrically linked to each other via the floating linkage formed by the standard floats,” the researchers explained. “The generated power will be transmitted to a floating transformer stationed on the side for easy access via boats.”
The research group conducted tests on a scaled model of an array, featuring two orientations: 25 degrees and 0 degrees. The tests were carried out under regular and irregular wave conditions. The scientists said the array exhibited excellent motion performance, and noted that the 0-degree orientation outperformed the 25-degree orientation in terms of smaller extreme motion responses and lower mooring tensions. The system also did not show any contact between adjacent modules and was able to follow the waves with limited wave overtopping, according to the researchers.
“We have estimated the cost of the concept and are optimistic that it is more cost-effective than many other offshore floating concepts,” researcher Zhiyu Jiang told pv magazine.
The scientists introduced the new floating PV tech in “Design and model test of a soft-connected lattice-structured floating solar photovoltaic concept for harsh offshore conditions,” which was recently published in Marine Structures. The team includes academics from Norway's University of Agder, the Oslo Metropolitan University, the Polytechnic University of Madrid, the Offshore and Marine (LOOM) Research Institute in the United Kingdom, and Norwegian engineering group cDynamics AS.

The TOPBiHiKu7 panels feature 210 mm cells and are available in six versions, with nominal power ranging from 675 W to 700 W, and a power conversion efficiency of 21.7% to 22.5%. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 46.9 V to 47.9 V and the short-circuit current is 18.24 A to 18.49 A. They have an efficiency range of 26.1% to 27.0%, with a bifacial gain of 20%.
“Canadian Solar's TOPCon modules will increase the energy yield of PV systems and deliver one of the most competitive balance of system (BOS) cost savings and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar power plants, compared to PERC modules,” said the company.
The double-glass panels measure 2,384 x 1,303 x 33 mm and weigh 37.8 kg. They feature 2.0 mm heat-strengthened glass, with anti-reflective coating and another 2.0 mm glass layer at the back. The modules have IP68 junction boxes and anodized aluminum alloy frames. They can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and in temperatures ranging between -40 C and 85 C.
The temperature coefficient is -0.29% per degree Celsius. Canadian Solar claims that this ensures “better performance under hot environments compared to the mainstream products in the market.”
The PV panels come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 30 years is 0.4%, while degradation over the first year is capped at 1.0%.
In December 2022, Canadian Solar said that it would begin mass production of TOPCon solar modules by the first quarter of 2023.

It has 400 MW of projects under construction and a total pipeline of 1.5 GW, including projects that are currently being designed.
The France-based floating solar specialist has more than 280 projects installed in more than 30 countries, with a total capacity of 820 MW. It installed its first megawatt-scale projects in Japan in 2013.
Its portfolio now includes a 70 MW floating solar array in China, a 73.4 MW project in India, and an 88 MW installation on a protected stretch of seashore in Taiwan. It is currently building an extension of the Taiwan Changbin project, with a target of 192 MW.
“One of the main challenges for this extension is to manage the salty water effects on metallic parts with a very careful selection of materials with an anti-corrosion screw set solution,” it said in a statement.
Waves and tides pose challenges for anchoring in cyclonic zones. Ciel & Terre Taiwan has developed an innovative anchoring system that distributes loads based on tide levels.
Its other projects under construction include a 120 MW installation on a cascading reservoir.
“The site is actually quite challenging in terms of environmental loads considering the wave height, the water depth, the nature of the rocky lakebed, which are very specific to such type of application on dams,” said Ciel & Terre.
The company said it aims to deliver 2 GW of cumulative floating solar capacity by 2026.

India’s Gautam Solar is showcasing n-type TOPCon modules this week at Intersolar Europe in Munich, Germany, with a focus on the European market.
It will target the residential and commercial & industrial (C&I) segments with modules ranging from 420 Wp to 435 Wp, while utility-scale and large C&I customers will be served with modules ranging from 565 Wp to 580 Wp.
“Europe is an important market for Indian solar module manufacturers and our new products with higher efficiencies are ideal for Europe,” said Gautam Solar CEO Gautam Mohanka.
The 420 Wp and 435 Wp TOPCon modules come in four variants: all black, silver frame, glass-to-glass bifacial, and lightweight bifacial, meeting local size requirements.
The all-black panels have a black backsheet and black anodized aluminum alloy frame, contrasting with the traditional white backsheet and silver anodized aluminum alloy frame.
The glass-to-glass bifacial variant offers a rear-side gain of 10-30%. The combination of n-type TOPCon and bifacial technologies provides a 37% power increase.
The lightweight bifacial modules use a transparent backsheet for efficient rear-side power generation while maintaining a lightweight design. They feature 108 half-cut cells based on M10 wafers.
For utility-scale and large-scale C&I projects, the 565 Wp and 580 Wp modules have 144 half-cut cells based on an M10 wafer.
The company has also introduced all-black mono PERC modules with power outputs ranging from 400 Wp to 415 Wp.
“All of these modules incorporate round ribbon for better light utilization, non-destructive cell cutting for higher reliability and lower chances of micro-cracks, and half-cut cell technology for better low-light performance. The optimum module size using M10 cells ensures maximum space utilization in a standard 40 ft. container during transportation,” said Gautam Solar.
Gautam Solar is based out of New Delhi, with four factories in Haridwar. The advanced modules are produced at the company's manufacturing facilities in India. The company has a solar module capacity of 500 MWp and plans to expand to 1 GWp by September 2023.

The company plans to set up a new production line by early 2025, which could increase its production capacity by over 50%.
It estimates the capital investment would amount to more than €300 million ($324.4 million) and create more than 100 new jobs.  A “substantial” share of the investment would be directed to research and innovation to increase the purity of polysilicon by means of a new, highly automated process, Wacker said in a statement. This process should allow semiconductors to meet rules for smaller designs and increase their power.
Wacker has received approval from the European Commission for funding the R&D project. If the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Protection also approves the application, the company expects to receive up to €46 million in funding.
“As the only European producer of ultrapure polysilicon, we are proud to be making an important contribution to strengthening Europe’s microelectronics supply chain with this project,” said Wacker’s CEO Christian Hartel. “By expanding our surface-cleaning capacity, we are creating the necessary conditions for meeting the continued fast-growing demand of our semiconductor customers. Thanks to this investment, we are also able to take the quality of our material to the next level to support the semiconductor sector’s latest technologies,” he added.
Semiconductor-grade polysilicon is even purer than solar-grade polysilicon, at 99.999999999% purity level versus 99.9999%, respectively. Producing it involves an etching process using strong acids to remove the uppermost layer from the surface of the polysilicon chunk.
In March, Wacker announced it would expand its polysilicon capacity for semiconductor applications, in addition to production material for high-efficiency solar cells. The company plans to double its sales in the semiconductor sector by 2030 and has earmarked an investment of around €100 million per year over the next few years.

BayWa and its Groenleven subsidiary plan to build a pilot agrivoltaics plant on a farm in the Dutch province of Noord-Brabant in 2020, combining electricity production from solar and fruit cultivation. It is set to become one of Europe's largest projects. More than 24,000 elevated modules will be installed, with a total output of 8.7 MW.
“Because of the positive experience with the agrivoltaic application, [the farm owner] decided to equip his entire raspberry plantation with solar panels,” said BayWa.
BayWa said it believes that agrivoltaics could address challenges in Europe such as land scarcity, extreme weather, and growing demand for solar energy.
“The expansion of solar energy should be in harmony with agriculture and nature,” said Martin Schindele, head of product management Agri-PV. “Our flagship project proves that the PV modules protect crops and enable a resilient growing environment while reducing the use of single-use plastic covers.”
However, agrivoltaic projects are more expensive and require support from laws and funding. Benedikt Ortmann, global director solar projects at BayWa re, noted the need for legislative and financial support to promote agrivoltaics in Europe.
BayWa has completed 14 agrivoltaic projects in Europe where fruit is simultaneously produced. It has also started constructing an “interspace” agrivoltaics project in Spain, with solar modules installed close to the ground, parallel to the cultivated area.

Annual capacity additions are expected to hit 3.8 GW in 2023, up 13% from the previous year. In 2021, the market contracted by 68% to 4.2 GW of annual additions. But now, favorable policy frameworks, declining technology costs, and increasing electricity demand now point to growth opportunities in Southeast Asia.
“New capacity is well distributed across different countries and the regional market no longer depends on one single contributor, [i.e. Vietnam],” said the APVIA and the GSC.
However, uncertainty remains, as several countries are now at a turning point in their solar stories. The report said it remains to be seen just how quickly they can deploy solar. The region also faces challenges related to grid infrastructure, access to financing, land availability, and lack of a skilled workforce. According to the report’s “high” scenario, regional installations could hit 5.7 GW in 2023, or contract to 2.5 GW under a “low” scenario.
“Starting from 2024, a high pace of growth is expected across the region,” the APVIA and the GSC said. Annual installations are forecasted to grow 32% to reach 5.1 GW in 2024, 59% to 8.1 GW in 2025, 28% to 10.4 GW in 2026, finally hitting 13.3 GW of new additions in 2027, according to the report.
The region’s top five markets are Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia.

Scaling up manufacturing to meet Europe’s growing demand? That puts a smile on AD Huang's face, writes Marian Willuhn.
Huang founded BYD's battery box division eight years ago and says the company's Blade Battery which, hitherto, was only used in the company's vehicles, will now be used in the BYD Battery Box storage system for residential and commercial applications.
There are some advantages when it comes to energy density and performance as well as, safety – the Blade Battery cell has a bigger surface area to dissipate heat more efficiently. More importantly, however, putting the vehicle cells into stationary applications means it will be easier to meet skyrocketing demand.
BYD produces 250 GWh worth of batteries per year, only 5 GWh of which are currently destined for residential use.
Intersolar may not be a heating trade fair but there is still a lot of news to dig up on that industry right now, writes Cornelia Lichner.
SolarEdge, for example, focuses a lot on heat pumps and is showing a highly interesting, and automated, control system in Munich, with the SolarEdge One concept.
The company is breaking away from a previous focus on maximizing self-consumption and is optimizing electricity costs instead and unlocking new revenue streams for homeowners.
The prerequisite is that customers use dynamic electricity tariffs. Prices are automatically transmitted to the energy management system by SolarEdge. The energy manager creates a daily timetable for major consumers, such as heat pumps and wallboxes, by using the weather forecast, a consumption forecast based on user behavior, and expected electricity prices.
SolarEdge intends to publish a patented algorithm in a white paper in the near future to tap the full potential of residential PV systems, say Frank Bakker and Uri Furberg, from the company's product management division.
Thus far, home solar has not taken into account the sharp drop in electricity prices during midday hours or high prices in the early morning. With the new SolarEdge system, customers can even sell surplus energy at times of high grid need.
Stay tuned to pv-magazine.com today for breaking news about the SolarEdge One and partnerships with heating manufacturer Vaillant and Samsung's smartthings business.
And now here's a word from Valerio Natalizia, Managing Director of SMA South Europe, which is exhibiting at Intersolar:
“We are proud to participate in Intersolar 2023 which, in addition to being the largest exhibition
dedicated to solar power generation is also an opportunity to communicate with all our
stakeholders.
“In this regard, for the occasion, we will present the new Home Solution that includes the Sunny Boy Smart Energy, the single-phase hybrid inverter of SMA. But not only that, among the most important novelties, the new commercial storage solution will also be shown, which comes with innovative and high-quality software that will allow to store solar energy and use it flexibly and economically.
“The objective of the event is also to open a dialogue on topics of fundamental importance such as the energy transition that is increasingly an answer to the problem of climate change and the global energy crisis.
“We, at SMA, have always been sensitive to environmental issues, that is precisely why, every day, we strive to develop and complete projects in a sustainable way.”
Fraunhofer ISE’s booth reveals how the German research institute is focusing effort on the some of the more practical concerns that come with scaling up the solar industry to the numbers forecast for the end of the decade.
Solar’s problem with silver consumption is well known – at current levels the industry will soon need most of world’s supply of the precious metal, writes Mark Hutchins. Plenty of solutions are on the table though, and ISE looks to be evaluating and making progress with many of them.
The institute’s Florian Clement took pv magazine through the advantages of either replacing silver paste with copper in the widely-used screen printing process, or switching to an all-new copper plating method. It’s a matter of cell technology, with heterojunction better suited to screen printing, while the high temperature processing required for TOPCon [tunnel oxide passivated contact] cells means a switch to the more complex plating process will likely be necessary.
Time will tell which approaches make their way into commercial PV but it's encouraging to see progress on such an important issue.
The amount of land PV installations will require is another big question and here too ISE has answers – in the form of modules specially designed for agrivoltaics, with gaps between cells to allow light to pass through to plants cultivated beneath.
ISE scientist Benjamin Grübel explained that the size and frequency of the gaps can be customized according to needs of different crops. Colored modules for building-integrated PV, a car rooftop embedded with high efficiency back contact cells, and PV-integrated sound dampeners for highways and train tracks all offer ways in which Fraunhofer ISE is looking to minimize solar’s land requirements and integrate the technology into other parts of life.
With a possible revival of European PV manufacturing a major topic for discussion at Intersolar, two technology suppliers say that they have unlocked a major cell-to-module efficiency boost.
German production equipment suppliers Singulus and M10 Solar Equipment last week announced development of a combination of tools – for half-cut and shingled module production – that can result in a cell-to-module efficiency boost of up to 5%, verified by the Fraunhofer ISE.
Stefan Rinck, the veteran CEO of Singulus, said that the company had developed a plasma coating and cell handling technology to allow the edge of cells to be passivated after cutting without disturbing the cell surface. The passivation tool is called the Generis and it was unveiled last week.
“The efficiency gain is enormous as we can gain back the losses introduced by the laser cutting [of the cell],” said Rinck. The high-throughput version of the Generis can process 3 GW of cells per year, with the single tool, he added. “With a small investment in such a small machine, a gain of efficiency of 1% is enormous.”
M10 managing director Philipp Zahn. said that when Generis is coupled with the M10 Surface stringer, and with a “matrix” layout, cell-to-module efficiency can be boosted by 5%.
“This combination will reach an outstanding efficiency grade that has not been available on the market before,” said Zahn. “It must be a must” for shingle module makers, he added.
But if a module maker is targeting the 3 GW of production from the single Generis, it has to be added to 20 of the Surface stringers, Zahn acknowledged – which is a lot of surface in anyone’s book.
Viessmann, the German heating manufacturer that has just been bought by Carrier, is showing its latest heat pumps in Hall B1 of Intersolar and demonstrating how they can be integrated into home energy management systems, writes Cornelia Lichner.
Since Viessmann offers battery storage, inverters, solar modules, wall boxes and heat pumps in a package, control comes directly via the One Base app, with no additional controller needed.
Based on a forecast of energy generation and house consumption, the self-learning energy manager draws up a plan for the use of solar power, stores any surpluses in the battery and in the hot water storage tank, and registers when residents leave the house and turn down the heating.
The large Vitocal 250A, for the modernization of existing buildings, and the Vitocal 222-SI – for new builds – are being launched this summer.
The 250A reaches flow temperatures of up to 70 degrees. The Vitocal 222-SI is nicknamed “the Invisible” because, with an installation depth of only 28 cm, it can be hidden behind paneling or in niches to save space. Both run on the new refrigerant propane.
Viessmann Product Distribution Manager for E-Systems, Marc Franken, tells pv magazine the company wants to halve installation times with the new products. The pre-assembled units can be hung on rails on the wall and can be easily connected to an outdoor unit and floor heating.
He calculates, a heat pump in a new building could be installed in only one day, in the future, instead of two.
Proposed legislation which will enable the construction of direct lines for renewables to bypass the grid and also enact “cable pooling” – when solar and wind share the same connection point – is likely to be adopted this year, says lawyer Piotr Mrowiec. This could drive solar installations in Poland to new highs, writes Marija Maisch.
According to Mrowiec, the country is likely to emerge as the second largest market in Europe, up from the third place in 2022. This year will be marked by the rapid deployment of utility scale PV, after emerging from sluggish, years-long permitting processes. “There are a lot of projects in the range from 70-100 MW that are nearing completion,” says Mrowiec.
While seen as one of the most promising power purchase agreement (PPA) markets in Europe, the price ceiling set in November stopped PPA-backed solar in its tracks. Current PPA prices in Poland are much lower than the revenue cap set by the EU and stand at around PLN 240 ($58).
“We hope for this cap to be scrapped by the end of the year, further speeding up PV deployment in Poland,” Mrowiec adds.
Congratulations to @wallboxchargers for winning one of the @ThesmarterE awards!

Electricity goes in and the sun stays out. That is the concept behind these solar blinds from new company Solar Storen, writes Marian Willuhn.
Founder Andreas Rahn explains how Solar Storen glues and strings solar cells onto carbon blinds. After the process, the cells will be covered with liquid glass – a clear resin – to keep them in place and protect them. He says the company is quite flexible, when it comes to cell choice. Newer tech can be seamlessly integrated into the blind manufacturing process. For now, they are still looking for a partner for the cells. Next stop: a commercial-ready product.
Why do they use carbon fiber, like you see on sports cars? Not for the sporty looks. Unlike aluminum, carbon will not expand under the heat of the sun. That will keep the cells intact, Rahn says.

Solar giant Longi is setting up for some fun in the sun that's not just modules, on the grass between halls A2 and B2 at Messe Munich.
With the company signing up as the ATP Tour's official solar energy and hydrogen partner, some outdoor racquet challenges have been set up to encourage friendly competition and games of skill.
pv magazine is pleased to report editor Tristan Rayner served up a clean winner, after only several dozen attempts…
Short of the perfect reading material as you peruse this year's show? Pop along to the pv magazine booth, at A2.250, and grab yourself a copy of the latest edition of the magazine.
In the June issue, we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
A little worse for wear after last night's tram party, Mark Hutchins has opted to start the morning sitting quietly at the back of the conference, where Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin's Rutger Schlatmann kicked off the day with a look to the future and the technologies promising a big jump in solar cell and module performance.
Schlatmann reminded the audience “innovation is not guaranteed” and said plenty of policy support is still needed to make perovskites, and other new technology, a commercial reality. He also had plenty of figures to share which illustrated the massive potential of innovative solar. It'll be exciting to see which of these we might find on the exhibition floor this year.
In March, the EU removed some of the obstacles preventing member states subsidizing solar manufacturers, writes Jonathan Gifford. State aid rules were loosened for items including solar modules and wind turbines.
The move came in the form of an amendment to the European Commission’s Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF). While promise is big, however, there appear to remain serious hurdles for the support required for an expansion of PV manufacturing further upstream, according to Dries Acke, Policy Director at SolarPower Europe.
Obstacles include the level of documentary evidence required for “matching subsidies” and a requirement project subsidies must be provided by three EU member states.
“We have told the commission that we understand their position but we’re not happy,” said Acke. He noted the EU executive’s DG Competition – the body tasked with assessing applications for approval of state aid to solar manufacturing projects – has shown a willingness to be flexible but has found itself in “uncharted territory.” The organization is looking to work with manufacturing project proponents in overcoming the regulatory hurdles at European level.
“Matching subsidies” are particularly attractive under the TCTF, said Acke, as they offer the opportunity to access subsidies commensurate with what they would receive in “non EEA [European Economic Area] countries,” such as India or the United States. However, proving precisely what subsidies are on offer elsewhere is far from straightforward.
A final impediment for solar manufacturing to expand upstream from module, to cell, wafer, and even ingot production, is the commission’s refusal to allow member states to provide subsidies for operational expenses (opex) such as energy and materials. At present, the TCTF only applies to capital subsidies (capex) for the construction and equipping of solar factories.
Sometimes it takes a voice from beyond the border to deliver a message of inspiration, writes Jonathan Gifford. This certainly was the case as the first day of The smarter E conference drew to a close in Munich yesterday.
With Ukrainian and EU flags greeting arrivals to the event, Dan Shugar, CEO and founder of tracker supplier Nextracker delivered an inspiring message. Asked whether he believed the current geopolitical instability will favor or hinder renewable energy development in Europe, his answer was unequivocal.
“I am just appalled by Putin’s aggression in Ukraine,” Shugar said. “There has never been a better opportunity to significantly increase the penetration of renewables as it basically stops one of the most atrocious things that has been committed in my lifetime,” he added, referring to the opportunity for Europe to end its dependency on Russian gas.
Addressing potential roadblocks to an expansion of solar well beyond the 20% annual growth rate that had been forecast for Europe earlier in the conference session, Shugar said near-shoring manufacturing has a role to play in gaining community acceptance and, therefore, municipal approvals in his home market of the United States.
“The IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] has been the most significant piece of environmental policy ever,” said Shugar. “What we have done, in Nextracker, is a massive expansion of manufacturing capacity in the United States and this has been very well received. It helps us and our customers to get their projects permitted because the municipalities involved in the permitting see the opportunity that is happening.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/14/chinese-pv-executives-reportedly-detained-by-police-in-munich/,"EVENTS,LEGAL,WORLD",VINCENT SHAW,"JUNE 14, 2023",Chinese PV executives reportedly detained by police in Munich,"“It has been confirmed that the person involved is only assisting in the investigation and has now returned to the hotel,” the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) said on the Chinese-language WeChat social media platform on Tuesday morning. “This time, only one person is confirmed in assisting in the investigation, not involving multiple Chinese PV companies rumored online, and there were no cases where multiple personnel assisted the investigation.”
Yicai, a financial media outlet in China, had previously quoted the German police as confirming the arrest of at least one individual upon arrival in Munich on a Lufthansa flight from Shanghai. The detained individual was then reportedly brought before a judge at the Augsburg district court, and the prosecutor's office issued a pre-trial detention order. However, the charges were later suspended due to certain unspecified conditions, Yicai reported, citing the German police.
pv magazine has attempted to contact the German authorities, but has yet to receive a response.
“Energy Yanjiuyuan,” a WeChat user, led much of the coverage of the detainment. It was later reported by other Chinese media outlets that the detained individuals are associated with Jetion Solar (Jetion Solar), Jiangsu Runda PV (Runda Solar), and Jiangsu Green Power PV (GPPV), which are subsidiaries of China National Building Material (CNBM).
One witness – an executive of an undisclosed Chinese PV company who arrived on the same flight – told Shanghai Securities News that another Chinese PV executive, affiliated with an unnamed Chinese PV module manufacturer, had also been detained by German police at the Munich airport
Industry analysts in China said the detainments could be related to visa issues, intellectual property concerns, or past trade compliance matters. The incident has raised concerns within the Chinese PV industry, according to Chinese sources.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/14/treatment-promises-1000-hour-stability-for-solar-perovskites/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 14, 2023",Treatment promises 1000-hour stability for solar perovskites,"Scientists have developed an additive and treatment for perovskite solar cells, which alters their chemical structure and reduces the effects of defects and degradation mechanisms. Cells that underwent the treatment achieved initial efficiencies around 24% and maintained 98% of this after 1,000 hours of ‘1 sun’ illumination. Reference cells produced without the treatment had lost 35% of their initial performance after just 200 hours under the same illumination.
The cells also fared well under high temperature testing, retaining 97.6% of initial efficiency after more than 500 h exposed at 60 C. In this test the reference cells lost 27% of initial performance in the same conditions. The treatment and testing of the cells is described in full in the paper “Covalent bonding strategy to enable non-volatile organic cation perovskite for highly stable and efficient solar cells,” published in Joule.
The scientists used various imaging techniques to understand how their treatment worked, concluding that bis diazirine, a polymer material present in the additive, formed covalent bonds with the organic element of the perovskite material. “…the covalent bonding strategy facilitates the ions’ immobilization, inhibits the escape of organic components, and eliminates the metallic Pb. Hence, it reveals enhanced thermal, illumination-resisting, and electrical bias-resisting properties of perovskites.”
With further characterization, simulations, and comparison to devices built without the treatment, the group was able to observe the covalent bonding strategy in action and confirm its role in reducing various undesirable effects that lead to performance loss in perovskite solar cells, as well as contributing to their initial performance by reducing the appearance of defects. “This work suggests a novel and effective strategy to confine the loss of organic components from perovskites to realize highly efficient and ultra-stable perovskite solar cells.”
The cells in the study were produced using spin-coating – a process commonly used in laboratories, but not suitable for large-scale production. However, a company spun out of Victoria University in Canada, Xlynx Materials, has begun marketing the treatment under the name BondLynx, and is inviting companies working to commercialize perovskite solar cells to collaborate on further projects or to purchase the materials for use in their own trials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/14/asia-leads-charge-in-renewable-energy-growth/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA",,"JUNE 14, 2023",Asia leads charge in renewable energy growth,"Asia is home to more than 50 percent of the world's population, and in recent years, the region has experienced phenomenal economic growth. With the rise of local economies, the energy demand in the region is increasing faster than anywhere else in the world. Even though the power markets on the continent are tremendously diverse, they share one thing in common: a positive forecast for power demand.
Governments in the region have outlined aspirational plans to accelerate the development of renewable energy. As a result of these efforts, Asia has surpassed North America and Europe in terms of its renewable energy generation.
IRENA’s report Renewable Capacity Statistics 2023 shows that in 2022, Asia accounted for nearly 60 percent of the worldwide increase in renewable energy generating capacity, resulting in a total of 1.63 Terawatt (TW) of renewable capacity by year end. A huge part of this increase occurred in China. The country makes up the lion’s share of global renewable energy, adding 141 GW to the continent’s new capacity. With its commitment to achieve net-zero emission by 2060, the country is one of the key destination for renewable-energy development. There are several factors boosting the impact of renewables on China’s energy landscape, such as decline in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) which is happening hand in hand with an expansion of emerging technologies.
“Thanks to China’s “30/60 dual-carbon” ambition and its targets imposed on energy state-owned-enterprises and local governments, as well as the robust development of local supply chain, wind and solar installed capacity has increased massively in 2022, setting a record high regardless of the pandemic impact,” said Sharon Feng, Research and Advisory Service Director, Azure International.
Meanwhile, the Middle East recorded its largest increase in renewable energy capacity to date last year, commissioning 3.2 gigawatts of new capacity, reflecting a 12.8 percent increase, the report said.
“With a 12.8 percent growth rate in installed capacity of renewable energy, albeit from a relatively low starting base of 25.3GW, the Middle East region has a significant transition ahead to achieve the Paris commitments and net zero targets some countries have committed to,” said Mohammed Atif, Area Manager Middle East, DNV. “A firm pledge to the right policy, regulation and financing frameworks is going to be essential to drive additional renewable capacity growth. COP28 will be a pivotal inflection point for accelerated transformation,” he added.
Globally, renewable capacity grew by 9.6 percent in 2022, adding a record 295 GW worldwide. This accounts for 83 percent of all power capacity added last year and brings the global renewable generation capacity to 3,372 GW by the end of last year, the report said.
