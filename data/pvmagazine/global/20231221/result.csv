Waaree Energies, India’s largest PV module manufacturer, said this week that it will set up its first US manufacturing facility close to Houston, Texas. The solar module factory, to be built in the town of Brookshire, will have an initial annual production capacity of 3 GW by the end of 2024.
Waaree said it plans to invest up to $1 billion over the next four years to scale the US facility’s capacity up to 5 GW by 2027 – potentially making it one of the largest solar module factories in the United States.
The company said it will also add an integrated solar cell facility at the site. It plans to make it operational by 2025.
In total, Waaree’s new production plan is expected to create more than 1,500 total jobs, once it is at full capacity.
Waaree already has a major presence in the US solar market. It said it has supplied more than 4 GW of modules from its current Indian facility to US customers to date.
Waaree’s ambitious US expansion plan has the support of a long-term supply agreement with SB Energy, which has more than 2 GW of solar in operation, 1 GW under construction, and another 15 GW of solar and storage in development across the United States.
Waaree aims to supply multiple gigawatts of solar modules to SB Energy over the next five years, following the commissioning of the Brookshire facility, which is expected to be operational in 2024.
Most of the major components used for the production of the solar modules will be sourced domestically, said Waaree.

The researchers said their new IBC4EU solar cell was designed in accordance with the polyZEBRA concept.
“The polyZEBRA concept is an n-type tunnel back contact (TBC) solar cell featuring polycrystalline silicon TOPCon contacts on both polarities,” ISC Konstanz researcher Jonathan Linke told pv magazine. “The entire process is compatible with industrially established tools, in particular the patterning of the IBC structure is done by laser processes and the metallization by screen-printing. The process is compatible with copper screen printing.”
According to the researchers, the mean efficiency of the cell in a batch of 16 cells was 23.7% efficiency. These results have so far not been confirmed by an independent third-party entity.
The previous maximum efficiency of the device was 23.4%.
“Our goal is to reach soon an efficiency of 25% and an open-circuit voltage of 735 mV,” said Radovan Kopecek, the co-founder and director of ISC Konstanz. “We are working with FuturaSun on industrialization.”
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Kopecek said that interdigitated back contact (IBC) cell tech could account for half of the global market for solar modules by 2030. He says IBC will start to dominate once TopCON and HJT get stuck at certain efficiency limits, and he believes that TOPCon will be the first to fall.

Germany installed 1,183 MW of new PV capacity in November, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). This compares to 1,231 MW in October and 675 MW in November 2022.
In the first 11 months of this year, developers connected 13.18 GW of solar to the grid, compared to 6.8 GW in the same period a year earlier. The country's cumulative solar capacity surpassed 80.74 GW at the end of November.
To achieve the nation's target of 215 GW by 2030, the pace would still have to increase and an average of 1.58 GW per month would be required.
Of the newly registered capacity in November, almost 413 MW came from projects selected tenders. Almost 628 MW are represented by rooftop PV systems operating under the feed-in tariff scheme or direct marketing.
Another 128 MW comes from ground mounted projects, with the remaining 15 MW being represented by other system typologies.

Called Advanced Regeneration Technology, the new technique consists of applying intense light and controlled temperature on the solar cells to excite the polysilicon molecules and make them move quickly. This reportedly changed their arrangement and “patches up” the holes caused by light, heat and humidity.
“The process is akin to patching holes in a bucket; it repairs solar panels to prevent energy leakage, ensuring optimal light energy collection,” the scientists said, noting that the process is implemented via a high intensity illumination device that can roll itself over the photovoltaic modules. “The process takes less than five minutes and can help treated solar panels recover up to 5% of their lost field performance.”
The research group claims that this process may reduce module degradation by up to 5 years, depending on the cell technology.
The device may also be used on-site in either rooftop PV systems or ground-mounted PV plants and may be applied to around 90% of the solar modules available in the market.
According to EtaVolt's website, the new regeneration technology is based on a proprietary combination of illumination, temperature, and regeneration time. It can also reportedly provide light-induced degradation (LID) mitigation and recovery.
“Our solar rejuvenation method has not only been rigorously tested and validated but has shown field-proven results in various commercial applications. The technology has been successfully implemented in projects with major partners in the solar industry, such as renewable energy solutions firm Vector Green, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for widespread adoption,” said NTU Singapore researcher Stanley Wang.
The research team did not reveal more technical details about the device. “These technologies developed at NTU have been patented through NTUitive, the University’s innovation and enterprise company and are licensed to EtaVolt,” it stated.

The “G5” system is designed for offshore applications. It provides options for installation angles of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 12 degrees, and 15 degrees.
“The high-density polyethylene (HDPE) floats used in the system are suited for a variety of water bodies, they are pollution-free, and have a lifespan of over 25 years,” the company said. “They also are interoperable with all of the primary solar components on the market.”
In addition to the HDPE, the floating structure features aluminum alloy support legs. The floating PV array uses rails made of magnesium-aluminum-zinc and aluminum alloy to hold the solar panels. It also includes stainless steel fasteners.
“For improved overall stability, the connection between the floats now uses an embedded fixed structure and plastic anti-loose bolts/nuts,” Mibet said. “With a buoyancy of more than 150 kg/m2, the size of individual floats has been increased to improve overall buoyancy.”
The company said that the new system can withstand wind gusts of over 60 meters per second, snow loads of 1 kN/m2, temperatures between -40 C and +85 C, and a pH level of 4.
“Because it is a modular product, it may be expanded in a variety of ways, including with patterns like parallel double rows or symmetrical double rows,” the company said.

A new report released by Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO, shows that renewables, led by solar and onshore wind, remain the cheapest form of new-build power generation in Australia even after including transmission and storage costs needed to manage their variable output.
The 2023-24 GenCost draft report, an annual collaboration between the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), shows that new build costs across the board have generally stabilised since the 20% increase reported last year, albeit with some outliers.
The cost of large-scale PV generation fell by 8%, while onshore wind rose by the same proportion. Battery costs were steady, rising only 2%, offshore wind decreased by 9%, and the cost of gas turbine technologies increased by 14%.
Costs for technologies such as pumped hydro, wave and tidal energy increased after not been updated in more than a year, reflecting a combination of new information and inflationary pressures.
Nuclear small modular reactors (SMRs) emerged as the highest-cost technology explored in the report with the CSIRO suggesting it will take another 15 years before the first one could be built.
The report reveals that utility-scale solar and onshore wind costs, including transmission and storage, are two to seven times cheaper than new coal and small modular nuclear reactors.

The CSIRO said the drafting considers inputs sourced on real-time engineering and construction cost data points in Australia, as well as overseas parallels, information from equipment manufacturers, software and literature.
The new report also incorporates pre-2030 integration costs, such as storage and transmission for variable renewables in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) data. This addresses the concern that leaving out pre-2030 projects underestimates the cost of the renewable transition.
While the change has led to higher cost estimates, variable renewables were still found to have the lowest cost range of any new-build technology.
Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the report reaffirms that “renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy in Australia now and in 2030, even when accounting for storage and transmission costs.”
“Its conclusions this year are unimpeachable and very, very clear,” he said. “The cheapest form of energy is renewable energy, even including the costs that go with renewable energy around storage and transmission. Even including those costs, it’s very, very clear renewable energy is the cheapest.”
CSIRO Director of Energy Dietmar Tourbier said the report is one of several economic analysis documents designed to help the Australian energy market plan for future electricity generation, with technology costs a crucial piece of the larger puzzle.
“GenCost uses the best available data in each cycle to provide important insights into our electricity market that are unbiased and up to date,” he said. “As we work to reduce our emissions, GenCost plays a pivotal role in guiding decision-makers to plan and build reliable, low-cost energy solutions that will help power the future of Australia.”
The draft report is open for consultation until 9 February 2024 with the final GenCost 2023-24 report expected to be released in the second quarter of 2024.

“NEStore is an optimal solution for homes or buildings with PV systems and can be combined with heat pumps and gas boilers,” a spokesperson told pv magazine.
The system features a patented 3 cm thin vacuum insulation and a design that reduces the number of thermal bridges.
“This combination ensures that the system minimizes downtime losses to 1% per day,” the spokesperson said. “The good insulation the water temperature, without causing high temperatures energy losses.”
The system is available in two versions, with water volumes of 214 liters and 320 liters and energy storage capacities of 20 kWh and 29 kWh.
The smallest product measures 1,650 mm x 590 mm and weighs 154 kg. The largest version measures 2,050 mm x 590 mm, and weighs 190 kg.
For both systems, the voltage is 230 V and the setpoint temperature is between 55 C and 110 C. The heat loss for the first system is estimated at 1.44% per day, while for the second system is 1.35% per day.
According to the manufacturer, the 20 kWh product can heat 600 liters of tap water to 40 C, which it said is enough for around a 1.5-hour shower or provide up to four days of hot water for a family of four persons.
“The NEStore charges when there is surplus power from the solar panels, or based on the most favorable dynamic energy rates,” the spokesperson went on to say, noting that the system can be installed in either existing or new buildings.
The thermal battery costs between €200 ($218.80)/kWh and €250/kWh.
“That's way down the costs of electric home batteries sold at approximately €750/kWh to €1,000/kWh and above the costs of a standard electric hot water boiler at about €140€/kWh,” the spokesperson said.
Newton Energy Solutions began selling the thermal batteries in July and plans to increase its production capacity in 2024.

Switzerland installed more than 1.5 GW of PV systems this year. This corresponds to market growth of more than 40%, according to provisional figures from Swissolar. It said that annual growth has increased sixfold since 2017.
The country added around 1 GW of new PV in 2022 and about 683 MW in 2021
The solar association attributed this year's performance to rebates for small and medium-sized ground-mounted PV systems, contributing to 28.5% year-on-year growth in the rooftop segment, with energy prices identified as the main factor by Swissolar.
At the end of 2023, Switzerland will likely reach about 6.2 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity, according to Swissolar. The association said the country will cover around 10% of its electricity demand with solar in 2024.
The industry association expects additional market growth of 10% for the coming year. Switzerland is therefore on the right path to increase expansion to more than 2 GW per year in 2027, when 35 TWh of solar power will likely be consumed every year.

Researchers at Georgia Tech have discovered a new factor in perovskite solar cell stability that could enable the development of more stable, longer-term perovskites. The research, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, is a first step toward solving one of the main issues in metal halide perovskite development: degradation. 
Perovskite solar cells are an emerging category of photovoltaic materials that are lauded for their ability to be deposited in extremely thin films, allowing the material to be deployed in a wide variety of use cases. Though these cells have now achieved efficiencies that compete with traditional silicon solar cells widely used today, they suffer from rapid efficiency degradation from the elements.
Using X-ray to examine the perovskites’ crystal structures’ reactions to both water and oxygen, the researchers discovered that degradation occurs due to an interplay of oxygen and water molecules. When isolated individually, however, neither oxygen nor water caused rapid degradation seen when both are present.

The Georgia Tech team developed a thin water-repellent layer for the perovskite cells using a material called phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The researchers found that PEAI was sufficient to stabilize the perovskites structure and conversion efficiency.
However, further research is needed to optimize PEAI layers. While the material does well to repel water, it struggles with thermal stability. The Georgia Tech researchers said finding a way to support thermal stability for PEAI layers is the next step in their pathway toward making commercially viable perovskites.
“Industry is already very interested, with companies around the United States popping up and trying to commercialize this,” said Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, assistant professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Tech. “All the technology that we’re creating here at Georgia Tech is eventually going to be able to be translated into industry.”
Correa-Baena said that perovskites are useful not only for photovoltaic applications, but for other technologies that require light transmission.
“Perovskites have the potential of not only transforming how we produce solar energy, but also how we make semiconductors for other types of applications like LEDs or phototransistors,” said Correa-Baena. “We can think about them for applications in quantum information technology, such as light emission for quantum communication. These materials have impressive properties that are very promising.”

Enphase Energy, a distributed energy solutions provider, has filed a statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission outlining plans to restructure and consolidate its business. The company said the moves are designed to increase operational efficiencies, reduce operational costs, and better align its workforce with current market conditions.
Macroeconomic conditions like high interest rates and policy changes like California’s NEM 3.0 have pushed down demand for residential solar in 2023, weighing on the share prices of Enphase and its competitors.
The plan calls for a reduction of its global workforce by about 10%, affecting about 350 contractors and employees. It will also cease operations at contract manufacturing locations in Romania and in the state of Wisconsin.
“We are looking to cut expenses further by consolidating facilities across our worldwide sites to reduce our real-estate footprint, minimizing capital purchases and … extending the hiring and travel freeze through 2024,” said Chief Executive Officer Badri Kothandaraman.
The filing said the company will focus on manufacturing with its two existing partners in South Carolina and Texas. Once these two sites are have fully ramped production, Enphase expects to have a global production capacity of 7.25 million microinverters per quarter, about 5 million of which will be manufactured in the United States.
Overall the restructuring is expected to reduce the company’s manufacturing capacity from 11 million units per quarter to about 7.25 million, with US capacities remaining flat.
“Over the last few months, we have made significant efforts to reduce our operating costs, but we have more work to do to right-size our operations and become leaner and more efficient,” said Kothandaraman.
The company expects to incur about $16 million to $18 million in costs from the restructuring, most of which will be incurred in the fourth quarter.
“Our focus in the first half of 2024 will be on clearing the excess inventory in the channel worldwide,” said Kothandaraman. “However, we see that there is greater confidence in the US Federal Reserve cutting the interest rate next year, and we hope this leads to growth in the back half of the year.”
Raghu Belur, co-founder and chief products officer for Enphase told pv magazine USA in a exclusive interview that he expects 2024 to be a year of recovery for residential solar.

Yet, the silo approach to energy seems to be the most common in the discussions.
To address this problem, RES4Africa calls for integrated policy actions where energy, water and food intersect and interconnect. Recognizing the intertwined connection as a cross-cutting challenge that needs to be tackled in an integrated way could reduce risk, and ensure long-term emissions target reduction.
The urgency of addressing the challenges of climate change can accelerate the path towards a green and inclusive transition, by turning climate change from a water-energy-food nexus crisis to a nexus opportunity. This can happen through several PV technologies, including desalination coupled with renewables, PV shading for horticulture, and solar irrigation.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) expects solar energy development to be the dominant renewable source of electricity by 2050. The solar PV global cumulative installed capacity is expected to rise to 8,519 GW by 2050 compared to 480 GW in 2018 and reach 151 GW in 2040 in North Africa.
Solar desalination
RES4Africa has recently published reports on financing water-energy-food-nexus and the different business models and applications Desalination coupled with renewables
Desalination currently with solar PV photovoltaics is a very widespread PV technology. It provides a promising direction for the future of water supply as a carbon-free and less energy-intensive option. This is even more true for countries where water scarcity and high availability of renewable energy sources coincide, such as Morocco. The country is endowed with tremendous solar energy potential, solid leadership in the installation and management of renewable energies, and the technical capacity to explore new advancements in the field.
Moreover, this solution also appears cost-effective, given the rising prices of fossil fuels and the stable cost of PV. Morocco has a relatively low desalination capacity compared to other countries in the region; nevertheless, in 2021, the government declared the aim to achieve long-term desalination production by announcing nine new plants, expected to produce an additional water capacity of 397 Mm3/year, representing over a 500% growth rate between 2020 and 2030 and 97% of the new capacity is disclosed to be coupled with renewable sources.
Agrivoltaics
Agrivoltaics combine agriculture and the generation of solar energy in the same location, adapting them to each other. RES4Africa strongly believes that combining agriculture and solar panels on the same land will allow countries in the region to harvest the sun twice, ease water stress, and land use competition while enhancing the food security of a rapidly growing population.
Globally, agrivoltaics are a confirmed practice, while in the southern Mediterranean, it remains embryonic: pilot projects – funded by EU and UN agencies – are underway in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, and Jordan, to assess the compatibility, efficiency, and profitability for energy and agriculture production. Deploying agrivoltaics in these countries can only happen with a political commitment from governments and institutions.
Nations like France, Korea, Germany, and Japan, among others, have politically declared their interest in agrivoltaics, explicitly outlining its benefits to co-locate solar power generation and crop production. This strategic commitment enabled the speedy application of the system in the countries, and the incorporation of agrivoltaics across national strategies, plans, and policy tools, with growing public support.
