The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union agreed to expand the uptake of sustainable fuels, such as advanced biofuels or hydrogen, in the aviation sector. The European Parliament said that beginning in 2025, a minimum of 2% of aviation fuels will be green. This percentage will progressively increase every five years to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, 34% by 2040, 42% by 2045, and ultimately reach 70% by 2050. The informal deal still needs to be approved by the Council Committee of Permanent Representatives and Parliament’s Transport and Tourism Committee, and then the European Council and the European Parliament.

2,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/05/standard-energy-unveils-vanadium-ion-battery-with-1-degradation/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,2024-03-05,Standard Energy unveils vanadium-ion battery with 1% degradation,"South Korea-based Standard Energy has developed a battery with just 1% degradation after 20,000 testing cycles. The company uses vanadium-ion batteries (ViB).
It showcased the ViB at the recent Smart Energy Week in Tokyo. The company's chief project and marketing officer, Gyucheol Lee, said that 10 years ago, the company was developing vanadium-redox flow batteries. However, this type of battery could never get above 80% roundtrip efficiency, as electric pumps were needed to move large amounts of electrolyte from tank to tank.
The company therefore shifted its focus to using vanadium in the same fashion as lithium – as an ion battery. Vanadium is an exciting candidate for cathode materials, Lee said, because it has many dispensable electrons in its atoms and features four ionic states. Multiple ionic states allow its electrons to move without the material changing from metal to ion state between charging and discharging. According to Lee, the change from metal to ion state promotes cathode-electrolyte-interphase growth – the principal degradation mode in lithium-ion batteries.
With no metal dissolution occurring in vanadium-ion batteries, the company has tested its batteries in its laboratory. Cycling them at a strenuous C-rate of 3, with 100% depth of discharge for 20,000 cycles, the company noted a degradation of just 1%.
In addition to this superior cycling life, the batteries are also said to be safer than their lithium-ion competitors. Standard Energy can use aqueous electrolytes in its batteries, rendering them virtually non-flammable. The current product also boasts a high-power delivery of a C-rate of 5, with a roundtrip efficiency of 96 %, according to test data.
High C-rates are only wanted sometimes. There are various requirements for energy and power delivery between different applications. Lee said vanadium-ion batteries do not require a change in cathode design, as with lithium-ion batteries – referring to the other use cases of LFP, NMC, and NCA batteries. Vanadium-ion batteries could be designed to deliver 10-hour duration storage for PV and wind systems or 5 C for UPS and frequency regulation without a change in their cathode design.
There are some drawbacks, however. Lee said vanadium is much heavier than lithium, making his batteries only usable in stationary applications, like large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) and residential storage systems.
Another issue is cost. At present, vanadium is very expensive. The price has risen 20-fold since the company started developing the product. With the startup-like production capacity and high resource prices, the batteries cost around double what competitively priced lithium-ion batteries cost.
Lee said he hopes the product will become more competitively priced when the company's planned gigafactory starts operations in two years. He said he also thinks that vanadium prices could come down again. Vanadium is not scarce, with large quantities available in Australia, China, and South Korea. New mining projects could bring down the price of raw materials.
The company started selling its products in South Korea in December 2023. So far, it has sold 10 MWh of batteries. Standard Energy sells complete systems and helps project developers and engineering contractors with installation and system design. The company is now waiting for certification for use in Japanese grids. European certification could take another two to five years, but is now in the planning stage, said Lee.

The deal was reached by unspecified “negotiators,” but it will have to be approved by the European Parliament and the European Council. The new rules will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union one day after approval. EU member countries will have three years to enforce the new provisions.
“According to the agreed text, national authorities or, if third countries are involved, the EU Commission, will investigate suspected use of forced labor in companies’ supply chains,” said the EU Parliament in a press release. “If the investigation concludes that forced labor has been used, the authorities can demand that relevant goods be withdrawn from the EU market and online marketplaces, and confiscated at the borders.”
At the request of parliament, the European Commission will draw up a list of specific economic sectors in specific geographical zones where forced labor reportedly exists. This will become a standard for evaluating the need to open investigations.
According to the agreed text, the bloc will investigate suspicions about the use of forced labor in companies. If an investigation concludes that forced labor has occurred, the authorities will demand that the merchandise be withdrawn from the European market and confiscated at the border. The confiscated products will have to be donated, recycled, or destroyed.
“A new Forced Labour Single Portal would be set up to help enforce the new rules,” the press release said. “It includes guidelines, information on bans, database of risk areas and sectors, as well as publicly available evidence and a whistleblower portal. A Union Network Against Forced Labour Products would help to improve cooperation between authorities.”
The Internal Market and International Trade Committees of the European Parliament approved the draft regulation in October.

French associations Brier’energie and RECIT are deploying photovoltaic shades above a cemetery as part of a collective self-consumption operation. The project will supply electricity from the summer of 2025 to the 4,000 inhabitants of the commune of Saint-Joachim, Pays de la Loire, France.
About 420 citizens have agreed to pay an entry fee of €5 ($5.20) to become consumers of the energy that will be produced by the shades.
“Made up of 5,000 photovoltaic panels, the future plant will extend over 8,000 m2 and offer a power of 1.3 MW,” Éric Boquaire, the president of Brier’energie, told pv magazine France.
In addition to producing electricity, the PV shade structures will prevent the flooding of the cemetery, which is located in a marshy area, by collecting rainwater for a neighboring sports complex.
The municipality will fully finance the €3.35 million ($3.6 million) installation, using tax capital gains from a 7% property tax increase due to inflation, redistributed to the community.
The facility will equitably share the electricity produced without favoring or penalizing any consumers.
“It will be necessary to constantly manage the power stream from and to the grid on the one hand, but also to establish distribution rules between participants, by defining distribution rules,” said Boquaire.
The two standard distribution parameters proposed by French grid operator Enedis – static or dynamic by default – were not suitable and it was necessary to come up with one capable of ensuring equal treatment between every participant.
“We have defined a dynamic citizen distribution module according to the following rule: one consumer – the same right to consume, with redistribution of the surplus,” said Boquaire. “This key is not based on mathematics, but on an algorithm that must be created from scratch.”
A dedicated company will calculate encrypted data, collected every 30 minutes from hundreds of users. Every month, it will send Enedis a summary sheet of results, enabling deductions for participating subscribers' invoices.
The next stage of the project will concern the assembly of a prototype from March 18 on a small part of the cemetery (180 square meters), to check the integration of the future solar plant into its environment. According to Brier'energie, the operation should enable participants to save an average of €150 to €250 on their annual electricity bills.

5,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/05/first-attempt-to-build-perovskite-solar-cell-based-on-ionic-liquids-delivers-13-8-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-05,First attempt to build perovskite solar cell based on ionic liquids delivers 13.8% efficiency,"A research group at North Korea's Kim Chaek University of Technology has made the first attempt to design a perovskite solar cell with an absorber treated with ionic liquids (ILs) to passivate defects in the perovskite film.
“ILs are liquids at ambient temperature due to low melting point and have high conductivity because they are ionic compounds,” the scientists said. “They are widely used as ‘green' solvents by their excellent properties such as low volatility and flammability and high thermal stability.”
In the study “Improving stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells by 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetracyanoborate ionic liquid,” published in the Journal of Saudi Chemical Society,” the researchers explained that, when applied to perovskite PV devices, ILs can increase the grain size of the perovskite film by delaying crystal growth while they form hydrogen bonds. In particular, the nitrogen atoms in the ILs can provide electrons to passivate defects in the perovskite material.
The academics used two ILs known as 1-butyl-3-mehtyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4) and 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EIMIBF4). The latter was distributed in the bulk film and also accumulated at the film surface, while the former was deposited on the perovskite film's grain boundaries.
The scientists built the cell with a substrate made of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on titanium dioxide (TiO2), a zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) interlayer, the perovskite absorber, and a carbon electrode. They also tested different concentrations of ILs.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 13.8%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.95 V, a short-circuit current density of 21.84 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 66.8%. The device was also able to retain 80 % of the initial efficiency under full-spectrum sunlight at 60–65 C in air with relative humidity ranging from 40 to 50 % after 240 h.
The group explained that the cell achieved a relatively high efficiency due to an increase in cell open-circuit voltage and fill factor, which they attributed to the decrease of recombination losses and the increase in the size of the perovskite crystals. “Also, the increase in the short-circuit current is due to the increase in light absorption as a result of the dense perovskite film due to the increase in crystal size,” it emphasized.

7,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/05/rustmo-mentous-celebrating-10-years-of-south-africas-first-big-solar-site/,"EMPLOYMENT,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH AFRICA",,2024-03-05,RustMo-mentous: Celebrating 10 years of South Africa’s first big-solar site,"As South African renewables continue to mature, the RustMo1 Solar Project, the nation's first utility scale PV site, is a testament to the transformative journey of the industry over the past decade. The 7 MW solar farm, commissioned under the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (REIPPPP), has been operational for 10 years. The first utility scale solar plant built and operated by Juwi Renewable Energies in South Africa, RustMo provides valuable insight into the evolving landscape of South African large scale solar.
Image: JUWI Renewable Energies
In the early rounds of the REIPPPP, high tariffs for utility scale renewables reflected the unproven nature of the program. RustMo developer Momentous Energy benefited from a tariff higher than the rate paid by national utility Eskom as the government sought to instil confidence in clean energy. Over the last decade, technological advances and cheaper debt – which reflected falling investment risk – have transformed utility scale solar from the most expensive to the cheapest clean energy source.
Simultaneously, South Africa's renewables sector saw increased competition. Developers responded by co-locating projects to optimize margins and are navigating regulatory complexity as they gain experience in the nation, and form relationships with the authorities.
Major regulatory changes have unlocked the potential of large scale renewables. The removal of licensing caps; grid code developments that were initiated, in part, during RustMo’s development, and with the support of Juwi and Momentous; and streamlined permitting have created a more favourable environment for developers. The South African Department of Environmental Affairs, for example, stimulated the market by introducing revised regulation, making permitting for large projects at low-to-medium sensitivity sites more efficient and cost-effective.
Project sizes have ballooned since 2014, with RustMo's 7 MW generation capacity reflecting the 75 MW cap on the early bidding rounds of REIPPPP. That restriction has risen to 240 MW in bid window seven as developers target economies of scale, and has reduced the competitiveness of small REIPPPP sites.
Aside from delayed REIPPPP bid windows, a lack of grid capacity, and high local content requirements hindering solar developers, a lesser known challenge is that negotiating agreements for projects on agricultural land has become more intricate as landowners seek optimal terms. Farmers who hold out for the best terms can render planned projects unbankable.
The arrival of engineering, procurement, and construction companies without a track record in South Africa threatens project quality and could complicate issue resolution as projects age and come online. A broader concern is the negative impact on solar of setbacks from less reputable companies. Ongoing support for utility scale solar depends on the technology maintaining a positive reputation.
The operation and maintenance (O&M) of solar plants is where “the rubber hits the road,” and the RustMo project has achieved a performance ratio above the guaranteed rate of 78% over the past decade. Plant availability has varied between 97% and 99.99%. This is the result of meticulous maintenance regimes, strategic planning, high standards of quality, and a robust support group of O&M contractors and owners, with Juwi’s O&M Black Economic Empowerment partner Reatile Renewables jointly owning the project with Momentous.
O&M practice at RustMo sheds light on the challenges and opportunities inherent in maintaining a solar project in South Africa over a decade.
From planning and time management to effective team collaboration, a well-informed and equipped team is critical to navigate the intricacies of large scale solar operations. Sticking to maintenance regimes and comprehensive planning – including having a facility operating plan – have been integral in ensuring seamless operation of the plant. Failure to do planned maintenance can have cascading effects, particularly for projects in remote areas where maintenance can be more challenging.
The RustMo support group – a 24-hour control room in Greece; Cape Town back-office support; and sub-contractors – are integral to O&M, particularly during periods of heightened uncertainty. The availability of essential information, guidelines, and tools enhance the team's ability to address challenges proactively.
The lessons from RustMo suggest that fostering a culture of collaboration and open communication contributes to effective problem solving and ensures the longevity of a solar project. Community relations require careful management and RustMo's experience emphasises the need for community liaison by the client to address concerns effectively. Local procurement and job creation, vital components of the renewable energy landscape, are areas where RustMo has actively engaged with local businesses.
Security is imperative for safeguarding equipment and personnel and RustMo has continuous monitoring, through 24-hour armed security teams and CCTV cameras.
Unexpected challenges, ranging from data storms to encounters with large snakes and fibre internet-loving rats, underscore the unpredictable nature of solar plant operations. The team’s ability to respond to such incidents highlights the resilience and adaptability needed, especially in remote areas.
As RustMo embarks on its next decade, the project remains committed to community development, beyond regulatory requirements. Some 17% of dividends are contributed to the Momentous Foundation Community Trust, instead of the 2.5% required by the REIPPPP.
That means solar profits have supported early-childhood development education for 250 youngsters, provided meals for 700 children during the Covid pandemic, and financed safe flushing toilets to replace dangerous pit latrines.
Momentous recently signed a further O&M agreement with Juwi, ensuring RustMo's continued contribution to clean energy generation and socioeconomic development. The project is poised to generate an additional 110 GWh of clean energy, reducing carbon emissions by approximately 66,000 tons.
Beyond those direct impacts, RustMo1 serves as a model that inspired the evolution of South Africa's national renewables procurement programme. As the sector continues to evolve, RustMo is a great example of how renewable energy projects can drive environmental sustainability and meaningful social and economic impact. RustMo1 is not just a solar farm; it is a trailblazer and beacon of innovation, collaboration, and lasting positive change in South Africa's renewable energy landscape.

The Italian government published the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) 2 in the country's official journal on March 2, introducing new fiscal credits to purchase components for renewable energy projects.
Barbara Paulangelo, partner and technical director for Italian consultancy Reliable Energy Advisor (REA), told pv magazine that the fiscal credits will be given to projects that achieve a reduction in energy consumption.
The fiscal credits for PV could reach up to 35% of the cost of the solar modules and will be awarded to projects that exclusively use solar panels made in the European Union. They will be awarded to projects with panels with module efficiency ratings of more than 21.5%, or products with cell efficiencies above 23.5%. They will also be awarded to projects that use either heterojunction or perovskite-silicon tandem modules with efficiencies of more than 24%.
Celeste Mellone of Italian law firm Green Horse Advisory said the tax credits will be recognized for up to 35% of a total investment of up to €2.5 million ($2.71 million) and up to 5% for total investments of €10 million.
“The maximum limit of eligible costs is equal to €50 million per year per beneficiary company,” said Mellone. “These measures are designed for plants intended for self-consumption, but in principle we can't exclude that an excess quota possibly released into the grid could be compatible with the public incentives recognized by the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici.”
The decree said that the possible beneficiaries are “companies resident in the national territory, regardless of the legal form, the economic sector to which they belong, the size and the tax regime for determining the company's income.”
The investments must be made in the 2024-25 period. The plan provides resources equal to €6.3 billion, which are added to the €6.4 billion already set out under Italy's budget law, for a total of approximately €13 billion.

“The main reason for launching the new products was to supply emerging perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell manufacturers. They need high-purity perovskite salts, self-assembled monolayer molecules, acceptor materials, and passivation materials,” the company's CEO, Henrik Pettersson, told pv magazine.
The fullerene acceptor materials are typically used in organic PV (OPV) and perovskite solar cells for electron transport, and they are compatible with both vacuum and solution processing. The range includes buckminsterfullerene (C60), C70, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), PC71BM and ICBA.
The new line is just the latest expansion news from the Swedish company. A few months earlier, Dyenamo added a line of perovskite passivation products and a line of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) molecular materials to its range of perovskite materials.
Dyenamo has been supplying the chemistry-based solar cell industry since 2011. Its perovskite materials have been used in record-breaking devices for their stabilizing effects or efficiency-enhancing performance, or both, according to Dyenamo CEO, Henrik Pettersson.
“Last year, we increased production of high-quality perovskite salts and low-temperature carbon paste following our customers’ need to continue to modify the properties of their devices,” said Henrik who added that customers are located in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia.
The Dyenamo salts are used in the range of perovskite concepts and deposition techniques, vacuum and solutions-based, while the carbon paste is particularly useful in so-called inverse n-i-p perovskite cells that have carbon as the back-contact material.
As for the passivation materials, Pettersson highlighted how they contribute to device stability without being detrimental to efficiency values. The passivation layers typically enhance the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface working against moisture and passivate defects. They prolong charge-carrier lifetimes and suppress non-radiative recombination losses. “By engineering the interfaces within perovskite devices, they are creating more favorable energy level alignments and enhancing charge extraction, as well as reducing charge recombination. In addition, they inhibit ion migration,” said Pettersson.
Dyenamo, which currently employs 10 professionals, initially targeted dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) materials. “The focus was due to our founders’ research and development experience but after two years of supplying DSSC material, we added perovskite in 2013. There is an overlap in the materials used,” said Pettersson. “Later, we added the OPV customer base for the same reason, that is, certain perovskite materials are applicable to OPV fabrication.”
To keep pace with the latest research and development trends, Dyenamo is active in four European perovskite projects; Pepperoni, a four-year research project involving a pilot line at Qcells in Germany; Triumph, a project aiming for triple-junction silicon-perovskite-perovskite devices coordinated by IMEC; the Diamond project which has a focus on carbon back-contact devices, coordinated by the Fraunhofer ISE; and Sunrey, a project coordinated by Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research (IAP) working on processes and materials to fabricate high efficiency, lead-free perovskite devices, as well as Swedish projects that target key challenges.
“This kind of collaboration is important. There are so many records being broken and advances being made in terms of device sizes, lifetimes and stability, PV stack configurations, indoor PV, high temperature processing and solutions processing. It is still not clear which will be the winning combinations,” said Pettersson.

The power plant was initially planned for 50 MW of electricity generation, but the capacity was later expanded to 75 MW, as some $22 million could be saved from the total allocated fund and the required land was available, according to Hossain.
The World Bank, the EGCB and the government financed the project.
The plant features 187,410 solar modules supplied by an undisclosed manufacturer. It is connected to the grid via a 230 kV substation, two 230/33 kV transformers, 13.33 km of 230 kV power evacuation lines, and a 230 kV transmission bay extension.
The company said the project also supports farming and fishing activities.
Feni district is home to several solar power plants, both from the public and private sectors. The EGCB said it plans to build three more solar power plants there.
The EGCB recently signed a deal with Japan's Marubeni Corp. to build a 100 MW solar plant in Sonagazi. It also plans to build another 100 MW plant with Hero Future Energies Asia, and is discussing plans with the Asian Development Bank to fund another 100 MW solar plant there.
Bangladesh generates approximately 1,205 MW of clean energy, with 972 MW from solar.

In the second systems, the panels are stilted from the ground on a steel structure, and agricultural production is performed underneath. In the first installations, the modules are deployed on vertical structures and agricultural production is performed through the module rows.
The assessment included two mono-use scenarios of arable land – an unchanged agricultural production and a total substitution of the agricultural activity with PV panels. “When assessing agricultural systems with a holistic approach it is necessary to include whole crop rotations, since crop-based agrivoltaic systems need to perform not only for one season, but for praxis relevant time frames,” the scientists specified. “This means to cover a crop rotation that can be repeated and is representative for an average Austrian production system.”
The selected crop rotation for the research was sugar beet, winter wheat, soybean, and winter wheat. “Green manure is assumed to be planted before sugar beet and soybean production, respectively, to protect the soil-borne nitrogen from leaching and make it useable for the following crop,” the group explained.
The life cycle assessment was conducted based on international ISO standards 14040 and 14044.
The scientists said their analysis showed that the vertical bifacial system had lower environmental impacts compared to the stilted system in all assessed impact categories considered. This was achieved thanks to lower material use for the mounting structures and the lower impacts of the glass-glass modules compared to glass-foil modules.
They also found that both agrivoltaic systems led to a reduction of environmental impacts in three of the nine assessed impact categories. “This study shows that the PV electricity production is the main reason for environmental impacts in agrivoltaic systems, while the agricultural part is of minor importance,” the academics stated. “Agrivoltaic systems compare favorably to the studied alternative options with a focus on sole electricity or agricultural production.”
Their findings were introduced in the study “Environmental life cycle assessment of a stilted and vertical bifacial crop-based agrivoltaic multi land-use system and comparison with a mono land-use of agricultural land,” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.

Oil major Chevron has revealed plans to build and operate a solar-to-hydrogen production facility in California. The 5 MW project will use solar-generated electricity to split non-potable water into hydrogen fuel.
The project marks Chevron’s first direct investment in its own hydrogen project. Deloitte estimates the global hydrogen market could reach $1.4 trillion by 2050.
Hydrogen fuel is created by using electricity to split a water molecule in a process called electrolysis. When it is burned as fuel, it emits water vapor and warm air, rather than carbon dioxide. However, today, about 95% of all hydrogen is produced from steam reforming of natural gas, according to the US Department of Energy.
Chevron said it expects the plant to produce 2.2 tons of hydrogen per day starting in 2025. This is the equivalent of powering 54,000 homes, said the company in a press release.
Hydrogen acts as an energy storage medium for renewable energy generators such as solar and wind. It is highly dispatchable and long-duration fuel, making it available to serve a different set of use cases than lithium-ion battery storage, which is currently the leading form of new-build storage under development for renewables.
The project is part of Chevron’s plan to reach 150,000 tons of hydrogen fuel production per year, supplying industrial, power, and heavy-duty transportation customers.
The company is spending $2 billion on “lower carbon” projects in 2024, though a significant part of these investments are expansions of renewable diesel and carbon sequestration, rather than an investment in renewables. Chevron announced a $16 billion capital expenditure plan company-wide for 2024.
A recent report from Stanford University shows how hydrogen plus renewables-charged battery storage could help many nations to lower their annual energy costs by about 61%.
In February, utility-scale energy storage company Energy Vault announced a first-of-its kind 293 MWh energy storage and hydrogen project in California. Upon completion, it will be the largest long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen hybrid project in the United States.

The latest ISO-NE capacity auction for 2027-28 concluded with coal failing to secure a spot, while solar, storage and wind all increased their market share.
ISO-NE announced that approximately 950 individual energy resources successfully bid to provide capacity if needed. Out of these, 603 were solar power or solar-plus-storage facilities, accounting for 16.6 GW of the total 31.5 GW of capacity.
The size of the sources ranged from 7 kW to 1.2 GW. The smallest facility, a 7 kW solar power plant named “Grasshopper 142 Blackstone,” is located in southeast Massachusetts. The largest solar plant, Three Corners Solar, which is located in Maine, secured a bid for 77.1 MW of capacity.

Facilities receive a monthly payment based on their available kW (AC) capacity. The auction’s preliminary price is $3.58/kW per month, 38% higher than last year’s bid, but similar to bids placed five years ago.
The 7 kW Grasshopper solar facility bid that it could guarantee 2.462 kW of capacity, earning a monthly payment of $8.81 and an annual total of $105. The facility must rebid next year. The Three Corners Solar facility, bid for its full capacity of 77.1 MWac but only for the summer period from June to September. It will earn $276,018 for each month and $828,054 for the summer season.
In 2019, Sunrun secured capacity payments for a distributed solar and storage portfolio for the first time, with delivery beginning under the contract in fall 2022. Since this initial bid, known as “FCA 13,” Sunrun has consistently secured contracts each year. Most recently, they won with three portfolios, totaling 5.67 MW of capacity.
The ISO noted that 1.7 GW of energy storage won bids, with 700 MW of those being new facilities this year. Energy storage first won capacity bids in the 2019 auction with 5 MW of capacity.
Offshore wind had a big moment with Vineyard Wind 1, an ~800 MW facility nearing completion, securing capacity payments on its first bid. The facility clinched two blocks: a 146 MW/50 MW winter/summer capacity and a larger 347 MW/185 MW block. Notably, wind farms typically offered more capacity in winter, whereas solar installations mainly provided value in summer or had reduced winter capacity when paired with energy storage.
The largest resource in New England to win capacity was the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, which secured 1.25 GW of capacity.

The Merrimack Generation Station in Bow, New Hampshire, a 482 MW coal plant that had been winning capacity bids until 2023, failed again to win any bids. The plant’s last payments of $785,000 a month will end with the closure of the 2025-2026 capacity season. According to the plant owners, the only financial path forward is to rely on revenue generated from supplying electricity during winter peak demand periods.
There are no other coal facilities currently operating in New England. However, wholesale electricity emissions in the region have not decreased for several years. This is because natural gas still dominates the grid, representing 46% of generation. Additionally, the retirement of multiple nuclear facilities has contributed to this trend.

“We have already had pilots in Lithuania for the past six months. The systems have been fully tested. The Nova line is now being launched abroad in Sweden, Austria, Finland, and the Netherlands,” Solitek CEO, Julius Sakalauskas, told pv magazine.
A single Nova battery module has a capacity of 5 kWh and a nominal voltage of 51.2 V. It weighs 85.9 kg.
The company has a range of compatible single-phase and three-phase hybrid inverters, ranging in capacity from 5 kW to 12 kW, which enable integration of the battery with solar PV installations.
Solitek says it has developed a “complete smart home energy management system”, which includes the battery, inverter, and software, whose algorithms optimize energy usage and charging based on electricity price data, weather forecasts, and consumption patterns. “The battery management software was developed in-house. In addition, Wifi communications enables remote management and maintenance via our Solitek app software,” said Sakalauskas.
Solitek is offering a 10-year warranty with 60% end-of-life performance. “We already have IEC 62619, UN38.3, and CE certifications, and are currently working on additional sustainability certifications, expected in the second quarter,” Sakalauskas added.
The March edition of pv magazine, out Monday, is dedicated to energy storage and considers sodium-ion’s chances of toppling lithium-ion, takes a look at compressed air technology, and asks whether big or small is the best approach for African solar and storage.
The Lithuanian company fabricates its battery product line at its 350 MWh capacity factory, which it hopes to scale up to 1 GWh capacity. The Solitek CEO noted that the new battery plant is equipped with a 310 kW solar PV façade that measures 1,675 m2, with 850 kW on the rooftop.
Solitek was founded in 2009 and is part of the BOD Group, a family-owned conglomerate of high-tech companies.

Eight mini-modules of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s (CSIRO) printed flexible solar cells were attached to the surface of Sydney-headquartered space transportation provider Space Machine Company’s Optimus-1 satellite which was sent into orbit today from the United States.
Australia’s largest private satellite yet, Optimus-1 is one of the 53 payloads launched into space as part of American spacecraft manufacturer Space X’s Transporter-10 rideshare mission launched from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
The 270-kilogram Optimus orbital servicing vehicle is to be deployed in an orbital slot where it will then commence its full testing campaign. Part of that will be an investigation of the CSIRO’s printed flexible solar cells that were attached to the surface of the satellite.
The CSIRO is exploring the potential of printed flexible solar cells as a reliable energy source for future space endeavors with the organization’s Space Program Director, Kimberley Clayfield, saying a major challenge in the development of spacecraft is low-mass, high-efficiency power systems.
“CSIRO’s printed flexible solar cells could provide a reliable, lightweight energy solution for future space operations and exploration,” she said. “If the space flight test reveals similar performance as we’ve shown in the lab, this technology offers significant advantages over traditional silicon-based solar.”
CSIRO Renewable Energy Systems Group Leader Dr Anthony Chesman said CSIRO-developed perovskite cells have the potential to transform spacecraft power systems and enable new possibilities for future space missions.
“Our perovskite cells have been achieving incredible outcomes on Earth and we’re excited that they’ll soon be showcasing their potential in space,” he said, adding that in situ testing would secure information on the performance of the cells as they orbit the planet. “We will get information on how the panels are holding up under the extreme conditions in space and data on the efficiency they achieve,” he said.
Chesman said the team had already undertaken pioneering research on the likely performance of the cells in a space environment.
“Based on our research we expect our printed flexible solar cells will stand up to the effects of cosmic electron and gamma radiation which can compromise the performance and integrity of traditional solar cells,” he said. “We are also confident these cells will outperform traditional cells in cases where sunlight hits them at non-optimal angles. The feedback we receive from the satellite will provide valuable insights into the practical application of our technology and inform future technology development.”
