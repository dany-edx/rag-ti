One of these concerns the wide bandgap required for a top cell, which often comes with large open-circuit voltage losses that limit the cell performance. A group of scientists led by Nanjing University in China noted that a large part of this loss occurs at the interface between the active perovskite and the hole transport layer (HTL) that helps to carry a charge out of the device, and decided to experiment with alternate materials to try and limit this.
The group settled on a cross-linked organic small molecule it calls VNPB. Using this material to replace the more common poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) hole transport layer, it was able to demonstrate a boost to the open-circuit voltage of almost 50 millivolts, for cells with a bandgap between 1.6 and 1.8 electron volts. “Compared with the control device using PTAA polymeric HTL, the perovskite films deposited on VNPB have larger grain size and better crystallinity,” explained Nanjing University professor Hairen Tan. “VNPB enables faster charge extraction and reduces defect density at the HTL/perovskite interface.”
Calculations made by the group show that VNPB allows for closer contact between the two layers, and decreases the number and density of defects at the interface between the two layers. The devices fabricated with VNPB achieved 24.9% efficiency as part of an all-perovskite tandem, and 25.4% in a perovskite-silicon device. “The results demonstrate that cross-linkable small molecules are promising for high-efficiency and cost-effective perovskite tandem photovoltaic devices,” the group concluded.
The hole transport layer material and devices fabricated using it are described in the paper Cross-linked hole transport layers for high-efficiency perovskite tandem solar cells, published in Science China Chemistry.

The EU executive made the announcement yesterday as it opened a separate, €785 million call for proposals for funding by cross-border energy infrastructure projects.
Planned international facilities which are on November 2019's list of projects of common interest – ‘PCIs' are facilities which benefit at least two EU member states – are eligible to apply for grant funding out of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and EU energy budget for 2021-27 to co-finance their plans. The cash pile concerned runs to €5.83 billion, and includes €2.4 billion for the 2021-23 period.
The call for proposals launched yesterday will disburse up to €785 million and eligible projects will have until October 19 to apply. The commission said a CEF-energy information day will be held on Tuesday.
The latest, fourth list of PCIs includes smart grid projects in Slovenia, Croatia, Czechia, Slovakia, France, Germany, Hungary, Denmark, Finland, and Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Eligible projects also include electricity interconnectors and compressed air and pumped hydro energy storage plans as well as oil and gas pipes and terminals, and carbon capture and transport facilities.
Announcing the call for proposals, the commission also said up to 15% of the CEF-energy budget – €874.5 million – would be available for renewables projects, with a call for early stage funding for such facilities set to be issued this month.

That would mark a 36% rise on the volume of panels sold outside China during the same period of last year, and the value of all PV-related exports from China rose a similar volume, to hit $9.86 billion in the five-month period, according to the CPIA figures quoted by Flat Glass.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The Chinese manufacturer's dependence on sales of its solar panel glass products was again evident, with Flat Glass reporting PV products supplied 83% of the business' first-half revenue, generating RMB3.32 billion ($514 million) in January-to-June, a slightly lower share than the 85% of total cashflow accounted for by PV revenue of RMB2.13 billion ($330 million) a year earlier, as a global solar glass shortage began to bite.
With Flat Glass reporting total six-month revenue of RMB4.03 billion ($623 million), architectural glass revenue of RMB304 million ($47 million) was the next biggest contributor.
That meant solar panel glass generated gross profits of RMB1.67 billion ($258 million) in the first half for Flat Glass, up from RMB852 million ($132 million) last time, and accounting for half of the company's six-month gross profit, up from 40%, year on year.
In common with the other Chinese solar glass majors, Flat Glass is forging – or perhaps that should be ‘melting' – ahead with production capacity expansion plans even in the face of prices which began to fall back in the second quarter as more and more production lines were constructed.
Flat Glass said it added PV production facilities with a daily melting capacity of 1,200 tons in each of the opening two quarters of this year, and will continue at the same pace until year-end.
The company added another 1,000-ton line at the Haiphong fab in Vietnam where it opened a similar asset in the last quarter of 2020, and in the last three-month window began cold repair and reconstruction of a 600-ton-per-day solar glass line at Jiaxing, in Zhejiang province.
Flat Glass is organizing a shareholder vote to approve a plan, announced in June, to issue up to RMB4 billion worth of A-share convertible bonds, to finance its expansionary strategy.

The facade was built with 360 CIGS thin-film solar modules with a power output of 135 W each, provided by an undisclosed manufacturer and installed on the west, south and north sides of the building.
The main technological feature of the installation, according to its creators, is the concealed suspension technology used. “It enables a frameless design without additional edging at the edge of the module,” the research institute said in a statement. “This makes it possible to combine the modules ideally with the metal curtain wall of the building.”
The modules are installed in landscape format, with each panel having two horizontal back rails which are glued on the back-side glass, without the need for frames and screws. The installers mounted two additional vertical rails on these back rails, which also contain two rods that are used to hook the modules into a preliminary-installation, vertical sub-construction mounted on the wall at an earlier point. The modules are hung in front of the cladding using a rail system so that a small air space is created between the module and the thermal insulation.
The new facade will be used not only to power the building but also as a real laboratory for PV research. For this purpose, the HZB researchers installed 72 temperature, ten irradiation and four wind sensors. The devices are intended at evaluating environmental factors, weather conditions, and compass directions.
“The extensive measurement technology enables new insights into the real behavior of solar modules in a facade in different seasons and weather conditions, over a long period of time,” said Björn Rau, the head of the BAIP – the consulting office for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) at HZB.

Austrian mounting system provider Aerocompact has unveiled a new mounting system based on a 5.8m long support rail that does not lie on the roof but is connected directly to a purlin placed below with self-drilling support screws. In this way, the manufacturer said, the panels are neither stressed nor damaged, as all compressive and tensile forces from wind or snow are directed into the roof substructure.
The roof substructure is screwed with thin sheet metal screws directly onto the top layer of the panels. Spacer sleeves and additional supports guarantee that the distance between the rail and the roof is maintained evenly and that good ventilation is ensured. A pre-assembled rubber seal prevents moisture from entering the raised beads. A patented structural algorithm regulates the optimal distribution of the support points on the roof, in the Aerocompact planning software.
“As a rule, photovoltaic systems are mounted directly on the roof skin with self-tapping screws, so that compressive and tensile forces act on the panels and damage them,” explains Marco Rusch, group head of corporate communications at Aerocompact. “With our concept, damages are almost impossible.”
The company specified there is no need for any approvals or additional certificates from the manufacturer for the installation, which makes retrofitting photovoltaic systems significantly easier. The mounting system may also be installed on a rooftop system with different types of solar modules. “Because the roof substructure absorbs all the forces, it is irrelevant which panels were installed and which forces they can withstand,” explains Rusch.
Aerocompact has integrated a fastening solution which is suitable for wood, steel and aluminum purlins, into the in-house planning tool Aerotool, and project planners will find automated faetures for optimal load distribution. The mounting system comes with a 25-year guarantee.

Swiss start-up SolarXplorers is currently developing the world's first PV-powered stratospheric plane, at the Payerne military airfield in Switzerland.
Called Solarstratos, the aircraft measures 8.5m in length and 24.8m in wingspan and has a total weight of 450kg. It is covered with 22m2 of solar panels totaling 5 kW that will power an electric motor connected to lithium-ion batteries to ensure its operation.
To reach the announced 25,000m altitude, the aircraft is powered by a three-bladed propeller and a 2×19 kW double electric motor which is entirely powered by solar energy. The PV system is based on solar cells with an efficiency of between 22 and 24%. The photovoltaic cells were integrated directly into the wings by the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM), a scientific partner of the project.
The cells were deployed in series or in parallel, to ensure their electrical insulation. This, according to the airplane developers, makes them more resistant to external factors such as humidity, rain, snow or corrosion, and even mechanical shocks.
The solar cells power the device's lithium-ion batteries, which have a total capacity of 14 kWh, expandable to 21 kWh.
To limit the weight of the aircraft, the aircraft is not pressurized and the pilot must be equipped with a spacesuit specially designed for the project, and which also operates on solar energy. It was the Russian space supplier Zvezda which developed the technology for this suit, which combines several innovations to regulate temperature and pressure, and to protect the pilot from solar exposure.
The fuselage and wings are constructed of carbon fiber with a large wingspan that allows the aircraft to fly at reduced speed. “SolarStratos will stay in the stratosphere for a while, consuming nothing other than unlimited solar energy and, above all, totally clean,” said Philippe Pilloud, who is in charge of operations and flight safety. “This is Icarus' dream, but in this case the sun will be an ally and no longer an enemy.”

Dubai-based clean energy developer AMEA Power today announced the commissioning of the project in the Ma'an governorate of the kingdom, which features solar modules made in Jordan by Amman-based manufacturer and developer Philadelphia.
The panel maker will own 30% of the power plant with AMEA owning the balance of a facility awarded under the second round of Jordan's feed-in tariff program.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
AMEA today said the project, which started commercial operation last Wednesday, employed 400 people during construction and will generate enough electricity to power around 50,000 households. Philadelphia had put that figure at a more modest 42,000 households in a press release it issued in January which predicted commercial operation would start in May.
The project, listed as costing $74 million by Philadelphia eight months ago, received finance from the DEG (Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) subsidiary of German development bank KfW (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau), and from Netherlands peer FMO (Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden).
Philadelphia stated the project had secured a 20-year power purchase agreement from Jordan's National Electricity Company, without revealing the tariff which will be paid for the solar energy.
Quoted in today's press release, AMEA Power chairman Hussain Al Nowais said: “We are delighted to announce another great milestone for AMEA Power. This is AMEA Power’s third operational power plant globally and the company’s second operational plant in Jordan. We continue to support Jordan's ambitions to increase the share of renewables in its power mix to 30% by 2030, and to reduce the country’s dependency on fossil fuels.”
AMEA claimed it is near financial close on 1.2 GW of renewable energy generation capacity associated with more than $1 billion worth of projects in Egypt, Tunisia, Cote D'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/08/what-seawater-and-salt-spray-can-do-to-a-pv-system/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021",What seawater and salt spray can do to a PV system,"A group of Chinese scientists has simulated the effects of the marine environment on the performance of PV systems installed on large ocean-going cargo ships and has found that there are differences between the effects of salt spray and seawater on the panels' electrical output characteristics.
The researchers explained that the marine environment has a strong influence on the module surface, via salt and water vapor mixed with acid and basic substances, noting that previous research focused mainly on the damage caused by seawater corrosion and salt particles. “Under seawater corrosion, black spots of corrosion on the surface of the glass of PV modules are formed, with further decrease of the spectral transmittance and [they can] even cause irreparable physical damage,” they stated. “Although the marine environment is highly corrosive, it takes a long time for tempered glass to be severely corroded. It may be more urgent to pay attention to the influence of marine environmental factors on the electrical output characteristics of the PV module.”
The impact of salt spray and seawater on a PV system is described by the academics as a dynamic process through which salt spray creates a  layer on the module, thus forming a water film on its surface. “At the same time, the seawater will also cover the surface of the PV module,” they emphasized. “When the salt spray and seawater evaporate, the salt particles are left on the surface of the glass cover plate.”
The Chinese group built an experimental platform consisting of a main workbox, a sample holder, a modular lighting system, and a water circulation system. Mini solar panels, with a power output of 10 W each, were placed horizontally on the sample holder and humidity, radiation, and temperature sensors were used to collect environmental parameters. Artificial seawater with a concentration of 3.5% and a pH value of 8.2 was used for the experiment. The performance of the PV system was evaluated through the tester PROVA210.
Through their analysis, the scientists found that the solar irradiation hitting the module surface was considerably lowered after the salt spray was sprayed. “This weakening effect has a stronger impact on the electrical output of the PV modules than the positive effect brought by cooling, resulting in the decreasing power output,” they highlighted.
When no more salt spray was sprayed, the solar radiation levels on the panels increased again, which shows, they went on to say, that the effect of salt spray is greater on solar irradiance than on temperature. “The combined influence of water spray on the electrical output characteristics of [a] PV module manifests as a maximum power reduction of about 6%,” the research team further explained. “When the PV modules are used in inland rivers, and other areas with easy-to-condense water, the water mist generated in the environment will also have a similar influence on the electrical output characteristics.”
When analyzing the effect of seawater, the researchers found that it has a significant cooling effect due to evaporation and heat absorption, and those can even raise the module yield by up to 20%. When the water evaporates, however, salt crystals gradually attach to the module surface and this makes solar irradiance spread uniformly on the glass cover.
“As a material with a low thermal conductivity, salt particles block the heat transfer of [the] PV module, making it difficult for the PV module to release its own heat, leading to a temperature rise,” they added, noting that the salt particles also weaken the light transmission of the module as a whole. “Although the cooling effect of seawater attached to the surface of [a] PV module is obvious, it will be temporary if there is no subsequent seawater scouring.”
The combined influence of salt particles, as a heating agent and a factor reducing solar radiation, resulted in a 10% yield reduction for the experimental PV system.
The scientists concluded that more research is needed to understand completely the dynamics of the coexistence between salt spray and seawater. “The resulting changes to the PV module output are often very complex, and it can lead to increases or decreases in the PV module output,” they stated. “Meanwhile, considering the rain, salinity of seawater, and other factors, the salt deposition will be slower, which will also affect the PV module output.”
The experimental set-up was presented in the paper Effects of marine environment on electrical output characteristics of PV module, which was recently published in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. The research group comprises scientists from the Wuhan University of Technology and China's National Engineering Research Center for Water Transport Safety (WTS Center).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/08/sites-market-conditions-om-drive-tech-decisions/,"SPONSORED,EUROPE",,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021","Sites, market conditions, O&M drive tech decisions","From Huawei Special Edition 2021
Statkraft has been developing solar for a while now – it never really stopped. But obviously it’s accelerated now because Statkraft acquired Solarcentury. The move brought quite a good pipeline of projects in with it, and a lot of project development capability. Developing and building the solar farms this year is very attractive for Statkraft.
In the past Statkraft was particularly active in developing some of the quite early floating PV projects in Europe. As an engineer, what is your expectation for that application? Will it remain a niche?
Though the vast majority of our projects are ground mounted, Statkraft has some good synergies regarding floating PV as well, because obviously, Statkraft constructs hydroelectric dams, and they provide a really interesting space to build a floating PV project. Of course, you’re always going to be limited a little bit by how many hydroelectric dams exist.
Every site is different. Every country has particular grid constraints, land constraints, and the situation with capex and price – namely, the differential between trackers and fixed structure costs at any point in time. You have to analyze the effect on cost of electricity: like bifacial versus monofacial, whether it’s worth deploying it in a certain area.
In some areas, even in Northern Europe, it can make sense [to deploy tracking] under certain conditions, and in other situations, it doesn’t make sense. The answer is always that you have to look at the site and the conditions around it to determine whether fixed or tracking is going to be your best option.
Yes, and the technology has been changing a lot over the last few years. The fact that bifacial modules are now becoming more and more common is an example, and that impacts your decision on tracker or fixed. This is true also of the larger-format modules. And we can’t forget storage, which is a whole new thing coming into the equation. It’s complex, but it’s an exciting time.
The things we value in all our key suppliers are a quick and effective response to our requests and good technical support in our target markets, as well as an openness to work with us in developing solutions to many of the challenges we’ve discussed today.
Historically, a large number of Solarcentury projects, which is now a part of Statkraft, have been string inverter projects – something like 90% or so. We were one of the early adopters of string inverter technology, using it in the U.K. before it had been widely adopted. And the reason why Solarcentury went so strongly with string inverters at the time was really thinking ahead from an O&M point of view.
One of the advantages you can have with a string inverter is if it breaks, you can simply replace it. You don’t have to actually repair it, and you can replace it quite quickly. That means that your availability is increased. That flexibility remains even if, for example, a manufacturer goes bust and you need another type of inverter to fill the void.
Solarcentury made the decision at a time when the price differential [between string and central] was quite big, and even then we still sort of came down on the string side.
It’s really important that they [inverter suppliers] have products which are compatible with all the other components we want to use. What is quite a big issue these days is the new types of modules. Up until last year or so, we just had the sort of 72-cell modules, and everything was quite standardized with the voltages and the currents that you’d be expecting, and manufacturers were designing inverters to match those.
Now, there’s a whole bunch of different PV modules of all shapes and sizes. And the inverter designs weren’t necessarily optimized to this new generation of modules. Now they are available, and the modules continue to change – so it’s a bit of a moving target. The fact that they [inverter manufacturers] can respond quickly to changes in the market and changes in technology is really important.
We have a pipeline of projects that take into account energy storage which are actively under development. We have very high hopes and a high level of confidence in energy storage. We have to consider some sort of storage more and more as solar and wind begin to saturate the grid, because we need to be able to smooth out the peaks.
The batteries are getting cheaper and cheaper. Now it’s starting to become very obvious that we can deploy batteries and actually gain an advantage.

“More flexible, shorter-term deals may be closed more favorably by independent power producers amid the current power price volatility,” Stefano Cavriani, the founder and director of EGO Energy, an Italian company that specializes in PPA hedging, told pv magazine.
With current day-ahead prices, a 10-year PPA for a solar project in Italy could be closed for a price ranging from €45/MWh to €50/MWh, and contracts with a length of a maximum of three years may be the easiest solution to achieve, said Cavriani.

“A year ago, after the first effects of the Covid-19 crisis, we reached an all-time low for spot electricity prices ranging between €20/MWh and €30/MWh. And now we have reached an all-time high, with prices standing firmly above €100/MWh,” he explained. “And this is the average price for the entire day over several weeks, which means these prices are stabilizing at a value that is unpredictably high.”
He said that the ongoing rally, which was triggered not only by renewed energy demand, but also by rising gas prices, started at the beginning of 2021, when spot prices were around €55/MWh.
“At the time this price rise was considered by many analysts as a sort of bubble, as we were still under a series of lockdowns,” Cavriani said. “In February, however, it became clear that some pressure had started on gas supply across Europe.”
Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea began buying more gas via maritime transport. European countries ended up seeing gas prices increase.
“During the first Covid-19 crisis in 2020, gas prices had also reached an all-time low of €5/MWh and now they have reached an all-time high of up to €30/MWh,” said Cavriani.
Last year was particularly cold in Europe and gas for heating was needed in many countries until the end of May. On top of this, CO2 prices, which are now around €60/ton, have also been on the rise over the past few months.
Cavriani said that electricity prices should not increase more, but they may stabilize at current levels, or slightly below the €100/MWh threshold.
“Every news concerning gas and electricity supply, at the moment, triggers upwards price pressure,” he said. “For example, all the tensions around the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 connecting Russia with Europe have also played a role in the price scenario. When it will be finalized, gas supply should improve across Europe. However, uncertainty on gas prices will remain.”
The scenario with stabilized high prices should not change at least until the end of winter 2022, according to Cavriani. And solar developers could take advantage of this time window to secure new deals.
“In the next winter, gas supply may also face some shortages, as gas storage in European countries is at lower levels than usual,” he said. “Gas prices for the end of the year and the beginning of 2022 are expected to be extremely high at around €48/MWh, which added to the current CO2 prices means an electricity price largely above €100/MWh.”
EGO Energy estimates the average spot market price for Italy in 2022 at more than €90/MWh.
“With this average price, any kind of unsubsidized PV project may be competitive in the energy market in the short-term,” Cavriani added. “Even a two-year PPA would ensure a very high level of profitability.”
In a post-pandemic scenario, gas prices could drop again, although not to pre-Covid-19 levels.
“Decarbonization targets will raise CO2 prices and this will change completely the way we see at the electricity market,” Cavriani explained. “The electrification of the European economies will raise demand for electricity and prices may not drop too much from current levels.”
EGO Energy estimates that rising PV module prices across Western Europe have determined an increase in prices for PPAs of between €3/MWh and €5/MWh, which means average PPA offer prices in Italy could currently stand around €50/MWh – a figure that is still much lower than current spot prices.
“Big energy consumers may now find a short-term PPA extremely attractive,” Cavriani stated. “A good deal with an independent power producer would not only be about making your power supply more sustainable, but it would be a highly favorable business case. This is not the right time for a wait-and-see strategy.”
What might be missing, according to the analysts, are shovel-ready projects that have secured all required approvals, at least in the Italian market, where large-scale PV projects face growing opposition from local communities and administrations.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/08/india-may-host-massive-amounts-of-pv-module-waste-by-2030/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021",India may host massive amounts of PV module waste by 2030,"From pv magazine India
India could have 21 kilotons of PV module waste from new solar installations if the nation reaches a cumulative 287 GW of installed solar capacity by 2030, from 40 GW in 2020. The PV waste generated will be due to early failures or damage during transportation, installation, and operation, according to a new study.
The report was developed in cooperation with the EU India Technical Cooperation Project (IDOM), European solar trade body SolarPower Europe, European take-back and recycling association PV Cycle, and the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI).
To project the amount of PV waste generated in India by the year 2030, the researchers estimated the annual and cumulative growth of the installed PV capacity in India under three scenarios. In addition, they made a number of assumptions about PV module weight, PV annual replacement rates, and PV module damages during transportation and construction. 
They said that by 2030, India will generate a cumulative mass of PV module waste of 11 kilotons in the “low scenario,” 21 kilotons in the “medium scenario,” and 34 kilotons in the “high scenario.” The waste generated due to the end of life of the PV modules would likely start to accumulate after 2040 and will rapidly become the most relevant waste source.
Compared to current installation levels, the annual PV market is expected to grow significantly across all three scenarios investigated in the study. By 2030, cumulative installed capacity experiences a multifold growth across all scenarios. Under the low and medium scenarios, cumulative capacity by 2030 reaches 187 and 287 GW, respectively, up from 40 GW in 2020. The high scenario capacity reaches 400 GW by 2030, in line with government ambitions. Assuming that PV systems installed in the 2020-30 period will have a lifetime of at least 30 years, any capacity installed during this period will not reach the end-of-life stage until at least 2050. 
Given that ground-mounted solar constitutes the vast majority of PV capacity, and that the residential segment is only a fraction of rooftop installations, the report concludes that the greatest bulk of end-of-life PV waste will be derived from B2B relations.
PV waste management
In India, there is no policy for dealing with the waste generated by PV modules, as they are not included in e-waste or in hazardous waste regulations. The report outlines different overall policy approaches for PV waste management in India. The business-as-usual scenario maintains the current status quo. In an improved business-as-usual scenario, a landfill ban is introduced, but the end-owner retains end-of-life management responsibility. Under an “extended producer responsibility scenario,” on top of a landfill ban, the producer would have legal responsibility for the end-of-life management of the product. 
The authors recommend the extended producer responsibility approach as the best one for the Indian context, as it constitutes the most effective way to perform sound PV waste management. They advise Indian policymakers to implement an extended producer responsibility law for PV modules that would set the principle of a “producer responsibility” for PV modules and, where required, other products of a PV system, such as inverters and batteries.
EU India TCP, NSEFI, SolarPower Europe, and PV Cycle have designed a questionnaire to understand the notion of Indian stakeholders (especially manufacturers and developers) on different aspects of the PV waste-management mechanism. Thirteen key questions were posed to the stakeholders to seek their input. Around 71% of the stakeholders were willing to take the responsibility for the end-of-life phase of PV modules, inverters, and batteries sold into the Indian market. Among the manufacturers who participated in this survey, almost 80% of them were willing to take this responsibility.
Only half of the survey respondents said that they believe that PV recycling will be profitable in the coming years. Most of them cited scale, market for the recycled materials, and incentives for recycling, as well as the diversity of PV modules and collection costs, as the possible reasons for non-profitability. 
Around 71% of the interviewed stakeholders said that they feel that the recycling of inverters is economically viable in India, while only 35% said that they think the recycling of lithium-ion batteries is viable in India. Imposing landfill bans and taxes on it, while enforcing stricter extended producer responsibilities, are the two main factors the stakeholders said should be enforced by the government to push the market for a circular economy. Finally, 86% of the respondents said that targets for a minimum amount of recycled content should be included while manufacturing new modules, as they claimed that this could help in achieving recycling-related goals.

Less than a year after it went into service, the Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility in California was forced offline on Sept. 4 when an unspecified number of batteries overheated.
Local fire crews were called around 8 p.m. to a reported structure fire, but no fire was found. News reports said that first responders instead found battery racks that had been scorched and wires melted. Fire crews remained on the scene until Sunday.
In a statement, Vistra said that the storage facility experienced “an overheating issue with a limited number of battery modules.” The incident affected the facility’s Phase I 300 MW/1,200 MWh system.
Vistra said that risk mitigation and safety systems “worked as designed” and detected that modules were operating at a temperature above operational standards. The company said that targeted sprinkler systems were activated and aimed at the affected modules. Vistra said that the overheating was “controlled and contained” without the need for outside assistance.
Vistra said it would keep the entire facility offline as it investigates the root cause of the incident in partnership with its engineering contractor, Fluence, and battery manufacturer, LG Energy Solution. Vistra was uncertain on the timing of the return of the facility, pending an investigation and any needed repairs.
A spokesperson for Vistra told pv magazine in an email that the company cautioned against insinuating that the batteries caused the incident. “We are very early in our investigation and have not determined a root cause,” said the spokesperson.
The Phase II 100 MW system, which is located in a separate building on site and went into service in August, was not affected by the event. It is currently available for operation.
Fire safety
The 300 MW Moss Landing facility that suffered the battery overheating event entered into service in December. The adjacent second phase entered into service in mid-August and included 4,500 TR1300 battery racks from LG Energy Solution.
When the second phase entered into service, LG said that its lithium-ion-based batteries met fire safety standards, and that its racks had been tested to verify compliance with UL9540A (Standard for Safety Test Method for Evaluating Thermal Runaway Fire Propagation in Battery Energy Storage Systems), to ensure that any fire event would not be propagated to adjacent battery racks.
The TR1300’s rack design also meets the American Society of Civil Engineers’ ASCE 7-16, assuring its stable operation even during external environmental changes such as seismic tremors. The standard is now part of the California Building Code.
LG has been working to improve its battery technology since an April 2019 accident involving one of the company’s utility-scale lithium-ion battery arrays at an Arizona Public Service location. A thermal runaway event there caused an accumulation of gases in the container that housed the batteries. Those gases ignited when first responders opened an access door to investigate reports of smoke coming from the container. Two firefighters were seriously injured.
In late May, LG Energy Solution said it would replace, at its own cost, lithium-ion battery cells used for certain energy storage products that were manufactured between April 2017 and September 2018. The replacement program came after overheating incidents were reported.
The company said in a statement that it determined that there were issues in the early production processes for electrodes used in potentially affected batteries. Reports said the batteries were produced at the company’s factory in Nanjing, China. The replacement program could cost around $350 million.
New batteries will incorporate manufacturing process improvements. The company said it also would implement remote modifications to reduce the potential for overheating while owners wait for their replacement units. LG Energy Solution also will update its battery diagnostic and control software. And it said that field inspections would be undertaken to monitor and minimize the potential for further incidents.
This article was updated on Sept. 7 to clarify that Phase I of the facility entered service in December 2020 and was affected by the overheating incident.

Coal India Ltd. (CIL), a state-owned coal miner that produces around 83% of India’s overall coal production, is looking for equity partners to implement and operate a proposed 4 GW solar PV ingot-wafer-cell-module manufacturing facility in India.
The proposed solar gigafab is part of CIL’s diversification initiatives. CIL already has formed a special-purpose vehicle (SPV), CIL Solar PV Ltd., to take up the proposed solar PV manufacturing project. And it is in the process of participating in a tender to set up the fab under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.
The miner has invited proposals from willing parties as it seeks to shortlist the prospective equity partner to implement and operate the 4 GW facility. 
“The purpose of this request for qualification (RFQ) is to seek interest from the prospective parties for collaborating with CIL for its proposed solar PV manufacturing project and to shortlist potential players from amongst the applicants for consideration in the next stage of selection,” CIL said in the tender document. “Based on the responses received from this RFQ, CIL may run a subsequent selection process, wherein discussions may be held with the shortlisted players on the contour and broad terms of the proposed partnership upon sharing of project-specific information by CIL to the shortlisted players on a confidential basis after signing of non-disclosure agreement, followed by a request for proposal process for final selection of the equity partner from amongst the shortlisted players.”
CIL has conducted a detailed market assessment exercise, followed by a pre-feasibility study for the overall financial assessment of the proposed project. It is in advanced discussions with selected states in India for site identification and finalization.
