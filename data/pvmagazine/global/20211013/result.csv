The new module employs half-cut monocrystalline passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) technology and boasts efficiencies of up to 21.38%. Comprising 120 bifacial monocrystalline half cut solar cells, its power output ranges between 590 and 605 W.
The VSUN605-120BHM-DG can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. The power temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius.
Overall, the PV module, which measures 2,172×1,303×35 mm, comes with a 30-year linear power output warranty and a 12-year product guarantee. It features high transparency, antireflection coated, semi-toughened safety glass with a thickness of 2 mm, and a frame composed of silver anodized aluminum.
Commenting, VSun said, “VSUN605-120BHM-DG module is designed to be compatible with the original racking design for installation in landscape orientation. Being compatible with different racking, more power in each array can be generated. It is worth mentioning that the high string power design increases current without elevating voltage. The number of modules connected in series thus will not reduce due to the 1500V limit.”
The Vietnamese company announced this January that it was planning to set up a solar cell and module manufacturing facility in the Hoà Phú Industrial Zone in the Bắc Giang province, in the northeast part of Vietnam. The factory is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 and to have an annual solar module production capacity of 4 GW and a cell capacity of 2 GW.

RatedPower, the Spanish technology company that pioneered the development of software to optimize the development of solar plants, today announced the closing of a US$6 million financing round led by Seaya Ventures, the European venture capital fund and lead investor in unicorns such as Glovo, Wallbox and Cabify, and with the participation of U.S. investors.
The investment will be used to drive the company's international growth with a particular focus on the United States, accelerate the development of new products and functionalities, and “fulfill its mission to become the software and technology ecosystem for renewables,” the company explains.
RatedPower was founded in 2017 by Andrea Barber, Miguel Angel Torrero, and Juan Romero after identifying the need for a tool that would transform the design and configuration of solar plants into a more automatic, agile, and efficient process. By sweeping through millions of iterations, its pvDesign software finds the best plant configuration and generates, in a matter of seconds and automatically, more than 300 pages of detailed documentation.

Andrea Barber told pv magazine Spain that the company currently has customers on five continents using its software to simulate PV plants in almost every country in the world. “However,” she said, “the United States is the mecca of software as a service (SaaS). It is one of the world's leading countries in photovoltaics and is a market with enormous and relatively homogeneous potential, where corporations – even the most entrepreneurial ones – are less risk-averse and, therefore, it is easier for us technology startups to sell them our innovative products. We will also use the investment to consolidate growth in Europe, with Spain as a spearhead, as well as to strengthen our operations in Latin America and Asia-Pacific.”
The new version of pvDesign that RatedPower launched in June calculates the CAPEX and LCOE of PV projects “on the fly”. Responding to the question of whether the software is adapting to this new market price situation, Barber said, “The flexibility of the CAPEX and LCOE calculation tool allows our customers to define, in a completely customized way, the price databases to get a faster quotation for the construction of the photovoltaic plant. This allows the software to adapt like a glove to any changes in market costs and automatically apply them to their designs. This, together with the accuracy of the algorithmic model to obtain the estimated energy production of the plant, makes the software a solid tool for calculating the profitability of photovoltaic plants.”
Regarding the effect that the recent Royal-Decree Law 17/2021 on urgent measures to mitigate the escalation of energy prices could have on the development of new renewable projects in Spain, Barber says that “we still do not know to what extent RDL 17/2021 will impact on the cuts to the profits of electricity companies. But there is no doubt that the reduction in remuneration will have a retroactive effect on hundreds of renewable installations, and we are following it very closely with concern. However, competitive pressure in this sector is nothing new.”
He continued, “In this sense, deploying software along the entire solar value chain makes more sense than ever. There is still room to improve asset efficiency and profitability through automation and process improvement. Not only in design and engineering, but also in asset management, O&M, financial modeling, and warehousing, etc. These innovations are going to play a key role in reducing PV costs. As well as having a positive impact on people and industries.”
Carlos Fisch, Principal at Seaya, added, “We are delighted to invest in RatedPower, whose products and technology are accelerating the shift to make solar energy the leading and most competitive energy source on the market.”
The company states that “pvDesign has proven to improve the profitability of our customers' solar plants by producing 5% more energy compared to industry standards, reducing the number of hours spent by engineering teams by 85% and increasing asset profitability by 20%.”
In the last 12 months, RatedPower has attracted more than 1,300 users on pvDesign – a 150% increase in the use of the platform (already reaching more than 2,000 GW simulated in more than 150 countries worldwide), a record number of new clients with a portfolio that includes companies such as Iberdrola, Engie, BayWa, AES, Clenera, Sungrow, Burns & McDonnell, Celsia, Shell, Samsung, and National Grid Renewables.

The company led NexWafe’s EUR 39 million ($45 million) Series C financing round with an investment of EUR 25 million ($29 million) in phase one. 
“Reliance New Energy Solar Limited will acquire 86,887 series C preferred shares of the face value of EUR 1 each of NexWafe at a price of EUR 287.73 per share aggregating to EUR 25 million. It will also be issued 36,201 warrants, which are exercisable for a consideration of EUR 1 per warrant subject to achievement of agreed milestones. The transaction is proposed to be completed by end of October 2021,” Reliance New Energy Solar stated in a BSE filing.
NexWafe claims its technology can produce ultrathin monocrystalline solar wafers while ensuring cost- and energy-efficiency. It will use the investment by Reliance to accelerate its proprietary wafer technology development and commercial production on prototype lines in Freiburg, Germany. 
Reliance and NexWafe also signed a deal for joint technology development and commercialization, at scale, of high-efficiency monocrystalline “green solar wafers.” Reliance, through this partnership, will use NexWafe technology in its proposed large-scale wafer manufacturing facilities in India. 
NexWafe develops and produces monocrystalline silicon wafers grown directly from inexpensive raw materials. The continuous, direct gas-to-wafer manufacturing process obviates the need for costly and energy-intensive intermediate steps such as polysilicon production and ingot pulling on which traditional wafer manufacturing relies. The process also minimizes wastage, cutting wafer production costs by up to 30%. It also offers a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions during manufacturing.
NexWafe claims its process is ultra-scalable and fully compatible with conventional solar cell manufacturing.
Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries Limited said, “We at Reliance have always believed in being ahead of the technology curve in all our businesses. Our partnership with NexWafe testifies to this yet again, as we embark on an ambitious mission to meet the affordable green energy needs of India’s rapidly growing economy. Our investment in NexWafe signals an important step towards accelerating India’s green energy transition and positioning India as a global leader in photovoltaic manufacturing. We believe NexWafe’s innovative ultra-thin wafer will give solar manufacturers a significant advantage over existing photovoltaic technologies, helping consumers in India and globally realize the benefits of solar energy more quickly and more efficiently.” 
Davor Sutija, CEO of NexWafe, said, “With its strategic partnership with NexWafe, Reliance can bring the latest in solar wafer innovation to India while also leveling the global playing field for photovoltaic manufacturers, expanding manufacturing beyond a single source market.” 
NexWafe Chairman Bart Markus added: “Reliance is famed for its ability to create quality products at the most competitive prices, so its commitment to helping us reshape and reinvent the silicon wafer will be, we believe, game-changing for helping the world deploy high-efficiency photovoltaics at scale.” 
Other investors joining Reliance in the Series C Round include InnoEnergy, Lynwood, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, and other incumbent and new investors, adding another nearly EUR 10 million ($12 million) to the round.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/13/jinkosolar-sets-new-record-for-n-type-solar-cell-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 13, 2021",JinkoSolar sets new record for n-type solar cell efficiency,"JinkoSolar today announced a new world record for n-type solar cell efficiency, at 25.4%. The achievement has been confirmed by the Japan Electrical Safety and Environment Technology Laboratories (JET), making it the fourth time this year that Jinko has raised the bar for n-type cell efficiency using its tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology. The record surpasses Jinko's previous achievement of 25.25%, announced in May.
A hydrogenation process developed by Jinko in collaboration with research and development partners was key to the achievement here, alongside ultrafine metallization, an advanced diffusion process, and various material upgrades.
“This is a big milestone in our R&D capabilities to make clean energy affordable and sustainable for everyone,” commented Jinkosolar chief technology officer Hao Jin. “We will continue to lead with innovative products and solutions for our global customers who depend on us for our breakthrough technology and reliable supply chain.”
It is not clear whether the hydrogenation process used to produce this record-setting solar cell has been implemented in commercial production. Last month, the company worked with UNSW to demonstrate its potential, producing a batch of cells in an ‘industrial environment’ and achieving average efficiency of 24.08%. The hydrogenation treatment was shown to add 0.64% on average to each cell’s efficiency.
Join pv magazine and JinkoSolar tomorrow for a webinar that will examine the prospects for n-type modules. Roberto Murgioni, Head of Technical Service & Product Management at JinkoSolar will share calculations on life cycle costs and LCOE for n-type and p-type technologies, and offer insight into Jinko's switch to n-type technology. Register for the webinar for free at pv-magazine.com/Webinars
JinkoSolar also received further recognition this week, being awarded the Green World Award by non-profit The Green Organization, for its commitment to environmental best practice. “The Green World Awards are a great honor for JinkoSolar and its employees. Investing in sustainability pays off – for us, for our customers, and for the environment,” said Dany Qian, VP of JinkoSolar, “we have firmly anchored our sustainability strategy along our entire value chain. And we will foster sustainability on the part of our suppliers and business partners, in their own operations and on the customer side.”
The achievement comes as Jinko and other leading solar cell and module makers ponder a switch to n-type in their mainstream manufacturing operations. TOPCon affords manufacturers the chance to upgrade existing production lines for PERC technology, rather than building entirely new lines as heterojunction and other n-type cell architectures would require.
Analysts expect n-type technologies to begin growing rapidly after 2022, with TOPCon the initial leader. According to PV InfoLink, by 2025 we will see more than 100 GW of n-type production capacity, with TOPCon accounting for around 60%.

Serving the commercial and industrial (C&I) solar sector, Vietnam’s SkyX Solar currently has around 100 MWp of PV projects either in operation or development, says VinaCapital, and it now plans on investing US$100 million in the roll-out of 200 MWp more over the next few years.
Samresh Kumar, CEO and Founder of SkyX Solar commented, “We intend to partner with more industrial companies in Vietnam to build many hundred MWs of solar capacity with them.”
According to Bloomberg NEF this January, Vietnam’s cumulative rooftop PV capacity reached 9.3 GW in 2020, with over 6 GW installed in December 2020 alone as project developers rushed to meet a December 31 solar feed-in tariff deadline. This represents an eight-fold increase from just 378 MW in 2019, noted the analysts.

Meanwhile, in its Global Market Outlook for Solar 2021-2025, European trade Association SolarPower Europe commented, “Vietnam is a very encouraging example, showing that the solar industry is now ready to develop even more sophisticated market segments like rooftop PV from basically zero to world record levels in a very short time – all it needs is the right policy and technical framework conditions, and a workforce with the right skillset.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/13/danish-electrolyzer-firm-stiesdal-next-in-reliances-new-energy-plans/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,DENMARK,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 13, 2021",Danish electrolyzer firm Stiesdal next in Reliance’s new energy plans,"From pv magazine India
Reliance Industries’ new energy arm will manufacture electrolyzers in India under a technology partnership with Denmark-based renewable energy firm Stiesdal A/S. The two sides have signed an agreement to collaborate on the technology development and manufacturing of Stiesdal HydroGen electrolyzers in India.
Stiesdal claims its innovative electrolyzer technology can produce green hydrogen at a significantly lower cost than current methods. Under the agreement, Reliance New Energy Solar and Stiesdal will combine their strengths and capabilities to further advance the HydroGen electrolyzer technology development and scale it up to set up manufacturing facilities. 
“In partnership with Stiesdal, we will strive to achieve our stated goal of offering hydrogen energy under $1 per kg in one decade – the 1-1-1 target for green hydrogen,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Limited, after signing the agreement.
Henrik Stiesdal, CEO of Stiesdal A/S, said, “As a company, we are committed to the fight against climate change, seeking to deliver the largest possible impact in the shortest possible time. For us, there could be no greater impact than seeing our technology scaled up for use in the world’s largest democracy. Production of low-cost hydrogen is a vital strategic element of the green transition in India and the world, and Reliance Industries have the reach and capability to ramp up electrolyzer production to the required levels.”
Setting up an electrolyzer gigafab is part of Reliance Industries’ US$10-billion plan for solar and energy storage. The company, through its newly created arm Reliance New Energy Solar, seeks to manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the renewables energy ecosystem—spanning every stage of the solar supply chain, advanced energy storage, hydrogen production, and fuel cells.
“The electrolyzer Giga factory would strive to manufacture modular electrolyzers of the highest efficiency and lowest capital cost. These will be used for captive production of green hydrogen for domestic use and global sale,” said Mukesh Ambani when unveiling the plan. 
Reliance New Energy Solar and Stiesdal also agreed to collaborate on developing and implementing technologies for offshore wind energy, next-generation fuel cells for conversion of hydrogen to electricity for mobile and static electricity generation, long-duration energy storage, and production of carbon-negative fuels.
Reliance has been on a shopping spree this week, with news that it will acquire a 40% stake in Indian multinational Sterling and Wilson Solar Ltd (SWSL), one of the largest PV plant engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), and operation and maintenance solution providers globally; and that it had signed a binding agreement to acquire 100% shareholding of PV module manufacturer REC Group. According to a press release, REC Group was acquired from its previous owner China National Bluestar Group for a value of US$771 million.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/13/iea-greater-global-effort-is-needed-to-reach-net-zero/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 13, 2021",IEA: Greater global effort is needed to reach net zero,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) today published the latest edition of its annual World Energy Outlook report. The report finds that global progress toward clean energy is still too slow when measured against rising global average temperatures.
The report finds that based on currently stated policies, demand for all fossil fuels will begin to flatten in the 2030s and start to fall slightly by the 2050s. But this would still see the rise in global average temperatures surpass the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark around 2030 and hit 2.6 degrees by 2100.
With the next COP conference coming to Glasgow, Scotland, in a couple of weeks, the report aims to highlight “the need for an unmistakeable signal of ambition and action from governments in Glasgow.” The report finds that even if all pledges announced by governments are implemented in full, global oil consumption would still be more than 75 million barrels a day by 2050.
“The world’s hugely encouraging clean energy momentum is running up against the stubborn incumbency of fossil fuels in our energy systems,” said Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director. “Governments need to resolve this at COP26 by giving a clear and unmistakeable signal that they are committed to rapidly scaling up the clean and resilient technologies of the future. The social and economic benefits of accelerating clean energy transitions are huge, and the costs of inaction are immense.”
In the report’s ‘Net zero emissions by 2050’ scenario, oil demand falls to 25 million barrels per day by 2050. This year marks the first time that all of the World Energy Outlook’s scenarios see demand for oil falling by 2050, from its current level of around 100 million barrels per day.
The report identifies four main areas as key to the solution here, firstly a massive push for electrification, and for clean energy to supply that electricity. And this should come alongside focus on energy efficiency, preventing leaks from ongoing fossil fuel operations, and a boost to clean energy innovation.
Key to all of these will be increased investments in the energy transition, which IEA estimates need to hit $4 trillion annually before 2030. “There is a looming risk of more turbulence for global energy markets,” Birol said. “We are not investing enough to meet for future energy needs, and the uncertainties are setting the stage for a volatile period ahead. The way to address this mismatch is clear – a major boost in clean energy investment, across all technologies and all markets. But this needs to happen quickly.”
These investments would create a market for key renewable energy technologies – wind turbines, solar panels, lithium-ion batteries, electrolysers and fuel cells, worth well over $1 trillion a year by 2050, comparable to the size of today’s oil market, according to IEA.

Already available in China and India, Sungrow is bringing the upgrade to the SG250HX in mid-2022 for utility-scale solar projects.
The added power capacity of the SG350HX was driven by the increasing use of large-format high-efficiency and bifacial PV modules. A maximum input current of 20A, each string provides easier use of modules with power ratings of 600 W and above, and supports a single block design as large as 8.96 MW.
It weighs approximately 111 kg, with 99.01% efficiency, a European efficiency rating of 98.8%, and max voltage of 1500V DC. The SG350HX retains the IP66 rating of the SG250HX.

pv magazine spoke with Javier Blanco, Technical Director for PV Business with Sungrow EMEA, at Intersolar Europe, about the SG350HX, and emerging trends in the market driving larger, more powerful string inverters.
“The point in power conversion equipment is to increase power density. It’s the way to be competitive as a manufacturer and to make our customers competitive too. And the main reason we’ve stepped up is larger modules, 600W and above,” said Blanco.
And with larger modules and designs adding more power, everything must step up. “If you want to keep the same PV plant layout, inverters placed in the same position as in the previous designs, there is actually more DC power connected to each inverter. Inverters have to be more powerful, as well as the substations, in order to keep the CapEx of the BoS low,” he said.
“We keep the same number of MPPTs [12, as in the SG250HX] simply because the modules are bigger. It’s a scale that comes more from the increase in the power of the modules than the inverter design itself. You see the configuration: 24 strings per inverter, 28 inverters per station. When the 250HX was designed in 2018, the mainstream module sizes were something around 450W, now they’re 650W and over. It’s been quite a rapid change.”
Blanco suggested that the future looks like it may go beyond the current 1500V DC max input voltage, with a step-up in voltage: 2000V DC would keep the competitiveness of the technology high, though IEC regulation inside Europe is “not yet at that stage,” meaning “significant challenges exist.” Outside of Europe, Blanco said a max 2000V DC pilot project in China shows a path to a possible future.
LCOE advantages are present with the SG350HX. “CapEx will be reduced, with fewer inverters needed for the same pavement, less labor. OpEx will also be reduced because there are fewer units to maintain of course, so there’ll be a progressive version of LCOE with us,” continued Blanco.
Asked about trends in the industry popping up at Intersolar, Blanco confirmed increased technical interest in energy storage solutions offered alongside solar installations, and more talks where wind operators are seeking to add complimentary solar. He also mentioned a likely future trend, where solar, wind, and storage are combined, bringing fresh challenges to manufacturers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/13/time-to-re-envision-the-zeppelin-this-time-as-a-hydrogen-transportation-method/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 13, 2021",Time to re-envision the zeppelin: This time as a hydrogen transportation method,"Green hydrogen has garnered much interest in various energy and non-energy sectors globally due to its ability to decarbonize even hard to electrify sectors such as the iron and steel industries. One major challenge, however, is its costly long-distance transportation.
Hydrogen has the potential for the deep decarbonization of the total primary energy mix due to its relative ease in transportation and its usage similarity with natural gas as an energy carrier. Recent government policies and huge investment in the hydrogen economy further assert its importance as an emissions-free fuel of the future.
Currently, two main hydrogen production routes are in competition: (i) steam methane reforming with carbon capture & sequestration; and (ii) green hydrogen which uses renewable energy and water to produce hydrogen. The third, and probably the most cost-effective technology (production costs have been claimed to be less than 1USD/kg), is the underground processing of fossil reserves still present in abandoned wells, i.e., so-called proton technology.
When it comes to the use of renewables and converting the current electric grid to 100% renewables, green hydrogen offers a decisive edge over currently available long-term storage and energy transportation. The intermittency of renewables can largely be minimized by employing hydrogen as a storage asset in the electrical grid.
Furthermore, its cost-effective long-distance transportation through new or repurposed pipelines enables rural/remote areas to be easily connected to national grids. However, the involved capital investment for new pipelines for hydrogen transportation dictates the use of ships to transport hydrogen in liquid form, in the form of ammonia, or using liquid organic compounds such as toluene.
In this article, I would like to point towards a renewed interest in airship transportation. The idea of hydrogen-filled airships is not new; but, it was abandoned following the Hindenburg disaster. However, current technological advances mean hydrogen technology, safety, detection, and transportation have been improved upon. Now, renewed interest in airships as a hydrogen transport method may prove to be the most cost-effective and safe approach towards the hydrogen economy.

Ocean shipping in various forms (liquid hydrogen, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), ammonia etc.,) or pipelines (compressed hydrogen) are the two most feasible long-distance transportation methods. The cost of these was estimated to be 0.4- – 0.60€/kg for 48 inches of re-purposed pipelines, 0.5 – 0.7€/kg for 36 inches of re-purposed pipelines, 0.55 – 0.6€/kg for LCOH shipping, 0.65 – 0.75€/kg for ammonia shipping, 0.9 – 1.0€/kg for 48 inches new pipeline and 1.00 – 1.20€/kg for liquified hydrogen transportation at distances between 5,500 – 6,000 km.
In terms of safety, almost all the methods are prone to fire-related accidents due to the high evaporation rates of hydrogen in the case of liquified hydrogen shipping. Moreover, toluene and ammonia are flammable and explosive liquids. Thus, great care should be exercised when transporting and handling these liquids.
The concept of hydrogen-filled airships dates back to the era of the German Zeppelin’s dominance i.e., 1900 A.D. Reimagined, the new concept embodies the visualization of the “buoyancy force of hydrogen to transport hydrogen”. Before the Hindenburg disaster, more than 100 zeppelins were constructed and operated under both civilian and military role.
However, with advancements in technology, it could be argued that hydrogen-filled zeppelins are a viable transportation alternative. For instance, assume a big, compressed hydrogen-filled airship with solar photovoltaic integrated drive propellers. The airship, with a minimal crew or even remotely operated, travels above oceans from one country to another to dispense compressed hydrogen, leaving only the amount of hydrogen in its tanks required to fly back home.
Consider the example of the Hindenburg: This zeppelin was filled with 200,000m3 of hydrogen, giving it around 230 tons of lifting capacity (one kg of hydrogen can provide 8 – 10 kg lift capacity). Assuming roughly 10-15 tons of dead weight from the rigid frame of the Hindenburg, it needs just 5-10% of hydrogen to keep it afloat.
The rest can be dispensed at the purchase point and the zeppelin can return home easily. Further, the returning airship will have less compressed hydrogen which would minimize leakage risks. The equivalent lift of dispensable hydrogen can be used to transport cargo. Furthermore, with the average flying speed of the Hindenburg (130 km/h), transportation times can be reduced by two to three times compared to the average speed of cruise ships.
Another advantage of the proposed concept is its decisive edge over the two competing technologies, i.e., pipelines and shipping in terms of capital and maintenance costs.
There is no doubt about the flammability and explosion potential of compressed hydrogen due to heat accumulation; however, the current state-of-the-art lightweight materials with flame retardant coatings and improved cooling mechanisms can minimize the risk of heat-induced triggers.
Secondly, the rigid structure of the airship must be lightweight and strong enough to reduce dead weight. Current carbon fiber composite-based technologies can play a potential role in this regard.
Hydrogen leak detection and its mitigation or isolation is also a highly demanding task and can potentially be addressed through improved hydrogen detection sensors and IoT-based controls. The protection of the cabin crew should be prioritized by using heat and explosion-resistant materials.

Near the center of Nigeria lies the Jos Plateau, which gives its name to Plateau State. The region’s mountainous geography means it has proved difficult to electrify using conventional means. Huawei’s Microgrid Solar Solution, however, has proved indispensable in delivering reliable power to settlements and industry across the state.
According to World Bank statistics, as of 2019, only 55.4% of Nigerians had access to electricity, meaning approximately 85 million Nigerians do not. A statistic made more startling when one realizes Nigeria is set to surpass the United States in population by 2050, becoming the third-most-populous country on the planet.
Hence why the Federal Government of Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP), which receives funding from the World Bank and the African Development Bank, commissioned a 234 kW solar hybrid microgrid in the Shimankar Community of Plateau State.
Shimankar is a farming village on the banks of the River Shimankar. Traditional rulership of the village resides with His Royal Highness Miskoom Maurice Manu Danjuma III. His Royal Highness attended the ribbon-cutting event for the completion of the solar minigrid in October 2020, thanking all those involved for this great aid to local businesses. “Our businesses are now fully operational – especially at night,” he said. “Our businesses are growing; we can buy and enjoy cold beverages in the provision shops. Today is indeed the beginning of better things to come for Shimankar.”
The project, which consists of 234 kW of solar, 236 kWh Huawei lithium-phosphate batteries, 200 kVA Huawei Powercube microgrid inverter and diesel backup generator, was installed by Green Village Electricity (GVE), a specialist in solar minigrid solutions throughout Nigeria. GVE projects limited CEO, Ifeanyi Orajaka, said the project’s aim was to provide reliable electricity to 1,972 households, 273 commercial users, five productive users, and 19 public users. “It’s a thing of pride that GVE, an indigenous Nigerian firm, can be a part of developing Nigeria’s rural areas,” said Orajaka. “Thanks to this project, Nigerian solar developers, like myself, can access these investment opportunities in growing Nigeria’s evolving offgrid sector.”
REA CEO Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad reiterated the sense of pride and fulfillment felt by GVE’s Orajaka, saying that “as an agency, we are responsible for powering unserved and underserved communities, therefore, it is fulfilling every time homes, businesses, schools and medical centres are connected to sustainable solar power. Almost immediately, we are able to witness rural communities being transformed with clean energy through the jobs that are created during construction, to their micro and small businesses scaling to larger capacity thanks to reliable electricity.”
The 200-bed multi-speciality Abdali Medical Center in Jordan’s capital, Amman, is one of the newest and most advanced hospitals in the MENA region, a record at least in part provided by its 8.2 MW solar plant.
Local manufacturer Philadelphia Solar’s turnkey solution generates enough clean solar energy to cover the hospital’s consumption, enable extensive medical research and testing, and all with the security of reliable solar self-generation. Philadelphia installed over 25,090 325 Wp panels in an 86,000 square-meter field, and yet still the array meets Huawei’s design concept of “less is more”. The brains behind the operation, the Huawei FusionSolar Smart PV Solution, including a smart PV string inverter SUN2000-42KTL and SmartLogger, help reduce reliance on components like DC combiner boxes and power distribution cabinets. The brains, therefore, make things easier for the brawn.
Abdulrahman Shehadeh, CEO of Philadelphia Solar, whose installation period was shortened and made simpler thanks to Huawei’s contribution, told pv magazine that the 8.2 MW system, which began commercial operations in August 2019, is “considered to be the largest PV system installed for a single medical center in the world.”
So, it is no wonder Mohammed Abu Ghazaleh, chairman of the Abdali Medical Center is pleased to be the owner of this unique solar plant. “We felt the difference in many aspects,” said Ghazaleh. “For example, economically we avoided rising energy costs and that enables us to earn a great return on our investment.”
“Choosing the clean energy option means the sun is the direct source that will enlighten our buildings,” continued Ghazaleh. “That encouraged us to go solar for a better world.”

It did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement. 
U.K. law firm Watson Farley & Williams said on Monday that its client, Kommunalkredit Austria AG, has extended a three-year short-term loan to support CCE Solar Invest’s efforts to obtain permits for 14 solar projects in Tuscany, Lazio and Apulia regions. The venture aims to be ready to start building by the second quarter of 2022, said Watson Farley & Williams.
Vienna-based Kommunalkredit specializes in financing infrastructure and energy projects. 
CCE Solar Invest develops and finances solar project throughout the world and claims to have a global portfolio of about 1 GW. In September,  it struck a deal with Volksbank Niederösterreich AG to obtain financing for a 10 MW solar portfolio in Austria. The projects include a number of commercial rooftop PV installations.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/13/solarrecycle-website-launches/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 13, 2021",SolarRecycle website launches,"Solar panel waste in the United States may reach the weight of 30 Empire State Buildings, or 10 million metric tons, by 2050, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Currently, it is cheaper to toss a panel in the landfill than to reuse or recycle it. But, as the stack of decommissioned panels grows, so too does the opportunity for a circular economy.
The creators of the newly launched SolarRecycle.org recognized this opportunity, and are working to support the flow of information to enable greater rates of solar panel reuse and recycling.
Recycling incentives are poorly aligned at present, but this dynamic appear to be shifting. For example, analysts at NREL have modeled a current average recycling cost of $28 per module, repairs at $65 per module, and landfilling at only $1.38 per module.
Solar panel recycler Cascade Eco Minerals (CEM) told pv magazine that the market has pushed recycling costs down as more panels reach the end of their serviceable lives. It said that the current rate is about $0.35 per pound. That mean a typical 72-cell module weighing 50 pounds would cost roughly $17.50 to recycle. The company said much of this cost reduction has occurred in the last 12 to 18 months, and rising economies of scale should continue to shrink costs.
Recycling rates are low right now, but declining costs could lead to a better financial model. NREL said at a $28 price tag, decision-makers would likely landfill their panels at a rate of 80% through 2050. If costs fell to $18 per module, closer to the figure quoted by CEM, recycling rates would increase by about one-third.
SolarRecycle said it aims to speed this maturation process for the solar panel recycling economy by connecting asset owners, operations and maintenance providers, and other players with recycling vendors.
The new website aggregates information on where to donate or sell used equipment, how to recycle, and provides updated state and federal policy related to solar recycling and waste classification. An interactive map highlights service providers by state.
“How many solar companies have piles of used and broken equipment in their warehouse? This website can help connect you with options to sell, donate, or recycle those items and free up your space – and your conscience,” said Kate Collardson, a volunteer with SolarRecycle.org.
As solar panel recycling is still in an early stage, so is SolarRecycle.org. The website-runners said they hope others will add to the site in order to centralize research and resource access.
