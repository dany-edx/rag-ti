Meyer Burger is steadily ramping up cell and module production at its factory in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany. Last year, it met its production volume target of 321.1 MW, as stated in its newly published annual report for 2022. It reportedly produces 830,000 solar modules and 700,000 solar cells per day.
Following completion of its production ramp-up, its capacity will increase to more than 1 million solar cells per day, according to Meyer Burger. The second production line started operations in September.
“There is growing certainty that the production lines at our German locations will be able to reach the defined nominal capacities when fully operational,” Meyer Burger said.
However, the manufacturer is also plagued by worries, especially when it comes to delivery times for electronic components. At least in theory, it is well on the way to becoming a gigawatt manufacturer. This year, production capacities will be expanded to 1.4 GW per year. By the end of 2024, this should increase to 3 GW. And the manufacturer has decided to scale its planned module production in the United States from 1.6 GW to around 2 GW. The increased output of about 25% is primarily attributed to the ramped-up production of glass-glass modules.
The expansion will require capital above all, and Meyer Burger is trying to gather as many sources as possible. According to the company, “significant investments in new systems” are needed for the necessary expansion of cell capacity in Thalheim. To this end, the manufacturer has concluded new purchase agreements for the additional production volume from 2025 with two undisclosed “well-known” companies.
The purchase guarantee runs for several years, and the contracts are set up in a similar way to a purchase agreement previously concluded with US project developer Desri, according to Meyer Burger. Investments in new systems will be largely covered by corresponding advance payments from customers.
Meyer Burger has also submitted an application for the third call for proposals from the EU Innovation Fund in March. The company is hoping for funding in the three-digit million range to support development of gigawatt-scale solar cell and module production in several European countries. A decision is expected in the summer of 2023.
The current issue of pv magazine focuses on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
In addition, the European Commission’s recently published Green Deal Industrial Plan gives cause for further hope. EU member states are expected to implement it in the second quarter of this year, which could positively impact Meyer Burger's business in Europe. In view of the generous support for industrial policy in the US through the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Europe must quickly follow suit.
In addition to the status quo and plans for the future, Meyer Burger’s annual report also contains the financial figures for the past year. The company’s sales rose from CHF 39.9 million ($43.56 million) to CHF 147.2 million within a year. It said sales of 250 MW of heterojunction modules were worth CHF 125 million The company stated the net result for 2022 at CHF -69.9 million, thus reducing the loss by around one-third in comparison to last year.
Meyer Burger currently sells its modules in 15 countries at “attractive sales prices”, according to the company. The strongest markets for the manufacturer are currently Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. Australia and the UK, among others, are to be added as new sales markets this year. Distribution takes place via around 50 wholesalers and more than a thousand registered installers.
The first edition of Solar + Storage España is taking place on May 10 and May 11 in Barcelona, Spain. The trade show will combine the expertise of RE+ events with pv magazine’s experience in creating spaces for discussing solar and storage technology, markets, and policy. The Going global conference session will discuss how European companies can take advantage of foreign incentives to expand their business abroad, and what Europe is doing to remain competitive and protect its companies.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/23/assessing-the-area-intensity-of-pv/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"MARCH 23, 2023",Assessing the area intensity of PV,"The area of solar panel per person needed to provide all required energy is simply estimated. Typically, developed countries such as the United States, Australia and Singapore consume about 10 MWh of electricity per person per annum. This will need to double to accommodate the electrification of transport, heating, and industry. Assuming 22% efficient panels and a DC capacity factor of 17% (averaged across rooftop solar and solar farms), we arrive at a figure of 13 kW per person occupying 60 m2.
The global population is 8 billion, and thus 0.5 million square kilometers of solar panels are required for an affluent, energy-intensive world that is fully decarbonized using only photovoltaics. For perspective, this is 1% of the area devoted to agriculture (50 million km2). Regions with lower per capita energy consumption, and those with substantial wind or hydro resources, will need much smaller areas of solar panel per person.
Solar panels can be mounted on rooftops, at solar farms in conjunction with agriculture (agrivoltaics), in arid areas, on inland lakes (floating PV), and on calm maritime waters. Agrivoltaics and floating PV are growing rapidly, but from a much smaller base than more traditional rooftop or ground-mounted PV.
Agrivoltaics in combination with pasturing costs nearly the same as conventional ground-mounted PV, except that the panel rows might be more widely spaced. The farmer benefits from lease fees and the livestock benefit from shade from the panels. The solar farm company benefits from free grass control. Agrivoltaics in conjunction with cropping usually requires taller panel supports and other adaptations, which add to the cost.
The cost of floating PV is around 20% higher than that of rooftop solar, but can be similar to that of tracking, ground-mounted PV with bifacial modules. This augurs well for rapid future growth. Although the cost of floating PV is currently higher than roof and ground mounted PV, it has large potential in countries with high population density. Many countries have substantial inland reservoirs that can host large solar farms.
The potential for maritime floating PV is enormous. Indonesia’s calm, tropical inland sea has 0.7 million km2 of seascape that never has wind and waves larger than 15 m/sec and 4 m height respectively, which is sufficient for all the solar energy an affluent and fully decarbonized world will need.
The world has 1.3 TW of hydroelectricity capacity, which will be passed by global solar capacity during 2023. This comprises a mixture of run-of-river systems with small reservoirs and large storage reservoirs. Covering 100% of a hydroelectric storage lake with solar panels will typically yield much larger power capacity and annual energy than the hydroelectric system.
One of the largest hydropower plants in the world is Itaipu in Brazil, with a flooded area of 1350 km2 and an installed capacity of 14 GW. The 50-years old plant was part of the country’s foreign debt for many decades (US$63 billion – last instalment paid recently!). Due to water constraints and eutrophication, only 66 TWh of electricity was generated in 2021 (compared to a record 103 TWh in 2016). If the Itaipu lake were completely covered with PV modules, the installed capacity of this giant PV power plant would be 270 GW (nearly 20 times Itaipu’s installed capacity), and it would generate some 350 TWh of electricity per year (more than five times Itaipu’s 2021 production), accounting for over 70% of the Brazilian annual electricity consumption.
It took 10 years to build Itaipu, and another 10 years to bring it to full capacity. Fifty years after the Treaty of Itaipu was initially signed, it is the country’s largest “battery,” and solar PV on rooftops and on the ground benefit tremendously from this large baseload modulator. Brazil allowed solar PV to be connected to the grid only in 2012, and 10 years later reached an installed capacity nearly twice that of Itaipu (18 GW of rooftop PV and 8 GW of large-scale, ground-mounted PV as of February 2023).
Rooftop solar
Rooftop PV is the fastest growing segment of the global energy market. Rooftop PV is behind the energy meter and competes with retail electricity tariffs, which are typically much higher than wholesale tariffs. Households and companies provide the funding and assume the risk, which avoids the need for public debt.
In Australia, about one third of residential dwellings have rooftop PV. Continued rapid growth in rooftop PV is expected because most houses and commercial buildings will eventually install PV systems. An important trend is the repowering of earlier systems: houses upgrading PV systems from 2 kW to 4 kW to 8 kW to 15 kW each. Large-scale home storage to increase self-consumption is available in the form of electric vehicle batteries, home batteries and hot water storage tanks. Australia’s electricity grid remains highly stable despite dire predictions from a decade ago.
High photovoltaic conversion efficiency is key both to reducing prices and reducing land use. Efficiency has improved around fourfold since the 1950s. The first practical Si solar cell was presented in 1954, with an area of about 3 cm2. It was around 6% efficient (60 Wp/m2 at STC) and cost US$286/Wp, more than a thousand times the current price of large-area Si solar modules.
Nearly 70 years later, individual best-of-kind Si solar cells approach 27% efficiency, and commercially available Si solar photovoltaic modules are close to 24% efficient (240 Watts per m2). Commercial Si modules might reach 26% in 2030. Tandem cells have higher efficiency potential than Si cells. However, there are formidable technical and commercial obstacles, including unstable device efficiency. If these can be overcome, then 30% efficient tandem cells may become available. The required area of solar panel for a fully decarbonized energy intensive economy would drop from 60 m2 to 45 m2 per person.
Electricity demand in developing countries is much lower than in developed countries (Bolivia, Brazil, and Chile respectively 1.6, 2.5 and 4.1 MWh per capita per year). For many reasons, it is debatable whether and when energy consumption will reach the level of more affluent countries. Important drivers of future clean energy consumption include private vehicles, electrification of industrial heating, production of hydrogen atoms for the metals and chemical industry, and production of synthetic aviation fuels. Solar PV can be the energy source for all of this, and there are no area constraints in most countries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/23/novel-oxygen-ion-battery-may-offer-longer-lifespan-claims-tu-wien/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRIA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MARCH 23, 2023","Novel oxygen-ion battery may offer longer lifespan, claims TU Wien","Researchers from the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) have developed an oxygen-ion battery that purportedly rivals lithium-ion batteries with an “extremely long lifespan,” according to a TU Wien statement.
The scientists set out to show that mixed ionic electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite-type oxides, electroceramic materials usually used in solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells, can be used to fabricate a solid-state oxygen ion battery operating at 350 C to 500 C.
“These oxygen ion batteries may offer certain advantages over other battery technologies, such as [lithium-ion], sodium sulphur, or ZEBRA batteries,” the academics said. “Consisting only of solid, non-flammable oxides, they present much less of a security risk in the case of device failure. Furthermore, they can be fabricated mostly from abundant elements, and in particular, do not depend on critical elements such as cobalt or lithium.”
The team used a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with MIEC thin film electrodes as model cells. These ceramic materials can absorb and release doubly negatively charged oxygen ions. When an electric voltage is applied, the oxygen ions migrate from one ceramic material to another, after which they can be made to migrate back again, thus generating an electric current.
“This is very similar to lithium-ion battery electrodes, which store electrical energy by changing their lithium content. Essentially, voltage-driven oxygen stoichiometry changes correspond to charging/discharging of the chemical capacitance, where self-discharging via oxygen exchange with the atmosphere is prevented,” the researchers explained.
Crucially, they believe oxygen exchange with the atmosphere in the other direction can lead to a very long battery lifespan.
“The oxygen-ion battery can be regenerated without any problems: If oxygen is lost due to side reactions, then the loss can simply be compensated for by oxygen from the ambient air,” said TU Wien.
The academics fabricated full cells of solid-state oxide batteries by combining two electrodes with different oxygen insertion potentials and used them to predict the performance of an optimized solid-state oxide ion battery.
Results show volumetric energy densities of up to 140 mW h cm-3, which corresponds to around 30% of the volumetric energy density of current lithium-ion batteries, according to the scientists. DC measurements of the cell showed capacities as high as 120 mA h cm-3 at a cell voltage of 0.6 V at 350 C to 400 C. Both of the electrodes exhibited cycling performance with faraday efficiencies above 99%.
“If you need a large energy storage unit to temporarily store solar or wind energy, for example, the oxygen-ion battery could be an excellent solution,” said researcher Alexander Schmid. “If you construct an entire building full of energy storage modules, the lower energy density and increased operating temperature do not play a decisive role. But the strengths of our battery would be particularly important there: the long service life, the possibility of producing large quantities of these materials without rare elements, and the fact that there is no fire hazard with these batteries.”
The authors shared their findings in “Rechargeable Oxide Ion Batteries Based on Mixed Conducting Oxide Electrodes,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. They have submitted a patent application for their invention.

The NEA attributed this strong growth to the first-quarter completion of long-delayed projects from 2022. Given that there is now a delayed-projects pipeline of around 34 GW, China could reach an installed PV capacity of more than 54 GW within the first half of this year, it said.
The country added 87.41 GW of new PV capacity in 2022, according to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA). The CPIA said it expects new PV additions to reach between 95 GW and 120 GW this year.

Developments in PV module technology have accelerated since 2018. The chart above – based on CEA quality assurance data – shows the most common modules for utility scale projects in 2017, varied by technology, had a glass-backsheet structure and featured 72 six-inch cells – a module type launched in 2008.
Since 2018, we have witnessed the transition from multicrystalline aluminum back surface field cells to mono PERC (passivated-emitter, rear contact) devices; the adoption of half-cut cells; the dominance of bifacial, glass-glass products; the introduction of multi busbar devices; a shift to larger wafers – 166 mm, then 182 mm, then 210 mm; the emergence of gallium doped p-type wafers; and, most recently, the rise of n-type cells – predominantly n-TOPCon (n-type, tunnel-oxide, passivated contact) products.
Wafer sizes grew to reduce costs. Market share today is split between 210 mm and 182 mm wafers as the advantages of each depends on project specifics. As production lines can be altered to produce either size, market share is fluid.
While “exotic” formats such as 218 mm wafers are unlikely to prosper, 182 mm variants have emerged, such as 182 mm wide by 185 mm products designed to minimize white space between cells in the long direction of the module. Trina Solar recently launched a 182 mm wide by 210 mm tall wafer. Ultimately, such variants are dependent on M10 or G12 solar ingot platforms and supply chains.
N-type (negatively-doped) solutions made an impressive entry in 2022 with several gigawatts of TOPCon generation capacity shipped already. TOPCon and heterojunction (HJT) cells are the main high-efficiency contenders to replace mainstream, p-type PERC cells. TOPCon and HJT cell architecture can be applied on p-type or n-type wafers but years of research have convinced manufacturers only n-type TOPCon and HJT variants can achieve an optimum efficiency-cost relationship.
TOPCon leads the race for now as legacy PERC cell production lines can be upgraded to produce it, whereas HJT requires retooling. TOPCon is also cheaper, thanks mainly to lower capital and operating expenditures.
Rival high-efficiency technology, interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar, has been touted as the “end-of-the-road” single-junction silicon PV technology because going beyond 26% conversion efficiency requires tandem cells. IBC cells have their contacts on the rear side, theoretically offering the highest efficiency for single-junction devices. However, front-contact TOPCon and HJT cells can become back-contact devices and several manufacturers appear to have planned such development. Longi, however, has chosen a p-type IBC architecture that probably uses PERC and TOPCon passivation.
The pros and cons of competing cell technologies are summarized in the following table, in which IBC refers to any passivation method, although properties such as bifaciality and tooling capital expenditure (capex) are linked to back-contact cells. An intense effort is under way to reduce the silver content of HJT devices.
The pace of n-type expansion will rapidly accelerate once technology and cost hurdles are surpassed. Module buyers will accept a price premium on n-type if high efficiency and improved energy yield reduce capex and the LCOE.
To measure such savings, CEA studied a 100 MW system on single-axis horizontal trackers in Spain. PERC and TOPCon cells were compared. Balance-of-system component costs were assumed from several sources, module cost and price data points were taken from CEA’s “PV Price Forecasting Report” and price tracking. PVsyst was used to measure energy yield.
For the analysis, CEA defined a “maximum price premium” metric to indicate the amount a high efficiency module could command over a PERC panel without surrendering LCOE advantage.
CEA equalized the LCOE for PERC and TOPCon systems, deriving the TOPCon module price by adding the maximum premium to the PERC module baseline. Calculations showed TOPCon manufacturers can charge a premium of up to $0.0327/W over PERC without LCOE suffering. While buyers would not pay the maximum premium for zero LCOE advantage, they would pay extra for some LCOE gain. The following chart shows the sensitivity of the LCOE advantage to the price premium, with premiums below 50% of the maximum figure resulting in LCOE advantages of 2.5% or higher. In this scenario, a premium of less than $0.016/W would be reasonable.

The price premium for HJT modules – similarly efficient to TOPCon but with higher energy yield – could be roughly 30% higher than for TOPCon: around $0.005/W. HJT manufacturers must work hard to reduce their cost delta with TOPCon and aim for an efficiency lead.
Modules are lowering the LCOE but pushing past tipping points accelerates the rate of change, making it difficult to estimate development timelines. As a web of factors influence LCOE, manufacturer claims need verification.

The new SunDay 10+ modules feature 144 monocrystalline half-cut cells based on M1o wafers and busbar technology. SDN claims that they are currently the largest solar modules to be produced in South Korea.
The manufacturer offers four versions of the panels, with nominal power ratings of 580 W to 595 W, and power conversion efficiencies ranging from 20.75% to 21.28%. The open-circuit voltage is between 53.42 V and 53.95 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.8 A and 13.99 A.
The panels measure 2,465 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and weigh 35.5 kg. They are built with 2 mm tempered anti-reflective glass and aluminum alloy frames. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and a maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panels have a temperature coefficient of -0.40% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 12-year warranty and a 30-year performance warranty. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 83.5% of the nominal output power.
SDN operates a panel factory in Gwangju, South Korea. It also plans to build a 1 GW manufacturing facility in Gwangju that will produce solar panels based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) technology, as well as modules featuring an unspecified tandem technology.
The company is active in the distributed-generation PV segment and large-scale solar project development. It has built solar arrays in Bulgaria, Japan and South Korea. Its shipbuilding division also supplies outboard motors for fishing and leisure boats.

The government of New Zealand has confirmed that it will develop a detailed business case for a pumped hydro scheme at Lake Onslow, as it seeks to build “a resilient, affordable, secure and decarbonized energy system.”
Energy Minister Megan Woods said the Lake Onslow facility is central to the New Zealand Battery Project, which has been established to explore how best to solve the dry year problem – when low rainfall limits existing hydro-electricity supply – without using fossil fuels.
“Until we address the dry year problem, we will continue to rely on burning expensive and polluting fossil fuels to produce our electricity,” Woods said. “Pumped hydro is an ingenious way of storing energy in a big reservoir, which is released into a lower reservoir when more power is needed, like a giant battery.”
It has been estimated that there can be an energy deficit of between 3 TWh and 5 TWh in the worst dry years, about 10% of the nation’s current annual energy needs.
The pumped hydro scheme at Lake Onslow is expected to provide between 3 TWh and 8.5 TWh of annual generation and storage capacity, depending on the scope of the enlarged lake.
First-phase investigations showing the project would take approximately seven to nine years to build.
“We always knew that any dry year battery storage solution will require significant investment, that’s why it’s important we thoroughly test these scenarios and get it right,” Woods said. “Now some more detailed work has been done we have a much clearer picture of the projected costs which differ significantly from the 2006 high-level costings. The next phase will be to dig even further before we look at spending such a huge amount of money, but one thing we do know is that doing nothing to plan for climate change is not an option.”
Woods said the government will also continue to investigate an alternative option that would involve a portfolio of technologies, including burning biomass, geothermal energy and green hydrogen, as well as a smaller pumped hydro scheme in the central North Island. The alternative portfolio option would cost about $13.5 billion, Woods said, but it would have much higher operating costs than the Lake Onslow pumped hydro project.
A detailed business case will likely be developed by the end of next year. A final investment decision will take another two years to make.

They aim to determine whether curtailment could be cheaper than energy storage in medium-voltage distribution networks with distributed-generation PV capacity.
The used a linearized power flow model instead of traditional non-linear AC optimal power flow models.
“We use a linearized power flow model because it can be applied to distribution grids with both radial and meshed configurations, as opposed to second-order cone relaxations that are typically valid for radial systems,” they explained.
They considered storage costs, operational costs, grid constraints, electricity costs, PV generation models, and loads. They also assumed that energy storage provides active and reactive power compensation in the event of overproduction from PV.
They found that the viability of storage systems and their sizing are strictly dependent on electricity prices, which can be influenced by higher or lower levels of PV generation. The scientists concluded that curtailment is cheaper than installing batteries.
“A sensitivity analysis showed that decreasing costs of energy storage technologies could make installing energy storage cost-competitive compared to curtailing PV generation,” they said.
They presented their findings in “Optimal sizing and siting of energy storage systems considering curtailable photovoltaic generation in power distribution networks,” which was recently published in Applied Energy. The research group includes scientists from the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Switzerland's Institute of Sustainable Energy.
“Studying sizing and siting of energy storage systems, in combination with curtailment of PV generation for satisfying the grid constraints stands as the main contribution of this paper,” they concluded.

Prospective developers have until March 30 to submit bids to build all four PV plants. The selected bidders will be expected to start construction by August 2023, with projects set for commissioning by 2025.
The selected power developers will also be responsible for setting up a training program for UGPE staff.
“Training provided shall be structured such that it equips the local staff with the necessary skills and knowledge to successfully take over the design, construction, commissioning, operation and maintenance of the solar PV systems at the end of the EPC contract,” UGPE said in the tender document.
Financing for the contracts will be provided via Cape Verde’s Renewable Energy and Improved Utility Performance Project (REIUP) facility, which has secured $16.5 million of funding from the World Bank.
The latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that Cape Verde had cumulatively installed 8 MW of solar by the end of 2022.
