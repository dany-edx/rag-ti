This is the assessment of the European Commission in response to the persistently high energy prices worldwide.
For several weeks now, the view of rising prices on gas and electricity markets has become increasingly worrying. On October 13, Czech utility Bohemia Energy, which has around 900,000 customers, announced that it would shut down the group with immediate effect. Customers will now be supplied by an emergency supplier.
Against this background, the European Commission has adopted a communication on energy prices. This contains a “toolkit” from which member states can draw to curb the rapid rise in prices on the energy markets. The goal of the toolkit is both to address the immediate impact of the current price increases and to strengthen resilience against future price shocks.
“Rising global energy prices are a serious concern for the EU,” says Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson. “As we emerge from the pandemic and begin our economic recovery, it is important to protect vulnerable consumers and support European companies. The Commission is helping Member States to take immediate measures to reduce the impact on households and businesses this winter.
“At the same time, we identify other medium-term measures to ensure that our energy system is more resilient and more flexible to withstand any future volatility throughout the transition. The current situation is exceptional, and the internal energy market has served us well for the past 20 years. But we need to be sure that it continues to do so in the future, delivering on the European Green Deal, boosting our energy independence, and meeting our climate goals.”
The Commission's letter states that a transition to clean energy would be the best hedge against future price shocks. Therefore, in response to high prices, it proposes, among other things, more investment in renewables and accelerating renewable energy auctions and permitting processes. It also wants to speed up the expansion of storage capacities for both hydrogen systems and batteries.
There could also be some changes to the electricity market itself, as the European regulatory body ACER is to be tasked with examining the advantages and disadvantages of the current design of the electricity market. In the future, for example, the merger of renewable energy communities for local supply is to be regulated in a more accessible manner. In addition, the market for power purchase agreements (PPAs) between producers and end-users is to be further promoted through “flanking” measures.
“The current energy price crisis demonstrates the urgent need for businesses to invest in reliable, low-cost renewable electricity,” says SolarPower Europe CEO, Walburga Hemetsberg. “The European Commission has recognized the strategic importance of renewable Power Purchase Agreements for the continent and we look forward to the Commission's additional guidance on PPA frameworks to Member States before 2023. The good news is that PPAs and on-site sourcing is booming in Europe, for yet another record-breaking year. We can go even further and faster by accelerating the development of regulatory frameworks for PPAs, taking enabling measures like standardized contracts, and creating incentives for end-users.”
Across Europe, record numbers of power purchase agreements (PPAs) covering 3.5 GW of capacity were signed this year – representing growth on the last eight years. SolarPower Europe expects a total of 407 GW of capacity to be created under PPAs by 2030. The PPA market is also picking up in Germany. According to a data survey by the consulting firm Enervis, 4GW of PV capacity in the PPA segment could receive their construction permits this year. In recent years, that number has been just 1-2 GW per year, according to Enervis.
Corporate purchases of clean energy are booming. Several factors are driving this trend, including falling costs, a heightened appetite for sustainability among consumers and investors, and increased political will for net-zero development. In recognition of this, the UP Initiative spent Q3 2021 investigating sustainable electricity supply. Read the coverage.
However, even the PPA market is not completely protected from the current energy crisis. The turmoil in the energy market has had a negative impact on pricing in the PPA market this year. Compared to the last quarter, bid prices for the cheapest 25% of PPAs in Europe increased by 8%. That's according to a survey by renewable energy trading services provider LevelTen Energy. According to the data, the German and U.K. PPA markets were hit particularly hard compared to other European markets. Prices for PV PPAs in Germany rose 8.9% to €53/MWh compared to the last quarter. Power purchase agreements for wind rose by as much as 13.4% to €64.2/MWh.
The Commission's communication will now be presented to the European Parliament by Commissioner Simson. Also, at the meeting of the European Council on October 21 and 22, the averaging is to serve as a subject for the discussion over energy prices. On October 26, meanwhile, Simson will present the communication to the energy ministers. In addition, the Commission points out that it will seek ongoing discussions with decision-makers within the EU in view of the tense situation. It also wants to remain in contact with national authorities, industry, consumer associations, and international partners.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/14/uk-renewables-industry-calls-for-action-on-rising-energy-bills/,"FINANCE,POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",UK renewables industry calls for action on rising energy bills,"In an open letter signed by figures from across the U.K. energy industry, the Renewable Energy Association has called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the U.K. government to immediately cut value-added tax on various products related to renewables and energy efficiency.
The letter is signed by senior figures at almost 30 companies and associations in the U.K. energy space and calls on the government to expand its classification of ‘energy savings material’ products, which are eligible for a reduced rate of VAT, to include all elements of a residential energy system, including solar PV systems, heat pumps, biomass boilers, solar thermal, thermal storage, heat batteries, electric battery storage, and domestic electric vehicle chargers.
Along with expanding the category to include these items, REA calls for the temporary removal of any VAT on energy-saving materials to aid in the competitiveness of these products against fossil fuels and promote residential renewables in the short term.
Longer-term, the association is certain that (with initial support) costs for renewables will continue to fall and become more competitive. The letter states, however, that fossil fuel supplies for residential heating are currently taxed at 5%, while renewable energy products are subject to the usual 20% VAT, and further notes that energy storage, in particular, has never received direct support through an incentive scheme in the U.K.
The association sees tax reductions like this as essential in addressing expected energy shortages in Europe this winter, and in protecting consumers from currently volatile energy prices, particularly in the natural gas sector.
“The recent gas crisis has offered a sharp reminder of the severe impact that will occur if the UK’s energy transition moves without the pace or substance required. There has been a large impact on supply chains and businesses, and we are incredibly concerned about rising energy bills after this period of immense difficulty,” said REA CEO Nina Skorupska.
“The Government must take immediate action. It is our belief that one of the best ways to protect consumers from volatile energy prices is to give them the ability to install renewable energy and clean technology systems in their own homes. By reducing the dependency on gas and other fossil fuels, consumers should see their energy bills stabilise, as well as being able to contribute to the decarbonisation of the UK’s energy system.”
Lower-income households will be particularly at risk from rising energy bills, and REA further asks the government for more clarity on its forthcoming Clean Heat Grant, set to replace the earlier Green Homes Scheme, noting that the industry will need time to adapt the new scheme to ensure its success and warning not to repeat the failures of the earlier scheme.
“Unless steps are taken to increase the affordability of a number of technologies, the aspiration to install domestic zero-carbon energy systems will remain out of reach for many,” said Skorupska. “That is why the Government must remove VAT on domestic renewable energy and clean technologies no matter where they are installed. This would support the transition to net-zero, deliver new jobs and investment and protect consumers from volatile energy prices.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/14/re-source-2021-kickstarting-the-renewable-energy-transition/,"EVENTS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",Re-Source 2021: Kickstarting the renewable energy transition ,"Re-Source 2021 is underway in Amsterdam with an eager audience and a keen motivation to make the ‘deals' happen for a fast renewable energy transition. 
The event began with an acknowledgment of the hour at hand, coming just a day after the European Commission endorsed corporate renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) as part of the answer to surging energy prices, and just weeks before COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland.
Corporate purchases of clean energy are booming. Several factors are driving this trend, including falling costs, a heightened appetite for sustainability among consumers and investors, and increased political will for net-zero development. In recognition of this, the UP Initiative spent Q3 2021 investigating sustainable electricity supply. Read the coverage.
SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger said the timing of Re-Source 2021 was ideal. And that as the heads of states prepare to meet in Glasgow at the end of October, private sector companies, “are taking their responsibility … not just to save emissions, but to save prices and do business.” 
The message is clear: “Corporate PPAs will have to play a major role,” said Hemetsberger – a role it is already starting to play if the already record year of 2021 in terms of GW procurement and number of deals is anything go to by. 
Rising energy prices are a key concern at Re-Source 2021. “Wind and solar are the most cost-competitive sources of energy,” Hemetsberger said, “which is all the more important due to energy price spikes.”
Jori Ringman, director-general of the Confederation of European Paper Industries (Cepi) added that people had been “screaming down his phone about energy prices”, but the concern in the room is one of opportunity rather than anxiety, with a sense that surging energy prices favor renewables. 
Perhaps that has something to do with the European Commission's endorsement of corporate renewable PPAs as part of the solution to surging energy prices, and the presence of Antonio Lopez-Nicolas, deputy head of the unit on renewables and energy system integration policy at the European Commission's (EC) Directorate-General for Energy (ENER), who said, in regards to rising energy prices in recent months, that “the overall feeling is positive, the facts are there…this is a reason to accelerate the transition and the green deal.”
“Renewables are having a price breakthrough,” said Lopez-Nicolas, “creating a big opportunity. We need to accelerate the rate of deployment,” and the first step is to ask member states to remove barriers to PPAs.
There is broad agreement about the challenges, but still a lot of debate about the manner in which they can be addressed. They include slow permitting processes, the need to unlock the 400 GW onsite C&I potential in Europe, grid infrastructure, and the need to build faster and smarter. 
As Marco Mensink, director-general of the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) emphasized, “Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure, especially east of Vienna.” In the U.S., he continued, it is easy to build a wind or solar farm next to a chemical plant and throw the cable over the fence; here it is not so easy.” 
“In China and the U.S. they are moving faster than we are,” commented Mensink, who said that if he ever meets people in the chemical industry who don't have renewable PPAs, he raises his eyebrows and says: “Oh, that's not good, you're behind.” But the real question we are here for, he continued, is how we are going to do it. 
Jori Ringman agreed with Mensink and added that what private industry needs for massive investment in renewables is “predictability and a regulatory framework, and most of all … affordable renewable energy.” 
Of course, both private sector representatives acknowledged the European Parliament's Fit for 55 package as a step forward in these regards. 
Another takeaway from Re-Source 2021 so far is the attention on ways to help small and medium businesses access renewable PPAs. 
Diderik Samsom, head of cabinet for the European Union, said “PPAs can make a huge difference, and we will open possibilities for public guarantees for PPAs so medium and small businesses can get involved.” 
Samsom acknowledged the irony that “if we had a green deal 10 years ago we wouldn't be in this situation, so we need to do it now and not later.” He stressed, however, that when it comes to a just transition, both sectors need to work together. “Normally, you would expect the ‘justness' of the transition to be a public concern and speed a private one, but now both concerns are everyones'. Nobody can afford to make the transition first and make it ‘just' later.” 
In closing, Samsom called on the renewables industry to develop business cases for low-income households: “You can give solar for free upfront and let it pay for itself,” he said. “It's the same for EVs. Public and private can work together and get this done.”

Under the terms, the PV tracker company will supply its bifacial ML2V trackers this year to the developer for its 300 MW solar project, set to be located in Mecca in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The financial details of the deal were not disclosed; however, a spokesperson for PVH told pv magazine that the PV plant is expected to be operational in the next year.
PVH says it has installed controllers integrating its 3D adaptive backtracking algorithm to maximize the PV plant's production. “Thanks to this algorithm, we avoid the generation impact that might have an uneven terrain and the relative positioning of the trackers, as well as avoiding shadows along the entire length of the tracker and the hot spots that they generate,” reads the press statement.
The trackers will be manufactured at the facility PVH opened this summer in Saudi Arabia. In addition to trackers, the newly created Saudi unit called PV Hardware Middle East also produces mounting structures, and robotic cleaning devices ‘Made in KSA', in response to the rules for domestic content recently outlined by the country's government.
In today’s news release, PVH said, “The company is currently in one of its most successful phases in the region, where it has already contracted more than 3 GW and where it expects to reach another 2 GW in the coming months.”

Earlier this week a consortium calling itself Offshore Wind Power Limited, comprising Macquarie’s Green Investment Group, TotalEnergies and Scottish developer Renewable Infrastructure Development Group (RIDG), submitted a proposal for a green hydrogen hub on the island. This facility would be powered by offshore wind farms in an area to the west of Orkney, also part of the proposal.
“We believe that green hydrogen could provide a critical alternative route to market for some of Scotland’s largest offshore wind projects and play a significant role in creating wider economic benefits as the North Sea goes through its energy transition,” said Edward Northam, head of Green Investment Group Europe. “We look forward to working with the Flotta partners to continue to develop this proposal.”
The project has the attention of local leaders, and could bring significant development to Orkney, as well as new jobs for those working in the oil and gas industry. “Flotta is an ideal location for green hydrogen production – it is surrounded by the best wind resource in Europe, it lies close to major shipping routes within the vast natural harbour of Scapa Flow,” said James Stockan, leader of Orkney Islands Council. “The time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of the Flow and Orkney to ensure a long-term sustainable, climate-friendly future for our communities. We are very much open for business and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the significant strategic and international opportunities we know that our islands offer.”
Announcing the UK’s hydrogen strategy in August, business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng estimated that hydrogen could provide up to one third of the UK’s energy in the future. And as renewables come to represent a larger portion of the energy, hydrogen is emerging as key to decarbonization in certain heavy industries and sectors such as shipping and aviation.
“The production of green hydrogen is a hugely exciting opportunity for both offshore wind and the Scottish supply chain. Projects with substantial capacity factors, such as the West of Orkney Windfarm, could deliver highly competitive power to facilities like the Flotta Hydrogen Hub which could, in turn, supply demand for hydrogen both nationally and internationally,” said Mike Hay, commercial director at RIDG. “We’ve therefore committed to working exclusively with our partners to investigate this opportunity thoroughly and have already completed cable routing assessments and nearshore geophysical surveys to better understand the practical aspects of project delivery.”

The two companies plan to operate the facilities with renewable energy, in order “to accelerate the decarbonization of industrial businesses … The aim of the partnership is to make the most of green electrons when they are generated in abundance on sunny and windy days by storing them as green hydrogen, helping the U.K. become more energy independent.”
The U.K. government unveiled a new national hydrogen strategy in August. RES and Octopus Energy said their planned investments are a direct response to the new strategy.
“We know that renewable-based electrification using wind and solar is the fastest way to decarbonize,” said Rachel Ruffle, EMEA CEO for RES. “When coupled with the production of green hydrogen, it becomes the natural choice for industry and our hard-to-abate sectors. Our partnership will enable industrial users to make the switch to reliable and cost-effective green hydrogen.”
Octopus Renewables claims to manage more than 300 solar PV, onshore wind, and biomass projects, collectively valued at more than GBP 3.4 billion. Earlier this week, it revealed that it had secured a new GBP 150 million corporate pension mandate from an undisclosed U.K. institutional investor to invest in renewable energy infrastructure.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/14/module-durability-and-design-for-recycling/,"MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 14, 2021","Module durability, and design for recycling","The International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) has published a new report offering guidelines for module manufacturers to consider recyclability of their products from the beginning, noting that with projected growth in PV over the coming decades, material shortages could become an issue, and preventing end-of-life modules from ending up in landfill should be an industry priority.
Alongside general guidelines such as avoiding hazardous or hard to recycle materials, such as one-way adhesives, and developing a standardized labelling system allowing recyclers to identify materials, the report makes several points specific to PV module design. The authors advise module designers to give particular consideration to backsheet compositions, choice of metals, minimizing use of encapsulants or using reversible encapsulant materials, choosing a frame sealant that would allow for disassembly, and including some durable way for recyclers to identify the materials and construction of the module.
“If adopted today, application of these DfR guidelines could help to mitigate tomorrow’s resource scarcity, lower the barriers and cost for PV recycling, and enable a circular economy during the energy transition,” the author’s state.
The report goes on to address the balance between designing products that last for a long time, and also considering ease of disassembly at end-of-life. “…all products reach end of life at some point, even durable ones, and it is better environmentally to recover and reuse those materials than lock them away in landfills,” they explain.
This will remain a challenge for the industry for years to come, and IEA PVPS notes that policy encouraging manufacturers to consider both sides of the equation, as well as availability of assessment frameworks and other resources to help guide choice of materials will be essential here.
It also notes that design for recycling can also include the possibility for recyclers to separate entire components from the module for reuse or remanufacturing, eliminating the need to go all the way back to a raw material – and the picture is bigger than recycling alone. “Economics, product performance, and environmental impacts must be considered; recycling at EOL may not always be the best solution for the existing manufacturing and recycling ecosystem,” the report states.
“Ultimately, it is desirable to achieve system-wide goals, such as ensuring material supply,
maximizing material value, or minimizing life cycle impacts.”
Since technologies for module recycling are still in the early stages, the report notes that manufacturers will need assurances that materials can be handled recyclers twenty or more years down the line. And one way for manufacturers to reduce this risk, say IEA PVPS, is for them to become involved directly in planning and development of future recycling capabilities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/14/the-evolution-of-residential-pv-in-china/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,CHINA",,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",The evolution of residential PV in China,"From pv magazine 10/2021
China’s residential PV market has experienced a major boom since 2019, when a specific budget and fixed feed-in tariff incentive was announced, which also facilitated access to grid connection. In the last three years, a clear and strong financial model has triggered the emergence of an increasing number of prosumers who benefit from the program.
Residential demand was weak until 2016, but in 2017 several programs promoting distributed PV were announced, including a lack of quota limitations for residential installations and fixed budgets, awakening this sleeping giant.
In the first seven-months of 2021, China installed 7.66 GW of residential solar, with close to 1.8 GW installed in July alone. The market is taking advantage of the relatively generous and fixed budget of CNY 0.5 billion ($77.5 million) and a subsidy of CNY 0.03/kWh. Indeed, the residential market is the only segment that remains under any type of national-level subsidy program.
In this favorable environment, IHS Markit estimates residential demand will reach another record year, with nearly 17 GW installed in China by the end of this year and close to one-third of the total installations in China in 2021. The market share for residential installations has never been larger, as shown in the chart (bottom left).
Important differences
Compared to other regions, China’s residential segment has some unique attributes. The average size of residential installations is far greater than in other regions. The increase in the average size of residential installations is a global trend also present in other markets (e.g., the United States) but no other country gets close to the trend in China. The national average for residential installations grew from 10 kW/system in 2018 to 21 kW/system in 2020 to get the most of separated budget assignation and standalone subsidies. Higher module power that moved from an average of 350 W to more than 400 W in the same period has also helped to consolidate this trend and optimize rooftop space.

Installations are not evenly distributed across the country, but highly concentrated within three provinces. According to IHS Markit’s latest report, Shandong, Hebei, and Henan have accounted for nearly 75% of residential installs since 2019. The main drivers for the concentration of installations in these provinces are (i) higher solar resources than other provinces, with average solar irradiation around 1,250 hours/year; (ii) large rooftop space availability in rural areas and high density of rural residences, and (iii) local financial institutions supporting residential PV programs in these provinces, and (iv) relatively higher residential electricity prices.
Finally, there are three major types of financing model in this segment, especially in the largest province, Shandong province. The first includes financial leasing, which is not the main model in Shandong, but quite favorable in Zhejiang and other eastern provinces. The latter includes 100% payment of the installation by the residential owner, which is the easiest and safest source of finance. However, the total capex of the system is the most important factor to consider. The third and preferred option, “mortgage loan,” is the most used in Shandong province, where local banks and residential developers will give service, with less (initial) downpayment from residents.
Residential outlook
The growth of the residential segment has been exponential since 2012. However, there is increasing uncertainty in the market about the future of residential solar in China once the current program is phased out next year, which means that the residential segment will also be included in the grid-parity umbrella, as is the current status of commercial and utility installations. Despite the elimination of the direct subsidy, IHS Markit forecasts this segment will continue having an important market share throughout the 14th five-year plan (2021-25) period. The main driver will be a new policy program to stimulate rooftop development in pilot counties, that was announced at the end of June.
The program states that at least 50% of party and government buildings in the pilot counties must have rooftop PV installations, as well as a minimum of 40% for other public buildings like hospitals, more than 30% for C&I buildings, and 20% for rural residences. In early September, the applied cities/countries list was announced by the National Energy Administration, with 676 places to develop residential and C&I segment solar systems on their roofs. With this policy scenario, IHS Markit projects residential installations will fall year on year in 2022 to quickly resume growth from 2023, with an increasingly diverse installation base across China.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/14/bhp-signs-supply-deal-with-australias-largest-windsolar-farm/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",BHP signs supply deal with Australia’s largest wind+solar farm,"From pv magazine Australia
Australia-based BHP has revealed it will enter a renewable energy supply arrangement with Iberdrola Australia that will allow it to reduce emissions by about half at the Olympic Dam copper-uranium mine site by taking power from the AUD 500 million ($369 million) Port August Renewable Energy Park (PAREP).
Iberdrola Australia CEO Ross Rolfe said that under the arrangement, BHP will become the primary customer of the PAREP, which will be Australia’s largest solar-wind hybrid plant once in operation in July 2022. The arrangement will include a direct link to the generation from the PAREP, which will combine 210 MW of wind with 107 MW of solar to generate an estimated 900 GWh of renewable energy annually, or enough to power about 180,000 Australian households each year.
Iberdrola, which also operates the 25 MW/52 MWh Lake Bonney battery energy storage system in South Australia, said that about half of the electricity supplied under the contract will be directly attributable to PAREP. It is expected to be ready to connect to the grid in the coming months, as the final wind turbine was installed on site in September.
The contract also includes an “innovative” mechanism which sees BHP acquire 100% of the Large Scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) for the contracted load by 2025. The deal also includes a retail agreement with Origin Energy, which will facilitate the arrangements.
“We worked very closely with BHP to design these bespoke renewable energy supply arrangements,” Rolfe said. “Olympic Dam is to be the primary customer for the Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park, a demonstration of their commitment to local procurement and sustainable economic development.”
BHP Olympic Dam Asset President Jennifer Purdie said the renewable energy supply arrangement, scheduled to commence on July 1, 2022, will contribute to the company’s medium-term target to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions from its operated assets by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.
“These arrangements will support an exciting new renewable energy project which will contribute to South Australia’s renewable energy ambitions,” she said. “Olympic Dam’s copper has an important role to play to support global decarbonization and the energy transition as an essential product in electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure. Reducing emissions from our operations will further enhance our position as a sustainable copper producer.”
The latest deal follows BHP’s signing of a power purchase agreement with Risen Energy earlier this year for it to supply the miner’s Nickel West Kwinana refinery in Western Australia with renewable energy from its Merredin Solar Farm. BHP has also signed a renewable energy PPA with state-owned generator and retailer CleanCo to deliver some of the electricity used across its Queensland coal mine operations.
South Australian Energy Minister Dan Van Holst Pellekaan said the deal is another step on the state’s journey to cleaner, cheaper electricity for industry, businesses and households.
“The arrangements highlight the good sense of BHP, Iberdrola and other companies getting the generation mix right, including wind and solar farms, grid-scale storage and fast-start gas, to provide cleaner and more reliable electricity,” he said.

The rapidly growing energy storage sector, which increasingly sites batteries alongside solar projects, could learn a lesson or two from the solar sector, especially when it comes to clearly understanding and documenting supply chain details.
That’s according to Paul Wormser, vice president of technology at CEA, a solar PV and battery storage quality assurance, supply chain management, and engineering services company. Wormser said that much of the solar industry was surprised in late June when U.S. Customs and Border Protection targeted a little-known player far upstream in the module supply chain with a Withhold Release Order (WRO). That order stemmed from what customs officials said were credible reports of the use of forced labor.
Both the House and Senate had taken action during 2020 related to forced labor allegations coming from the Xinjiang region in China. A paper known as The Sheffield Report laid out damning details. And the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warned its member companies in late December of potential problems in the industry’s supply chain. Read “Solar companies pledge to oppose forced labor in the supply chain.”
That’s because Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., the focus of the WRO, is far up the supply chain at the raw metal stage of polysilicon production. The order instructed personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.
U.S. solar players had generally expected customs enforcement action someplace in the production midstream. Before the June 24 WRO announcement, there had been little need for solar companies to know where their suppliers’ suppliers had sourced their silicon metal.
“Customs shocked the world by focusing on Hoshine,” said Wormser. “There was not a single person expecting that.”
He said that to date, no modules that have been detained at U.S. ports have been released.
As part of its work within the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Patrol enforces forced labor prohibitions through Section 1307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1307). That law, which was passed back when Herbert Hoover was president, bars the import of any product that was mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced labor, including by forced or indentured child labor.
What took the solar sector by surprise was the decision to target the WRO at Hoshine and its role at the very start of the solar supply chain. For their part, Chinese officials deny the existence of forced labor in the country. As a result, Chinese anti-sanctions laws penalize domestic companies for following U.S. regulations that are opposed to Chinese law. In this case, China’s denial of forced labor makes it difficult if not impossible for related supply chain inquiries to move forward.
“It’s virtually impossible to prove there is no forced labor” in the supply chain, Wormser said.
Warning flag
Now, CEA is raising a warning flag that similar scrutiny could be trained on energy storage technologies. To be sure, no such action has yet been taken by Customs and Border Protection. But the complexity of the energy storage supply chain may be greater owing to the sheer number of components involved and the wide range of raw materials that are mined, refined, and processed.
Once manufactured, an energy storage device may contain hundreds of individual components. If an enforcement action were to take place, importers would need to provide evidence Customs officials to prove that no forced labor was used at any stage of production, including all the way to the mine.Shawn Shaw, director of energy storage at CEA, said that China accounts for around 13% of global lithium mineral supply, but produces around 70% of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, with most headed for export. South Korea also is a large battery producer and exporter.
Not surprisingly, lithium supply chain issues are being asked about with more frequency by players in the energy storage sector. So is cobalt, Shaw said. And graphite that is used in anodes “comes from lots of different places” and could come under scrutiny, he said.
From a practical point of view, having greater insight into the supply chain can be a benefit should a product defect or failure occur. The challenges of root cause analysis can be eased somewhat if documentation is available that can point to how a component was fabricated, he said.
Financial institutions that put up money for energy storage projects are aware of the risks that a WRO action may pose. As part of their loan due diligence they may ask challenging questions about product origins, Shaw said. As a result of the lessons learned from the June WRO, supply chains are becoming “more thoughtful,” he said. And he added that supply diversification “is a good idea.” Besides possible trade action, energy storage customers are becoming more attuned to the carbon footprint of their supply chains.
“There’s growing consumer interest in ‘where was my product made’ and ‘how was my product made,'” Wormser said. At a minimum, he said all companies should review and update if necessary their forced labor code of conduct.
