Eurostat on Thursday said the EU had imported €8 billion worth of solar modules last year, compared to an export trade worth €1.8 billion.
While that import bill was 250% higher than the volume of panels bought by the bloc's member states in 2015, it was actually lower than the solar module import value recorded in 2012. Eurostat said the value of Europe's solar panel exports last year was around the same as it had been eight years earlier.
Unsurprisingly, China was the dominant source of solar modules imported to Europe in 2020, accounting for 75% of the market. Some 6% of the solar modules imported by the EU in 2020 came from Malaysia, 4% came from Japan, and 3% from South Korea, with Taiwan, the U.S. and the U.K. each accounting for 2% of imports.
China also figured among the chief export markets for European-made panels, with around 8% of shipments. The U.S. was the chief external market for European solar manufacturers, as the destination for 18% of exports last year, with 14% of shipments heading to Singapore, 11% to the U.K., and 7% to Switzerland. Malaysia and Taiwan each accounted for 6% of the export market.
The European solar industry is hoping to carve out a bigger slice of the world market as Asian supply chains have been buffeted, first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then by a post-Covid surge in demand which shipping companies and manufacturers have been unable to satisfy. Moves such at the EU's planned carbon border adjustment mechanism, which would penalize imported panels for their carbon footprint, are intended to further boost European solar manufacturing.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/06/new-tool-to-understand-component-failure-rate-in-pv-related-fires/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,DENMARK,MALAYSIA,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 6, 2021",New tool to understand component failure rate in PV-related fires,"An international group of scientists has created a new model to identify the most significant causes of fire at the component level and various failure patterns related to fire accidents in rooftop PV systems.
“Our model is applicable to all sizes of rooftop PV, as it compares the annual number of fires with the national capacities, rather than the number of installations,” research co-author, Jens Steemann Kristensen, told pv magazine. “This makes a lot of sense, as the number of components, and thus possible sources of ignition, is assumed to be proportional with the size of the PV system.”
The proposed model is based on fault tree analysis (FTA), which is a graphical tool aimed at identifying potential causes of system failures before failures occur. FTA shows the logical relationship between a particular system failure and all its contributing causes.
The scientists said that that model initially evaluates the quantitative frequency of fire incidents caused by rooftop PV systems. They noted that the lack of quantitative data on fire accidents on a global scale is still an issue that prevents an exhaustive understanding of causes and effects in PV-related fires. A qualitative FTA analysis is then applied to assess system safety and reliability.
“The method has the potential to identify fault linkages in the system, highlight failure patterns before they arise, compare several designs for safety prioritization, help authorities evaluate overall hazards, and take decisions to avoid critical failures,” the researchers said.
Based on previous reports from Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom, the academics identified seven major events that can cause fires in PV systems. Six of the major events were caused by electric malfunctions in the components of the PV systems, whereas the seventh major event was an unrelated external ignition source.
Electrical arcing, which occurs in PV systems when a connection is broken while the PV is producing current, was identified as the most common cause of fire in rooftop solar arrays. This phenomenon occurs due to poor-quality products, planning and installation errors, component damage during transportation, operational errors, and infrequent inspections, among other minor factors. The connector was found to be the prime contributor for arcing in 17% of the analyzed PV-related fires.
“The quality of the workforce installing the PV system is assumed to have a significant influence on the failure rate,” said Steemann Kristensen.
A self-installed domestic system therefore might be more prone to failure than a high-end professionally installed commercial system, because studies have shown that professional installations on plants have higher quality. Qualitative research has also shown that annual fire incident frequency is 0.0293 fires per megawatt.
“When talking about a technology being safe or not, we talk about the risk related to the technology,” Steemann Kristensen said. “With risk being the product of probability times consequences, we must accept that the PV system affects both quality and quantity.”
He added that rooftops without PV systems are not designed to facilitate flame spread, but when a PV system is added to a roof, a semi-enclosure is created between the back of the PV modules and the upper surface of the roof.
“The introduction of a semi-enclosure is a significant change of the fire dynamic scenario, as heat from the initial fire is re-radiated back towards the surface of the roof, whereupon the fire can spread on the roof.” Steemann Kristensen stated. “It is important to emphasize, that it is not necessarily the PV system that burns, but the PV modules, as a physical object, facilitate flame spread on top of the roof construction.”
The academics also noted a recent fire accident at a Walmart facility in the United States. “This type of pitfall might have severe consequences for the society and be crucial for the implementation of PV systems into the built environment,” they said.
Steemann Kristensen said the expected consequences of the PV technology are largely positive because they contribute to higher sustainability, for example. However, to ensure continuous growth of the technology, it is essential to understand the expected and unexpected consequences, including fire-related risks, as a lack of understanding might have severe long-term consequences.
“That makes the paper very relevant, and it is therefore suggested in the conclusion of the paper that the National Fire and Rescue services implement two PV-related questions into their post-incident reports,” he concluded.
The scientists described the model in “Fault tree analysis of fires on rooftops with photovoltaic systems,” which was recently published in the Journal of Building Engineering. The research group includes scientists from Universiti Putra Malaysia, the Technical University of Denmark,  and the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom.

Batteries are already making a valuable contribution to the energy transition, but there are still plenty of challenges and improvements to be made.
And while a lot of this research is focused on working with entirely new materials that show promise for energy storage applications, squeezing more out of established technologies, and understanding the mechanisms behind their limitations, is a valuable prospect for many. Faster charging presents one challenge for today’s batteries, particularly relevant to electric vehicle applications – and understanding how the higher currents needed for fast charging can cause damage and performance loss within the battery is the focus of recent work from scientists led by Argonne National Laboratory in the United States.
The group took an ‘as prepared’ graphite anode that had not been cycled within a battery or even exposed to an electrolyte, and compared it to another taken from a cell that had been through several cycles of fast charging. Both anodes were examined using sophisticated imaging and characterization techniques, which are described in the paper Increased Disorder at Graphite Particle Edges Revealed by Multi-length Scale Characterization of Anodes from Fast-Charged Lithium-Ion Cells, published in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society.
In addition to plating – where lithium from the electrolyte is permanently deposited on the anode’s surface rather than reversibly stored within graphite particles – the group noted changes to the anode’s structure that further reduced its capacity. “Basically, what we see is that the atomic network in the graphite becomes warped, and this prevents lithium ions from finding their ‘home’ inside the particles — instead, they plate on the particles,” explained Argonne scientist Daniel Abraham. He added that this effect appears to increase the faster the battery is charged, and is visible even after just a few cycles. “The key is to find ways to either prevent this loss of organization or to somehow modify the graphite particles so that the lithium ions can intercalate more efficiently.”
The group suggests that raising the cell cutoff voltage, or increasing the space in the lattice of graphite particles, could be potential solutions, but each would come with its own drawbacks. The improved understanding of the mechanisms behind plating and performance loss, however, should open new doors to researchers looking for solutions.

London-based development body InfraCo Africa – which is funded by the governments of the U.K., the Netherlands, and Switzerland – on Friday revealed a deal had been signed in Paris last month to more than double the amount of borrowing secured for the planned 34 MW solar project 30km north of Chadian capital N'Djamena, which will also include 4 MWh of battery storage.
With the African Development Bank (AfDB) having already committed €18 million for a project which, as pv magazine reported in October 2019, had originally been supposed to be fully financed in 2017, and operational in 2018, a further €18.6 million of borrowings was confirmed ten days ago.
The December edition of pv magazine will hit the streets tomorrow. Read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. But we find more to celebrate than condemn, for 2021 has been another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
Proparco, the private-sector arm of French development body the Agence Française de Développement, will lend €9.3 million to the project, InfraCo said, and that loan was matched by the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund, which is financed by the governments of the U.K., the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden, and which borrows capital from public and private sources to on-lend to projects.
InfraCo said Boston-based energy private equity investor Denham Capital has also come on board as a “long-term investor,” via Casablanca-based, sub-Saharan Africa focused renewables developer Neo Themis. InfraCo did not specify Denham's financial commitment but Fatou Gaye, InfraCo's business development manager for the Chadian project, quoted in Friday's press release, said Denham and Neo Themis will “progress the project through to construction and operations in the coming months.”
With pv magazine having previously reported the first phase of Djermaya would have a generation capacity of 32 MW, rather than 34 MW, and that the project would be sited in N'Djamena, rather than 30km north, InfraCo on Friday confirmed the first generation and storage capacity at the site would be part of a two-phase project which would eventually boast 60 MW of solar capacity.
The terms of the power purchase agreement (PPA) signed by Chadian national utility Société Nationale d’Electricité also appear to have changed. pv magazine in 2019 reported the power company had agreed to purchase the power generated by Djermaya for 25 years but InfraCo on Friday referred to a 20-year contract.
InfraCo said it had developed the solar-plus-storage project via the Anergi Group African power company owned by the AfDB's Pan-African Infrastructure Development Fund, which is managed by South African infrastructure developer Harith General Partners. London-based InfraCo also named French energy company Smart Energies as its development partner.

It aims to give a boost to businesses, employees, top management, and various levels of government for their implementation of sustainable strategies in operational standards.
AE Solar was recognized by the jury on December 2 in Kyiv, Ukraine, for its innovative solar solution to halt industry-related global piracy.
The international solar market is full of copycats developing fake PV modules under trustworthy brand names that are low quality, have short lifetimes, and high degradation. To combat these challenges, the company integrated Near Field Communication (NFC) chips into every one of its solar panels.
The benefits of the NFC chips include:
“Our company’s vision is to deliver ‘A superior eco-friendly, riskless clean approach and safe source of energy across the globe’. Holding this award is a great honor for each of our employees as that means that the AE Solar brand is truly recognized by its global vision and mission. We never stop to deliver to our customers cost-efficient solutions and innovative products, winning in the Planet category inspires us to push our limits and to set the higher goals for the upcoming years,” said Alexander Maier, CEO and founder of AE Solar.
AE Solar has grown steadily over the past few years to both broaden its portfolio and strengthen its presence in the international marketplace. The module manufacturer now operates in more than 95 countries. The company has a wide range of distributors in local markets and is continuously striving to increase its global solar footprint.

News service Reuters on Friday reported the first confirmed case of Omicron-variant Covid-19 in the Norwegian capital had been linked to the event and quoted the City of Oslo as stating: “Health authorities have confirmed a further 12 cases of Omicron in Oslo after an outbreak … More cases are expected.”
The news wire report said at least one attendee of the event, reportedly held on Friday, November 26, had “just returned from South Africa.” The Omicron variant of Covid-19 was first sequenced and reported to the World Health Organization in Southern Africa, where Scatec has solar power operations.
Reuters stated all attendees of the Scatec Christmas event were fully vaccinated and had tested negative for Covid-19 before the gathering, without providing further details. Friday's report added, none of the 13 confirmed cases had resulted in hospitalization and the people affected had suffered only mild symptoms. “This is not unexpected, given the young age of the participants,” Reuters was told by Preben Aavitsland, a senior physician at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, who described the Scatec gathering as a “super spreader” event and said a working hypothesis was that “at least half of the 120 participants were infected with the Omicron variant during the party.”
pv magazine contacted Scatec to ask whether the number of confirmed Omicron-variant cases is still 13 and whether any of the people affected has manifested more than mild symptoms of the virus. We were referred to a news article run by Norwegian online business site E24 yesterday which stated the number of confirmed cases remained 13 and no-one had displayed more than mild symptoms.
A Scatec spokesperson said enquiries about the health of Covid-19 patients should be referred to the Norwegian health authorities, and added: “Scatec can comment on how [Covid-19] has affected our operations, and that is that it has a limited effect. Our operations are outside of Norway and not impacted by the outbreak. Our head office has long experience [of] working from home and the outbreak will have limited effect.”

“The majority of studies in North America compare heat pumps to natural gas, which is logical given [the latter's] dominance as a heating fuel,” the scientists explained. “Rural customers relying on, more expensive fuel oil or propane, however, represent a better opportunity for heat pumps and no studies were found using these fuels as a baseline comparison.”
Their work considered, in particular, isolated areas in the U.S. Upper Midwest and the northeast of the nation, and archetypal buildings that were modeled under four levels of electrification, for each of which PV sizing analysis was conducted. The four levels are described as follows: A baseline case in which propane serves all heating needs; a case where a heat pump is used for producing hot water; full electrification of the building's heating system; and a second fully electrified level that also provides cooling in the summer.
The economic performance of the four levels was evaluated through total life cycle cost (TLCC) and a self-consumption pricing model. The analysis also took into account the envelope efficiencies of residential buildings and the Midwestern generation mix available today. “Economic sensitivities are analyzed on capital costs, electricity and propane prices, and discount rates,” the scientists emphasized. “Climatic, construction, occupancy behavior, and economic boundary conditions are taken from Michigan but are considered representative of most buildings in North America’s cold climate zones.”
The technical analysis was carried out by identifying a project's primary energy renewable fraction (PREF), which considers all energy sources used in the final supply of electricity and heat to the building. The maximum capacity of a PV system must be equal to a household's electricity load over the year.
Through the analysis, the academics found that heat pumps are already economically competitive with propane in isolated areas in northern climates, regardless of whether a PV system is installed or not. The cost-optimal solution was found to be that of the second level, in which the solar-powered heat pump is used for hot water production, assuming that solar module costs will further drop in the future. “The high capital cost of PV remains a barrier, however past work has shown … the majority can still gain access to capital [and] take advantage of existing support programs and/or third-party business models,” the researchers explained.
According to their calculations, homeowners would face no lifecycle economic costs when heat pumps are a drop-in replacement. “Even with 50% higher capital costs than average market prices, the lower operational costs of heat pumps compensate,” they emphasized, noting that heating electrification solutions such as solar heat pumps may reduce cost by up to 20% and carbon emissions by 30%.
They also warned, however, that their conclusions are strictly dependent on the region's electricity prices. “Lower retail prices benefit heat pumps but harm PV while higher sell-back prices help support PV even when electricity prices are lower, suggesting that a trade-off can be made with utilities, where lost revenues from distributed PV can be more than compensated by the increased demand from heat pumps,” they highlighted.
The model is described in the study Decarbonizing rural residential buildings in cold climates: A techno-economic analysis of heating electrification, published in Energy and Buildings. The research group includes scientists from the Michigan Technological University, in the United States, and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden.

In the Italian town of Cuneo, located in the northern region of Piedmont, Italian PV module manufacturer FuturaSun has installed a solar-plus-storage system to power a panoramic elevator.
The pilot project is part of the Store4HUC program which is funded by the European Regional Development Fund, and is the first in a series of four to be developed in Austria, Croatia, Slovenia and Italy. The aim is to develop renewable energy production systems with sustainable storage in historic city centers across Europe.
In Cuneo, the newly equipped lift consists of an inclined system which climbs 28 meters to connects a car park to the city center. The elevator is powered not only by the solar array and the batteries but also by the energy produced by the elevator itself while it is moving, through gravitational storage.
The 8.84 kWp photovoltaic installation was connected to the grid in October and was deployed along the lift path. It comprises 26 FuturaSun Next Pro 340 W monocrystalline photovoltaic panels measuring 1,684×1,002mm with 120 half-cut multi-busbar PERC cells, for a total surface area of 45 square meters.
According to a FuturaSun press release, this initiative is one of the first at national and European level “to optimize the use of energy resources in a fixed-location transport system.” The plant is expected to receive some remuneration from Italian energy agency the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici.
The new system, a ‘sustainable public mobility experience,' reduces the energy consumption of the elevator, ensuring both reduced public spending and lower carbon dioxide emissions.

The Brazilian energy regulator – Aneel – approved, last Tuesday, a new regulation for the operation of hybrid power plants.
Resolution 954/2021 defines what hybrid projects are and establishes the rules for permitting and contracting the use of transmission systems. In addition, it defines what kind of tariffs these plants will have to pay for using the grid, and possible tariff reductions.
The regulation is considered an important step to help Brazil take advantage of the synergies between different sources of energy generation. It allows for combinations of different generation sources, including PV, wind, hydroelectric, and thermoelectric plants.
Combining utility scale facilities, according to the regulator, should allow the use of the transmission network in a more efficient and stable manner while helping plant operators mitigate risks and save on land purchase and other costs.
“The approval of the proposed regulation will be a milestone for the development of hybrid plants, which will provide greater technological diversity, contributing to the modernization of the Brazilian electricity sector,” stated Aneel director Elisa Bastos. “The inclusion of these projects in the electrical system can reduce costs and delay new investments in grid expansion.”
“This regulation is a leap in quality in the electricity sector and is now the priority of our innovation agenda,” said the director general of Aneel, André Pepitone. “Throughout the entire process of building the regulation, Aneel acted with predictability and transparency, qualities that were recently recognized by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).”
The procedural matters related to the viability of the hybrid plants will be approved by Aneel shortly, with the revision of grid procedures and commercialization rules.
Prior to Aneel's new resolution, some pilot, hybrid wind-solar projects were undertaken in Brazil. One of these is a 68.7 MWac facility planned to be installed on a plot next to the existing 205.9 MW Ventos do Piauí I wind farm, by the energy division of the Brazilian multinational Votorantim: Votorantim Energia. The commissioning of the entire complex is scheduled for early 2023 and it will have a total installed capacity of 274.6 MW. It will sell energy on the free market.
A study conducted by Brazil’s government-run energy agency the Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, in 2017, stated that, for hybrid wind-solar, the particular characteristics of every geographical area must be taken into account, and that the benefits of every wind-solar project must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The study includes, among other things, an analysis of the advantages of these projects in northeastern Brazil, where the transmission grid has a limited capacity compared to the volume of the proposed wind and solar projects.

London-based inverter and battery company Invergy, which this year launched its hybrid solar inverters in India, is targeting residential arrays with 3-12 kW products for use in single and three-phase set-ups.
As part of its push for Indian customers, the company will build an inverter factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh by May which will be able to manufacture 5 MW of products annually.
Invergy director Deepak Pandey told pv magazine: “Our product line is not in competition with other inverter brands present in India. Ours are next-generation inverters with features that have not been introduced in India 'till today. These are IP65-compatible units compatible with both lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries. Currently, the inverters available in the Indian market are mostly compatible with only [a] lead-acid or lithium battery.” 
“Our inverters are scalable. So, you can get 50 kW output by placing 5 kW inverters in ten rows in parallel. You can connect up to 16 … rows. The maximum capacity, in that case, will be somewhere around 75 kW, with 5 kW units. The best part is, our single-phase inverters can be connected in three-phase mode and give a three-phase output.”
Invergy lays claim to 10 MW of manufacturing capacity catering to the residential solar market in Europe, West Africa, Dubai, and India.
“We want to manufacture in India as the response from the Indian market is good,” added Pandey. “Also, the Make in India concept is there. The increased [customs] duties on the import of completely-built units is among other reasons [for our expansion in India].”

It has excellent optoelectronic properties. In recent years, it has also been used as an absorber material to build solar cells. The efficiencies achieved by such devices have reached between 5% and 9.2%.
These efficiency levels are still far behind those of other thin-film technologies, such as cells based on copper, indium, gallium and selenide (CISG), cadmium telluride (CdTe), kesterite (CZTSSe), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). This technological gap might depend on the fact that features such as mobility, carrier lifetime, diffusion length, defect depth, defect density and band tail remain largely unknown to the scientific community for the Sb2Se3 cell technology, as not too many devices of this kind have been fabricated to date.
The latest attempt to investigate such a cell configuration was made by U.S. scientists from the University of Toledo. They developed a device with a power conversion efficiency of 8.5%.
“The efficiency was measured in our own lab so it is internally certified,” researcher Suman Rijal told pv magazine. “These cells can be used for the production of solar electricity and also can be used as a photocathode for the production of hydrogen by the solar water splitting method.”
The cell was built with a two-step closed space sublimation (CSS), which is a physical vapor deposition method to produce thin films. It involves semiconductors that evaporate below 800 C, which are coated on substrates in both vacuum and atmospheric pressure.
“This is a kind of sublimation deposition method this can go for commercial production,” Rijal said.
The scientists applied a seed layer was to a soda-lime glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo) through rapid thermal evaporation (RTE). They said this enabled templated growth of a vertically orientated Sb2Se3 seed layer that, in turn, enabled the growth of a high-quality Sb2Se3 absorber layer with high crystallinity and large columnar grains, while also avoiding the void formation at the back interface.
“The seed layer plays a crucial role in controlling the crystalline quality and preferred orientation of Sb2Se3 thin films and their interface properties,” the scientists said, noting that the growth of the Sb2Se3 ribbons can be oriented in mainly two groups of directions with respect to the substrate surface, and that vertically oriented ribbons are preferred.
A cell developed with this configuration originally achieved an efficiency of 7.47%, an open-circuit voltage of 459 mV, a short-circuit current of 26.54 mA cm2 and a fill factor of 61.39%. After post-deposition annealing in the air was used to passivate bulk defects in the Sb2Se3 absorber, the device reached 8.5%.
“The air annealing effectively reduces the densities of the defects and lowers their activation energies,” the scientists said. They also claimed that their research shows that high-performance Sb2Se3 solar cells can be developed through an approach that they define as “facile and effective.”
They shared the technical details of the cell in “Templated Growth and Passivation of Vertically Oriented Antimony Selenide Thin Films for High-Efficiency Solar Cells in Substrate Configuration,” which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.

Large-scale solar continues to prevail, despite growing congestion issues on the Dutch grid.
The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has announced that PV projects with a combined capacity of 4,161 MW have been submitted for the first round of the 2021 SDE++ (Stimulering Duurzame Energieproductie) program for large-scale solar and renewable energy. Of this capacity, 2,224 MW is represented by commercial and industrial PV systems, while ground-mounted projects and floating solar arrays account for another 1,908 MW.
The state-run Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) agency, which manages the program, has accepted a range of renewable energy project proposals. The proposals include sustainable heating projects and CO2 capture and storage, with an aggregate power of 5.17 GW. All of the projects would require a total budget of €12 billion (USD 13.5 billion), with €5 billion earmarked for the round.
“Due to budget depletion, a number of more expensive techniques may not qualify for the subsidy,” said the RVO. “The highest amount of €6.1 billion was requested for CO2 capture and storage, followed by solar PV with €2.2 billion.”
The largely oversubscribed round might not end up allocating all the capacity requested for solar. But as previous rounds of the SDE++ program have shown, a big portion of it could be allocated.
In the second round of 2020, the RVO selected 3,426 PV projects with a combined capacity of 3,535 MW. In another recent round of the SDE++ program, the Dutch authorities selected 6,882 PV projects with a combined capacity of 3,340 MW.
The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a recent report by Netbeheer Nederland. By the end of December 2020, the country’s cumulative installed solar capacity hit 10 GW. New PV capacity for 2020 was around 2.93 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/06/canadian-bipv-module-maker-releases-790-w-panel/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 6, 2021",Canadian BIPV module maker releases 790 W panel,"Mitrex Integrated Solar Technology, a Canadian building-integrated PV module producer, has released a new 790 W panel with a power conversion efficiency of 19.5%.
The Mega HP M790-M1F module is the company's most powerful product. It combines two 395 W panels fused in a single device. It is built with 144 monocrystalline cells with an efficiency of 22.5%, 3.2 mm tempered glass, and an IP68 enclosure.
The panel measures 2,036 mm x 1,992 mm x 40 mm and weighs in at 42 kg. It can operate with a system voltage of 1,000 V and has a power temperature coefficient of -0.36% per degree Celsius. The open-circuit voltage is 96.2 V and the short-circuit current is 9.86 A.
“During the first year, Mitrex warrants the actual power output of the products will be no less than 97% of the labeled power output,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “From year two to year 25, the actual annual power decline will be no more than .7% by the end of year 25. By the end of year 25, the actual power output will be no less than 80% of the labeled power output.”
Mitrex produces the panels at its facility in Toronto. It said it is using its patented anti-reflecting technology, which involves color-treating the glass through pigments that are fused into the glass itself.
“The glass coating materials are characterized by high solar transmittance, minimal absorption, and increased durability,” the manufacturer said on its website, in reference to the colored layers. “Treated glass can have reflective, semi-reflective, or matte surfaces, depending on the product’s aesthetic requirements.”
Mitrex also makes smaller solar modules, as well as PV facades, solar cladding, solar glass and BIPV systems.
