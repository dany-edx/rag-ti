The Danish company said it is already invested in Australia's first offshore wind farm, Star of the South, and the 5,000 MW Murchison green hydrogen.
APA Group has successfully conducted pressurized hydrogen testing in a 43-km gas pipeline in Western Australia. The government of Western Australia stated that the testing, carried out by APA, the owner and operator of the Parmelia Gas Pipeline, demonstrated the technical feasibility, safety, and efficiency of running the pipeline with pure or blended hydrogen at the current operating pressure. This development brings the pipeline closer to becoming one of Australia's first gas transmission pipelines to be converted to a pure hydrogen service. The project's next phase will focus on preparing the pipeline for hydrogen service, including detailed conversion plans, safety studies, and exploration of potential supply and offtake opportunities.
Infinite Green Energy and Samsung C&T have signed an agreement to develop and construct the Arrowsmith Hydrogen Plant in Western Australia. The plant, powered by wind and solar energy, will be located 30 km south of Dongara and is expected to produce up to 300 tons of green hydrogen per day (100,000 tons per year). The initial focus of production will be on Asian markets, including Japan and South Korea. Infinite Green Energy said it anticipates starting production in early 2028.
University of Alberta researchers have developed a catalyst that, with a small amount of power, can produce hydrogen and clean drinking water when placed in any type of water. The catalyst was discovered by chance during an experiment and is non-toxic, abundant, and cost-effective. The team said it aims to create off-grid devices to support remote communities and disaster relief efforts.

As part of the Model Region Agri-photovoltaics for Baden-Württemberg research project, the third LVWO pilot plant has gone into operation at the Heuchlingen experimental fruit farm in Bad Friedrichshall, Germany.
Combining power generation with the cultivation of soft fruit, farmers are increasingly employing protection systems against cold, rain, hail, and excessive solar radiation. Pests are kept at bay through the use of nets. The installation of solar modules has the potential to generate sustainable synergy effects, according to Baden-Württemberg's Ministry of Food, Rural Areas, and Consumer Protection.
The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems reports that the agrivoltaic system at the Heuchlingen farm has a capacity of 113 kW. Researchers will examine the effects of the facility on the cultivation of raspberries, blueberries, currants, strawberries, gooseberries, and blackberries on an area of nearly 2,000 square meters. To explore resource-saving cultivation techniques, the facility incorporates fully closed circuits for water and nutrients.
“Rainwater is collected, stored and used with fresh water for irrigation,” said Oliver Hörnle, a project manager for Fraunhofer ISE. “Excess liquid from the substrate in which the berries grow is collected, processed with the help of a solar-powered system and also reused.”
As part of the research project, the LVWO, the Fraunhofer ISE and 11 other project partners are building and testing a total of five agri-photovoltaic pilot systems in Baden-Württemberg. Researchers will seek to gain experience and knowledge for the practical implementation of agri-PV systems, examine innovative approaches, clarify legal framework conditions, and make the technology available for practical use.
In Austria, meanwhile, RWA Solar Solutions and Frutura are testing the combination of PV and apple cultivation in the Pöchlarn eco-solar biotope.
Under the project's 4.1 MW system, researchers are actively testing several variants of agrivoltaics. Frutura has approximately 300 apple trees on a test area of around 900 square meters. Additionally, a reference area of approximately 640 square meters with 200 trees is being observed, which is protected by a hail net instead of solar modules. According to Frutura, the initial results are positive: the unique microclimate under the photovoltaic system enhances tree growth and accelerates vegetation development. However, continuous use of a drip irrigation system is necessary due to rainwater shielding.
This year, Frutura aims to examine the effects of the PV system on the behavior of beneficial insects and pests, as well as on the formation of flower buds, fruit size and hail protection.

Brazil's solar energy industry is grappling with new concerns as operational underperformance threatens to compound existing challenges of pricing, connection availability, and contract closures.
According to analyst Vinicius Vitti, the Greener Summit revealed that out of the 3.4 GW of centralized generation mapped by Greener in 2022, 65% generated less power than anticipated. In the case of distributed generation, where the total capacity of plants exceeding 1 MW reached 103 MW, 41% fell short of expectations.
Among the most common failures identified in distributed generation, the consultancy found that 44% were related to the malfunction of string inverters and 30.6% to the lack of communication from the plants.
“There is a lack of training for professionals,” Huawei O&M Manager Rodrigo Trigona said. “There are many problems in civil works and you often have to do rework. It is generating a bad legacy for the commissioning phase, in a scenario where deadlines are tight.”
Businesspeople tend to underestimate the complexity of solar power plant systems, which bring together different disciplines of knowledge, such as electricity, photovoltaics, network architecture, and civil construction, he added.
“We do remote start-up supervision and often the plant doesn't even appear to have started up. We see chain loop, reverse current, intermittent communication. If the data is not sent reliably, it is not possible to know if the plant is really generating what was expected,” Neto explained.

Among the planned projects are PV plants from Repsol, Comal and Sonnedix.
Repsol is set to begin construction of its first two PV facilities, with a combined capacity of 11 MW, in the southern Puglia region. The solar parks are part of the Spanish company’s planned 825 MW of PV projects slated for Italy, where it is also developing 943 MW of wind power.
Repsol’s vast Italian portfolio comprises acquisition of various projects, including those deriving from its recent takeover of Asterion Energies, in the regions of Puglia, Lazio, Sardinia, Umbria, Sicily, Basilicata, Molise and Tuscany.
Comal will build an 80 MW solar facility on the island of Sardinia for Italian energy company Saras. The plant is scheduled to be constructed in the first half of 2024 in Cagliari. Comal has signed an agreement with a Saras subsidiary, Sardeolica, for construction of the facility.
Meanwhile, Sonnedix has begun construction of two PV plants with a combined capacity of 34 MW in the central Lazio region. Sonnedix has signed a 10-year PPA with Norwegian energy group Statkraft for the facilities, which will supply 48 gigawatt-hours per year. This deal marks the second collaboration between Sonnedix and Statkraft in Italy and their third in Europe. Last year the companies signed power purchases agreements for a solar portfolio in Italy with a total capacity of 22 MW.

Soltec has developed a new bifacial tracking algorithm to determine the optimal angle for solar trackers to maximize the production of specific bifacial modules in solar plants.
The algorithm estimates power generation for various angles, considering front and rear irradiance and module performance. It uses Soltec's self-developed astronomical algorithm based on solar positioning data from NREL-SPA.
The algorithm considers plant parameters, such as albedo and soil albedo, which can be dynamically configured for improved efficiency. Analytical and experimental tests were conducted across different latitudes, showing an increase in power generation ranging from 0.10% to 0.12%, depending on location and albedo conditions.
The algorithm's effectiveness varies monthly, with a greater gain observed during lower sun angles and winter months. While the potential overall profit of the algorithm is 0.29% (0.41% during the activation period), the actual profit obtained was 0.18% due to weather forecast inaccuracies.
Soltec estimates an economic gain of €6,192 ($6,698)  per year for a 50 MW plant in Mediterranean latitude under 30% albedo conditions. The algorithm complements Soltec's other tracking algorithms, such as TeamTrack and Diffuse Booster, which address shading and maximize production during diffuse radiation, respectively.

The agency said that it tested a perovskite absorber over a 10-month period in order to assess its resistance to vacuum, extreme temperatures, radiation, and light stressors simultaneously.
“There is no ground analog, no machine that will do all of those crazy things to it at the same time quite like the International Space Station,” said researcher Lyndsey McMillon-Brown.
The scientists attached the film to the outer side of the space station and exposed it to space conditions from March 2020 to January 2021. It then returned to NASA's laboratories on Earth and its status was compared to that of a reference device on the ground. The research group said the space-traveling perovskite cell's sunlight-absorbing qualities were surprisingly restored when hit by solar light on Earth, while the reference showed stronger degradation when exposed to the same conditions.
“The perovskite film was still dark black after spending 10 months on the International Space Station, proving her team’s innovative solar cell material is suitable for possible use on future space missions,” said McMillon-Brown. “We don’t know exactly what about the space environment gave our film this superpower.”
Looking forward, the NASA team said that it will try to find out which specific parts of the space environment transformed the perovskite.
“Not only do they survive, but in some ways, they thrived. I love thinking of the applications of our research and that we’re going to be able to meet the power needs of missions that are not feasible with current solar technologies,” said McMillon-Brown.
The results confirmed earlier research showing that the lack of moisture and oxygen outside of Earth’s atmosphere is actually beneficial to perovskite cells, and that the cells could be more suitable for operation in space without any major changes. The group said that there is huge potential for improvements in terms of stability and lifetime, and that proving the cell for long-term operation in space will be the next research step.

The solar projects are part of the Ministry of Energy's National Renewable Energy Program (NREP), in which PIF is mandated to develop 70% of the initiative's target capacity. Badeel and ACWA Power, a leading developer, investor and operator of power generation, water desalination and green hydrogen plants, will jointly own the new projects, which have a combined value of SAR 12.2 billion ($3.25 billion).
Financial close for these projects is expected by the third quarter of 2023.
The Ar Rass 2, Saad 2 and Al Kahfah projects have respective capacity levels of approximately 2,000 MWac, 1,125 MWac and 1,425 MWac and will be used to power some 750,000 households.
The companies expect the financial close for the projects by the third quarter of 2023.
The energy ministry aims to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix to around 50% by 2030, with the remainder supplied through high-efficiency, gas-fueled power plants.
PIF is currently developing a total of five projects with a cumulative capacity of 8 GW and more than $6 billion of investment from its own funding as well as from partners. The company said it aims to enable and support the local private sector through requirements for significant local content contribution and the procurement of equipment, supplies and services through local supply chains.
“The three new solar projects are part of PIF’s commitment to develop 70% of Saudi Arabia’s renewable energy by 2030, in line with the National Renewable Energy Program,” said Mohammed AlBalaihed, head of Energy & Utilities at PIF. “Renewable energy is one of PIF’s priority sectors, with a focus on unlocking the capabilities of promising sectors and enabling the private sector to enhance Saudi Arabia’s efforts in diversifying the economy.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/22/australian-state-targets-1-5-gw-of-renewables-and-storage-in-latest-tender-round/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 22, 2023",Australian state targets 1.5 GW of renewables and storage in latest tender round,"From pv magazine Australia
The Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) has officially opened the third in what’s to be a decade of rolling tenders as the state continues to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap which aims to deliver at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation and 2 GW of long-duration storage by 2030 to help replace the state’s ageing coal-fired power stations.
AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as NSW Consumer Trustee, said the latest tender is seeking an indicative amount of 2,500 GWh (about 950 MW) of generation and 550 MW of long-duration (at least eight hours) storage, but more can be awarded if it is in the long-term financial interest of NSW consumers.
The tender is open to all projects across the state that can connect to existing grid infrastructure, irrespective of their location within the renewable energy zones.
AEMO Services Chair Paul Moy said the tender will look to build on the success of the inaugural tender round, which concluded at the start of May.
That tender delivered renewable energy projects worth $2.5 billion of investment, including two solar farms, a wind farm and a long-duration battery that will contribute 1.4 GW of renewable energy generation in NSW. The three generation projects selected for the first tender round exceeded AEMO Services’ indicative target by more than 400 MW.
Moy said the first tranche of renewable energy projects, drawn from a shortlist of 16 projects representing more than 4.3 GW of large-scale generation and long-duration storage, would serve as a running start for the coming instalment.
“We spent more than 12 months in the lead-up to our first tender working closely with investors and proponents to streamline the process and design new products to incentivise the acceleration of their energy infrastructure projects,” he said.
“We’ll continue to build on that work and fine-tune our offering to make sure subsequent tenders enjoy the same success.”
Moy said the strong pool of projects which had been shortlisted on non-price criteria in the first tender but not yet demonstrated the same financial value to electricity consumers, would provide a solid base for the next tranche of bids with unsuccessful proponents from the inaugural tender encouraged to submit bids.
“We designed our tenders specifically to allow unsuccessful proponents to submit subsequent bids at minimal additional cost to them,” he said. “This provides benefits to both consumers and bidders and is a key features of our rolling 10-year competitive tender schedule.”
“The first tender also demonstrates the depth of the pipeline of projects that are well placed to re-submit high quality bids in this tender. We anticipate that many of these projects will be able to improve their bids and be successful.”
AEMO Services Acting Executive General Manager Graeme Edie said the two-stage process for this tender round will be similar to that employed in the inaugural round.
“The first stage will be an assessment against non-price criteria, such as community benefit and local employment,” he said. “The second stage is a financial value assessment for shortlisted projects, which determines the projects that best deliver in the long-term financial interests of NSW electricity consumers.”
Edie said successful projects will be awarded long-term energy service agreements (LTESAs) that provide a floor price for output, allowing for greater investment certainty for developers.
The first tender round delivered strike prices about 40% below the levelized cost of electricity which Edie said “demonstrates the market understands the advantages and value of the LTESA contract.”
“AEMO Services has designed and consulted on these innovative option contracts, and feedback received from the market is that they are highly sought-after,” he said. “We expect robust competition for them in this tender round, increasing over time as the tender plan progresses.”
This tender round is the second for generation and long-duration storage and the third in AEMO Services’ tender schedule. The state is also seeking offers for a minimum of 380 MW of shorter duration ‘firming capacity’ (at least two hours of storage) to supplement resources in major load areas ahead of the impending closure of the Eraring coal plant in late 2025.

Maxeon Solar Technologies has priced a public offering of shares to raise $157.4 million in equity proceeds. It said it would use the funds for Maxeon 7 module production and general corporate purposes.
Maxeon is selling 7.48 million common shares of stock, including 1.87 million shares of historic investor TotalEnergies, at a price of $28 per share. At closing, the company anticipates receiving more than $157 million in gross proceeds. The offering was upsized by 10% from an initial announcement that Maxeon made of selling 6.8 common shares, according to a company statement. The add-on public offering was expected to close on May 19.
BofA Securities and Morgan Stanley served as joint book-running managers for Maxeon’s offering. Raymond James and Roth Capital Partners were co-managers for the offering. In an additional private placement transaction, TCL Zhonghuan Renewable Energy, a current 23.7% shareholder in Maxeon, will acquire 1.5 million shares in Maxeon stock for about $42 million.
TCL Zhonghuan is a Chinese semiconductor manufacturer primarily engaged in the solar market. In July 2020, Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor was acquired by TCL after the consumer electronics manufacturer won an auction to buy shares of its parent, state-owned Zhonghuan Electronic Information Group.
Maxeon is using the equity raise to fund the 500 MW capacity expansion of its cell manufacturing capacity for Maxeon 7 interdigitated back contact (IBC) panels, which is expected to increase its  manufacturing capacity of the next-generation panels by about 50%, the company said.  Maxeon 7 IBC panels are expected to be the world’s most efficient solar panels at approximately 24% module efficiency.
The IBC manufacturing expansion would utilize a previously closed Philippines warehouse with module assembly to occur at other existing Maxeon facilities. The Philippines facility will be designated as a “Fab5” facility and located near Maxeon’s existing Fab4 site, which currently hosts the Maxeon 7 pilot line.
Maxeon said Fab5 site production will ramp up in the second half of 2024. The company said new volume produced at Fab5 will be sold to the distributed generation (DG) markets, including expanding supply volume into a new U.S. residential channel market. Additional new Fab5 expansion capacity will allow more shipments to its European market and rebalance the mix of Maxeon and Performance line sales.
Total capital expenditures (capex) for Maxeon’s IBC expansion are $200 million, of which about $50 million is for site preparation and long-lead time items included in prior 2023 guidance. Including the $157.4 million and $42 million of add-on and private placement proceeds, the company’s 2023 capex budget remains at $150 million to $170 million, of which $100 million relates to the Fab5 ramp up.
Domestic content guidance
In US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Maxeon said the company’s management was reviewing the May 12 guidance from the Internal Revenue Service related to domestic content bonus incentives under the US Inflation Reduction Act.
For taxpayers using the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (ITC), eligibility for the domestic content bonus would increase the credit by 10%, which in most cases is from 30% to 40% of the cost of a qualifying solar property. By power output, using the production tax credit (PTC) would increase by 10% as well as a result of domestic content eligibility.
“IRS guidance is supportive of our announced plans to deploy a multi-GW cell and module factory in the US to manufacture solar products for both the DG and utility-scale power plant markets,” said Maxeon said. “We are currently evaluating this guidance, which provides guidelines for how the solar products we will produce help our customers qualify for the domestic content bonus in the ITC and PTC and prescribes requirements for certain record-keeping and certification.”
Maxeon was spun off from SunPower in August of 2020, when both became separate entities. TotalEnergies owns a minority interest in Maxeon.
The company’s Performance line of solar modules leverage Maxeon’s shingled cell technology, originally developed by SunPower. The technology is protected by 83 granted patents. The 425 W modules use bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large-format eight-inch G12 wafers, and have an efficiency of 20.6%, according to Maxeon.
Maxeon is based in Singapore but lists shares on the Nasdaq Capital Markets exchange, where it currently trades at $28.66 per share today with a $1.3 billion market capitalization. The company has 5,344 employees worldwide, of which based primarily in Mexico (39%), Malaysia (33%) and the Philippines (20%), according to its annual financial statement.

Canada-based Polar Racking says it will add two facilities to manufacture solar mounts in the United States. One factory will be located in Michigan, the other in Florida.
A spokesperson for the company told pv magazine USA that it is building up to more than 1 GW of tracker and fixed-tilt capacity by mid 2024, with the ability to scale up from there. The company said each site will add 10 jobs, with job opportunity growth as demand increases.
The Michigan facility is currently operational, and the Florida plant is expected to reach commercial production by the end of summer 2023, said the spokesperson.
“Our new US facilities mitigate shipping lead time risks for our customers and gives us additional control over the entire supply chain,” said Pals Saddyappan, director of supply chain and global manufacturing for Polar Racking.
The company now has a pipeline of 3.4 GW of solar mounting and racking across North America and the Carribean.
Made-in-USA solar components, including racking, trackers, and mounts, are in-demand across the nation, as the Inflation Reduction Act includes a 10% tax credit adder for renewable energy projects that include a certain threshold of domestic content. The US Department of the Treasury recently released guidance on the content requirements, which contain complexities and are actively being evaluated by the industry. The subject of domestic content requirements was a hot topic at the RE+ Southeast renewable energy conference in Atlanta, Georgia.
“The expansion of Polar Racking’s manufacturing operations is in response to our customers’ needs to meet the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) domestic content requirements,” said Vishal Lala, managing director of Polar Racking. “Polar Racking supports the government’s initiative to re-shore the PV supply chain to create local jobs and bolster the local economy.”

Researchers at the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Silchar, Assam in India have designed a formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) perovskite solar cell with a potential power conversion efficiency of 31.57%.
They built the cell with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (TFO) substrate, a zinc oxide (ZnO) electron transport layer, the FASnI3 absorber, nickel oxide (NiO) hole transport layer (HTL), and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The proposed Au/NiO/FASnI3/ZnO0.25S0.75/FTO solar cell device structure revealed an exceptional open-circuit voltage of 1.2419 V, short-circuit current density of 28.35 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 89.64%, and power conversion efficiency of 31.57%.
The researchers designed and investigated the device structure using SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance simulator at AM 1.5G illumination, 1000 W/m2 incident power, and 300 K temperature.
The performance parameters of the proposed solar cell device structure were investigated with variations in the active layer (FASnI3) thickness, defect density, and doping concentration; and variations of NiO HTL and ZnO0.25S0.75 ETL thickness, electron affinity, and doping concentration to achieve higher performance. Moreover, they inspected the influence of series and shunt resistance and temperature on the performance parameters of the proposed solar cell device structure.
The latest issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
“The FASnI3 parameter variations revealed that to attain high solar cell efficiency, we desire optimal FASnI3 thickness, defect density, and doping concentration, facilitated by a decent number of photons absorption and restricted non-radiative recombinations,” said Robin Khosla, a member of the research team and assistant professor at the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Silchar, in an interview with pv magazine.
The scientists shared their research in Results in Optics. The research team included Robin Khosla, Srinivas Mattaparthi, Dipesh K. Sinha, and Aditya Bhura.
