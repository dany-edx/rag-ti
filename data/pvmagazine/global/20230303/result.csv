“Attractiveness of each investment (as measured by the payback period) is likely to increase as EU industries scale and reduce production and installation costs,” said the global management consulting firm .
The analysis considers three price scenarios, using a German single-family home as an example. A “high commodity price” scenario, a “high gas but average power price” scenario, and a low-commodity price scenario, where gas prices return to historical averages and power prices reach new lows.
Heat pumps and rooftop solar both have the longest payback periods in the low power price scenario, but it also has the high decreases in payback periods between 2022 and 2030. The payback periods for heat pumps could fall by 38%, from 17.1 years in 2022 to 10.6 years in 2030. The payback period for rooftop solar could fall by 31%, from 12.6 years in 2022 to 8.7 years in 2030.
Heat pumps have the shortest payback periods under the “average power price” scenario. The payback period could decrease by 28% in this time frame, from 12.5 years in 2022 to nine years in 2030. For rooftop solar, average payback periods could fall from 9.2 years in 2022 to 5.8 years in 2030.
Rooftop solar has the shortest payback periods under the “high-power price” scenario. It could fall 34% from 8.2 years in 2022 to 5.4 years in 2030. The payback period for heat pumps could go from 15.1 years in 2022 to 10.3 years in 2030, down 32%.
“These payback periods (and therefore household energy costs) could lower further due to decreasing electricity costs as the power system decarbonizes and decentralizes (reducing costs at peak times),” said McKinsey & Company.
The new study focuses on three initiatives that reportedly have the largest potential to substantially improve the energy efficiency of EU buildings: the ramping up of rooftop solar and heat pump installations, and the improvement of the insulation of buildings.
It finds that the yearly deployment of rooftop solar will need to be around 33 GW to reach the EU’s Fit-for-55 and Repower EU targets, compared with the record rate of 22 GW in 2022 and the 10 GW average of the last four years.
“Heat pump deployment will also need to keep growing at 12.5% a year through to 2030 to reach RePowerEU’s target of 54 million heat pumps by 2030,” the authors say. At the end of 2021, Europe had reportedly installed 15 million heat pumps, with McKinsey estimating an additional 2.5 million installations in 2022.
The consultancy firm suggests five key drivers to help catalyze these changes: upskilling the workforce, setting up appropriate incentive mechanisms, attracting financing and private capital, investing in grid infrastructure, and creating net-zero and circular supply chains.
The forthcoming March edition of pv magazine features an extended article from the McKinsey report authors about the outlook and competitiveness of the European solar production industry.

The release of hydrogen from the powder and conversion into electricity is done through a proprietary, compact release unit,” said Electriq. The Israeli startup said it wants to start making hydrogen powder from green hydrogen by 2025. 
Universal Hydrogen has flown a 40-passenger regional airliner using hydrogen fuel cell propulsion, in the first flight of its kind. The aircraft took off from an airport in the US state of Washington and flew for 15 minutes. “The flight, conducted under an FAA Special Airworthiness Certificate, was the first in a two-year flight test campaign expected to culminate in 2025 with entry into passenger service of ATR 72 regional aircraft converted to run on hydrogen,” said the US-based hydrogen-powered aviation specialist.  
BP has launched a green hydrogen cluster in  Castellón, Spain. “Led by BP, this public-private collaborative initiative is intended to be based around the phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030 to produce green hydrogen at BP's refinery,” said the UK oil and gas giant. BP expects to invest up to €2 billion ($2.12 billion) in the Castellon facility by 2030.
Toyoda Gosei has unveiled new high-pressure hydrogen tanks. “These newly developed large tanks can be filled with about eight times as much hydrogen as the passenger fuel cell vehicle tanks Toyoda Gosei produces for the Toyota Mirai (the second-generation model), which are installed in the rear of that vehicle,” said the Japanese company. 
Enapter has started producing a water-cooled variant of its AEM Electrolyser EL 4.0 solution, which enables the direct connection of external cooling systems to optimize thermal management and efficiently use waste heat. “The heat is released via a secondary circuit and can be combined with a heat pump. A common cooling circuit with other components such as water-cooled fuel cells is also possible,” said the German hydrogen generator manufacturer. The AEM Electrolyser EL 4.0 LC is available in AC and DC versions.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has revealed plans to strengthen support for green hydrogen investment in Kenya. The EIB said it expects to initially mobilize €1.8 million of grants to support initiatives in the country.

Conceived for large-scale application, LAES systems store electricity in the form of liquid air or nitrogen at cryogenic temperatures – below -150 C. They charge by using excess electricity to power compression and liquefaction of the air which is then stored as a liquid at temperatures approaching -196 C. To discharge, the liquid air warms and becomes a pressurized gas that operates a turbine to generate electricity.
The proposed system comprises a 2 MW local PV power plant equipped with maximum power point tracking (MPPT)-based boost converter. The installation is able to generate low-carbon electricity with minor fluctuations between 12.89 and 12.99 MWh a day
The LAES unit utilizes surplus power from the PV plant and compensates power for the local load with an inadequate power level. The system’s energy storage duration at the off-peak time is 9.13 hours, and the energy release duration at peak time is 6.27 hours.
For the proposed PV-LAES project, results show that the surplus renewable electricity of 6.73 MWh sent to LAES is used for generating 27.12 tons of liquid air for energy backups during the daytime. There, the LAES unit has a round-trip efficiency of 47.4% and can discharge a flexible power compensation to the load in the night.
Meanwhile, the power demand from the main grid reduces significantly in a day from 12.78 to 3.33 MWh. Based on these data, the annual power savings is estimated to be 3449.25 MWh, and the corresponding carbon emission can be reduced by 2607.63 tons.
Regarding the economic performance, the PV-LAES system presents a dynamic payback period of 9.33 years and an accumulated life-cycle net profit of $2,260,011, the researchers found.
They discussed their findings in “Hybrid photovoltaic-liquid air energy storage system for deep decarbonization” published in Energy Science and Engineering.
“The proposed PV-LAES scheme is economically feasible from a life-cycle perspective, and can potentially realize flexible energy interaction with local renewables to achieve an integrated low-carbon power generation and storage system,” the researchers concluded.

While energy storage will present a big part of the solution to this, other approaches to managing the output of renewable resources can also be valuable, and these could be even more effective with the added ability to predict the output of a renewable energy system even just a few hours in advance.
And this is what researchers led by Chung-Ang University in South Korea set out to achieve, developing a forecasting model to predict renewable energy output and other uncertain parameters to help run a grid optimally, and profitably for the energy generators.
“The proposed data-driven forecasting method employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, an artificial neural network with feedback connections. Its hyperparameters are optimized by a genetic algorithm-adaptive weight particle swarm optimization (GA-AWPSO) algorithm, while a global attention mechanism (GAM) identifies important features from input parameter data,” explains Chung-Ang Professor Mun Kyeom Kim, describing the maths behind his model. “Both these algorithms can help overcome the limitations of the conventional methods and improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency of the LSTM model.”
The model is also able to take into account uncertainties on the demand and pricing side. Its workings are described in full in the paper A novel deep learning-based forecasting model optimized by heuristic algorithm for energy management of microgrid, published in Applied Energy.
The researchers tested their work using data from the PJM interconnection grid that covers part of the United States, and found it was more accurate than existing grid models, and was particularly in forecasting solar PV output. “It will accelerate the integration of renewable resources in power supply networks while enabling MG operators to solve day-ahead energy management issues,” stated Kim. “Ultimately, it can open doors to zero-emission electricity sources that can make carbon neutrality by 2050 a realistic goal to achieve.”

As of 2021, global sales of electric vehicles had reached 16 million units, underscoring accelerating demand, said the International Energy Agency. The transportation energy transition has only just begun.
Most batteries retired from EVs still have about 70% of their capacity remaining, said San Diego-based startup Smartville, noting that this makes them an ideal candidate for second-life use. This is the opportunity that Smartville aims to seize, by repurposing EV batteries as grid-scale energy storage to store renewable energy. 
“Our second-life energy storage product repurposes EV batteries to reliably store power from solar and wind,” said Antoni Tong, chief executive officer of Smartville. “The outcome is that the system can sustainably power our communities, lessening our dependence on external energy sources.” 
The company announced it secured a $5.9 million grant from the US Department of Energy to scale this service. The grant came as part of a $75 million funding package made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which awarded a total of 10 projects that advance EV battery recycling and reuse efforts. 
Smartville's MOAB product can hold between six to 10 battery packs with nominal ratings between 200 kWh to 500 kWh. The company’s proprietary suite of software, hardware and diagnostics comes with a performance guarantee for stationary storage, serving enterprise and utility customers. 
“We realized early on that the only way to grow a real market for this type of technology is to be able to absolutely warranty or guarantee the performance,” said Mike Ferry, president of Smartville. “We validated our technology using battery modules obtained by disassembling EV battery packs, and we cycled modules of different chemistries from different automakers. As a result, we now have software and hardware that can use batteries of different states of health within the same system and we’re able to improve total system state of health over time.”
Ferry said Smartville sees benefits in focusing on repurposing battery packs, rather than performing disassembly and repurposing battery modules. The company said labor and cost for disassembly is prohibitive when reaching a megawatt-hour or gigawatt-hour scale. 
Smartville said it will use the Department of Energy funds to accelerate the commercialization of its repurposing product. The company first plans to achieve UL certification for the technology and will follow that with a 4 MWh demonstration project. The pilot project will locate the repurposed battery with an existing central California power plant in an identified disadvantaged community. 
Smartville was launched out of the University of California, San Diego, starting with a $2 million government loan through the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy program. The company said it will install another prototype system at the end of the second quarter with Southern Company. While Smartville has other early-stage projects in the works, it is focusing on certification, commercialization, and scaling its manufacturing in the coming year.

A solar tower capable of withstanding Category 1 hurricane winds (120 kmh to 153 kmh) has been shown to be commercially viable. Three Sixty Solar, a Canadian commercial and utility-scale solar developer, published a white paper this week that provides background on the solar tower’s initial 16 months in operation.
The British Columbia-based company has indicated that each of its early-stage towers can produce up to 250 kW of clean energy, while future towers could be installed at multiple megawatts of power capacity in grid applications. The company installed the Solar Tower demonstration project in October 2021, and reported that installation took place in five working days using a bucket-lift crane to handle mounting systems.
Following an early autumn storm that brought strong winds and several days of extreme rain and wind gusts in November 2021, the developer reported no damage to the Solar Tower. Many in the nearby community of Kelowna, British Columbia, were without power and closed schools for a matter of days. The PV panels were inspected and remained firmly intact and the tower structure remained in as-built condition.

The ministry has not revealed the locations of the planned projects or their combined capacity. Prospective providers have until April 26 to submit their offers.
According to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Turkmenistan did not have any solar or wind capacity installed as of 2021. Its total renewable energy capacity was 2 MW in 2021 – all from hydroelectric power.
Turkmenistan could soon start exploiting its vast solar potential, as the nation gets more than 3,000 hours of sunshine per year in some areas, with an average of 300 sunny days a year. It enjoys an average solar irradiation intensity of 600 W per square meter, and almost year-round sunshine in dry desert areas, which cover 86% of the country.
In November, Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy developer Masdar and Turkmenistan‘s power utility, Turkmenenergo, signed a joint development agreement for a 100 MW solar park in the country. But this is not the first large-scale renewable energy project under development in Turkmenistan. In July, Turkmenenergo signed an agreement with Turkish developer Çalik Enerji Sanaýi we Tijaret A.Ş. to build a 10 MW hybrid wind-solar park, with 3 MW of solar. The plant is located near Altyn Asyr, a recently completed artificial lake.

William Creek, Australia  – a town about nine hours north of the city of Adelaide – has made the shift from diesel generation to solar, in a move that has slashed the town’s energy costs with no capital outlay. At the gateway to the Simpson Desert, William Creek has a population of just 50, but it hosts approximately 26,000 tourists each year. Previously the town was 100% reliant on diesel generation, but is now powered by a 200 kW ground-mounted solar array coupled with a 280 kWh battery energy storage system.
Juice Capital, which financed the project as part of a long-term commercial power purchase agreement (PPA), said the off-grid system, which went live in November 2022, has supported in the town’s ambition to be self-sufficient and sustainable while significantly reducing its power bill. Juice Capital Commercial Sales Manager Dan Howard said the town’s previous diesel-generated power was priced at approximately AUD 1.20 ($0.81) per kilowatt-hour. Now the town purchases its electricity for $0.287 per kilowatt-hour.
“We are really proud of this project as it has bridged a gap between the outback and grid-connected towns,” he said. “Communities like William Creek have been left to fend for themselves when it comes to delivering their own energy. To power a town like this using only diesel was expensive. They now have an option.”
Designed and developed in conjunction with Adelaide-headquartered engineering firm MyEnergy, the William Creek renewable energy system comprises 330 Trina solar modules and 135 kVa of Victron Energy Quattro inverters DC coupled using Victron 450/200 smart solar chargers and AC coupled using Fronius International ECO inverters. This is partnered with 280 kWh of energy storage provided by Pylon Technologies’ US5000 batteries. The system is remotely controlled using technology provided by Victron Energy.
Howard said one of the key challenges associated with the William Creek project is the “sheer remoteness” of the location.
“William Creek is one of the most remote communities in Australia,” he said. “There is over 300 kilometers of dirt road to get there.”
Juice Capital will own, operate, and maintain the solar and battery power plant on behalf of William Creek for the life of the asset, which is one of a growing portfolio the company has throughout Australia. The Sydney-headquartered company said it has more than 350 on-site solar power plants with a combined capacity of more than 15 MW operating on commercial business sites in all states and territories.
Howard said the company’s solutions include solar systems, grid energy, storage and emerging energy technologies.
“Our customers are SME’s, farmers, hospitality, and a broad range of service businesses,” he said. “We help business reduce their carbon footprint, save money and work toward their net zero goals without the use of their own capital.”
