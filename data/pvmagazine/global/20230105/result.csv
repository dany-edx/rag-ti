The new measure will apply to all PV systems up to 1 MW in size. Djukanovic said the new measure will reduce project costs by around 12%.
EPCG and the Montenegrin Ministry of Ecology, Spatial Planning and Urbanism kicked off a net-metering program for rooftop PV in July 2021. A few months later, Investiciono razvojni fond (IRF) – the Investment and Development Fund of Montenegro (IDF MN) – and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched a financing support program to help farmers and small- and medium-sized enterprises to deploy rooftop PV solutions.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had installed just 7 MW of solar power at the end of 2021. Most of Montenegro’s electrical power demand is currently met by the 225 MW Pljevlja thermal power plant in the north of Montenegro and two large hydropower plants, at Perućica (307 MW) and Piva (363 MW).

Neoen has signed a corporate power purchase agreement with TDF, a digital network operator in France.
According to the terms of the contract, TDF will buy 100% of the electricity produced by 62 MW of solar capacity from Jan. 1, 2026, for a period of 15 years. It will draw the electricity from 16.8 MW in Var department and 45.1 MW of capacity in Lot-et-Garonne department, in southeastern France.
The company wants to start building the two facilities this year, with completion scheduled for 2024 and 2025.  The annual anticipated production from the two projects has been estimated at nearly 83 GWh.
For Neoen, it is its first set of corporate power purchase agreements in France.
“We are now approaching the corporate PPA market with great ambition,” said Guillaume Decaen, Neoen’s firector of development in France.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/05/semi-transparent-solar-cell-based-on-silicon-germanium-quantum-wells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 5, 2023",Semi-transparent solar cell based on silicon-germanium quantum wells,"Researchers from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) have fabricated a semitransparent solar cell based on ultra-thin hydrogenated amorphous multiple quantum wells (MQWs) made of silicon and germanium (Si/Ge).
“Our novel semi-transparent solar cell technology could afford several integration opportunities into diverse applications like glass façades in buildings and windows, sunroofs in vehicles and greenhouses for agrivoltaics,” researcher Hosni Meddeb told pv magazine. “The customized design capabilities could enable multifunctional utilization beyond solar energy harvesting such as aesthetic appearance, visual comfort and thermal management.”
Quantum wells are thin nanostructures inserted into the cell layers to alter the bandgap and other properties. In previous PV research, these nanostructures were used as single quantum wells (SQWs) and the novelty of this research consists in giving them a “multiple” configuration.
“This allows extra degree of freedom for both optical design and bandgap engineering,” the scientists said, noting the MQWs offer advantages for both photovoltaic performance and transparency.
They built several solar cells with either MQWs or SQWs and compared their performance at standard illumination conditions to assess the extent of the advantages provided by the former. They deposited front and back electrodes via the DC magnetron sputtering technique and fabricated the semiconductor functional layers through low-temperature Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) method at 13.56 MHz. They also annealed the cells at 100 C for 30 min.
The academics said that a cell built with six 2.5-nanometer MQWs performed better in terms of open-circuit voltage and fill factor than a device based on one 20-nanometer SQW. The champion cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 3.4% and an average visible transmission level of around 33%.
“A corresponding light utilization efficiency above 1.1% is achieved, which can be considered as one of the highest among inorganic semi-transparent solar cell technologies,” they explained.
The research group described the cell technology in “Novel semi-transparent solar cell based on ultrathin multiple Si/Ge quantum wells,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. It is currently trying to establish a techno-economic and ecological assessment for the application of its novel semi-transparent solar cell technology in building-integrated PV. Further non-technical considerations and detailed cost estimations are expected in the future.
“Our proposed ultra-thin-film PV concept could provide promising technological advantages in terms of low material consumption, fast fabrication and cost reduction,” Meddeb explained. “Along with the cost-effective and industrial-compatible fabrication process, large-scale modularization is similar to mature thin-film PV technologies. This would facilitate the technology transfer toward manufacturing and commercialization level.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/05/germany-launches-rebate-program-for-residential-heat-pumps/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JANUARY 5, 2023",Germany’s new rebate program for residential heat pumps has come into effect,"From pv magazine Germany
The German government has proposed changes to its rebate scheme to support the deployment of sustainable heating. The new rules now include heat pumps with natural refrigerants, only clean burning biomass ovens, and hydrogen cell heating systems.
The program covers up to 40% of the costs to buy and deploy heat pumps, with a basic subsidy rate of 25%. Depending on the type of heat pump, there is also a subsidy bonus ranging from 5% to 10% to replace old, inefficient heating systems.
The bonus, which was previously only awarded to heat pumps with geothermal energy, wastewater, or groundwater as a heat source, could now be granted to heat pumps with natural refrigerants such as propane, for example.
From 2028, only heat pumps that use natural refrigerants will be funded. However, the government also noted open negotiations about a new regulation that could include partially fluorinated hydrocarbons. Depending on the outcome, there could still be changes in the promotion of heat pumps with propane.
Another funding condition is a minimum co-efficient of performance (COP) of 2.7, and up to 3.0 COP from 2024. The Federal Heat Pump Association said there are projects in which such annual performance figures could not be achieved without additional measures, such as replacing heating distribution systems or building insulation.
“The good news is that the funding environment for heat pumps will remain largely stable in 2023,” said Martin Sabel, managing director of the German Heat Pump Association. “Up to 40% of the investments not only in the heat pump itself, but also in necessary environmental measures such as radiator replacement or the development of geothermal sources are subsidized.”
For other heating systems such as biomass ovens or fuel cell systems lower rebates rates apply.

And the winners are…
Winner: Huasun Himalaya G12 Series
Challenger manufacturers such as China’s Anhui Huasun Energy Co are setting the pace in HJT development.
In August 2021, Huasun announced 25.26% efficiency on an M6 (166 mm) wafer device – equaling the world record. Expanding to a G12 (210 mm) wafer, the Himalaya G12 (full name: HS-210-B132DS700) peaks at 22.5% module efficiency and a 700 W output in a 66-cell format. The Himalaya offers typical HJT benefits including a lower temperature coefficient of -0.26% and up to 93% bifaciality. The real innovation, gained with cell equipment partner Maxwell, is in the cell processes used to deposit the amorphous silicon and transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers –  reducing light absorption and boosting efficiency.
Huasun wants 20 GW of production capacity by 2025, manufacturing more-than-25.5% efficient cells by that point.
Winner: Gamesa Electric Proteus PV
This up-to-4,700 kVA central inverter showed a careful evolution of Gamesa’s PV central devices, bringing commendable efficiency and features to match a range of demands from solar developers. The comparatively higher efficiencies and power densities from the Proteus, plus Gamesa’s well-tried liquid cooling solution, also allows for less de-rating at high temperatures. Features coming as standard include Q@Night functionality,  and operation at altitude, to be compelling, overall, as part of the efficacy of the solution.
 
 
Winner: EKO Instruments MS-80SH Pyranometer

EKO Instruments’ Class A pyranometer is packed with features that make it stand out in the market for these sensor products that provide the crucial yet often overlooked service of measuring solar irradiance at a site. The MS-80SH features an integrated dome heating system to keep the sensor free of dew and frost that can impact measurement accuracy and can cause dust and dirt to stick to the outside of the dome that houses the sensors.
The company says its pyranometer has the lowest energy consumption on the market and the heating system can be switched on or off remotely, allowing further energy savings. The product is designed for easy compatibility with data loggers and SCADA systems, and internal diagnostics systems enable users to monitor internal temperature, humidity, tilt, and roll angle without having to visit the site and carry out a physical check.
Winner: Villara Energy Systems: VillaGrid
VillaGrid is a residential, lithium titanate (LTO) battery offering twice the continuous power of conventional lithium-ion batteries at 10 kW; four times the peak power at 30 kW; double the lifespan, via a 20-year warranty; and improved safety, as a non-flammable chemistry. Its US manufacturer says even the smallest, 5.75 kWh VillaGrid battery can back a home during a power outage.
The LTO device doesn’t require a heating or cooling system and works well in temperatures between -30 C and 55 C, outperforming other lithium-based chemistries. It can be installed at up to 10,000 feet (3,048 meters). VillaGrid is engineered to last 25 years, far outstripping the industry average of 10 years. Guaranteed end-of-warranty capacity is 70%. “Your solar panels last 25 years and so should your batteries,” Villara says.
Winner: ROSI, High value module recycling
France-based ROSI offers solutions to recover silicon lost as kerf during wafer slicing, and full end-of-life treatment for solar modules. “Our goal is to realize a truly circular economy for the PV industry and beyond,” the company stated in its award application. “The high-value recycling technology allows the reintegration of recovered materials into several key European industries, such as PV, batteries, and semiconductors.”
The company expects to have its first industrial PV module recycling site up and running early this year, initially able to process 3,000 tons of module waste annually, with plans to increase to 10,000 tons next year. Unlike most PV recycling operations to date, it will focus on the recovery of high value materials locked up within the modules as well as the glass that makes up the bulk of the panel’s weight. ROSI promises to produce silver and high-purity silicon at its recycling plant, and to recover 95% of the economic value of module materials, compared to its estimate current industry practices reclaim only 35%.
Winner: Brighten Haiti, Solar4Schools
A presidential assassination, gang violence, outbreaks of dangerous illness, and a chronic energy shortage as a result of armed street blockades have wreaked havoc on Haitians. Gangs blockaded diesel supplies in the capital, Port au Prince, late last year, prompting the closure of schools, hospitals, and much else.
NGO Brighten Haiti’s Solar4Schools program has offered a glimmer of light.
Brighten Haiti supplies 6 kWp solar systems to schools, each of which it says it can deliver on the back of a $6,000 donation from a US sponsor. Some 54,500 students in 109 schools have benefited, according to Brighten Haiti.
Solar4Schools leverages the Secure Power islanding capability  offered by German company SMA Solar Technology, which can deliver up to 2 kW of power in the event of grid outages at a price 87% cheaper than solar-plus-storage. In sustainability terms, the program features “functioning used and blemished modules from the US.”
Winner: Growatt
In January 2021, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, we awarded pv magazine’s Publisher’s Pick for
2020 to inverter manufacturer Growatt. Normally we would have not considered the same company just two years later but Growatt pulled off an amazing feat: it battled the pandemic, supply chain constraints, and a severe semiconductor chip shortage to top its 2020 revenue by 69%. This spectacular achievement, along with its continued innovation on the product and technology front, makes another Publisher’s Pick for 2022 more than well deserved.
Almost two-thirds of Growatt’s 2021 revenue of CNY 3.2 billion ($459 million) came from products sold in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The Shenzhen manufacturer has emerged as a leading player in the energy transition and is on the cusp of emerging as a PV unicorn with an upcoming Hong Kong IPO worth an estimated $1 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/05/gravitricity-to-deploy-prototype-underground-hydrogen-storage-system/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",BERNADETTE GEYER,"JANUARY 5, 2023",Gravitricity to deploy prototype underground hydrogen storage system,"Gravitricity, a Scottish energy storage specialist, has signed a memorandum of understanding with structural engineering contractor VSL Systems UK to develop its first full-scale demonstration project in the United Kingdom for the underground storage of hydrogen. The company told pv magazine that initial use cases for its purpose-built storage systems will include industrial uses and heavy transport, so the systems will likely be located at industrial sites.
Gravitricity’s FlexiStore technology can store up to 1,000 tons of compressed gaseous hydrogen per shaft, and multiple shafts can be co-located at a single site. Current salt mine storage solutions do not provide for flexibility of location, but the FlexiStore system can be installed close to renewable energy facilities, where green hydrogen storage can also help to provide grid-balancing services.
“A single FlexiStore would store the green hydrogen generated by a 460 MW offshore wind farm and could be emptied and refilled daily,” the company said in a statement, noting that multiple shafts “could soak up vast amounts of otherwise wasted or ‘constrained’ wind – which amounted to 3.6 TWh in 2020.” 
Gravitricity said its underground steel-lined rock shafts will be safer than current above-ground storage technologies, which have a higher risk of damage and leaks. Under the terms of the deal, VSL Systems UK will contribute its expertise to the design and construction of the FlexiStore structures, which will be 6 meters in diameter and 365 meters deep, with a capacity of 100 tons of gaseous hydrogen at 220 bar. Gravitricity estimates that the daily storage capacity could be sufficient to refuel more than 1000 HGVS, or to power 500 buses for a week.
A Gravitricity spokesperson told pv magazine that FlexiStore systems will eventually also tap into the potential of gravitational energy, as heavy weights (up to 12,000 tons) are dropped through the hydrogen stored in the shaft. The company is in advanced discussions with Bendalls Engineering to fabricate the linings for the rock shafts, and it is seeking funds for the UK demonstration project.
The company’s gravity-based storage technology is currently being demonstrated in existing mine shafts in Czechia. The technology purportedly has a faster response time than lithium-ion storage technology and can help to stabilize electricity networks at 50 Hz by responding to full power demand in less than a second.

Nostromo Energy, a cold energy storage developer, has received notice from the DoE's Loan Programs Office (LPO) to submit an application to proceed with a $189 million loan to fund the deployment of 275 MWh IceBrick storage projects across 120 buildings in California and various states.
The loan guarantee from the DoE would support Nostromo Energy’s energy storage-as-a-service (ESaaS) solutions for the deployment of behind-the-meter, modular cold energy storage projects to commercial and industrial customers.
The invitation to submit a Part II DoE loan application means that the government loan office has determined that Nostromo Energy’s proposed project is innovative, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and meets technical eligibility requirements under Part I of the application.  If approved, the DoE loan will help Nostromo Energy to deploy more than 275 MWh of cold storage dispatch systems over a network of 120 commercial buildings.
Nostromo Energy has retained investment bank Independence Point Securities to source an undisclosed equity raise to fund the deployment of the 120-building portfolio. Its IceBrick systems are managed by its Cirrus cloud-based energy management system and operate as a virtual power plant, which provides demand flexibility to the local power grid.
The cold dispatch storage product provides the lithium-ion equivalent of  8 kWh to 12 kWh of avoided energy. The IceBrick cell has 92% thermal round-trip efficiency over an approximate four-hour dispatch cycle.

The past year has represented a turning point for the US solar industry. The beginning of the year was marked by lingering pandemic-related delays, trade law enforcement, supply chain issues, and price hikes for components and shipping. Many of these headwinds led to delays and cancellations, and project deployments fell short of initial projections.  
The second half of the year was characterized by renewed optimism, as the landmark US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was passed, allocating a record $369 billion in spending for climate and energy measures. Abigail Ross Hopper, the president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, has dubbed the next 10 years as the “Solar + decade,” as solar and energy storage buildout is expected to continue to build momentum, now energized by the spending package. What can be expected for 2023? 
As is often the case with new technology policy and adoption, the country will look to California as a case study for where things may head for the solar industry. Specifically, Net Energy Metering (NEM), which is instrumental to the value of residential rooftop solar, will be a policy to watch again this year. Just before the clocks changed to 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) unanimously approved NEM 3.0, altering the mechanism by which residential rooftop solar customers are paid for sending their excess generation to the grid.  
Under the new NEM 3.0, Californians who install their projects after April 15 will be paid 75% less on average for their exported solar production, compared to the previous regime. This damaging effect on customer value has led ROTH Capital Partners to project a 30% year-over-year decrease from 2022 residential solar installations in the state. 
The nation will watch California’s residential solar industry closely to see how it will adapt to the loss in system value. A spike of installations can be expected before April as Californians rush to secure the NEM 2.0 credit value for the next 20 years. After that, the industry could suffer a precipitous drop off in installation requests, as happened in Nevada in 2017, when it made a similar cut to net metering. 
California will act as a proving ground to show whether the CPUC was correct in its judgment that solar-plus-battery systems will rise in adoption as NEM is cut. Recent analysis has shown that an increase in adoption is highly unlikely, as the value for end users has been damaged by the new structure. Last year, NEM policy changes occurred or were blocked in Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Michigan, Vermont and many other US states, and 2023 will likely be another battleground year for this policy. 
The Inflation Reduction Act set aside a record $369 billion to support climate and energy goals. The implementation of the package will take time as the industry sorts out the finer details on how to meet certain requirements in the act to qualify for significant tax credit incentives and value adders. 
The government of US President Joe Biden continues to work with industry stakeholders to understand how to implement the law. The White House recently released a guidebook to help industry members to navigate the complexities of its many offerings.
