In a press release which included no details of how the arrangement has been structured, Guelph, Ontario-based Canadian said its new partner, Oxford-based Habitat Energy Limited has its own trading platform and proprietary software PowerIQ, and maximizes income from utility scale storage assets.
A spokesperson for Canadian Solar has subsequently told pv magazine its investment involved purchasing Habitat shares but was not prepared to reveal what proportion of shares were acquired, or at what purchase price. A Habitat Energy representative told pv magazine the investment represented a minority stake in the business.
The English company in December secured the contract to optimize the services of a 2 MW/8 MWh vanadium flow battery near Hawker, in the state of South Australia, which is co-located with a 6 MW solar farm. The project was described, in a Canadian Solar press release today, as “the world's largest solar powered vanadium flow battery.”
Canadian Solar is ramping up its energy storage portfolio after establishing itself as one of the world's leading PV project developers.
The solar manufacturer's CEO, Shawn Qu, said: “The power grid of tomorrow is not only built by renewable energy and battery storage, but crucially driven by artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, cloud computing, and many more technologies. Habitat Energy is the proven leader in AI-enabled battery optimization and dispatch services. We strongly share Habitat Energy's belief that making merchant battery storage investable at scale is a vital step towards delivering a low carbon future and the preservation of our habitat for generations to come.”

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) this week revealed 32 projects, totaling more than 3.3 GW of new renewable energy capacity, were registered for connection into the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2020 and there are no signs of the growth in renewables slowing.
New figures released by AEMO earlier this week show that since March 1, 2021, the federal energy market operator has registered four new wind and solar generators in the NEM, with a total capacity of 226 MW while five generators, contributing a total of 383 MW, completed their commissioning and are in commercial operation.
The ongoing growth in renewables has served to offset concerns of potential electricity supply shortfalls triggered by the earlier-than-expected closure of the Yallourn Power Station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley.
EnergyAustralia announced in March it would shutter Yallourn in 2028, four years sooner than initially scheduled, to build a 350 MW/1.4 GWh big battery in its stead. The four-hour, utility scale battery is expected to be complete by 2026.
The 1.45 GW Yallourn power plant currently supplies about 20% of Victoria’s electricity demand, or 8% of the NEM, and modelling from AEMO suggests its closure could lead to potential electricity supply shortfalls emerging between 2028 and 2030.
AEMO’s 2020 Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) Update models the Yallourn Power Station’s exit from the grid and additional ‘committed’ generation and storage projects not considered in the 2020 ESOO.
AEMO chief systems design officer Alex Wonhas said the fresh modelling suggests there will be a breach of the market’s minimum reliability standards in the absence of a “further commitment of dispatchable capacity.”
“The modeling of the Yallourn exit and new connections since the 2020 ESOO, result in an increase in forecast unserved energy (USE) for Victoria and South Australia,” he said.
“As a result, the interim reliability measure (IRM) will be exceeded in both states in 2028-29 and 2029-30, unless there is further commitment of dispatchable capacity.”
While the loss of Yallourn’s capacity is an issue, figures published by AEMO indicate more than enough dispatchable capacity is expected to be built to address these reliability concerns.
“Based on the pipeline of registered and commissioned renewable projects, we’re well ahead of the 2020 Integrated System Plan’s ‘step change’ scenario which would see more than 90% renewable penetration, including rooftop solar PV, by 2040,” Wonhas said.
AEMO said more than 40 projects, totaling nearly 4.9 GW completed registration or began exporting to the grid in 2020 while another 300 generation and storage projects, totaling 55 GW, are proposed across the NEM.
The 120 MW Gangarri Solar Farm in Queensland is among the new generators registered, along with the 85 MW Winton Solar Farm and 7 MW Ferguson South Wind Farm in Victoria, and the 14 MW Adelaide Desalination Plant Solar and Battery facility, in South Australia.
The 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm leads the way for the new generators which have already been commissioned and are in commercial operation. Others include the 30 MW Molong Solar Farm, in NSW, the 27 MW Maryborough Solar Farm, in Queensland, and the 144 MW Cattle Hill and 82 MW Elaine wind farms, in Tasmania and Victoria, respectively.
Victoria has the strongest connection pipeline of any NEM state, with 32.8 GW across 131 projects in the connection pipeline. Victoria’s proposed capacity is 80% more than the next biggest state, New South Wales, which has 8.1 GW across 52 projects in the application or completion process.
“We’ve seen registrations of new wind and solar projects in Victoria more than double, from 467 MW in 2019 to 1,146 MW in 2020,” Wonhas said.
“We expect registrations to further increase in 2021, with 2,000 MW of new wind, solar and battery storage projects forecast.
“These new generation sources will help transition our electricity market, as two out of three of today’s coal-fired generators are due to retire by 2040.”

GlobalData issued a statement about increasing competition between sovereign wealth fund driven Middle Eastern energy-project rivals ACWA Power, from Saudi Arabia, and the UAE's Masdar. The press release opened with: “Following the news that bidders for the next round of projects on Saudi Arabia's National Renewable Energy Programme (NREP) have until 3 June to submit proposals…”
There has been no official statement from the NREP program on its website or Twitter feed since April last year but British-owned website power-technology.com yesterday reported a previously announced bid deadline of March 24, for 1 GW worth of capacity under the third round of the national renewables scheme, had been extended until June 3.
The third round of the program, for which the request for proposals was last extended until early October last year, consists of two big ‘category B' projects, which are the subject of the reported June deadline, and two smaller ‘category A' projects which, according to power technology and other online reports, attracted three bidders earlier this month.
A source at the MEED Middle Eastern business website owned by GlobalData has confirmed to pv magazine the June 3 deadline refers to the two larger projects in the third round of the national scheme.
Power-technology.com cited “a source familiar with the round three schemes” to back a surmise Masdar and Chinese company Jinko will be among the contenders for the larger sites. The Saudi NREP program stated last April the category B projects comprised a 700 MW project at Ar Rass and a 300 MW Saad solar scheme.
The smaller projects listed for round three – the 120 MW Wadi Ad Dawasir facility and the 80 MW Layla plant – are reported to have attracted bids from ACWA with, according to some sources, China's State Power Investment Corp; from the Total Solar division of the French power company, alongside Saudi investor Al-Blagha; and from Riyadh-based engineer Alfanar.
The NREP website has issued no update on the third round projects for more than a year, since stating the request for proposals for the larger projects would be extended to six months because of Covid-19 disruption. At that time, the state body said the same process for the smaller projects would be announced “later this month.” The story is still the top news article on the NREP English-language website. The department's Twitter feed has not been updated this year and the organization has not responded to pv magazine‘s attempts to make contact since.
The description of the tender issued by NREP a year ago stated the electricity generated by the plants would be bought by the Saudi Power Procurement Company under a 25-year PPA and said all projects would have an 18% local content requirement.
This copy was amended on 17/05/21 to include confirmation by MEED the June 3 deadline applies to the category B projects in the third round of the Saudi NREP.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/13/role-of-distributed-solar-at-issue-in-californias-net-metering-update/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 13, 2021",Role of distributed solar at issue in California’s net metering update,"From pv magazine USA
Now that California gets over 22% of its electricity from solar, the state is again revising its compensation scheme for newly installed distributed solar.
Key parties in an ongoing rate proceeding widely known as ‘NEM 3.0,' agree that new distributed solar should be compensated at lower rates than in the past. They disagree about what the new rates should be, with each party anchoring its proposal in a distinct philosophy.
Solar-plus-storage “will be the future of renewable distributed generation in California,” says a joint proposal from the national solar trade association the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and the non-profit Vote Solar.
(Read “Clean energy advocates are ready to do battle over California’s net energy metering program.”)
Distributed storage is “necessary” for California’s wildfire-prone grid, and will also help manage distribution circuits as loads increase due to electrification, said the California Solar & Storage Association (CALSSA). Because existing solar providers are best able to install distributed storage at scale, the group said, the state’s distributed solar industry must be preserved by compensating self-generators at attractive levels.
Meeting California’s greenhouse gas reduction goals through utility scale renewables alone “is not a realistic scenario,” said CALSSA, saying that transmission siting will be “extremely difficult” and that, based on recent experience, new transmission will be “enormously expensive.”
The Public Advocates Office of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) aims to benefit – and “fairly compensate” – homeowners who add solar, based on the “actual value” of the energy, in a way that “supports electric service affordability for all customers.”
California has a dual mandate for setting electricity rates for self-generators. State law AB 327 calls for these rates to balance the costs and benefits of self-generation, while ensuring that customer-sited renewable generation can grow sustainably.
To balance costs and benefits, SEIA and Vote Solar proposed reducing compensation for self-generation below current “NEM 2.0” rates. New residential self-generators who are served by two of the state’s three major utilities, would be required to use existing, non-tiered time-of-use rates designed to promote electrification. Because those rates are lowest during sunny hours, they would provide a “strong incentive” for new distributed generation customers to include storage, the groups say.
CALSSA proposed a step-down of export credits below current retail rates for new residential self-generators, that would achieve a seven-year payback period. The group said its proposal would promote sustainable growth through a payback period “that customers find acceptable.” The export rates for these customers would then step down over five years, which the groups said would meet California’s sustainable growth goal. They added that customers should be allowed to oversize their systems by up to 50% to provide for load growth due to additional electric vehicles and heat pumps.
The CPUC’s Public Advocates Office said that homeowners with new solar should be compensated at the utility’s avoided cost for their exported energy, through which they would “still receive a meaningful subsidy.” The office said that monthly bill savings would recover the system cost in 13-15 years while solar panels retain 80% of their starting efficiency after 40 years, “so the system owner stands to accrue substantial long-term benefits.”
That office agreed with the proposals of a CPUC-commissioned white paper, which called for the compensation of export energy at avoided cost; adding “grid benefits charges” to cover distribution, transmission and public program costs; and gradually reducing export compensation from the current level. The office’s proposal would also provide storage incentives to existing self-generation customers.
CALSSA challenged that white paper’s analysis, saying it “unreasonably assumes the majority of utility costs are fixed,” and proposing alternative means to measure avoided costs, and to calculate CPUC’s ‘ratepayer impact measure.'
Both the SEIA/Vote Solar proposal and the CALSSA proposal would keep rates for new commercial distributed generation customers at NEM 2.0 levels.
The parties’ proposals are available to read in the California Public Utilities Commission docket for Proceeding R2008020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/13/eu-carbon-price-running-at-level-not-expected-until-next-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CHINA,EUROPE,UNITED KINGDOM",MAX HALL,"MAY 13, 2021",EU carbon price running at level not expected until next year,"The carbon price of around €50 per ton of CO2 emissions currently applied in the EU is running at a level respondents to an annual survey of businesses had not expected until next year.
Under the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS), businesses of a certain scale are permitted only a maximum volume of carbon emissions. If they cannot ensure their operations stay under that level, they can account for the overshoot by buying carbon allowances from firms which emit less than their annual cap, with the carbon price set by demand.
London-based financial data company Refinitiv said respondents to its annual carbon market survey, held in March and April, had not expected a carbon price of €50/ton until next year, and a majority of those polled said their companies were buying emissions allowances as a financial investment, rather than as a requirement, and that the bloc's carbon price had become “a decisive factor for investment decisions.”
Refinitiv, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group and Canada-based newswire Thomson Reuters, said 63% of the respondents to this year's survey described the carbon price as decisive for investment, up from 27% as the emissions-allowance value plunged during Covid-19 lockdowns last year, and from the 52% of respondents who voiced that opinion in 2019.
With 61% of respondents citing investment, rather than compliance as the reason for purchasing carbon credits, some 68% said more ambitious climate change policies had become an important factor in the carbon price. The influence of anticipated policy levers was illustrated by Chinese respondents to the survey, who anticipate the steel industry will be the first sector to be added to a national ETS, or ‘cap-and-trade' system launched in China in January. Respondents to the Refinitiv survey anticipate the EU's plans for a carbon border adjustment mechanism – which would penalize goods with a high embedded carbon footprint – will prompt the Chinese authorities to move to include metals in the first expansion of an ETS which currently applies only to fossil fuel power companies.
Beijing opened the national scheme in January and is pushing for trading in carbon permits to begin before July. However, only 24% of the respondents to the Refinitiv survey believe that will happen. Some 65% of those who replied said trading is likely to start in the second half of the year.
Asked for their predictions about the U.K. cap-and-trade system which is due to start on Wednesday, respondents to the survey said they anticipated a similar carbon price to that seen in neighboring Europe, with half of them expecting the programs to be linked by 2025. Some 20% of those polled said they expect the EU and U.K. schemes to be tied as early as next year but, as survey lead author Anders Nordeng pointed out: “Linking will require a political treaty.”
A Refinitiv spokesperson told pv magazine 303 respondents to its online questions had supplied responses which informed the final report.
This copy was updated on 17/05/21 to reflect how many respondents participated in the survey.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/13/best-membrane-for-non-aqueous-redox-flow-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 13, 2021",Best membrane for non-aqueous redox flow batteries,"Membranes represent a significant portion of the final costs of redox flow batteries (RFB) used in energy storage systems. It is therefore important to identify the membrane technologies that could simultaneously ensure high performance and low-cost production, as this will be crucial to bringing redox flow storage closer to wider adoption in commercial projects.
With this in mind, researchers from Finland's Aalto University and Tianjin University in China have conducted a review of the different kinds of membranes that could be used in non-aqueous redox flow batteries (NARFBs). They describe NARFBs as a second-generation technology with a much higher energy density and temperature window, compared to aqueous devices.
“NARFBs are typically composed of two electrolytes, often distinctly divided as anolyte and catholyte, two electrodes, and one membrane,” they explained. “Application of non-aqueous electrolyte provides a wide selection of solvents, thus, more flexible design of the device, although NARFB works on the similar principles as the aqueous RFBs.”
The electrochemical performance and long-term stability in such storage systems are ensured by three main components – the electrolytes, the electrodes, and the membrane. The latter is used to prevent a problem known as “crossover,” which occurs when the redoxmers migrate to the wrong side of the battery, thus causing capacity losses that can reach up to 50%.
Their analysis included commercial membranes such as dense, ceramic and porous products, as well as intrinsic dense membranes and intrinsic porous devices. The researchers also looked at composite membranes – a category they have identified as the most promising future technology.
“An ideal membrane in NARFBs should have high ionic conductivity and selectivity, low swellability, low-cost, and high mechanical and chemical stability in organic solvent,” the researchers said, adding that dense ceramic membranes feature high ionic selectivity and low swellability, although they have poor mechanical stability and low ionic conductivity. They are also expensive.
Porous membranes are said to exhibit high ionic conductivity and low swellability at low costs. They also exhibit high chemical and mechanical stability, but they irremediably suffer from crossover issues.
“Modified composite membranes achieve high ionic selectivity, low swelling ability, high ionic conductivity, meanwhile, exhibit chemical and mechanical stability simultaneously because of excellent chemical stability and mechanical strength of the porous substrate,” the academics explained. “Intrinsic composite membranes also have a potential of achieving high ionic selectivity and conductivity, low swelling ability, chemical and mechanical stability simultaneously because of the possibilities in monitoring their component materials.”
The Chinese-Finnish research team described all membrane technologies in “Membranes in non-aqueous redox flow battery: A review,” which was recently published in the Journal of Power Sources. Scientists from the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences and the University of Warwick published a similar review, conducted on all membrane technologies for RFBs, in September. In addition, another research team from Aalto University recently conducted a comprehensive analysis of all redox flow battery (RFB) and hybrid RFP technologies.

Chile‘s Environmental Impact Assessment Service (SEIA) has recently agreed to review several large scale solar projects.
Since mid-April, the La Pampina Solar Plant project has planned to inject 160 MW of nominal power at the connection point to the National Electric System and to have a total installed power of 200 MW. The $140 million project is expected to be located in the commune of María Elena in the province of Tocopilla, in the Antofagasta region.
Spanish renewable energy company Grenergy filed an application for the 220 MW Gabriela Photovoltaic Park on April 20, consisting of 487,872 photovoltaic panels of 540 W each which together will have a nominal generation power of 220 MW that will be injected into the National Electricity System (SEN).
Andes Green Energy submitted the Ghungnam Kcs Electric Power Generation project on April 21, planning the construction of a 709 MW solar photovoltaic plant and another 300 MW concentrating solar power plant (CCSP), for a total nominal power of 1,009 MW. The plant should require an investment of $2.78 billion.
Netherlands-based IPP Sonnedix has submitted the Pelequén Solar Park, which includes storage and has a required investment of $140 million. It consists of the construction and subsequent operation of a photovoltaic plant of 175 MWp of installed power and its respective transmission line for the generation of electric power and its subsequent injection into the National Electric System (SEN), at the Malloa Nueva substation. The main works of the project are the photovoltaic plant, a lifting substation, an energy storage system using batteries (BESS) and a 6.2km-long high voltage electric transmission line. The installed power of 175 MWp will be reached using 291,992 bifacial photovoltaic modules whose unit power is 600 Wp.
AME, a Chilean energy company, is developing the Sol del Loa Solar Plant Optimization Project, a modification of a project that was previously approved. It considers the construction and operation, in two stages, of a solar electric power generation plant with a total nominal power of 640 MW. The construction and operation of the project will be carried out in two stages, called ‘sub-phases'. Sub-phase I will have a capacity of 448 MWac and sub-phase II, which will begin to be built immediately after the start of operation of sub-phase I, will have a capacity of 192 MWac. The commissioning of the whole plant is expected to be four years after the start of the construction phase. The solar plant and most of the transmission line will be located in the María Elena district of the Antofagasta region). However, 2.7km of transmission line is projected within the Pozo Almonte district of the Tarapacá region. The estimated investment is $480 million dollars.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/13/air-assisted-water-spray-for-pv-module-cooling/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TURKEY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 13, 2021",Air-assisted water spray for PV module cooling,"Researchers at Ataturk University in Turkey have evaluated the impact of water spray cooling on solar panel performance. They have proposed a number of technical improvements to optimize and scale up this active cooling technology.
The scientists said in “Optimization of operational parameters for a photovoltaic panel cooled by spray cooling” – recently published in Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal – that they used response surface methodology (RSM). The technique, which is used to explore the relationships between several explanatory variables and one or more response variables, was used to identify the key parameters of water spray cooling applied to PV panels.
The researchers applied the so-called response surface design, which includes several mathematical and statistical techniques for empirical model building. It is often used to optimize a response, or output variable, that is influenced by several independent variables, or input variables.
The experiments were made with different spray water flow rates of 0.012, 0.015, and 0.018 m3/h and nozzle air flow rates of 2, 2.4, and 2.8 m3/h, respectively. Water was sprayed via an air-assisted external mixing flat fan nozzle.
“Much finer and a more homogenous atomization is obtained compared to pressurized nozzles,” the researchers said. “Homogeneous droplet distribution and smaller characteristic diameters are other advantages over pressured nozzles.”
One of the researchers, Faruk Yesildal, told pv magazine that the system doesn't require a pump.
“Both the nozzle air inlet and the pressurized water tank are fed by the compressor,” he said, noting that multiple nozzles used in agriculture could be adapted to the system. “A compact system, such as an irrigation system, can be installed in a single pipe. There are many alternatives in this regard.”
The researchers conducted the tests on a panel measuring 630 mm x 550 mm x 25 mm and a power output of 50 W. The tests also featured an open-circuit voltage of 22.0 V and a short-circuit current of 3.03 A. Temperature measurements were taken with Type K thermocouples, which are among the most common temperature sensors, and a data logger. The panel was set with an inclination angle of 15 degrees to prevent the accumulation of liquid on its surface.
They looked at radiation intensities of 700, 800, and 900 W/m2. The module, at 25 C and with water spray cooling applied, achieved efficiencies of 13.3%, 12.2%, and 11.4%. However, when the technique was not used, its efficiency fell by 39.7%, 41.4%, and 49.8%.
“In accordance with 32 experiments conducted according to the experimental layout, the surface temperature was reduced by spraying and the electrical efficiency was gained between 9.4% and 11.435%,” the academics explained. “In other words, after achieving thermal balance under 900 W/m2 irradiance, the electrical efficiency is around 7.9% in the non-cooled system, whereas it raises to 10.2% with spray cooling.”
The Turkish group said that smaller droplet sizes are key to achieving a more even distribution of the water on the panel. They added that this requires more air flow.
“This means that the minimum value for the nozzle air flow needs to be avoided,” they said. “Thus, even at lower water flow rates, increased spray homogeneity will allow for more efficient cooling.”
The scientists found that the optimum values for the cooling technique are 49.8 seconds of spraying time, 0.0180 m3/h for the spray flow rate, 2 m3/h for the nozzle air flow rate, 50 cm for the nozzle-to-panel distance, and 700 W/m2 for solar irradiance.
“We found that the optimum results had a lower nozzle air flow rate, higher spray flow rate, and mean spraying time values,” they concluded.
Yesildal said that in potential commercial applications, initial cost considerations would include piping and compressors. “We did not consider this system commercially,” he added.
The research team invested €200 in the pressurized water tank, the same sum in the compressor, between €25 and €100 for different kinds of nozzles, and around €50 for the piping applied to 10 panels.

Stabilization has given way to renewed price adjustments by most module manufacturers in recent weeks. We saw price hikes in March of up to one U.S. cent per watt, more or less across the board. Compared to the foruth quarter of 2020, prices on average have risen a full $0.02 to $0.03 per watt, which corresponds to 10-15% at current levels, and cannot simply be compensated elsewhere in calculations for existing projects. It is rare for a manufacturer to agree to binding price commitments for new orders. Wholesalers and project customers can still lock in quantities, but generally can no longer receive firm prices, at least not beyond the current quarter. One reason for this is that upstream suppliers, especially for polysilicon, wafers, and solar glass, no longer want to be bound by price guarantees, preferring to trade on the basis of daily prices.
Demand continues unabated, at least in Europe, especially in the booming small-scale sector and for medium-sized installations. Restrictions in Germany’s EEG have not led to a decline in demand – at least from the point of view of wholesalers – and it far outstrips the current supply of modules. For inverters and battery systems, the situation is a bit better. However, sought-after module types are sold out months in advance, and in some cases fresh supplies have not even been announced, even in the case of new module formats. When manufacturers are asked about the reason for this shortfall, they sometimes reply that they have had to cut production due to the difficult supply situation and high raw materials prices – is that even possible?
Analyst armada
An armada of analysts regularly predicts global trends in PV demand with great accuracy. Every quarter, forecasts are published with installation figures that point only in one direction – up. In addition, climate experts and activists also regularly note that the figures predicted or set by politicians are still far too low to achieve the CO2 reduction targets mentioned in the same breath. Why, then, is the industry unable to keep capacity planning in step with the rate of development? It cannot be due to investor money, of which there should be enough by now that could be channeled towards rebuilding a European solar industry with all stages of value creation, instead of being parked in cryptocurrency for lack of other stable and lucrative forms of investment.
Instead, we are still at the mercy of Asian manufacturers, who have massively expanded cell and module capacities in recent years, but at the same time have apparently missed the boat on successfully expanding polysilicon production. Of course, investment sums on a completely different order are required here. Asian manufacturers can usually rely on the generous support of their central governments. Apparently, they are still afraid of overproduction and a resulting drop in prices, and therefore often lag behind the market. Yet politicians and producers should be wary of overly pessimistic forecasts and trust in rapid demand growth, especially if prices are right. Unfortunately, we cannot necessarily rely on former industry leader, Germany’s Wacker Chemie AG. Its U.S. factory, which opened in 2016, has been a constant source of problems, with the result that the planned output, at least for solar silicon, has not been achieved to date.
Steadily rising prices have brought a different aspect of the global solar expansion into focus: the quality of solar installations. Low electricity prices make headlines and are celebrated by solar and climate activists, but they do not necessarily have anything to do with the genuinely achievable value. Given the current state of the technology, a multi-MW PV plant cannot produce electricity for $0.01/kWh on a sustained basis, regardless of where it is built. Either massive savings must be made in the quality of products used, or it is a risky bet on future electricity prices. Outside of Europe, participation in auctions is often solely about rapid grid access – even bids of €0/kWh are not uncommon. After the fixed price period has expired, however, revenue must be at least $0.02 to $0.03 or more for the project to pay for itself in the long term.
The second option – that only the cheapest components are used and savings are achieved in the cost of calculation, planning and subsequent operating costs – is rather rare, according to an industry expert, because clients are usually experienced energy conglomerates or international investor groups. Such an approach would be negligent and should be a thing of the past. As the saying goes: buy cheap, buy twice. But in the field of large-scale projects, this means that the initial operator will not experience the second time.
I can only urge that project prices be planned realistically, that only serious bids be submitted at auctions for grid access and subsidy volumes, and that the solar industry itself finally try to adapt to the generally known, always positive market development and formulate offers that fit the respective demand.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/13/china-reaches-a-tipping-point-in-2021/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA",,"MAY 13, 2021",China reaches a tipping point in 2021,"From pv magazine 05/2021
The strong outlook for solar PV installations in China is a reflection of the development of the industry over the last decade, and it’s forecast to continue after the publication of the new carbon target.
China dominated global solar PV installations in the period between 2011 and 2020. With 48.2 GW of additional solar capacity added in 2020, the country’s National Energy Administration (NEA) announced 253 GW of cumulative solar connections during the period, with roughly 70% of those connections deriving from utility-scale projects, driven by feed-in-tariffs.
Demand grew significantly during the 13th five-year plan period (2016-20), with 210 GW (AC) of solar connections – a five-time increase from the 12th five-year plan period (2011-15). Over the next five years, IHS Markit expects mainland China to continue to be the largest solar market globally in installation terms.
Fueled by FITs
Policy support has played a significant role in the industry’s size, business model, time frame, speed of installations, and supply chain movements of solar PV in China. Chinese solar policy schemes followed a few key stages. First, at the beginning of the 12th five-year plan, the key national solar policy was the “Gold Sun Program 2009-13” and “Building-integrated PV (BIPV) projects 2009-13,” which provided a solar system subsidy (CNY/W).
Secondly, a feed-in tariff scheme was put into place. After July 2013, the State Council of China released “The notice to promote the healthy development of the solar industry,” which provided guidelines on the solar power generation subsidy (CNY/kWh), a feed-in tariff for solar power generation.
However, with financial incentives and technology advancements in the solar industry successfully lowering the cost of solar, the policy scheme shifted to unsubsidized projects by the end of the 13th five-year plan. Since 2019, NEA and the National Development and Reform Commission have already released two rounds of unsubsidized project tenders.
Installations in 2021
IHS Markit expects 2021 to be another record-breaking year, with 61 GW of solar additions, equating to an annual installation growth rate of 26% year on year. The main demand drivers are (i) the unsubsidized program, (ii) the residential segment, (iii) special pilot projects in high-voltage transmission and distribution lines, (iv) renewable parks in some provinces and (V), some additional policy schemes like the special transmission and distribution pilot projects. Former policy drivers like the PV poverty alleviation program and the Top Runner program have now been phased out.
There is a strong pipeline of projects from the unsubsidized PV program announced in 2019-20 and a further 8 GW of subsidized projects that are being transferred into the pool of unsubsidized projects. Yet, IHS Markit remains cautious that additional policy developments in China, or additional supply chain price increases could put our installation forecast at risk, especially since it is strongly skewed to the second half of the year.
Climate commitment
Chinese President Xi Jinping first announced the 2030 carbon targets at the Climate Ambition Summit in September 2020. By the end of 2020, Xi updated the 2030 carbon targets at the Climate Ambition Summit, representing a part of China’s new Intended Nationally Determined Commitment (NDC).
Energy-related goals included in the 14th five-year plan strengthen both the updated 2030 NDCs and the carbon emissions peaking target. The development of low-carbon-emissions energies, such as renewables and nuclear, will accelerate, while coal consumption growth will be under tight control. The main points include plans to do the following:
As part of this announcement, the Chinese government for the first time stated specific renewable installed capacity targets as part of the new national climate goals. IHS Markit has revised upwards the five-year solar PV installation outlook in China to reflect the clear commitment to continue supporting renewables development as a pillar of the decarbonization strategy in the country, as part of its search for carbon neutrality.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/13/future-of-cadmium-telluride-pv-tech/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 13, 2021",Future of cadmium telluride PV tech,"pv magazine: Prof. Arvind, you dedicate a long chapter in “Solar Cells and Modules” to thin-film PV technologies such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells. Panels built with such cells are the only thin-film products that have been able to reach all market segments in the solar sector. Why is that?
Arvind Shah: The reasons are the following: relatively high efficiencies, low market prices, and the presence of U.S.-based manufacturer First Solar as a major provider of CdTe modules. (It) claims justifiably to be committed to sustainable PV manufacturing, responsible construction practices and minimizing the environmental impacts of its products across their life cycle, from raw material sourcing through end-of-life recycling. Indeed, end-of-life recycling is not provided for any other solar technology.
Alessandro Romeo: CdTe is a very robust material that can be successfully deposited with a large variety of deposition techniques with no issues on secondary phases. This is a unique feature in the panorama of thin-film solar cells. Also like other thin-film technologies, CdTe modules can be fabricated on pure glass with an all-in-line fabrication process at much lower temperatures than crystalline silicon.
Compared to crystalline silicon modules, cadmium telluride products can be produced at lower costs and with simpler production processes. How much room for improvement do you expect in this regard?
Shah: As far as I can personally judge, there is not much room for further improvement in the production process.
Romeo: CdTe is produced, compared to crystalline silicon, at a relatively low scale. Crystalline silicon has benefited from the large number of different companies involved in high-scale manufacturing that has strongly reduced the manufacturing cost per watt. Thin-film solar technology has not yet benefited from such a development. However, the costs are currently already very competitive with crystalline silicon. A higher scaling of the production processes with an increase of the module area and with a further reduction of process temperatures would reduce even more the final production cost.

What kind of improvements can be expected for this technology in terms of performance, efficiency and sustainability?
Shah: I would expect that the efficiency of commercial modules will be further increased and could attain 25% in the next decade.
Romeo: CdTe has been limited in performance by the relatively low open-circuit voltage due to the high compensation of the defects that reduces the carrier concentration. For this reason, one of the main research topics is CdTe doping. With a suitably controlled doping of the material, the efficiencies can be improved further, towards the Shockley-Queisser limit which is over 30%.
CdTe panels have suffered from instability in the past. Do you believe this issue has been completely overcome?
Shah: There is ample evidence that the problem of stability has been overcome.
Romeo: Stability was an issue as long as copper was not controlled in the device, as copper tends to diffuse into the material with time and degrades the solar cell. But this was definitely solved by applying a new type of contact where copper remains embedded in the zinc telluride (ZnTe) back contact. Since then, the cells have shown remarkable stability. At the moment, CdTe modules have a certified degradation of 0.2% per year.
Compared to crystalline silicon modules, CdTe panels are said to more effectively maintain efficiency at higher temperatures. Do you think this gap between the two technologies still exists?
Shah: CdTe modules have excellent high-temperature behavior, with a relative temperature coefficient of the efficiency of -0.25% to -0.32% per degree Celsius. However, the newest crystalline silicon modules such as TOPCon and heterojunction modules have similar values. On the other hand, the older types of crystalline silicon modules had relative temperature coefficients of up to -0.4 % per degree Celsius and were clearly less favorable than CdTe modules. As shown in our book, the temperature coefficient of a module can be improved, if recombination is reduced and efficiency increased. There is more room for such an improvement in CdTe modules than in crystalline silicon modules. So we can expect that in the future CdTe with much better high-temperature behavior and relative temperature coefficients of down to -0.2% per degree Celsius should become available.
Romeo: At the moment, the temperature coefficient of CdTe modules is -0.28% per degree Celsius, which is one of the best available on the market. This advantage, which is intrinsic of the CdTe physical properties, will remain.
For this kind of technology, the right choice of soda lime glass as a substrate is a decisive factor to achieve low module prices. How could this influence production costs? What are the main issues with this kind of substrate?
Shah: This is not an issue, as glass producers all over the world are currently able to produce, at a very reasonable cost, soda lime glass, at a quality which is fully suitable for CdTe modules.
Romeo: CdTe modules can be in principle deposited on any type of low-cost soda lime glass if the front layers are engineered accordingly, so this is not a real issue.
Several kinds of CdTe deposition techniques are currently being adopted. Which ones might prevail in the future?
Shah: We expect the Vapor Transport Deposition (VTD) technique, already used today by First Solar, to continue to prevail in the future.
Romeo: High-temperature processes like VTD or close space sublimation (CSS) can deliver higher efficiencies. For this reason, these technologies are the best candidates for dominating the future of CdTe module production. However, production processes with lower temperatures are interesting because of their lower energy consumption and because they have a high potential for use in flexible modules.
Cadmium is a toxic compound and has always raised concerns about the potential environmental impacts of CdTe modules. Do you think these concerns are excessive?
Shah: Cadmium itself is toxic, but when bound to telluride, it is not toxic at all. In our book, we show evidence that it is extremely unlikely, even in the case of catastrophes, like fires, floods, or other unforeseen events, that cadmium telluride modules will decompose into cadmium and tellurium.
Romeo: As explained in our book, CdTe is a non-soluble material; soluble neither in water nor in other solvents. For this reason, the probability that broken pieces of this material left in water or in the soil might release cadmium is extremely low, as proven by different scientific reports. Moreover, we have to recall that this is a thin-film technology where a large solar module with a size of 1 square meter has a cadmium content that is lower than the cadmium contained in an AAA-size Ni-Cd battery. Furthermore, the cadmium within the solar module is bound to tellurium, unlike the cadmium contained in a nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery. The cadmium within the solar module is, therefore, no threat to the environment.
Prof. Shah has previously spoken to pv magazine about the future of heterojunction PV modules and amorphous silicon solar cells. Shah and co-author Sylvère Leu wrote “Solar Cells and Modules,” which was recently published by Springer. The book includes other contributions from Christophe Ballif, Adinath Funde, Detlef Sontag, Alessandro Romeo, Alessandro Virtuani, Mauro Pravettoni, Urs Muntwyler, and Stefan Nowak.
