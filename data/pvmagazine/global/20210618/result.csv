Currently, the company has put into operation around 15 GW of wafer capacity at the facility. Another 15 GW of capacity should be operational by November. It expects to reach full capacity by the end of 2022. The manufacturer plans to produce 210 mm wafers at the factory. In March, polysilicon manufacturer Xinte Energy announced a deal to supply Gaojing with 152,400 metric tons of the solar panel material from July until the end of 2025.
Wafer producer Zhonghuan Semiconductor has released new product prices for June and all prices were slightly reduced, compared to the previous list. The wafer price was reduced by RMB 0.05 ($0.0077) per piece, which is less than RMB 0.01 per watt. Meanwhile, Longi has  maintained the prices of its wafers unchanged since May 25.
PV glass maker Flat Glass has decided to raise funds of up to RMB 4 billion ($620 million) via convertible bond issuance. The company plans to use net proceeds from the operation to support the construction of a new factory with a total annual capacity of 750,000 metric tons and to deploy 204 MW of distributed solar at its factory in Anhui, among other things.
Polysilicon maker GCL-Poly’s shareholders on Tuesday voted through the sale of 652 MW of solar project generation capacity in China to state bodies Three Gorges Asset Management, Guangdong Jinyuan New Energy and State Power Investment Corp Guizhou Jinyuan Weining Energy. The two project sales will book a profit of RMB 299 million ($46.7 million) on the investments and will generate RMB 2.05 billion ($320 million) for GCL while removing RMB 5.88 billion ($919 million) of liabilities from the company’s books. GCL said yesterday it had issued new senior notes on the Singapore exchange to replace the $500 million of investments which were not paid up in late January.
State-owned China Energy Engineering Corp on Tuesday announced it had “recently” signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Ningde-based lithium battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. Areas of cooperation will include the development and construction of energy storage facilities and the operation of “energy storage power stations.”

Prototypes of pure electric vehicles that use hydrogen as fuel by converting it into electricity in a fuel cell will be examined to see how effectively the CO2-free drive train, model-specific chassis technology and vehicle electronics systems work together under real-life conditions. The program aims to test the efficiency, safety, cost competitivenes and reliability of all components. The BMW Group wants to present “a small-series model with this sustainable drive technology, developed on the basis of the BMW X5, in late 2022.” The hydrogen tank of the vehicles can be filled within three to four minutes, according to the German group. The vehicles use fuel cells from the product development cooperation with the Toyota Motor Corporation. According to BMW, the technology could become an alternative to battery-electric drive trains, especially attractive for “customers who do not have their own access to electric charging infrastructure or who frequently drive long distances.”
The UK government is drawing up a second tender to help fund innovative ways to produce low-carbon hydrogen. Up to £60 million (€69.7 million) will be made available to fund feasibility studies and demonstration projects, according to a document published on the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) website. No timetable was given for publication of the invitation to tender document, with BEIS stating only: “This competition will open shortly for applications.” A previous £33 million contest awarded funding for two projects featuring carbon capture and storage technology, two linked to offshore wind-powered production and a fifth project based on technology developed by the Gas Technology Institute, a US-based, natural gas-focused non-profit.
The India H2 Alliance is expanding with the aim of building consensus for a common path towards hydrogen commercialization in India’s steel and cement sectors. Indian company JSW Steel has joined the IH2A energy transition coalition as the Steel and Cement Work Group lead, along with two government agencies — CSIR-National Chemicals Laboratory and Scottish Development International (SDI), the international arm of the Scottish government. “Green steel as hydrogen product exports can be a national strategy for taking leadership in the global hydrogen value chain by embedding hydrogen in the industrial supply chain. This is a leadership opportunity,” commented Prabodha Acharya, JSW Steel's chief sustainability officer.
The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU), a public-private partnership which collaborates with European cities and regions to set up locally integrated hydrogen ecosystems, reported that 32 Hydrogen Valleys are currently operating globally with a cumulative investment volume of more than €30 billion. Hydrogen Valleys are geographical areas – cities, regions, islands or industrial clusters — where several hydrogen applications are combined together into an integrated hydrogen ecosystem that consumes a significant amount of hydrogen. “Hydrogen Valleys will significantly mature over the 2020s, due to an increasing number of projects overall and because announced projects themselves grow in size and complexity,” the organization said in a 60-page study released this week. “While in the earlier phases of hydrogen deployment, projects were mostly driven by public authorities or public-private initiatives, today more than 50% of projects are led by the private sector.” The analysis, commissioned by the European Union, reported five Hydrogen Valleys in Germany, four in the Netherlands and France, two in Spain and in the UK, and one in Austria, Denmark, and Italy. Of the 32 Hydrogen Valleys surveyed in the report, 65% are European, 13% are in the Americas and 22% are in the Asia-Pacific region. Internationally, excluding the EU, China leads with three projects, followed by Australia and the US with two each.
Germany-based large-bore diesel engines and turbomachinery company MAN Energy Solutions is acquiring the majority of shares in the Augsburg-based electrolyzer manufacturer H-TEC Systems to complete its range across the hydrogen value chain. MAN Energy Solutions had already purchased a 40% stake in the company in 2019 and agreed last year to take over the remaining shares from former majority share holder GP Joule. The parties declined to provide financial details of the deal. The now completed transaction had until now been subject to approval by the competition authorities. “Today, H-TEC Systems offers electrolyzers in the megawatt range,” said MAN Energy Solutions CEO Uwe Lauber. “The objective now is to prepare the company for serial production because green hydrogen is going to become a mass market.”
The Central German Metropolitan Region action platform Metropolregion Mitteldeutschland Management, the Hypos hydrogen network and more than a dozen regional partners have commissioned a concept for a comprehensive hydrogen network in the area extending over parts of the states of Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Saxony. “Currently, there is a lot of discussion nationwide about potential hydrogen model regions,” Jörn-Heinrich Tobaben, managing director of Metropolregion Mitteldeutschland Management and board member of the Hypos hydrogen network, said in a statement Friday. “In Central Germany, we have already been a functioning hydrogen region with established value chains for decades, which also has a unique selling point throughout Germany with the hydrogen pipeline in the Central German Chemical Triangle.” As part of the study to be carried out by DBI Gas- und Umwelttechnik and Infracon, potential users of green hydrogen will be identified in the Leipzig-Halle region, in the vicinity of the Leuna, Schkopau and Bitterfeld-Wolfen chemical parks, at the Zeitz site, in the Profen open-cast mining region, in Grimma and Chemnitz. In addition, the study will draw up a concept for a hydrogen network between the sites and the future hydrogen storage facility in the Bad Lauchstädt salt cavern.
Ireland-based energy company EI-H2 has appointed EPC services company Worley to develop the concept design “for what will be Ireland’s first green hydrogen production facility.” The project is set to be completed before the end of 2023. Based in Aghada, County Cork, the 50 MW facility would supply over 20 tonnes of green hydrogen per day to a diverse commercial market. “We firmly believe that Ireland is incredibly well positioned to become a global leader in green energy,” Tom Lynch, CEO of EI-H2, said in a note released on Thursday.
Calvera, Spain’s only manufacturer of hydrogen refueling stations, is now supplying the forklift sector, saying it is the one with the highest supply capacity in the market. The company is in charge of every stage of the process, from engineering to full development. “The characteristics of this equipment make it suitable to adapt to both current customer needs and those that may arise from a predictable increase in demand due to its flexibility and its dispensing speed that can reach the supply of 120 forklifts every 24 hours,” the company said Thursday. “The forklift industry has been one of the first sectors to demonstrate the viability and profitability of hydrogen and fuel cell technology for mobility, without grant support.”

Indian energy company Tata Power today announced the commissioning of India’s largest grid-synchronized, behind-the-meter solar carport at the Tata Motors plant in Chikhali, Pune, in the Indian state of Maharashtra.
The 6.2 MWp solar carport is estimated to reduce 7,000 tons of carbon emissions annually and 160,000 tons over its lifecycle. Spanning over 30,000 square meters, the carport will generate green power and provide covered parking for finished cars in the plant.
Tata Motors envisioned the plant as part of its net-zero carbon goal for 2039. It entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Tata Power in August last year. Despite the challenges brought by Covid-19, both companies successfully managed to develop this massive carport infrastructure in a record time of nine and a half months. 
“We have always been conscious of the need to conserve energy and are committed to achieving 100% renewable energy source for all our operations,” said Shailesh Chandra, president of Tata Motors' passenger vehicle business unit. “Our partnership with Tata Power to deploy India’s largest solar carport at our car plant in Pune is a step in that direction.”
Tata Power CEO Praveer Sinha added, “As One Tata initiative, we are proud to partner with Tata Motors and inaugurate India’s largest solar carport. Our partnership is a testament to our collective efforts to lower the carbon footprint and provide innovative and future-focused green energy solutions. We will continue to explore new ways to harness clean resources and offer them to our partners and customers.”
Being a signatory of the RE100, Tata Motors is committed to using 100% renewable power and has taken several strides towards achieving this goal by progressively increasing the proportion of renewable energy used in its operations. In FY 2020, the company generated 88.71 million kWh of renewable electricity, which is over 21% of its total power consumption (up from 16% in FY 2019). This helped prevent the equivalent of 72,739 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The company further intends to source renewable energy more rigorously to meet its aspiration of sourcing 100% renewable energy by 2030. 
Tata Power has executed multiple large solar solutions, including the world’s largest rooftop solar plant (16 MW) at a single location at Radhasoami Satsang Beas in Amritsar; 2.67 MW at Cochin International Airport; the world’s largest solar-powered cricket stadium for the Cricket Club of India (CCI), with 820.8 kWp capacity; a unique vertical solar farm (120 kW) for Dell Technologies in Bangalore; and a 1.4 MW floating solar project at Tata Chemicals in Nellore.

The Berlin House of Representatives passed the Berlin Solar Act on Thursday requiring the installation of photovoltaic systems on all new buildings in the German capital from 2023.
The law's new provisions apply to all new buildings as well as to major renovations of roofs in existing buildings with usable areas of more than 50 square meters.
The photovoltaic systems must cover at least 30% of the roof area. Alternatively, various minimum requirements have been defined for residential buildings: Photovoltaic systems with a capacity of 2 kW must be installed for a maximum of two apartments, 3 kW systems for residential buildings with three to five apartments, and 6 kW systems for six to 10 apartments.
The implementation of these new rules will be supported by a funding program for PV deployment run by the Investitionsbank Berlin in the form of investment grants and loans. 
Anyone who violates the PV requirements will have to pay a fine of up to €5,000 if it's a one or two-family house. For multi-family homes, the fine may reach a maximum of €25,000 and for non-residential buildings up to €50,000.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/18/flexible-perovskite-solar-module-with-10-5-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 18, 2021",Flexible perovskite solar module with 10.5% efficiency,"Researchers at the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Italy have unveiled a flexible solar module based on perovskite with an active area of 15.7 cm2.
“It is the first flexible perovskite module that shows stability under light exposure,” Luigi Angelo Castriotta, a researcher at the university's Centre for Hybrid and Organic Solar Energy (CHOSE), told pv magazine. “It can be used for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), Internet-of-Things (IoT), and e-mobility.”
The methylammonium-free inverted solar module was built on a flexible substrate made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). A hole transporting material made of poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and a double-cation cesium formamidinium (CsFA) perovskite layer were deposited through blade-coating and nitrogen-assisted blade-coating. A two-minute oxygen plasma treatment was performed on the PET substrate prior to layer processing.
“PTAA and perovskite deposition by blade-coating are proposed as the main ways to boost the light stability by limiting the charge losses occurring at the PTAA/perovskite layer,” the Italian group explained, noting that the PTAA layer was optimized using anisole instead of toluene as a solvent in air and clean-room environment.
The solar module showed a power conversion efficiency of 10.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 8.26 V, a short-circuit current of 18.48 A and a fill factor of 55.03%. The panel is described as the most stable large-area perovskite module reported to date. “The use of scaling-up techniques, such as a blade-coating process, in the field of perovskite opens a feasible path to further increase the stability of flexible modules while keeping this technology repeatable, cheaper, and suitable for flexible solar panel technology,” the academics affirmed.
Looking forward, the research team is planning to investigate the recovery process of the devices under dark conditions through light/dark cycle tests. The panel is described in the study “Light-Stable Methylammonium-Free Inverted Flexible Perovskite Solar Modules on PET Exceeding 10.5% on a 15.7 cm2 Active Area,” published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.
In March, the University of Rome Tor Vergata also presented a perovskite solar module with a total active area of 42.8 cm2 and aperture area of 50 cm2. The panel was built with 20%-efficient perovskite cells connected in 14 series and was able to retain 90% of the initial efficiency after 800 h of thermal stress at 85 degrees Celsius.
Later in June, it unveiled a perovskite solar module with cells based on triple-cation cesium methylammonium formamidinium (CsMAFA).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/18/austria-deployed-341-of-new-pv-in-2020/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRIA",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JUNE 18, 2021",Austria deployed 341 of new PV in 2020,"From pv magazine Germany
Austria saw a record increase of 341 MW in photovoltaic systems in 2020, according to new figures released by trade body Photovoltaik Austria. Compared to 2019, last year's result represented a 38% growth.
Overall, photovoltaics covered 3.6 percent of electricity demand last year. The cumulative installed photovoltaic capacity in the country rose to 2,035 MW at the end of last year.
Vera Immitzer, managing director of the federal association, sees the numbers as “first signs of a solar revolution”. However, the 341 MW are still far too low from the 2030 targets set by the Austrian government. “By 2025 at the latest, three times as many systems as we have today will have to be installed every year, and in the following years up to five times as many systems,” she further explained, adding that a reliable framework for solar subsidies in the country is urgently needed.
The planned new renewable energy law — the Erneuerbaren-Ausbau-Gesetz (EAG) — is expected to create the conditions for this strong development. Despite having long been discussed, the final passing of the law is nowhere in sight, however. Photovoltaic Austria has therefore activated a countdown on its website in order to finally get politicians to act. “Only if we have this increase every year from now on can we pat ourselves on the back in 2030 and be proud,” Immitzer stated.
The current framework conditions are seen as inadequate due to insufficient funding, the fact that other programs are expiring and the lack of incentives for further photovoltaic expansion in the federal states.
In February, Austrian energy agency OeMAG allocated 322 MW of PV capacity across 15,957 rooftop solar projects under the country's residential solar subsidy program for 2020. According to authorities, the funding pot has triggered around €332.4 million in investments.
Through its incentive schemes, Austria is supporting mainly rooftop PV. To date, only a few ground-mounted PV plants have been built in the country. The largest solar park is an 11.5 MW facility that came online in March.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/18/stand-alone-brackish-water-desalination-system-powered-by-photovoltaic-thermal-unit/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,IRAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 18, 2021",Stand-alone brackish water desalination system powered by photovoltaic-thermal unit,"A group of scientists from the Tarbiat Modares University (TMU) in Iran has fabricated a brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) desalination unit integrated with a stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system which is claimed to produce freshwater at a cost that is close to that of conventional large-scale reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants. Brackish water is water with salinity levels between seawater and freshwater and can usually be found in estuaries, where seawater and freshwater mix.
“We have fabricated a research scale setup and then evaluated it under the climate conditions of Tehran, Iran,” research co-author, Shiva Gorjian, told pv magazine. “The total cost of the current system considering the labor cost has been calculated as $779.50, but this is a research-scale set-up; for a commercial one the costs will definitely be reduced.”
The BWRO unit, which has a treated water production capacity of around 11.80 L/h, was built with a pre-filtration module, a high-pressure DC pump, an RO module, and a post-treatment module. As for the PVT system, it was sized to meet the energy requirement of a high-pressure DC pump and a diaphragm-type circulation pump utilized to circulate soft water beneath the PV module for the active cooling of the panel itself. Two DC-DC converters of 10 A and 180 W of power were used to connect the loads to a battery.

“Since the efficiency of converters is not 100%, the battery was chosen in a way to supply the required power of the loads and compensate for the converters’ power losses,” the Iranian group specified. The PV module has dimensions of 676 x 700 x 30 mm, an output of 60 W, an open-circuit voltage of 21.5 V, and a short-circuit current of 3.88 A. The battery has a size of 92.8 x 65 × 20.2 mm and a nominal system voltage of 12 V.
The PV module was hybridized with the addition of a copper plate heat exchanger (PHE) with a capacity of 23.26 kW installed on its rear side to transfer the produced heat in the panel itself to the saltwater. A temperature control unit containing and a thermostat are used to control the temperature of soft water flowing out of the PVT module.
The PVT-BRWO system was tested for eight days during October 2019. The measurements considered air temperature, total solar radiation, wind speed, boiler feed water (BFW) temperature, PV module’s surface temperature, and circulating soft water temperature. This analysis showed that weather data directly affect the operational parameters of the PVT module and, as a result, the productivity of the whole system.

The average treated water production of the system treating 5,000 parts per million (ppm) and 15,000 ppm is 41.40 and 34.80 kg per day, respectively. “The treated water production cost of the unit treating 15,000 ppm salinity feed water was 18.96% higher than the unit treating 5,000 ppm salinity for all cases,” the academics explained. “The maximum treated water production cost of the unit was about 0.013 $/L, which is closer to the price associated with conventional fossil fuel-powered RO units (0.011 US$/L) and cheaper than passive solar still (0.041 US$/L) and solar membrane distillation units (0.017 US$/L).”
The payback time for the system is estimated between seven and 14 years, depending on several variables, including the price at which water is sold.
A thorough description of the system can be found in the paper “Performance evaluation and economics of a locally-made stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic-thermal brackish water reverse osmosis unit,” published in Cleaner Engineering and Technology.

Onslow in Western Australia’s Pilbara region has become the largest town in Australia to be powered by 100% renewable energy, achieving the landmark moment during a successful demonstration of the Onslow Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Project.
State-owned regional utility Horizon Power successfully powered the community, home to more than 800 people, for a total of 80 minutes with renewable energy during a trial of the microgrid late last month. The system consists of a 600 kW ground-mounted solar plant, a 700 kW rooftop array, and a battery system.
Western Australia Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the successful trial was a landmark moment in the state’s energy transition.
“The operation of the Onslow microgrid powered by 100% renewables signifies a landmark step towards building a cleaner, brighter, renewable energy future for our state,” he said.
“This innovative project demonstrates how distributed energy resources can be safely integrated at the grid level, unlocking further benefits from Western Australia’s world-leading rooftop solar uptake.”
The Onslow project, which replaced diesel- and gas-fired generators, was initiated in 2016.  Stage 1 delivered a modular gas power station with 8 MW of installed capacity and associated infrastructure. Stage 2 saw the completion of a centralized 1 MW centralized solar PV farm and a 1 MWh battery storage system.
The microgrid also incorporates rooftop solar and residential batteries with the residents of the town having been incentivized to install solar and battery technology in their homes as part of the project.
The high uptake of renewables by the Onslow community enabled Horizon Power to effectively pilot the DERMS which manages the assets connected to its networks in a coordinated way.
The software solution, provided by PXiSE Energy Solutions, uses predictive analytics to maximize the amount of renewable energy in the microgrid while maintaining network stability for all customers.
The technology allowed Horizon to turn the gas generators at the power station off during the trial and power the Onslow community by coordinating the rooftop solar with the solar farm and large-scale batteries.
It is the first time a Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) has been deployed in a remote microgrid in Australia. Further testing of the system is set to continue ahead of commissioning the project later this year.
Horizon has previously said the Onslow DER Project has brought forward a future where customers are recognized as being key to a greener energy future by helping inform the infrastructure and intelligent system controls which enable them to take a central role.
Horizon also believes the project is an ideal environment to integrate and test other energy technologies like electric vehicles and customer products and services.

Astronauts Shane Kimbrough of NASA and Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency (ESA) have completed their spacewalk upgrade of the international space station, installing the new iROSA roll-out solar arrays.  
The duration of the spacewalk was scheduled to last six and a half hours, and ended up totaling seven hours fifteen minutes, with the astronauts utilizing their battery-powered suits to traverse the exterior of the station. 
It cost about $100 million to install the six arrays, which were produced by US manufacturer and space infrastructure technology company Redwire Space, Inc. The arrays have a capacity of 120 kW and will increase the station’s power generation by 20-30%.  
The previous arrays had been designed for a 15-year service life, but had been continually operating since December 2000. Although they were functioning well, the older arrays were showing signs of degradation.
Before the new array can begin supplying power, the spacewalkers will need to install electrical cables and drive the final two bolts, thus allowing the panels to unfurl into the deployed position. This will take place on June 20th, and can be viewed live on NASA’s website. 
This is the third spacewalk Kimbrough and Pesquet have conducted in tandem, following two 2017 expeditions in which the astronauts replaced the orbiting laboratory’s nickel-hydrogen batteries with new lithium-ion batteries.
