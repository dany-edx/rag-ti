The fuel cell systems developer designed and manufactured the 125 kW proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells in in Latham, New York. The company packed 36 fuel cells into a pair of 12-meter long shipping containers, each holding 18. “What we just witnessed was, for the data center industry, a moon landing moment. We have a generator that produces no emissions,” said Sean James, Microsoft's director of data center research. Microsoft turned to PEM fuel cells as a potential solution to the backup diesel generator challenge in 2018 because PEM fuel cells are quick to turn on and off. Plug Power explained to pv magazine that the 36 fuel cells are the largest Plug has ever made, and the 3 MW fuel cell system is Plug's biggest application. Microsoft wants to eliminate diesel from its operations by 2030 and, given recent cost reductions in fuel cell technology, hydrogen offers an increasingly viable route.
Spain's Cepsa and India's Ohmium have announced an agreement to develop “highly efficient” green hydrogen projects in the Iberian Peninsula. “The companies will collaborate to develop and build initially small-scale projects aiming to develop a green hydrogen platform using Ohmium's advanced modular PEM electrolyzers, with the possibility of providing Cepsa up to 300 MW of installed hydrogen production capacity,” wrote the Spanish mobility and energy company, announcing its first renewable hydrogen project. In its Positive Motion plan, Cepsa plans to develop 2 GW of green hydrogen production in Spain and Portugal by 2030.
The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and Southwest Research Institute said they are working on creating high surface area carbon (HiSAC) microstructure particles that can physically and chemically absorb hydrogen. The researchers argue that HiSAC would allow safe transportation, cheaper than existing options. Previous research has demonstrated HSAC microstructures at high temperatures and low pressures, but the team will work on forming these materials at room temperature in a scalable manner. “This process uses less energy than it takes to power an incandescent light bulb,” UTSA professor Josh Mangum commented. UTSA will perform the analytical characterization of the microparticle structures. Mayer's research team will perform a detailed structural characterization of the materials.
Norway's Teco2030 and Germany's AVL List have signed a collaboration agreement that will see Teco2030's fuel cell stacks deployed on AVL's DemoTruck, powered by the HyTruck Fuel Cell System. “The DemoTruck project is currently constructing a prototype class 8/40-ton truck with outstanding power density capabilities, which provides a perfect form factor to enable integration of over 300 kW net fuel cell systems into standard truck chassis. The DemoTruck prototype will be on the road in mid-2023,” wrote the Norwegian company. 
West Australian company Hybrid Systems Australia has signed an agreement with Charles Darwin University to deliver a 5 kW fuel cell with an 8 kWh hydrogen storage system as part of a pilot project. The system will be housed at the Renewable Energy Grid Testing Facility in East Arm Wharf. “The Hydrogen Energy Storage System (HESS) is a first for the Northern Territory,” wrote Charles Darwin University, which will operate the system. 
Kenyan electricity generating company Kenya Power published a request for proposals for consultancy services to undertake a feasibility study for green hydrogen, ammonia and fertilizer production and its pilot plant at Olkaria, Kenya.

Among the less explored approaches here is single-device integrated solar generation and energy storage, or solar-powered redox batteries (SPRBs). These promise to eliminate much of the additional power electronics and other equipment needed to shuttle energy from a PV system to a battery, meaning both cheaper and more efficient energy storage. So far, a few different approaches to fabricating such a device have emerged, and while progress has been made, none has yet achieved the type of performance that would bring interest from commercial developers.
Scientists led by China’s Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology conducted an extensive review of recent progress with SPRBs, focusing on the development of high-performance dye sensitizer materials, the photoelectrochemical performance of different electrode materials, and the mechanism and structure of such devices. Their review and recommendations can be found in the paper Integrated Photovoltaic Charging and Energy Storage Systems: Mechanism, Optimization, and Future, published in Small.
The paper notes that dye sensitizer materials and semiconductor photocatalysts have shown the most promising results so far, and recommend a range of strategies focused on enhanced light absorption, charge separation, energy matching and overall device optimization. It also states that working with materials that exhibit a high specific capacity for energy storage will be key in developing commercially relevant types. If this potential can be realized, the review finds multiple applications including capacitors, solid-state batteries, microdevices, and smart wearables that could all benefit from such integrated technology.

German PV panel manufacturer Aleo Solar has launched a new solar module series for rooftop applications.
The LEO Sol modules will also be available as solar roof tiles that can be integrated into roof surfaces using Ernst Schweizer‘s Solrif in-roof photovoltaic mounting system.
The 345 W product is based on 96 monocrystalline half-cells and has a size of 1,169 mm x 1,607 mm x 17 mm. It also features 10 busbars and a black backsheet. Aleo Solar also uses thin round wires instead of flat wires, which allow more light to hit the cells.
The module is tested and certified for fire protection as hard roofing, is free of snail tracks and can withstand hailstones of up to 40 millimeters. The product and performance are guaranteed for 25 years.
The Solrif photovoltaic in-roof system allows the new module to be laid overlapping and tension-free on the pitched roof instead of being clamped. Just like clay roof tiles, the solar roof tile is laid directly on the battens.
The system also enables the full covering of roofs using Solrif dummy modules. This offers design options for homogeneously integrating corners and edges around chimneys and skylights. According to the manufacturer, the Solrif system is self-cleaning and low-maintenance due to the free lower edge of the modules.
The homogeneous appearance of the solar tiles also makes them suitable for photovoltaic use in historical buildings and aesthetically demanding new construction and renovation projects, the company added.

In fact, we are only working with Tier 1 suppliers for panels, inverters, trackers, and transformers. We believe that the quality, efficiency, and durability of our installation are directly related to the quality, durability, and innovation capacity of our suppliers. Additionally, the price of the equipment is important once all the above is guaranteed.
We started our relationship two years ago when we introduced the string inverters in our 50MW Project in Huelva. This was a new experience that aimed at verifying if this type of equipment offered greater security in the event of problems and if it contributed to a greater plant efficiency (LCOE reduction).  The experience has been positive. The existence of a small equipment stock allows the plants not to stop when there is a failure, and the start-up has been very simple. Today Huawei is one of the most important and committed partners that Alter Enersun has.
This year, Huawei's special edition looks at technical challenges to a power system mostly run by inverter-interfaced power sources. The leading topic: Smart PV and Storage – Anytime for Anyone, is achieved by a high degree of digitization, a new business division within the Huawei corporation and strong network of partners.

We are verifying that the string inverters are functioning properly, in fact, we have been using Huawei in the last six installations which we have put into operation. Honestly speaking, the fact that string inverters are efficient, safe, and competitive.
The existing problem in the global supply chain has had an impact, first in delays in work execution and then in the huge freight increase, especially all those originating from China. To finish completing this difficult scenario, we have seen how the cost of practically all equipment and supplies that make up the photovoltaic installations increased. The result has been a delay in projects and a substantial cost increase.
To complete the energy transition and leave fossil fuels behind we need to guarantee the manageability of renewable energy. In our opinion, we will achieve this with storage of all kinds: reversible jumps, batteries, and the development of hydrogen as fuel and storage. Alter Enersun is probably building one of the largest storage projects in Spain. Specifically, 62 MWh in the Extremadura projects that should be in operation in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023, is the best proof of our confidence in battery storage.
We must develop efficient installations that minimize the use of land and water per Megawatt, that coexist with livestock, agriculture, and above all, we must be a “good neighbor”, respecting and creating value on a local level. The inverter, together with panels, trackers, and transformers are the critical equipment of the plant. Choosing the inverter well results in reliability, improved production, and an easy start-up.
We are building 4 projects in Extremadura totaling 120MW and the first part of the storage Project with 9MWh batteries (62MWh in total). Before the end of the year, we will start 5 additional projects in Andalusia that will total 250MW, in addition to building 40MW of self-consumption for large industries.
We expect an improvement in storage costs in the coming years due to increased production in Europe and increased competition. To the extent that storage costs are reduced, its use will be extended, not necessarily related to large projects.
Alter Enersun is a group made up of a group of companies capable of developing, investing, building, and operating photovoltaic installations of all sizes. Our intention is to continue with the organized growth and to deep in our relationship with our partner BRUC Energy.

India-based Visaka Industries Limited, a sustainable construction materials developer, has announced its integrated solar roof will power the Climate Lab at Anant University’s Ahmedabad campus in Gujarat. Visaka will also supply its Vnext fiber cement boards, an eco-friendly alternative to climate-damaging plywood and gypsum.
Visaka’s Atum solar roof will cover the 390-square-meter area of the lab and produce 70 kW of solar power to run the facility.
The manufacturer said its Atum solar roof is a great alternative to metal sheets, reinforced concrete sloped roofs, or clay tiles for industrial, commercial, and residential buildings. The roof is reportedly able to resist fire damage for over 2.5 hours and withstand wind speeds of 255 kilometers per hour.
According to the manufacturer, the solar roof also has a thermal conductivity of 0.072 W/mtK and thermal insulation that reportedly reduces building temperatures by up to 40%.
“The installation requires a steel structural grid for mounting the Atum solar roof modules, accessories to anchor the Atum modules straight on the steel structure, and BOS and inverters to commission the plant based on whether it’s an on-grid or off-grid system,” stated a Visaka spokesperson.
Atum has been successfully installed across many locations in India, including Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai (Maharashtra), and Hyderabad (Telangana), as well as in Sharjah, in the UAE.

Based in Illawarra on Australia's New South Wales south coast, hydrogen technology company Hysata has closed its Series A funding round oversubscribed at AUD 42.5 million ($29.4 million).
The company launched in 2021 claiming its capillary-fed electrolysis technology will deliver a “giant leap” in performance and cost compared to incumbent technologies, promising to deliver hydrogen for less than $2 per kilogram by the “mid 2020s.”
This promise is based on the efficiency of its system, which Hysata says operates at 95%, a massive step up from the current hydrogen electrolyser efficiencies which generally sit at 75% or less.
Alongside its capillary-fed electrolysis, Hysata is also promising easy equipment production, telling pv magazine Australia previously that it believes it can reach gigawatt-scale hydrogen production by the middle of the decade thanks to its simple and mass manufacturable design.
The successful funding round, the company said, will help it grow its Illawarra-based team and set it on its path to gigawatt-scale manufacturing.
Kiko Ventures’ founding partner, Robert Trezona, described Hysata’s technology as “game changing.”
“Having assessed scores of electrolyser technologies in my 20 years in cleantech, Hysata’s technology stands out as a true breakthrough. The company has redefined the core cell architecture for alkaline electrolysis, producing a practical and scalable solution with game-changing efficiency. Hysata has the potential to be a globally significant company in the hydrogen economy and we look forward to supporting its growth, especially here in Europe,” Trezona said.
“Over the last 12-18 months, Hysata has been interacting with dozens of major customers globally,” Hysata CEO Paul Barrett added. “The impact our efficiency and system simplicity delivers to customers’ project economics truly moves the needle. We look forward to continuing to work with our shareholders and customers to bring this much needed technology to market as soon as possible.”

In the study “Silicon heterojunction solar cells and p-type crystalline silicon wafers: A historical perspective,” published in RRL Solar, the scientists put the early stages of the p-type technology in a historical perspective going  back to the 1970s. “Due to the susceptibility of p-type Czochralski-grown silicon to boron-oxygen related light induced degradation (BO–LID), such wafers were deemed unsuitable for silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells,” they explained. “In addition to stability issues, lower charge carrier lifetimes due to contamination and challenges with surface passivation posed barriers to the adoption of p-type wafers in SHJ applications.”
The paper points out that the BO-LID issue was identified as a serious challenge for p-type wafers in the late 1990s. “In 1999, Glunz et al. reported conversion efficiency losses of up to 1.7% on p-type Cz-Si homojunction solar cells with a starting conversion efficiency of 21.0%,” the researchers stated.
Before selling its PV business to Panasonic, Japanese manufacturer Sanyo was the first to develop commercial heterojunction solar cells and it immediately chose to use n-type wafers, with the researchers being unable to track down any intent of using p-type wafer for SHJ applications dating back to 1990 -2000. “Either other wafer types were not considered and tested, or the results from such attempts were judged not relevant to be reported,” they further explained.
The first stabilization of BO-LID defects in p-type devices dates back to 2006 but the first manufacturing processes based on carrier generation via high-intensity illumination at elevated temperatures has only become available for commercial cell production in the past decade.
“The lack of understanding about BO defect stabilization during the development of SHJ technology may be the main reason why the development process was restricted to n-type c-Si wafers, and if BO defect stabilization processes were readily available at the time, the technology could have been developed based on p-type c-Si wafers,” the scientists emphasized. “Fortunately, the continuous efforts in solving BO defects in PERC solar cells over the past two decades provide us the knowledge required to defect engineer p-type SHJ solar cells and fabricate devices with high and stable open-circuit voltage.”
The research group comprised academics from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, Australian startup Sundrive Solar Pty Ltd, and Russian heterojunction solar module maker Hevel Solar. “Our recent research suggests we might be able to rethink the type of silicon needed to make these high-efficiency solar cells,” they concluded. “Further work is required to evaluate the impact of variations in wafer quality across different p-type Cz-Si ingots (and ingot positions) on the performance of p-type SHJ solar cells.”
The same research group unveiled in July 2021 a novel hydrogenation process that is claimed to have the potential to improve the stabilized efficiency of p-type heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell based on gallium-doped silicon wafers. Two solar cells were developed with a new advanced hydrogenation process (AHP) at an existing SHJ line operated by Hevel using 156.75 x 156.75 mm p-type wafers doped with boron (B) and gallium (Ga), respectively. The first products were provided by Chinese manufacturer Longi and the second by Taiwanese wafer maker Sino-American Silicon (SAS). The scientists also built a standard n-type SHJ device as a reference.
Chinese manufacturer Longi achieved 25.47% efficiency for gallium-doped p-type heterojunction solar cell in March. In the same month, researchers at France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – an arm of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – and Italian renewable energy company and heterojunction solar module manufacturer Enel Green Power achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.47% for a gallium-doped p-type heterojunction silicon solar cell.

According to its designers, the device has a power density of 1.1 kW/L and an efficiency of 97%.
The micro-inverter utilizes GaN 600V diodes and power transistors developed by CEA's electronic branch CEA-Leti. “With this coplanar technology, it would be possible to make the power component ‘smarter' with protection (temperature, voltage, current, etc.) and control (driver) functions. It is also possible to design bidirectional voltage interrupters which do not exist at present,” the French scientists said in a statement.
They added the microinverter technology consists of two conversion stages — a DC/DC stage comprising 5 GaN 100V transistors and DC/AC stage comprising 4 GaN 650V transistors — without providing further technical details. “This technology is expected to reach the market by 2025-2027,” they specified, noting that a second prototype should be developed this year. “In the meantime, researchers at CEA-Leti and CEA-Liten at INES will improve the technology and develop an integrated digital control system. The team will unveil new prototypes in the coming years.”
String inverters based on gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors could represent a valid alternative to devices based on silicon (Si) or silicon carbide (SiC) in the future if the industry manages to reduce their size. A consortium led by Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology IEE is currently coordinating a research project to assess how components of GaN inverters can be further miniaturized, in order to achieve lower production costs.
The primary goal when using GaN in power electronics is usually the optimization and miniaturization of the entire inverter device, including passive components such as cooling systems, casings, and mounting structures.

Most building decarbonization models do not account for seasonal fluctuations in energy demand for heating or cooling, which makes it difficult to predict what switching to all-electric heating could mean for the electrical grid, especially during peaks in energy use.
A new study by researchers at Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH), Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Oregon State University, and the nonprofit Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET) examined these seasonal changes in energy demand, and found that monthly energy consumption varies substantially and is highest in the winter months.
The study “Inefficient Building Electrification Will Require Massive Buildout of Renewable Energy and Seasonal Energy Storage,” published in Scientific Reports, presented novel modeling of multiple building electrification scenarios and found that the surge in winter energy demand will be difficult to satisfy through current renewable sources, if buildings switch to low-efficiency electrified heating. The findings emphasize the need for buildings to install more efficient home-heating technologies, such as ground source heat pumps.
“Our research reveals the degree of fluctuation in building energy demand and the benefits of using extremely efficient heating technologies when electrifying buildings,” says Jonathan Buonocore, assistant professor of environmental health at BUSPH  and study lead and corresponding author.
“Historically, this fluctuation in building energy demand has been managed largely by gas, oil, and wood, all of which can be stored throughout the year and used during the winter. Electrified buildings, and the electrical system that supports them, will have to provide this same service of providing reliable heating in winter. More efficient electric heating technologies will reduce the electrical load put on the grid and improve the ability for this heating demand to be met with non-combustion renewables.”
The study analyzed building energy data from March 2010 to February 2020, and found that total monthly average for energy consumption in the United States, based on the current use of fossil fuels, as well as future use of electricity in the winter, varies by a factor of 1.6x, with the lowest demand in May, and the highest demand in January.
The researchers modeled these seasonal fluctuations in what they call the “Falcon Curve’’, a graph of the change in monthly energy consumption (which represents the shape of a falcon). The data shows that winter heating demand drives energy consumption to its highest levels in December and January, with a secondary peak in July and August due to cooling, and the lowest levels in April, May, September, and October.

The researchers then calculated the amount of additional renewables, specifically wind and solar energy, that would need to be generated to meet this increased demand in electricity. They found that to meet winter peaks, without storage, demand response, or other tactics to manage grid load, buildings would require a 28x increase in January wind generation or a 303x increase in January solar energy. Then they calculated adding more efficient renewables, such as air source heat pumps or ground source heat pumps, and found that buildings would only require 4.5x more winter wind generation, or 36x more solar energy—thus “flattening” the Falcon Curve as less new energy demand is placed on the electrical grid.
“This work really shows that technologies on both the demand and the supply side have a strong role to play in decarbonization,” says study coauthor Parichehr Salimifard, assistant professor of college of engineering at Oregon State University.
Examples of these technologies on the energy supply side are geothermal building heating and renewable energy technologies that can provide energy at all hours, she says—such as renewables coupled with long-term storage, distributed energy resources at all scales, and geothermal electricity generation where possible.
“These can be coupled with technologies on demand side—i.e., in buildings—such as passive and active building energy efficiency measures, peak-shaving, and energy storage in buildings. These building-level technologies can both reduce the overall building energy demand by reducing both baseline and maximum energy demand as well as smooth the fluctuations in building energy demand, and consequently flatten the Falcon Curve,” said Salimifard.
“The Falcon Curve draws our attention to a key relationship between the choice of building electrification technology and the impact of building electrification on our power grid,” said study coauthor Zeyneb Magavi, co-executive director of HEET, a non-profit climate solutions incubator.
Magavi cautions that this research does not yet quantify this relationship based on measured seasonal efficiency curves for specific technologies, or for more granular time scales or regions. It also does not assess the numerous strategies and technologies that can help address the challenge–all of which must be considered in decarbonization planning.
Even so, Magavi says this research indicates that, “Using a strategic combination of heat pump technologies (air-source, ground-source, and networked), as well as long-term energy storage, will help us electrify buildings more efficiently, economically, and equitably. The Falcon curve shows us a faster path to a clean, healthy energy future.”
“Our research makes clear that, when accounting for seasonal fluctuations in energy consumption apparent in the Falcon Curve, the drive to electrify our buildings must be coupled with a commitment to energy-efficient technologies to ensure building decarbonization efforts maximize climate and health benefits,” says study senior author Joseph G. Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science and director of the Healthy Buildings program at
One fundamental change is, even under high-efficiency building electrification, the US electrical grid will likely switch from peaking in summer to winter. The researchers concluded that for building electrification to represent “healthy decarbonization of building energy, the additional electricity demand needs to be met with non-combustion renewable energy, which under our most optimistic scenario will require increasing wind generation by 4.5×”.
Currently, the seasonal fluctuations are being met largely by a fossil energy system with long-term energy storage. In an all-electric scenario, long-term electricity storage may have a strong role in aiding renewable electricity in meeting the demand from newly electrified buildings.

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its 2021 module shipments report, reflecting a market of $9.8 billion for imported and exported solar panels. The figure also includes US-made solar panels that were shipped to US projects. This represents a 19.5% increase over 2020’s total.
The average cost of these shipments was $0.34/W, down from 2020’s average of $0.38/W. The cost fell despite supply chain pressures, rising shipping costs, and increased materials costs. Modules prices have fallen steadily from about $2.00 per peak Watt in 2010.
In 2021, the United States had nearly 29 million module shipments. This number was only 320,000 when EIA began reporting it in 2006, and about 3.7 million ten years prior to this report in 2011.
EIA reports that 4.2 million modules were manufactured domestically, while nearly 23 million were imported. Export shipments totaled about 1.1 million modules. About 119,000 were purchased from U.S. original equipment manufacturers.
China, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam accounted for 11.3 million modules shipped to the United States. Malaysia accounted for 3.2 million; South Korea, Thailand, and United Arab Emirates nearly 5 million; and “other” nations shipped nearly 3.5 million modules.
In terms of peak kilowatts, the top three states for module shipments were California (5.1 million peak kW), Texas (4.3 million peak kW), and Florida (1.7 million peak kW).
Notably, EIA said fewer companies now report on the module shipments “EIA-63B” form due to “company consolidation and changes to strategic planning of companies in the U.S. solar photovoltaic industry.” As a result, EIA’s 2021 report is less detailed to protect the confidentiality of company-level data. Data can no longer be published for the specific types of PV cells and modules, or by region.
