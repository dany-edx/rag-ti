The Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (Miteco) held a 520 MW renewables auction yesterday, which concluded unsubscribed.
The auction aimed to contract 140 MW of distributed solar power, for installations of less than 5 MW with at least three local partners. The remaining 380 MW were allocated to other renewable sources, 220 MW of which were reserved for solar thermoelectric, 140 MW for biomass and 20 MW for other technologies.
The results have not been very encouraging: the quota for solar thermal was not awarded due to the cut-off price set by the Ministry for Ecological Transition, €110 ($110.24)/MWh. In total, 177 MW were awarded, of which only 31 MW to solar PV, and the remaining to biomass.
The auction PV capacity as follows: Brezos de Tormanto was awarded two projects, one of 3 MW and the other of 1.5 MW, at a price of €52 and €58/MWh, respectively.
Enerland was awarded two projects, 4.2 MW and 2.9 MW, at €44.98 and €47.98/MWh, respectively. London 1908, one of its subsidiaries, was awarded another 4.9 MW project at €54.98/MWh.
Powertis, the project development division of tracker maker Soltec, was awarded a 5 MW project at €54/MWh. Erasp Spain, a subsidiary of Engie, was awarded two projects of 5 MW and 2.5 MW, at a price of €57.82 and €60.24/MWh.
Finally, Hidrodelta was awarded two projects of 1 MW each, at €57.50 and €62.50/MWh.
In the auction held in October 2021, Miteco allocated a total of 2.9 GW of PV, which did not cover the capacity offered for the first time in history.
On November 22 another auction will take place, in this case for 1,8 GW of PV capacity. In this fourth auction, the capacity may be procured for expansion and hybridization of existing installations. If any of the quotas are not filled, a transfer may take place so that installations of other technologies can be allocated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/26/finland-to-extend-net-metering-to-all-pv-systems-in-2023/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,FINLAND",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 26, 2022",Finland to extend net metering to all PV systems in 2023,"At present only a small share of Finland’s PV systems are net-metered, despite all the country’s distributors being allowed to implement net metering since early 2021. “Only a few did so – it required too expensive changes to their IT-systems,” Tapio Tuomi, managing director at Lahienergia, the Finish clean energy association, told pv magazine.
As of 2023, net metering will be extended to all PV systems. Earlier this year, in fact, Finland adopted a new centralized information exchange system for the retail electricity market, called Datahub, which replaces the IT systems of the country’s 80 distributors. The new system includes meter data management and settlement functions. “From 2023 the Datahub will offer net metering to everybody,” said Tuomi.
Currently, Finland's metering points are measured on an hourly level. Distributors make the metering data available the next day for use by the costumer and the electricity markets. As of May 2023, the measurements will be taken on a 15-minute basis instead, increasing the granularity of electricity price calculation.
Finland’s cumulative installed solar capacity reached 395 MW at the end of 2021, a record 102 MW increase from 2020, according to data from Lahienergia. The association found that the number of PV systems connected to the grid at the end of 2021 was 39,000. The systems consist almost entirely of installations smaller than 1 MW. According to data from Finland’s Energy Agency, PV plants over 1 MW currently equal only 4.6 MW.
The Finish transmission system operator Fingrid registered 27 GW worth of grid connection requests in 2022, according to Tapio. “Fingrid estimates that the power of solar power plants connected to the electricity grid will increase from the current 400 MW to approximately 12,000 MW within a decade,” he added.
As for storage, the country “has some megawatt-scale batteries used for the frequency containment market,” said Tapio. Pumped hydro may also be developed in the country, which has a few old abandoned mines suitable for deploying the technology.
Finland has two operating solar module factories, a 100 MW fully automated production line by Salo Tech and another by Valoe Oyj.
Its solar incentives include a 25% rebate for homeowners, businesses and communities that cover the costs of purchasing and installing PV systems and a 40% investment subsidy for renewable energy production for agricultural companies.

As part of their Sunalgae Life project, the team cultivates single-celled photosynthesizing algae called diatoms to extract their shells, which reportedly have unique light-manipulating properties, including blocking ultraviolet (UV) light.
The shells are then added to the encapsulant of silicon modules or to the anti-reflective coating on the glass of thin film modules, which the Swedish team claims could boost their efficiency by 4% and 36%, respectively. These enhancements were “measured in indicative flash tests performed by external institutes,” including the Chalmers University of Technology, according to the team’s website.
The algae shells should also reduce the degradation of solar panels over time caused by UV radiation. The team estimates the resulting modules would be 3.9% cheaper compared to currently commercialized panels.
The Sunalgae Life project required a €4 ($3.99) million investment, partly awarded by the European Union. One of its goals is to commercialize the algae material for use in solar panels. The team has now inaugurated a pilot facility in Sweden to mass produce the material. The new facility is expected to cultivate 500 kg per year and subsequently 1,000 kg per year. Until now, the team has cultivated 30 kg per year in a greenhouse.
“Material produced from the facility will [be] tested for repeatable efficiency enhancement in solar panels,” the project website says. The team claims the production process is circular. “The material is produced in an environmentally friendly process where water is cleaned, valuable nutrients are recycled, carbon dioxide is absorbed, and a valuable sustainable organic biomass is also produced.”

The investment will go into the construction of an additional factory building and new production lines. The Czech factory manufacturers air-to-water heat pump indoor units, a Daikin spokesperson told pv magazine.
“We have always strived to develop and manufacture our products close to the markets we are serving,” said Patrick Crombez, general manager Daikin Europe heating and renewables. “Today, our residential hydronic heat pumps sold in Europe are 100% designed and made in Europe, making us the leading manufacturer of hydronic heat pumps on the continent.”
The expansion will result in a production capacity five times higher than at present by 2025. The company did not disclose the factory’s present production capacity. The investment will also create at least 500 new jobs in the region of Brno.
Daikin also expanded its heat pump plants in Belgium and Germany earlier this year, which produce indoor and outdoor heat pump units. It will establish a new heat pump factory in Poland by 2024.

Installed capacity in the distributed generation sector has surpassed 14 GW in Brazil. According to the Brazilian Association of Distributed Generation (ABGD), the sector has more than 1.7 million consumers in the country.
By sector, 47.4% corresponds to residential consumption, 30.3% to commercial, 13.4% to rural, and 7% to industrial. Solar photovoltaic is the leader among mini and micro generation systems, with 98.3% of the total. It is followed by biomass and biogas, 1% each; hydroelectric generation, 0.5%; and wind, 0.1%.
The 14 GW of installed capacity supply electricity to about 7 million households, or 28 million people, according to the association. Distributed generation now has the same installed capacity as the Itaipu hydroelectric power plant — the largest in operation in the country — responsible for about 10% of the energy consumed in Brazil.
According to the president of ABGD, Guilherme Chrispim, “2022 is the year of energy self-generation in Brazil, as already foreseen, because we are witnessing an unprecedented acceleration in this segment. At this rate, we should reach about 16 GW in December,” he concluded.

UK-based engineering solution firm IECL has developed a project called Cassiopeia to generate solar power in space for terrestrial energy needs.
The project takes its name from a 2,000-ton satellite located 36,000 kilometers above Earth. The satellite would collect solar energy using large, lightweight mirrors, each up to 1,700 m in diameter, positioned at 45° to a helical array of up to 60,000 solar panels that produce electricity.
“Space-based solar power has two huge advantages over traditional methods: on the one hand, placing a sunlight-capturing satellite in space means we wouldn't need to cover large tracts of land with solar panels,” said Ian Cash, IECL chief engineer and author of “CASSIOPeiA – A new paradigm for space solar power,” published in the journal Acta Astronautica. “On the other, we would not be dependent on local weather conditions or whether it is day or night.”
The study concluded that it was feasible to deploy a system consisting of a Cassiopeia satellite in geostationary orbit, which would generate about 3.4 GW of electricity on the satellite. This would be converted to radio frequency microwave radiation, with an efficiency of 85%. A net power of 2.9 GW would then be transmitted to a receiving antenna located at a fixed point on the ground. The antenna would convert the electromagnetic energy into direct current electricity and then, through an inverter, supply a net power of 2 GW of alternating current to the grid.
It would cost GBP 16.3 ($18.69) billion to develop and launch the project. Considering a minimum rate of return on investment of 20% per year, the report concludes that a space-based solar power system could, over its lifetime of approximately 100 years, generate power at $48 per MWh. If the project were scaled up, it could supply more than 150% of all global electricity demand.
The project envisions a 40 MW pilot project placed in low-Earth orbit from 2027 to 2031. Between 2036 and 2039, a 2 GW production prototype would be in orbit.
In early 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) commissioned two independent cost-benefit studies of space-based solar power for terrestrial energy needs from UK and Germany-based consulting firms Frazer-Nash and Roland Berger, respectively.
The studies were completed in August 2022 and both concluded that it is possible to provide competitively priced electricity to European homes and businesses by 2040. The total costs of a pilot development, which would generate 2 GW, have been estimated at between €2.3 ($2.29) billion and €3.5 billion.

Its solution is a semi-solid flow battery in which the gooey electrodes are mixed directly into the electrolyte.
According to 24M, its SemiSolid cell manufacturing process and chemistry-agnostic platform can reduce manufacturing costs by up to 40%.
24M’s gooey electrode mix eliminates the energy-intensive process of drying and solidifying the electrodes in traditional lithium-ion production. The company says it also reduces the need for more than 80% of the inactive materials in traditional batteries, such as copper and aluminum.
The SemiSolid electrodes and unit cell construction are said to offer superb abuse tolerance, whereas their binder-free structure eliminates the need for hydro- or pyrometallurgical processes for battery recycling. According to the company’s website, 24M’s lithium-ion cells have energy density between 400-500 Wh/kg, specifically those made for the aviation industry.
In January of this year, 24M received a grant from the Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program to develop and scale a high-energy-density battery that uses a lithium metal anode and semi-solid cathode for use in electric aviation.
After being spun out of A123 Systems in 2010, 24M went on to acquire a renowned customer base, including license agreements with Volkswagen Group, Fujifilm Corporation, Kyrocera Corporation, Lucas TVS, Axxiva and FREYR. The last three companies are planning to build gigafactories based on 24M’s technology in India, China, Norway and the United States.
“The SemiSolid platform has been proven at the scale of hundreds of megawatts being produced for residential energy-storage systems. Now we want to prove it at the gigawatt scale,” says 24M CEO Naoki Ota.
More recently, 24M has entered a joint development agreement with ASX-listed graphite producer Volt Resources. The agreement will focus on coated spheronised purified graphite and also nonspherical graphite products to enhance lithium-ion battery performance.
The ongoing test work is being undertaken by Volt’s technology partner in the US, American Energy Technologies Co. (AETC), and progressing to support 24M’s commercialization activities in multiple markets, including electric vehicles, stationary storage and electric aviation.
At a later stage, the companies will be looking to enter into a binding offtake agreement that will leverage AETC’s inverted LIB anode materials flowsheet design to produce graphite products sourced from Volt’s 70% owned Zavalievsky Graphite business in Ukraine and future supply from its Bunyu Graphite Project in Tanzania.

Researchers at France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – a division of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – claim to have reduced the amount of silver deposited during the metallization of heterojunction solar cells.
The International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) report by German engineering association VDMA evaluates the amount of silver currently deposited on heterojunction cells at 165 mg for the M6 format (166 mm × 166 mm) and at 147 mg for the M2 format (156.75 mm × 156.75 mm). It also indicates an efficiency of 24.5% for these cells in 2022, which represents power capacity of 5.98 W per M2 format cell, and a ratio of the amount of silver consumed per watt of 24.58 mg of silver per W.
The CEA metallization experts said they demonstrated the possibility of reducing the width of the metallization lines by using screen printing and screens with finer openings than the standard while ensuring the transfer of the silver paste and the low line resistance. 
The built M2 format heterojunction cells with six busbars with material consumption lower than the values estimated in the ITRPV 2022 international roadmap while maintaining good power conversion efficiency levels, with a power loss of only 0.8% compared with reference cells built with the usual amount of sillver.
The ratio of silver consumed per W reached 19.2 mg of silver per W, which compares to 24.58 mg of silver per W, the value set by the ITRPV 2022 for the material consumption expected by the international community by 2026 for this technology. According to CEA-INES, however, the new achievement may only be integrated into commercial production after 2028.
The CEA also seeks to replace silver with other conductors while ensuring their compatibility with the assembly of reliable and durable photovoltaic modules.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/26/high-electricity-rates-push-us-homeowners-to-consider-solar/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 26, 2022",High electricity rates push US homeowners to consider solar,"From pv magazine USA
The cost of electricity is rising in states across the nation. That coupled with the increased frequency of long power outages is pushing more Americans to consider solar.
Homeowners are challenged to stretch their budgets now with inflation, supply chain challenges, and rising interest rates. Rocket Solar’s study asked homeowners which home essentials they are spending more on today than a year ago, 61% said electric power—second only to food (85%) and ahead of commuting (39%).

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in May of this year, the average U.S. household paid $o.1492 kWh for home electricity service, or an average increase of 5% over 2021. The increase was substantially higher in some parts of the country, such as New Hampshire, which saw rates shoot up about 50%.
While paying the electric bill is now a serious concern for many, having an unstable grid is another concern. The EIA reports that in 2020 the average U.S. electricity customer experienced just over 8 hours of power interruptions, the highest since it began keeping records in 2013. As of mid-July 2022, 44% of homeowners had already experienced at least one power outage this year, with an additional 4.9% saying they expect to have one but have not yet. Of those, 64.8% had at least two or more outages in 2021.

“Power outages impact my family greatly because we have a nine-month-old,” said one homeowner. “If the electricity goes out, I get very worried. We live where the heat index reaches 100 degrees and I can’t have my baby living in those conditions.”
Nearly three-quarters of the homeowners surveyed said they believe solar would decrease their electric bill, and nearly 30% said they would consider installing solar if their electric bills keep rising. It is becoming even more appealing to the study respondents as electric rates increase along with solar costs decreasing. An added incentive is the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act that increases the investment tax credit to 30% for the next ten years.
Aside from cost savings, just over 17% cited the environment as a reason to go solar. For about 10% of the respondents, another reason to go solar is the potential increase in their home’s value.

The survey was conducted in July, when the company surveyed 1,560 single-family homeowners. The sample was controlled and divided equally among a combined sample of Gen Z and millennials, Gen X, and baby boomers. To make sure the participants had a clear understanding of their electric bill, those who weren’t individually responsible for their electric bill or didn’t have a significant other responsible for their electric bill were excluded from the study.
Rocket Solar is part of the Rocket family, which includes Rocket Mortgage, Homes, Loans and Auto. Rocket Solar teamed up with Palmetto, which leverages proprietary platform technology and energy intelligence solutions to accelerate the sale and adoption of clean energy. Palmetto connects homeowners with local sales and installation specialists to advance the clean energy economy in communities across the United States.
