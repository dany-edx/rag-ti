Felix Krause: We launched the Vireo Electrification Fund at the end of last year and have already made two investments in energy startups. Prior to the launch of our fund, Matthias Engel, Mischa Wetzel, Thomas Labryga and I helped to establish Innogy Ventures, Innogy's former corporate venture capital fund, with a volume of €130 million ($138.9 million). Before becoming managing director of Innogy Ventures, Matthias worked at RWE in the area of mergers and acquisitions and thus accompanied the transformation of the energy industry at an early stage, Mischa helped set up the Creative Industries Fund of IBB Ventures here in Berlin, and Thomas worked as a management consultant along the entire energy value chain. Among other things, he accompanied the IPO of Innogy. Sven Heiligtag has spent the last 20 years in the energy world at McKinsey, most recently as head of the German energy division and building up the Japanese energy division. During this time, he has worked with a wide range of incumbents in Germany, Europe, the US and Japan, both in the traditional energy industry and with startups and organizations in the broader energy and startup ecosystem. I myself started my own business in the photovoltaic sector in 2009, developing PV projects in Germany and the UK. This was followed by founding Milk the Sun. In 2020, we opened a new chapter as early-stage investors and started directly to build our own investment portfolio of energy startups. Individually and as a team, we have completed well over 100 startup investments.
What kind of startups have you already invested in? Do you plan to invest in the future?
We firmly believe that the energy sector is one of the most attractive areas to invest in at present. It is large, growing rapidly, subject to radical change and therefore offers investors an above-average return on climate and investment. That is why we invest in young companies that are driving the necessary transformation of the energy world and in particular the upcoming electrification of various sectors around the fields of green energy, hydrogen, mobility and smart buildings. In doing so, we are looking for dedicated teams that we can support with our network and experience. We typically invest in startups during the so-called pre-seed or seed phase, where we can offer the greatest added value. We often accompany the companies from prototypes to market entry, the subsequent growth phase and to internationalization. We then also support them in organizing further rounds of financing. Since our first closing in November 2022, we completed two investments. Unfortunately, these are still confidential, which is why I am not yet allowed to mention any names here.
In November 2022, you have launched a fund? What is its volume, and how many startups do you plan to invest in?
Our fund will have a total volume of €60 million. We plan to use this to make investments in up to 30 European startups in the energy industry over the next four years.
Why do you place such a strong emphasis on sector coupling?
Sector coupling, – that is, the holistic view of the energy system in interaction with heating/cooling generation, mobility and other areas – enables the decarbonization of all economic sectors through renewable energy. Although this sometimes comes with higher investment costs than conventional energy, significantly lower operating costs are applicable, with almost zero marginal costs per kilowatt-hour. This, as well as the fluctuating availability of renewable energy, will enable and also require completely new business models – and this is where sector coupling comes into play. The intelligent coupling of sectors through the use of energy-efficient technologies such as heat pumps, combined heat and power plants or electric cars can lead to a significant reduction in energy consumption. The use of large and cost-effective energy storage outside the power sector creates a high degree of flexibility in the power supply. This makes it easy to compensate for fluctuations in renewable energy. Of course, this only works if all systems are smartly linked and controlled. In the past, for example, we have invested in companies that intelligently control the charging of electric cars or that manage the cooling needs of stores, among other things. We believe that we are still at the very beginning of this development and that there will be many exciting opportunities in the coming years.
Why are you primarily focusing on young companies in Europe? Wouldn't start-ups in the US also be interesting after the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act?
The Inflation Reduction Act is certainly acting as an accelerator for renewable energy and related sectors in the US. Nevertheless, we are convinced that Europe offers a fantastic environment for early-stage investments from an investor perspective. In Europe, we have excellent research facilities and a lot of know-how, especially in the renewable energy sector. We therefore assume that many of the required technologies will be developed in Europe and that these will then have the chance to scale up in the US as well. As a result, we also benefit indirectly from the IRA. But of course the EU will have to find an appropriate response with a similarly strong and long-term program. Young companies in the EU will then also benefit directly from this.
The advisory board that advises Vireo Ventures on investments was recently established. Who is represented there?
We are very happy to have gained seasoned and experienced experts for Vireo Ventures for our advisory board. Going forward, we will be supported by five top-notch personalities from the business world: Christopher Burghardt, former vice president Europe at Charge Point and vice president at First Solar, and now a member of the advisory board of various venture capital and private equity firms. Carl-Peter Forster, formerly a board member at BMW and General Motors, CEO of Tata Motors, and currently board member in various companies, as well as his own startup investments. Samuel Leupold, former CEO of Ørsted Wind Power and current chairman of Corio Generation, and on the boards of Enel and Schlumberger. Louise Hahn is a board member of European Energy A/S and formerly MD at Ørsted and GlobalConnect. Marie-Theres Thiell, former CEO of Innogy Hungary and member of the supervisory board of Westenergie and Bayernwerk, among others, is also on board.
The latest edition of pv magazine is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
What impulses do you hope and expect from these high-class experts?
With our advisory board, we cover the various European (and global) European markets geographically as well as the sectors relevant to us, in which we invest. We will benefit from the cumulative market understanding of our advisory board, and together with them we will critically scrutinize our investment theses on a regular basis and adjust if necessary. In addition, we provide our portfolio companies with first-class access to expertise, industry know-how and networks via the advisory board members.
Do you have a goal for how many investments you want to make this year?
In my time as an investor, I have never seen so many exciting start-ups and investment opportunities at once. It seems as if many have taken the current energy crisis as an opportunity to get off the ground with a startup right now. It is therefore not easy for me to give a concrete answer to the question, but I would expect six to seven investments until the end of this year.

The tool is designed to help business managers and engineers to model the impact of different heating temperatures.
“The goal is to find out in a few minutes whether heat pumps warrant a more detailed investigation for your requirements and whether you should seek out more information,” A2EP says on its website.
Users can input current electricity costs, process hours for use per year, average required heat, temperature of the heat sink, and water temperature. They can choose between heat pump sources, location, and using cooling in addition to heating.
The estimator returns the size of the required heat pump, coefficient of performance (COP), capex, opex, net savings, and payback time, with costs and savings presented in Australian dollars. It allows comparing the values for two natural refrigerants, ammonia (R717) and CO2 (R744).
“There is a lack of understanding across industry which we at A2EP are trying to overcome with resources and tools like the Heat Pump Estimator,” said Jarrod Leak, CEO of A2EP. “A lot of manufacturing and operations managers think heat pumps don’t compete on cost, but that’s based on the incorrect assumption that you need to replace a boiler with a heat pump of the same capacity, which is not the case.”
The heat pump estimator was developed by A2EP, engineering consultancy pitt&sherry, and energy equipment provider SmartConsult. It had support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Australian Meat Processor Corp., and industrial refrigeration equipment supplier Mayekawa Australia. A more advanced version of the tool which supports more advanced sizing, including for thermal storage systems, is available exclusively to A2EP members.

Lion-owned XXXX Brewery has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) to satisfy 100% of the electricity needs for the 144-year-old XXXX brewery in Brisbane, Australia, from the AUD 130 million ($90 million) Woolooga solar farm.
The Woolooga project – under development near Gympie, Queensland, by oil giant bp’s renewables joint venture with UK solar company Lightsource – has already commenced generation. It is expected to achieve full production early this year.
Lion's latest XXXX brand campaign asks Australians to “give a XXXX” about the world and environment, and claims the offtake agreement will see the company reach its target of 100% purchased renewable electricity by 2025 in Australia, two years ahead of schedule.

Lion Sustainability Director Justin Merrell said the deal also means the company is Australia’s first certified large-scale carbon neutral brewer.
“All of our beer produced here, up to 250 million liters annually, is now made using 100% renewable electricity,” he said. “XXXX is encouraging all Australians to ‘Give a XXXX’ about the planet for the benefit of our environment, and for beer. Today’s announcement is another great example of how we’re investing in climate solutions to reduce our footprint.”
Merrell said the agreement will cut the brewer’s carbon emissions by an estimated 138,000 tons.
The renewable energy deal is the latest in a series of PPAs announced by the Queensland government. Earlier this week state-owned generator Stanwell signed an agreement to supply biscuit manufacturer Arnott’s Group with more than 68 GWh of renewable energy as part of a long-term PPA.
That came just days after state government-owned CS Energy finalized a deal with global investment manager AMP Capital which will see four major shopping centres in Queensland source 100% of their electricity needs from renewable energy supplied by the 162 MW Columboola Solar Farm.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said he expects more renewable energy PPAs to be announced in the coming weeks as part of the state government’s energy and jobs plan, which lays out a strategy to reduce household and business electricity emissions by 96% by 2040. The Queensland government aims to supply 80% of the state’s electricity demand from hydro power, wind and solar by 2035.
“An increasing number of companies want to decarbonise their operations,” Miles said. “The pipeline of renewable projects in the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan means we will continue to see more and more companies make the transition and lower emissions.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/13/photovoltaic-thermoelectric-tech-with-potential-efficiency-of-65/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 13, 2023",Photovoltaic-thermoelectric tech with potential efficiency of 65%,"Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Science have designed a hybrid power system that combines photovoltaics, spectral-splitting (SS), radiative cooling (RC), and a thermoelectric (TEG) unit.
“The proposed system can be applied to solar photovoltaic power generation, with the thermoelectric materials using the separated solar spectrum to generate electricity,” researcher Jianfeng Guo told pv magazine. “At the same time, the combination of radiation cooling technology and thermoelectric materials can realize power generation at night.”
In the proposed ideal system configuration, the photovoltaic panel is based on heterojunction cells made of III-V materials, placed at the bottom of the hot side of the TEG to generate electricity using the temperature difference between the PV panel and radiative cooling.
“Radiative cooling needs to face the sky, so it is placed on the top,” said the scientists.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
The performance of the system was compared to that of a “conventional” PV-TEG system, in which the PV panel stays on the top acting as the hot side of TEG, and a heat sink is used as the cold side of TEG at the bottom. The TEG module uses numerous P-N thermocouples  and is placed in the middle, to generate electricity using the temperature difference between the solar panel and heat sink.
For the comparison, they applied a theory based on heat-flux conditions is employed to achieve maximum thermoelectric efficiency.
“The PV-TEG hybrid system with RC is superior to the conventional hybrid system, not only in terms of higher efficiency but also in its 24-h operation capacity,” the scientists stated.
They found that the hybrid system with four-junction cells could potentially achieve an efficiency of more than 65%, which they described as superior to most current photoelectric and thermal power systems. A system with a single-junction, efficiency reached 39.4%, and they said that this was higher than the theoretical PV efficiency at 500 suns of 38.2%.
“We only carried out theoretical analysis and numerical simulation on this system, without economic analysis,” Guo said. “In the future, we are going to build an experimental system, and then we will conduct cost analysis.”
The researchers introduced the system in “Maximizing Electric Power through Spectral-Splitting Photovoltaic-Thermoelectric Hybrid System Integrated with Radiative Cooling,” which was recently published in Advanced Science.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.

They say it could be used for ubiquitous device functionalization.
“Our solar cell may be used for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), vehicle-integrated PV (VIPV), and non-intrusive transparent devices for indoor PV,” researcher Alex López García told pv magazine. “It may also be utilized in agrivoltaics as an active element that simultaneously filters harmful light and harvests energy. This application will probably rely on an alternative substrate such as flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and we think that these processes can be transferred to this kind of substrates thanks to the low temperatures.”
The researchers built the cell with a substrate made of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer made of aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO), an absorberd made of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and oxide, a hole transport layer made of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), and an indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode. They built two different cells with a-Si:H thicknesses of 8 nm and 30nm.
“Intrinsic a-Si:H films present a direct bandgap usually reported at values around 1.7-1.8 eV,” they explained. “It has also been reported to be extended up to 2.1 eV via quantum confinement, when thickness is reduced to the nanometric scale.”
The two cells achieved a power conversion efficiency of 1.95% and 0.56%, respectively, which the Spanish group described as the highest values ever reported so far for oxide-based transparent PV devices. Furthermore, the thinnest cell achieved an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 35.4% and the thickest of 66%.
“Use of substrates with sizes up to 5 cm2 x 5 cm2have allowed to achieve good statistics to analyze the reproducibility of the results when working with 0.07 cm2 active area devices that have been defined using a metallic shadow mask during ITO deposition,” the academics said. “A first attempt for process upscaling has also been done with the fabrication of a 5 cm2 x 5 cm2 solar cell. However, even in this case the devices show a dramatic drop in the device efficiency to values lower than 0.1%.”
The scientists acknowledged that the next step in their research will be to develop transparent solar cells with high AVT values, while simultaneously trying to increase efficiency.
“At this time we are basically at low technology readiness level (TRL) and the paper serves as proof of concept,” López García explained. “As transparent PV yields lower efficiency than conventional opaque PV, it will not be just enough to prove that devices work. It will be paramount to use robust processes with nanometric control and homogeneity. Furthermore, it will be important to use low-cost and non-critical-raw materials. In our work, we use oxide materials and silicon, which are earth-abundant and cheap.”
The research team described the cell in “Ultrathin a-Si:H/oxide transparent solar cells exhibiting UV-blue selective-like absorption,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.
“Commercial production is being envisaged,” López García said. “However, we must still carry out more research as we believe that further optimization is possible. With time we should move to industrial collaboration in order to translate all the research efforts into real-life products.”

“The system is designed in the United States, components are made all over the world, firmware/software is built predominantly in the United States, and all of this is assembled in Malaysia,” Zola CEO Bill Lenihan told pv magazine.
“Flex Max serves homeowners looking to power AC appliances such as refrigeration alongside lights, connectivity, TV, and businesses looking to power productive use products,” Zola said in a statement. “It is an evolution of Zola’s plug-and-play solar and storage hybrid power system Flex … Flex Max’s increased capacity can further power high efficiency AC and DC refrigerators in residential settings, so customers can better store food and minimize spoilage, and extends its application from the domestic to offices and hospitals.”
The Flex Max system has a nominal voltage of 12.8 V and a capacity of 50 Ah or 640 Wh. It can be connected to 240 W solar panels. The battery has a continuous AC power rating of 300 W and a DC maximum power rating of 150. It measures 11 cm x 32 cm x 45 cm, weighs 10 kg, and comes with a five-year warranty.
The new device can charge from both solar and the grid.
“The core value of Flex Max is its larger, modular battery and flexibility to leverage both high-efficiency appliances that come with AC as well as infrastructure’s DC systems, so more customers can use existing appliances while benefiting from the versatility of Zola’s DC ecosystem,” said the company.
The Flex Max includes three DC ports for Zola accessories, four lighting ports, two USB ports, and one DC port for a 300 W Zola inverter. The battery has a maximum operating temperature of 40 C. The product’s datasheet does not include the minimum operating temperature. The battery is IEC 62133 certified.
Zola incorporated new financing mechanisms for the device, including a pay-as-you-go model that allows the system to be locked in case of non-payment.
“Crucially, this addresses the lack of traditional energy financing mechanisms in the developing world, combatting the affordability issue for end-users, while also supporting distribution partners,” the company said in a statement.

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has confirmed it has approved AUD 65 million ($44.95 million) in funding to renewables developer Vast Solar to construct VS1, a “first-of-a-kind” CSP plant north of Port Augusta, South Australia.
Vast Solar Chief Executive Officer Craig Wood said the AUD 203 million project seeks to demonstrate the technical and operational performance of the company’s modular CSP technology at utility scale, helping to unlock further investment in future projects and provide another pathway for Australian industry to decarbonise.
“The world-leading VS1 plant will have an important impact on the future of clean, dispatchable energy generation in Australia and globally, allowing us to sustainably power electricity grids overnight,” he said.
Vast Solar’s CSP technology uses mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers, with high temperature heat transferred via liquid sodium and stored in molten salt. The stored energy can then be used to heat water to create steam to drive a turbine and produce electricity, or the heat can also be used directly to decarbonize some industrial processes.
The Sydney-based developer said its technology allows plants to be configured with four to 16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW. Wood said one of the benefits of CSP is that the captured heat can be stored cost-effectively for long periods with little loss of energy. This means that CSP can be used to generate electricity or provide heat on demand, including overnight.
The technology is on show at Jemalong, New South Wales, where a 1 MW pilot plant, which was constructed adjacent to a 50 MW solar PV project, has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the expansion of Vast Solar’s technology into a commercial-scale project illustrates that CSP technology could play an important role in generating and storing renewable energy at scale.
“With the increasing need for dispatchable renewable generation and longer duration energy storage, CSP has potential to assist Australia’s energy transition alongside pumped hydro and large-scale batteries,” he said.
ARENA’s funding for VS1 is conditional upon the project reaching financial close, which is targeted to occur in late 2023. VS1 is expected to take two years to build with commercial operations commencing late 2025.

However, such microgrids will likely encounter serious challenges in terms of increased power losses, thermal loading, voltage deviation, and overall system costs.
Now, an international group of researchers from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Finland has proposed an efficient planning approach, the “jellyfish search optimizer” (JSO) method, to solve the allocation problem of EV charging stations and RERs in multi-microgrids.
The researchers investigated different scenarios, including the optimal integration of EV charging stations without RERs, optimal integration of EV charging stations and RERs with a controlled charging strategy, and optimal integration of EV charging stations and RERs with a controlled charging and discharging strategy.
They obtained superior results with the optimal integration of EV charging stations and RERs with a controlled charging and discharging strategy. Voltage deviation, energy not supplied, and total cost decreased considerably compared to the base case – specifically by 73.97%, 50.43%, and 29.55%.
The researchers also found that the proposed optimizer can reduce operating costs for RERs and conventional stations while increasing the capacity of charging stations. The researchers said this makes the JSO approach superior for solving the allocation problem of EV charging stations and RERs compared to the other well-known algorithms.
They presented their findings in “Multi-objective optimal planning of EV charging stations and renewable energy resources for smart microgrids,” which was recently published in Energy Science and Engineering.
