Now, new research promises to lower manufacturing costs and improve the performance of sodium-ion batteries by virtue of micro-architected electrodes.
In a study that was recently published in the journal Small, researchers at Tohoku University in Japan examined ways to develop high-performance, low-cost sodium-ion batteries by increasing the loaded amount of active materials used to make a battery into a single battery cell. Their approach reduces the inactive components that are used for binding multiple cells together, compacting the battery size and lowering the costs of the ingredients. However, it requires the fabrication of thicker electrodes, which restricts ion movement within the battery.
The researchers have addressed this by developing an approach that fabricates micro-engineered, high performing anode, using 3D stereolithography to print microlattice structures made from resin. The microlattices are then shrunk by carbonizing them via a process known as “pyrolysis.”
The resulting hard carbon anodes were found to allow fast transportation of energy-generating ions. Also, as the team made the lattice structure finer, its performance improved.
“As 3D printers gain increasing resolution, sodium ion batteries could eventually outperform lithium-ion ones,” said Akira Kudo, a Tohoku University materials scientist.
The team’s next goal is to use the same approach to make the cathode, and eventually use the finely architected electrodes for superior sodium ion batteries.

Last week, the US Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which proposes $369 billion in energy spending, including a new production tax credit to cover the first 10 years of operation for qualified clean hydrogen production facilities. The base credit amount would be $0.60/kg, multiplied by an “applicable percentage” defined as a function of greenhouse gas emission rates. The credit could be five times the base credit amount, up to $3/kg, if the hydrogen is produced according to key requirements. Electric vehicles and carbon capture and sequestration are also poised to benefit from the proposed legislation.
SAIC Motor has revealed plans to put 410 fuel cell vehicles into operation in Shanghai, in pursuit of its aims to put more than 10,000 such vehicles into service by 2025. In addition, the Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturer said that it would launch at least 10 new fuel cell models by 2025.
Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with US industrial engineering contractor Oklahoma-based Matrix Service Co. to develop new technology to support onshore large-scale liquid hydrogen storage in South Korea. “The agreement also supports the development of solutions that will allow transportation of greater volumes of hydrogen by transport ship,” said Oklahoma-based Matrix Service. Kogas is reportedly seeking new tech for hydrogen shipping, storage, and distribution.
Advent Technologies has signed an MoU with Greek gas supplier DEPA, potentially setting the stage for a forthcoming agreement. The two companies want to team up in several areas, including the production of low-carbon hydrogen and the creation of a hydrogen and fuel cell innovation center in Greece. In addition, they said they aim to jointly develop a proprietary combined heat and power system “ready for mass production with efficiency approaching 90% and with multi-fuel operating capabilities (hydrogen, natural gas, efuels).”
Anglo American has revealed plans to build on-site solar plants and off-site wind farms in South Africa to “provide the foundation for green hydrogen production” to power its haul trucks. In its first-half earnings report, the company said it aims to replace its global fleet with hydrogen trucks over the next decade. It currently operates around 400 diesel cargo vehicles.

Brazil’s National Institute of Clean Energies (INEL) has announced the establishment of a green hydrogen secretariat (SHV) to accelerate the growth of green hydrogen production in Brazil. The secretariat will serve under the leadership of Luiz Piauhylino Filho, who has experience in the renewable energy and green hydrogen sectors, in both Portugal and Brazil.
Filho said that the SHV will try to guarantee low-cost clean energy for the production of green hydrogen. It will coordinate with the main players in the market, as well as national and international authorities, other clean energy associations, companies, entrepreneurs, and the general public.
In November 2021, INEL set up a working group with the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) to seek technical solutions for the connection of distributed generation – one of the bottlenecks for the segment in the country. The results of this analysis were delivered in May.
The green hydrogen segment in Brazil has started to grow this year with the installation of the country’s first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant. It was completed in May by Unigel. The system includes three standard 20 MW electrolyzers supplied by Thyssenkrupp nucera, with a second phase expected to expand the project’s capacity beyond 100 MW.
Shell's Brazilian subsidiary is also working on hydrogen projects, in collaboration with the port of Açu. The two sides are developing a pilot plant at the port, north of Rio de Janeiro, with an initial capacity of 10 MW. They aim to eventually develop a 100 MW green hydrogen production facility at the port.

Texas-based FTC Solar’s DG Solutions Business Unit and AUI Partners have announced a new solar tracking solution for solar sites of under 20 MW, which they report can be delivered as quickly as eight weeks.
“Despite the growth in DG as a result of federal and state-wide pushes for increased solar projects, there is still a shortage of comprehensive solutions that give customers what they need in a timely manner,” said Mario Carbone, partner at AUI Partners. “By combining FTC’s resilient and versatile Voyager tracker and optimization software with our lead generation, design, delivery, and installation services, we are able to offer customers an innovative design-through-installation service that ultimately benefits developers by reducing the number of project partners they need to commission.”
FTC Solar and AUI Partners are targeting US-based commercial and industrial, community solar programs, projects for independent power producers, and smaller one-off projects for sectors such as agriculture. The companies are using proprietary automation technology to provide a fast turnaround time on project quotes.
The tracker is FTC’s Voyager+ 2P solar tracker, and AUI is providing site design and construction. The Voyager+ 2P was introduced in September of 2021 and is designed for modules of 550 W and higher. It uses nearly 50% fewer foundation piles than comparable alternative systems, according to the company. It also enables a roughly 2% higher energy density than its 1P competitors.
In developing the tracker, FTC Solar collaborated with RWDI and Engineered Power Solutions on data analysis and wind tunnel testing to independently validate the product’s structural stability. Through this testing and design modification, FTC said it created a tracker that can withstand winds equivalent to a “Category 3” hurricane, but also operates well in low wind speeds, an environment that has long been a hurdle for trackers. To optimize the Voyager+ tracker, FTC offers a variety of software solutions, including its SunPath platform, which will also be available for distributed generation projects.
“By ensuring materials are readily available for these projects, DG Solutions will deliver faster than many other providers in the market, which can require more than six months,” said Sean Hunkler, CEO of FTC Solar. “We see tremendous growth potential for this market over the next few years. However, for it to grow successfully, resilient turnkey solutions are imperative, and working with the team at AUI Partners will help us complete these projects quickly, which is a win for both the customer and the planet.”

Among these is light scattering, where sunlight hits tiny particles embedded into the cell, and is reflected around the device rather than straight back out of it.
A group of US scientists led by Penn State University have demonstrated a 1% efficiency increase in perovskite solar cells by adding a nanoscale light trapping structure to the front of the cell. The achievement is also notable they started out investigation a completely different route to solar cell optimization, and ultimately discovered most of the gains thought to come from this are actually attributable to an accompanying light scattering effect.
“Some researchers in the literature have hypothesized and showed results that up-conversion nanoparticles provide a boost in performance,” said Shashank Priya, professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State. “But this research shows that it doesn't matter if you put in up-conversion nanoparticles or any other nanoparticles – they will show the boosted efficiency because of the enhance light scattering.”
Up-conversion is a process where a material added to a cell converts infrared radiation into visible light, which can be absorbed by the solar cell. This has long been pursued as a possible to way to reach efficiencies beyond what is thought to be theoretically possible in a single junction device. In this case, scientists at Macquarie University in Australia provided another crystalline material that does not exhibit the up-conversion effect, allowing the Penn State researchers to compare results.
They described their work in “Homogenization of Optical Field in Nanocrystal-Embedded Perovskite Composites,” which was published in ACS Energy Letters. The results showed that the materials were equally effective in improving the perovskite solar cell’s conversion efficiency. And with further calculations, the researchers were able to prove that the efficiency boost primarily came from light scattering, with up-conversion only having a negligible effect.
“We started to basically play around with nanoparticle distribution in the model, and we started to see that as you distribute the particles far away from each other, you start to see some enhanced scattering,” said Thomas Brown, associate professor at the University of Rome. “Then we had this breakthrough.”
The group says it will now investigate the optimization of the size, shape and distribution of particles in nanostructures to optimize performance even further.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/09/german-solar-market-hits-high-of-e0-261-kwh-in-july/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,EUROPE,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"AUGUST 9, 2022",German solar market hits high of €0.261/kWh in July,"From pv magazine Germany
From June to July, the market value of solar increased by more than €0.07 ($0.071) to reach its highest value in 2022 of €0.26093/kWh, according to the country’s transmission system operator. Power spot market prices also rose sharply, increasing by almost €0.10 to reach €0.0315/kWh in July.
The market value for both onshore and offshore wind soared, reaching €0.278/kWh and €0.287/kWh, respectively. Compared to May, this represents almost a doubling in value for wind, along with a major increase in the spot price.
Operators in Germany’s direct marketing system can thus look forward to high revenues, as Fraunhofer ISE has reported new record amounts for solar generation in July for the third month in a row. The report shows that PV systems in Germany produced 8.223 TWh of electricity, marking the second time that the 8 TWh mark has been surpassed since June.
The value of €0.261/kWh is significantly above those outlined for the direct marketing mechanism in Germany’s Renewable Energy Act (EEG). It is also far above the values for both rooftop and ground-mount systems that have been produced by tenders in the country.
In the recent “Easter package” update to the EEG, Germany’s federal government significantly increased the values to be applied in direct marketing, with systems that receive feed-in-tariffs remaining eligible to receive bonuses. However, the €0.134/kWh that will be paid to all PV systems up to 10 kW in size, assuming they have been commissioned since the end of July, is still far below solar electricity’s current market value.
This article was amended on 09/08 to correct the market value numbers, which were previously out by one decimal place.

You can imagine, 140 MW of rooftop solar across multiple facilities, it took a lot of ambition but perhaps even more planning and execution. Coordinating the resources, keeping our teams safe and healthy, especially during a global pandemic, was quite challenging to say the least. But we tackled each and every aspect of this project through the joint efforts of every person on the team, each of whom proved determined in achieving our goals.
Huawei’s FusionSolar Smart PV Solution means high quality products and it means no fuses. To be sure, Huawei’s products provide higher yields, so from an economic point of view its solution enables investors to obtain maximum efficiency. And from an O&M perspective, the intelligence of the systems means the PV plant, even a diffuse rooftop system like this project, is easy to maintain.
This year, Huawei's special edition looks at technical challenges to a power system mostly run by inverter-interfaced power sources. The leading topic: Smart PV and Storage – Anytime for Anyone, is achieved by a high degree of digitization, a new business division within the Huawei corporation and strong network of partners.

The Tosyali Solar Project in Osmaniye/Adana is the world’s largest rooftop solar project. It took 300 people to complete the installation which took place in two phases. The amount of materials used was simply staggering – 260,000 solar panels, 1,400 inverters, 2,000 km of solar cables and 3,500 tons of steel profiles are going into the project. With a total capacity of 140 MW, you can imagine that is spread across many rooftops, indeed covering approximately 632,000 square meters of Tosyali’s production facilities.
With the purlin connection technique, the steel profiles are mounted right on the column instead of the roof itself, so that the system is not affected by the strong winds nor the strong vibrations. This technique is rather rarely applied, probably because it requires a considerable amount of engineering expertise. But we at SolarApex employed it for this project because the region where the various rooftop installations were to be installed can see pretty harsh weather conditions, particularly heavy winds. On top of that, the heavy machinery within the buildings causes quite a strong vibration during production. If we had employed conventional installation techniques in these circumstances the rooftop system would not be as solid and durable as we’d like it to be. And we are not in the business of putting the system at risk.
Huawei is a partner we trust with the quality of its product and technology. We share a common vision, and that is why we have been collaborating with Huawei for almost all of our previous projects, in which Huawei’s smart PV inverters are always present. Both SolarApex and the investors are more than satisfied by the performance and service of Huawei’s projects, and as a result of that mutual trust and contentment our bond is only strengthening. At SolarApex, we are honored and proud to have collaborated with our long-time solution partner Huawei on this world-wide legendary project. And it is a sweet coincidence that Huawei’s 20th year in Turkey has come in the same year as we collaborate on realizing this significant project.
We estimate that 140 MW will generate approximately 250 million kWh of green energy annually. For Tosyali Holding, a portion of this energy will be used to produce hydrogen for the production of green iron and steel – two very hard-to-decarbonize sectors. This project will definitely be seen as a magnificent example of what large-scale rooftop solar can do, an example which will lead major industrial companies to consider their own energy transition. After all, in terms of size and scale, as well as quality and technology, this project is one of a kind, pioneering, but hopefully one day in the near future there will be many others like it.
Stability of power supply is absolutely crucial for producers with large energy consumption, and of course, the heavy industry is highly energy intensive. With electricity prices surging almost constantly, generating energy through renewables means independence from those fluctuations, and that stability is extremely important, not only because it saves money in the long run, but because it protects against grid outages and other issues that arise from dependency. Moreover, generating energy where you use it reduces transmission losses. Big industry players like steel producers must eliminate their carbon footprint in order to maintain their position in the global market. In response to the Paris Climate Accord, and more and more countries pledging carbon neutrality targets, global players must reduce their emissions while continuing to export and remain competitive, especially with mechanisms like carbon taxes in the mix.

The two sides are now negotiating the interest rate and other terms and conditions.
“The grid-tied large projects will get priority in the latest loan program,” a senior IDCOL official told pv magazine.
IDCOL provides low-cost loans to set up of solar home system, domestic biogas, solar irrigation, biomass, and biogas based electricity generation plants. The non-bank financial institution is now offering a range of subsidies and concessionary loans to viable renewable energy projects.
IDCOL has the financial support of the World Bank, Global Environment Facility (GEF), KfW, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), the Asian Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank. It said the second phase of its Renewable Energy Programme will be implemented between 2023 and 2027.
Anirban Kundu, country director for KfW in Bangladesh, said the €80 million loan is part of a €99.50 million financing package that KFW is providing on behalf of the German government. It also include €18.50 million of investment grants and €1 million of accompanying measure grants.
Documents show that KfW has sought a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the undisbursed loan amount, as well as a management fee of 0.10% flat on the total loan amount. It has offered two options for the interest rate on the loan – a fixed interest rate of 2.73% per annum, or a floating (variable) interest rate. The repayment period of the loan is up to 20 years, with a grace period of five years, with 31 equal semi-annual installments.
“The negotiation on the interest rate and other terms and condition is still ongoing. But we are expecting to sign financial agreement by this year,” said one IDCOL official.
However, IDCOL has asked the KfW to reduce the the interest rate for the proposed loan. It has said that the interest rates for past KfW loans have been limited to 2%, but the current offer has a higher fixed interest rate of 2.73%.
Bangladesh currentls has the capacity to generate 909 MW of electricity from renewables. About 675 MW of the total currently comes from solar.

Rio Tinto issued a call in June for market proposals to develop large-scale wind and solar to power its aluminium assets in the Australian state of Queensland.
That call was promptly heeded, with Rio Tinto’s Australian chief executive, Kellie Parker, saying that the group had received proposals for “a lot more than the 4 GW.”
Rio Tinto appears to be keeping a check on expectations, though. “All of us understand that Australia remains an expensive location to build, so it won’t be easy,” she said in a speech to the Melbourne Mining Club last week, without providing an indication of costs.
The company is seeking to meet the energy needs of three of its Gladstone assets, including the Boyne smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery, and the Queensland Alumina refinery.
“These assets require 1,140 MW of reliable power to operate, which equates to at least 4,000 MW of quality wind or solar power with firming,” Rio Tinto said in June.
Such a massive fit out would require much planning, and the company does not seem to have even decided on its renewable model yet. Parker said Rio Tinto has received proposals putting it in different roles, including project owner, operator, partner, investor and customer.
