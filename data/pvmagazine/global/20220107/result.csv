https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/07/high-performance-sodium-and-potassium-ion-batteries-via-new-carbon-electrode-materials/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 7, 2022",High-performance sodium and potassium ion batteries via new carbon electrode materials,"Sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries are prospective lithium-free alternatives for large-scale energy storage systems based on abundant, more environmentally friendly resources. However, unsatisfactory rate and cycling performance due to the larger sizes of sodium and potassium ions and their ability to move through the porous carbon-based anodes has held back the application of these battery technologies.
Now a group of researchers from the Bristol Composites Institute and Imperial College has developed high-performance sodium and potassium ion batteries using sustainably sourced cellulose. They implemented a novel controllable unidirectional ice-templating strategy to develop new carbon electrode materials, called aerogels. In aerogels, cellulose nanocrystals are formed into a porous structure using ice crystals that are grown and then sublimated, thereby leaving large channels within the structure that can carry the large sodium and potassium ions.
“We proposed a novel controllable ice-templating strategy to fabricate low-cost cellulose nanocrystals/polyethylene oxide-derived carbon aerogels with hierarchically tailored and vertically-aligned channels as electrode materials, which can be utilized to well-tuning the rate capability and cycling stability of sodium- and potassium-ion batteries,” said Jing Wang, lead author and a PhD student in the Bristol Composites Institute.
The researchers were astounded with the performances of these new batteries, which are presented in detail in the paper “Ice-Templated, Sustainable Carbon Aerogels with Hierarchically Tailored Channels for Sodium- and Potassium-Ion Batteries,” published in Advanced Functional Materials.
Their results demonstrate a practical pathway to tune electrochemical storage performance through a controllable ice-templating strategy which, according to the researchers, can be easily extended to a variety of other energy storage systems such as zinc-, calcium-, aluminum-, and magnesium-ion batteries, exhibiting its universal potential for the next-generation of energy storage systems.
“Benefiting from the renewability of the precursor and scalability at relatively low cost in the environmentally benign synthesis process, this work could offer an appealing route to promote large-scale applications of sustainable electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage grids in the near future,” she added.
In the light of these findings, the researchers hope to collaborate with industries to develop this strategy on an industrial scale and further explore the potential of this technology across a broad range of battery storage systems.

In “Optimal techno-economic sizing of a standalone floating photovoltaic/battery energy storage system to power an aquaculture aeration and monitoring system,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, he claimed that standalone power systems might be particularly beneficial for shrimp ponds in remote parts of developing countries, where no grid electricity is available.
“The proposed configuration could be used for a paddlewheel aerator and a turbine aerator,” he told pv magazine. “However, it is not suitable for a pump-sprayer aerator and a diffuser aerator.”
He said that around 54% of the solar-plus-storage system capital costs are represented by the cost of the battery. This is why the sizing of the entire system would be crucial in achieving economic viability.
He designed a solar-plus-storage installation for an aeration system. It is a fully floating platform for a shrimp pond based on a paddlewheel aerator with a speed of approximately 100 revolutions per minute (rpm). The system was assumed to have a power requirement of 200 W, installed at an unspecified remote location along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Thailand. It is designed to rely on a monitoring system with a power demand of 5 W. The aeration system works for six hours per day and the monitoring system operates around the clock.
“The floating platform is assembled using four high-density polyethylene floats, which are bound into a single unit by a galvanized steel frame, to support both the aerator and solar-plus-storage system,” said Jamroen. “This floating platform has a weight capacity of around 100 kg weight capacity, which is a crucial factor that restricts the size of the solar generator coupled to storage.”
The researcher conducted a simulation for a year and assessed the reliability index, which provides a qualitative estimate of the structural performance of a system. It was calculated to evaluate the power supply ability of the energy system to ensure its continuous operation. He also used the levelized cost of energy to assess the cost-effectiveness of the different energy system configurations. In addition, he considered two aeration scenarios, including day aeration and night aeration.
Jamroen determined that the ideal sizing for the day-aeration scenario is 450 W for the PV system and 60 Ah for the battery. For the night aeration setting, the ideal size of the PV installation is 535 W and at 150 Ah for the storage system.
“The costs of the selected optimal floating solar-plus-storage system were estimated at $805 for day aeration and $1,420 for night aeration,” Jamroen said, noting that the costs for a system powered by a diesel generator came to $16,000 in both scenarios. “The costs covered only the solar-plus-storage system and the costs of floats, motor, paddle wheels, structure, electronic components for the monitoring system were excluded, as our work focused only on the energy system.”
Jamroen determined that the proposed configuration is cheaper than the combination of a floating solar array coupled with a diesel generator and without a battery. He calculated an overall cost of $8,810 for the the day-aeration scenario and a cost of $11,400 for the night aeration scenario.
“The results indicated that the solar-plus-storage system is the most technically and economically feasible option among the other configurations for both day- and night-aeration scenarios,” concluded Jamroen.
*The article was amended on January 10 to reflect that, for the night aeration setting, the ideal size of the PV installation is 535 W, and not 535  kW as we previously reported.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved the Green Energy Corridor (GEC) Phase-II scheme for the Intra-State Transmission System (InSTS). The scheme is intended to add approximately 10,750 circuit kilometres (ckm) of transmission lines and approx. 27,500 mega volt-amperes (MVA) transformation capacity of substations with central financial support.
The transmission infrastructure created under the scheme will facilitate grid integration and power evacuation of approximately 20 GW of renewable energy (RE) power projects in seven states. The beneficiary states include Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.
The total cost of the transmission system is estimated to be INR 12,031.33 crore (US$1.6 billion), with central financial assistance (CFA) covering 33% of the project cost, i.e., INR 3,970.34 crore (US$534 million). The CFA will help offset the intra-state transmission charges and thus keep the power costs down, ultimately benefiting the end users.
The transmission system will be created over a period of five years, from financial year 2021-22 to 2025-26, helping the nation to achieve the target of 450 GW installed RE capacity by 2030.
This scheme is in addition to GEC Phase-I, which is already under implementation in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu for grid integration and power evacuation of approximately 24 GW of RE power and is expected to be completed by 2022. The scheme will add 9,700 ckm of transmission lines and 22,600 MVA capacity of substations with an estimated cost of INR 10,141.68 crore (US$1.36 billion) for transmission projects with a CFA of INR 4,056.67 crore (US$546 million).

“The similarities between Dutch and British gas central heating mean these high-temperature heat pumps could be suitable for UK housing in suburban and rural areas,” the two companies said in a joint statement. “They could enable households to swap out their existing gas boilers without needing to go to the additional expense and disruption of changing the rest of their heating system or installing additional insulation at the same time.”
The heat pump is claimed to be able to provide a water temperature of between 60 and 80 degrees Celsius, which means its use doesn't require the improvement of a house's insulation, the setting up of underfloor heating or the adaptation of radiators, all of which is necessary when a conventional air heat pumps are utilized.
The system's buffer works as a heat battery that is used to provide heat to radiators and generate hot tap water.
“The high-temperature heat pump solution is innovative, simple to install and could be the solution to help decarbonise homes in the UK that are heated using traditional gas boilers,” said Mark Anderson, commercial and development director at Vattenfall Heat UK, noting that the system can be deployed in just two days.
Further technical details on the heat pump were not disclosed.

Avanzalia Panama, a subsidiary of Spanish developer Avanzalia Solar, secured permission in late December to operate its 120 MW Penonomé solar plant.
The project was fully built by the end of 2020, but the company then conducted numerous power supply tests throughout 2021. The solar plant has since been certified by the National Dispatch Center of Panama.
The Penonomé solar plant is expected to generate 240 GWh of green energy per year. It is the first large plant of its kind to be directly connected to the network of national grid operator ETESA at 230,000 volts.
Spanish engineering group TSK handled construction. Avanzalia told pv magazine that the project required an investment of $160 million.
The PV array is now in the final financing phase, which will be completed when Panamanian and North American investors issue a green bond in Panama.
The plant was originally scheduled to be switched on at the end of 2019. It features 450,000 solar panels and 89 inverters. In October 2019, Avanzalia signed 22-year long-term power sale agreements for the project with unspecified large clients.

The floater is called Hydro-lock and is able to host water, which gives it additional mass and, according to its creators, additional stability, without extra costs for ballast materials, such as metal or concrete. Each floater can host a single solar panel.
“The float can host any kind of solar panel with dimensions of up to 1000 x 2200 mm,” the company's CEO and founder, Polina Vasilenko, told pv magazine. “It is made with linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), which costs between €1.5 and €2 per kg. Manufacturing costs for our system reach around €4 per kg.”
According to the manufacturer, simulations with wind speed 44 m/s have shown the HelioRec’s floaters are 3.5 times more stable than conventional blow-molded floaters.

“HelioRec’s floating system possesses a stackability functionality through which it is able to efficiently pack up the floaters while shipping them between our target location and the manufacturing firm,” Vasilenko went on to say. “This allows to use up to 50% less space in containers, thus, reducing logistics costs.”
According to her, the new tech also has a unique design of the connectors between the stackable floating elements that helps reduce mechanical stresses on the system as a whole.
The floaters are available in different shapes and colors. They were initially manufactured in Russia but production is currently being moved to an unspecified location in Estonia, from where the company will run its sales operations.
The floater has been recently used in a 10 kW project being developed at the port of Ostend, in Belgium, in cooperation with Greenpipe International. “For the project, we are using mono PERC modules with a power output of 410 W each from JinkoSolar and we will apply hydrophobic additive from Portuguese provider ChemiTek,” Vasilenko further explained.
The French company also recently signed a partnership agreement with Dutch maritime giant Van Oord to evaluate if floating solar arrays can be used to power unmanned survey vessels.

Silicon Ranch, a company backed by Royal Dutch Shell, has raised $775 million in equity capital.
The funding round was led by new investor Manulife Invesment Management, a division of Canada’s largest life insurance firm, which contributed $400 million. Existing investors Shell TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund and Mountain Group partners also participated. The deal is expected to close the first quarter of this year.
Silicon Ranch operates out of Nashville, Tennessee. It owns and operates PV assets in 15 states. Shell invested in the developer in 2018, and now owns roughly 45% of the company.
Chief Executive Reagan Farr told Reuters that the new funds will support the buildout of about 2 GW of PV projects over the next 24 to 36 months, which will double its installed capacity. The company has expressed interest in continuing to make acquisitions like last year's purchase of Clearloop, a company that sells carbon offset contracts to corporations, and then uses the funds to build solar projects in low-income and high-carbon communities.
Last year, Silicon Ranch partnered with Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives to build the 100 MW Lumpkin Solar Farm in Georgia, as part of a 435 MW portfolio designed to supply Facebook data centers with power in pursuit of its 100% renewable energy procurement goals. The project included the installation of more than 300,000 First Solar Series 6 modules. An estimated 300 construction jobs in Georgia were created by the project.
The investment comes as the United States is projected to install 348 GW of solar over the next 10 years, representing more than triple the current installed capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Franklin Whole Home will debut its first product, a residential storage solution, at Intersolar North America in California next week.
The system was designed in the United States by Franklin Whole Home, which is based in San Francisco, with manufacturing facilities in Shenzhen, China. The FranklinWH system integrates a lithium iron phosphate “aPower” battery with artificial intelligence, which is part of the included aGate smart control system.
The company says the 13.6 KWh battery is compatible with any PV inverter technology and can be connected with existing solar systems. It scales up to 15 units, for a total of 204 KWh of capacity. In the event of a power failure, its black start feature creates a microgrid for the home.
The AI function in the aGate control system allows it to manage complex load scenarios. This safeguards the main panel, but also enables the homeowner to integrate three additional large loads such as HVAC, pool heating, or electric vehicle charging. The app prompts homeowners to modify consumption when needed or, with its smart export capability, send power back to the grid at peak rates.
Franklin Whole Home said there is no assembly involved and noted that home electric panels do not need to be upgraded. In addition, the aGate’s advanced monitoring helps installers pinpoint and resolve failures remotely. The Franklin Home Power solution is backed by a 12-year warranty and a bankability report from DNV. A single unit is priced at around $10,000.
Franklin Whole Home will host a public event at Intersolar on Jan. 13 at 10 a.m. in booth 1059 to mark its new UL certifications and bankability milestones. Representatives from CSA Group, Intertek and DNV will be on hand at the event.
The company was established in 2019 and employs a team of leading storage and power electronics experts. It has more than 30 patents pending.
