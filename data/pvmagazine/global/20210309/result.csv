The new product relies on nine-busbar technology, which should make the modules less susceptible to micro-cracks. Like all half-cell modules from the Japanese manufacturer, the products have three small junction boxes, each equipped with a bypass diode. These enclosures transfer less heat to the upper cells, which helps to extend the lifetime of panels while improving overall system performance, it is claimed.
The panel has a size of 2,108×1,048mm and a weight of 25kg. The module is suitable for a system voltage of up to 1,500 V and has a temperature coefficient of -0.347% per degree Celsius.
The product has been certified according to the certifications IEC61215 and IEC61730 standards, which the manufacturer claims confirm the quality and safety of the module, which was tested for resistance to ammonia, salt mist, sand and voltage-induced degradation (PID).
The module was specially developed for ground-mounted and commercial and industrial photovoltaic systems and offers, according to Sharp, and offers a good balance between cost reduction and system compatibility. A 1.67m-long cable comes with the new module, which is said to enable installation in a landscape format or to allow skip cabling for installation in a portrait format.
In September, Sharp launched the NU-JD440 solar panel, which is also a half-cut monocrystalline PERC product, but with a lower, 19.9% efficiency rate and 440 W of power output. In January 2020, Sharp launched its first monocrystalline PERC module series to feature half-cut cells. It had previously announced three more mono PERC products, with a claimed 19.1% efficiency rate, in April 2018.

Requiring a maximum 20 kWh of electricity per kilogram produced, the company said it expects further hydrogen content reductions in its next, 30,000 MT production line.
Battery company CATL and inverter maker Kstar today announced completion of construction of the 1 GW-annual-production-capacity fab established by the partners in Xiapu economic development zone, in Fujian. The 206,907m2 facility features two inverter production lines, two “charging lines” and a battery pack assembly unit. 
Polysilicon manufacturer Xinte Energy on Friday announced shareholders will vote, on March 25, on plans to build a 100,000-ton-per-year-production-capacity factory in Baotou City, Inner Mongolia. The facility was described as a “circular economy construction project” but Xinte did not release any details about its circular economy features.
Power provider China Huadian Corporation (CHD) has announced it will decommission 3 GW of thermal power plants and increase the share of renewables in its power generation fleet to 50% by 2026. At the end of last year, the company had 153 GW of power plants, of which 40.4% produced renewable energy. In order to reach its new, 2025 target, CHD needs to install at least 26.4 GW of new renewable energy generation capacity.
Wuxi-based solar cell manufacturer Jiangsu Luneng Energy has said it will invest RMB3 billion to build new heterojunction and TOPCon solar cell production lines with an annual capacity of 1 GW for each technology, plus a 500 MW solar module production line with half-cut cell technology. The new lines will be in Zhang Jiagang city, Jiangsu province. Construction will start this month, with completion scheduled in 2022. Luneng is a key supplier for manufacturers such as Risen, Yingli, and Eging. The company has three production bases, in Jiangsu, in Shanxi province and in Vietnam, with a total annual manufacturing capacity of 2 GW for PERC, mono-casting and multi-crystalline cells.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/09/solar-could-play-big-role-in-helping-renewables-displace-uks-planned-gas-fleet/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",MAX HALL,"MARCH 9, 2021",Solar could play big role in helping renewables displace UK’s planned gas fleet,"London-based thinktank Carbon Tracker has claimed portfolios of clean energy and storage assets are already cheaper than new combined-cycle gas turbines in the U.K.–with last year proving the inflection point.
The cost of developing the 6.3 GW-capacity mix of clean energy assets Carbon Tracker estimated would be necessary to replace a 1.8 GW gas generation plant fell to the same price as the fossil fuel asset in 2020: £60/MWh (€69.93), according to a new report from the thinktank.
And solar would play a significant part in such a clean power portfolio at today's prices, according to Carbon Tracker, with each 1.8 GW of new gas capacity planned by the U.K. government requiring 1.7 GW of solar panels as part of the alternative, non-fossil-fuel power mix. The clean energy portfolio modeled by Carbon Tracker included 1.7 GW of energy storage facilities–contributing half the overall cost, at today's prices–with onshore wind generation, demand-response technology and energy efficiency investment completing the line-up.
The low, 11% capacity factor of solar–the energy output actually delivered as a percentage of nameplate generation capacity–means PV would contribute around 26% of the electricity required to supplant a gas turbine, falling to 1% during periods of peak demand, based on an even mix of residential and industrial power consumers. During peak periods, the 27% year-round-average share of the burden provided by energy storage would rise to 39%, with demand-response's contribution rising from 20% to 23%, as onshore wind falls from 18% to 10%. The energy efficiency investment opportunity offered by the U.K.'s aging housing stock means the contribution from that source–during the annual peak electricity demand periods, which occur in winter–would rise from 9% to 27%. However, the dismal failure of Westminster to deliver on its flagship green home improvement policy last year would cast significant doubt on the government's ability to guide energy efficiency investment effectively.
Carbon Tracker's Foot off the gas report estimates the cost of the renewables portfolio modeled would fall to £41/MWh by 2030, making it 39% cheaper than the gas plant required to fulfill the same job, with that margin rising to a 60% discount by mid century. However, that figure is posited on continuing falls in clean power technology–led by storage costs–as well as the prediction made by analyst Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) that gas prices will rise this decade, alongside an expected climb in carbon costs.
The report leans on another BNEF prediction when it posits the capital expenditure cost of a four-hour, utility scale battery in the U.K. will fall from £220,000/MW (€256,000) last year to £150,000/MW in 2025, and £120,000 in 2030.
Even if those predictions–described as “conservative” in the report–fail to materialize, the potential for clean energy facilities to reduce the U.K. carbon footprint, and to improve energy security are hard to question.
Carbon Tracker pointed out its proposed green generation facilities would drive 24 million tons fewer carbon emissions per year than the 14 GW of equivalent gas plants which are in the development pipeline. That would amount to 7% of the nation's emissions in 2019, in Europe's third largest power market. The thinktank added, the U.K. imported 54% of its natural gas, some 21% of which came in liquefied natural gas shipments.
Based on current estimated prices, Carbon Tracker stated each of the 17 combined-cycle gas turbines being planned in the U.K. would be more expensive than the equivalent fleet of clean power facilities in the same year it is planned to be commissioned, from this year to 2023. With the commissioning dates unknown for SSE Generation Ltd's two 1.1 GW facilities at Ferrybridge, in West Yorkshire, England, the report estimates both would already have been undercut by renewables and storage costs last year.
The picture for open-cycle, gas ‘peaker' plants–mobilized at short notice to supply peaks in demand–is less promising for renewables advocates, based on Carbon Tracker's estimates a 299 MW gas facility provided a levelized cost of energy of £200/MWh last year, versus £238 for the equivalent suite of renewables. However, that clean energy portfolio price will fall to £68/MWh by mid century, according to the study. That would mean, regarding the seven 299 MW gas peakers either commissioned last year or planned to 2024, the facilities would have a better business case for 12-16 years, with those developed in 2020 having the best longevity prospects, according to Carbon Tracker.
That said, the entire 14 GW new gas fleet planned in the U.K. up to 2030 still represents a £9 billion (€10.5 billion) stranded-asset risk, according to the report, even without factoring in government talk about the requirement to equip such facilities with carbon capture and storage and hydrogen and methane blending tech.
With the study also noting a government emphasis on scaling up offshore wind to drive down costs, and on securing more energy flexibility through access to more electricity interconnectors, the findings appear to make a compelling case for solar and other renewables against the conventional fossil fuel approach.
The government will only be able to realize the cost-saving potential of renewables, warns the report, if the pro-gas bias present in the capacity market–established to secure sufficient network peaker capacity–is turned into a level playing field for the participation of renewables, energy storage and demand-response.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/09/focus-on-temperature-to-reduce-lcoe-says-new-study/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 9, 2021","Focus on temperature to reduce LCOE, says new study","Temperature has long been an underappreciated characteristic in module performance, since the gains from installation in a hot, sunny location have been seen to outweigh the potential losses from elevated module temperature. However, much of the light that hits a PV module is lost as heat, and this heat can have an adverse effect on performance. “All solar cells generate heat, which can lower the electrical output and shorten the module lifetime,” says Lujia Xu, a postdoc researcher at Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). “Panels can regularly reach 60-65 degrees Celsius, but heat's impact on LCOE rarely receives much consideration.”
As power plant monitoring becomes more sophisticated, and further increases in conversion efficiency (PCE) at cell or module level seem harder to come by, the industry is now looking more closely at mitigating the effects of heat in PV modules as a route to improving performance.
Xu and a team of scientists at KAUST sought ways to better take the role of heat into account when measuring PV module performance, and even when calculating the economics of a solar power plant. The group developed a model that translates gain from reduced temperature to the equivalent in power conversion efficiency, which the group says offers a more comparable approach for those working on new cell and module technologies. “Whereas the temperature-dependent LCOE speaks to those working at system level, [our equivalent ratio] provides technologists working at the module and cell level with a more tangible metric,” states the group. “Once the cell PCE is approaching a practical upper limit… work on the control and mitigation of module temperature can be equally or even more significant than costly marginal gains in PCE.”
Calculations made by the group find that lowering module temperature by around three degrees Celsius could bring about the same improvement to levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) at project level as a 1% increase in module efficiency. Findings also show that reducing operating temperature can also greatly increase a module’s lifetime. “A 4 degrees Celsius decrease in module temperature would improve the module time to failure by more than 50 percent, and this improvement increases to over 100 percent with a 7 degrees Celsius reduction,” says Xu. Full details of the model can be found in the paper Heat generation and mitigation in silicon solar cells and modules, published in Joule.
Applying this model to various PV technologies and installation environments, the group found that the most practical way to lower module temperature is by selecting a site with plenty of wind, and a mounting system that enables heat transfer via convection.
In the future, module designs could start to better incorporate cooling strategies. Xu notes that the strong heat absorbance of EVA encapsulants is an area where improvements could be made and that tandem cell concepts, with the ability to absorb wider parts of the light spectrum, present a promising path to both reducing thermal losses and increasing efficiency. “Our results show that researchers should pay more attention to module temperature,” says KAUST associate professor Stefaan De Wolf. “Because crystalline silicon solar-cell efficiency is approaching the practical upper limit, it is timely to consider other ways to decrease the LCOE, which might be even more significant than further marginal gains in cell efficiency.”

Last week, several large scale green hydrogen projects were announced in Latin America, including a US$5.4bn green hydrogen plant under development by Australia-based hydrogen specialist Enegix Energy–a project that is expected to require 3.6 GW of wind and solar facilities and is currently the region's largest hydrogen project.
Other developments announced simultaneously in other Latin American countries last week confirm that the region may become a global hydrogen hub thanks to its considerable solar resources, land availability, and low project costs, which also means the nascent hydrogen sector in the region may immediately gain in scale.
Chilean power provider AES Gener, a unit of U.S.-based energy company AES, announced last week a memorandum of understanding to study the viability of the first large green-hydrogen-based ammonia project in the country. The project would require the installation of up to 850 MW of renewable energy capacity.
Referring to the project, the minister of energy of Chile, Juan Carlos Jobet, said the government will continue working to promote national and international investments and thus build new poles of progress in different regions.
The minister also revealed that there are currently more than 40 projects related to green hydrogen in Chile: “When we launched the National Green Hydrogen Strategy last November, we had 20 projects to develop,” he further explained. “In just three months, we have already doubled that number and we already have more than 40 projects to produce or consume green hydrogen in Chile.”
The national strategy will contribute, according to government estimates, to the creation of some 100,000 jobs and $200 billion in investment over the next 20 years. “The numbers support us, we are the country with the best capacities to be the cheapest producer in the world by 2030,” Jobet stated.  According to the ministry, Jobet has led rounds with investors from Germany, Australia, Canada, China, the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom, which have been attended by more than 200 companies, investment banks, and international entities interested in investment opportunities. 
Mexico's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for a 58 MW solar power plant planned for green hydrogen generation.
The project, submitted by Mexican company Delicias Solar, SA de CV, is expected to rely on around 140,000 solar modules and power a 75 MW hydrogen power plant with an estimated annual production of 4,425 tons.
The project includes the construction of a substation, power line transmission line and internal roads for a total area of 166.22ha, of which 121.75ha correspond to the photovoltaic plant, 32.86ha to the interconnection lines (LT1 and LT2), 6.57ha to the facilities of the green hydrogen generation plant and 5.04ha to the access roads located in the municipality of San Luis de la Paz, Guanajuato.
In recent months, the North American country saw the launch of the new industry body Mexican Hydrogen Association, whose founder is Israel Hurtado, who has previously been the general secretary of the Mexican PV association, Asolmex. According to him, the country needs a national strategy for hydrogen.
“The strategy must go hand in hand with the government, private initiative, industry, and academic institutions,” he told pv magazine. “In Germany, France, Australia, and Chile, there are considerable advances, and this is where we must go, and I don't know if this is going to take us six months, a year, or three years, but towards that point we must work.”
Uruguay will receive $10 million from the United Nations Joint Fund for Sustainable Development Goals, to develop green hydrogen projects.
The funds were secured by the country's Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining (MIEM), through its National Energy Directorate (DNE) and will be complemented with financing from other entities—among them, multilateral organizations that have already pledged their collaboration—to reach a total amount of $70 million.
The money will be utilized, among other things, for the Verne Project–a pilot project for the electrification of transport through green hydrogen production–being developed by Uruguay's National Administration of Fuels, Alcohols and Portland, Uruguayan power utility UTE, and the MIEM itself.
The project foresees the setting up of green hydrogen production using a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer with a capacity of 500 kg/day and a charging station in Montevideo.
The three entities also received financial support from the Inter-American Development Bank and the German Corporation for International Cooperation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/09/new-power-electronic-device-to-manage-surplus-solar-power-part-ii/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"MARCH 9, 2021",New power electronic device to manage surplus solar power–Part II,"From pv magazine Spain
pv magazine reported last week on a new power electronics technology that is claimed to be able to combine different storage technologies in a single electronic-based board interface. This week, we will reveal the details of the first pilot projects that were carried out with the new technology, which was developed through the EU-funded project ‘renewable penetration levered by efficient low-voltage distribution grids (RESOLvD).
The power electronics device (PED) has a module structure and a power of 75 kVA. It can integrate a heterogeneous array of different kinds of batteries and provide services related to the improvement of energy quality and the ability to integrate renewable energy in a low-voltage system.
The project coordinator, Luisa Candido, explained that two types of batteries were used–a 30 kWh lithium-ion battery based on lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and a 14 kWh lead-acid package. The hybridization of the batteries is aimed at maximizing the technical and economic performance of the devices and, at the same time, providing various services to the final users. “The main challenge is how to change from a traditional network to a more powerful network,” said researcher Ramón Gallart Fernández. “The pilot has low-voltage switches which work as a railroad switch to ‘move' electricity according to the needs of consumers.”
In the proposed configuration, the distribution system operator (DSO) repeatedly sends the PED a schedule of the operation for the next 24 hours, depending on the services it has to provide. This information is received by the management system of the PED, which is called Intelligent Local Energy Manager (ILEM), and more specifically by one of its modules, the power sharing algorithm (PSA).
The PSA is a non-linear model that solves the optimization problem based on the state, technical performance, and degradation mechanisms of each type of battery and distributes the energy demand among them. “Ultimately, it allows each type of battery to be operated synergistically, towards a minimum overall cost and a maximum battery efficiency,” the researchers explained.
The proposed system is claimed to be able to increase power quality through the reduction of phase imbalances and current harmonics, smoothing of rapid fluctuations in power flows, and the compensation of reactive currents. For these services, little or no active power exchange with the grid is needed from the batteries, which must provide a short-term response and high cyclability.
Other services, such as equilibrium–or temporary displacement of renewable generation based on the technical limitations of the network, electricity prices, and consumer habits–require seamlessly exchanging the energy stored in batteries every hour. For these services, the charge of lithium-ion batteries can be reduced by also taking advantage of the cheaper lead-based ones.
Specific scenarios and use cases were considered for the L'Esquirol grid. First of all, the two radial lines were connected by a link cable that allows the creation of a ring shape. To remotely control and reconfigure the moving edges of the network, three fuses were replaced by motorized switches.
To analyze the energy exchanged between the batteries and the grid, and to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the technology, smart meters were installed at the beginning of the two feeders and the PED at the common coupling point. The PED and batteries, along with the measurement equipment, are the main hardware of the project. The former were developed and provided by the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and installed on the SS-B substation. 
The PED and the lead and lithium-ion batteries were installed on the second floor. The remote terminal unit (RTU) is located on the ground floor so that it is also easier for the user to control the entire system. To support and distribute its weight on the ground, a metal support was built under the storage systems.
The batteries and the battery management system are electrically connected to the PED by a cable and the link from the low voltage switchgear and a feeder pass through the ground. The measurement components–phase measurement units (PMUs) and power quality meters (PQM)–were provided by Slovenian technology company Comsensus and were installed on both the low voltage and medium voltage side. These analyze the waveform of the energy as well as the voltage and current measurement inputs. The voltage and current ranges allowed by these devices require the installation of voltage and current transformers, as well as Rowosky sensors. 
All these technologies are used to evaluate the impact of the project on the distribution network, mainly with low voltage feeders of 400 V. A series of tests were carried out in the area, related to efficiency, planning, and quality of service.
To test the efficiency of the technology in the demonstrator, the improvement of the energy profile in the SS-A substation and the reduction of power losses due to a better quality of the waveform will be measured. Measurements both before and after the PED should quantify the improvement in energy management. As for the quality of the service, improvements of the voltage profiles, the prevention of critical events, and the operation in island mode will also be studied. For this, the PED and the batteries installed in the substation will be crucial to smooth voltage variations by exchanging energy with the grid, increasing or decreasing the voltage to compensate for the variation in consumption or generation.

It has secured a 20-year tariff for the Haisuke floating solar plant under Japan's feed-in tariff scheme. It is the third floating PV project build by Sumitomo Mitsui Construction in Japan to date.
It built the project with its PuKaTTo proprietary floating technology, which it started to develop in 2015. “Including the Haisuke project, we have provided our floating solutions for seven projects in Japan and five abroad,” Sumitomo Mitsui Construction said.
It claims that the technology is easy to deploy and highly durable. The 9.7 kg floats are made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and feature UV-absorbing agents. They also include components for mooring cables. The floats are connected via 2 kg bridges that also serve as walkways for construction and maintenance workers. The floats have wide openings at the center to help cool off the PV panels by using the water.
The company mounted upright stands on each float to produce a 10-degree angle for the PV panels. It placed a scaffolding float on the outer part of the float as a scaffold for the installation and maintenance of the mooring rope. It also used binding bands to fix the floats together and bolts to attach the solar panels brackets to the floats. The company said the use of the binding bands enables the deployment of a floating array within a matter of hours.
The technology can host 60-cell and 72-cell modules from different manufacturers. The floats come with a 10-year warranty for both float and binding bands.

The integrated strategy includes 24-hour ahead forecasts to improve profit generation from batteries, a Monte Carlo analysis considering battery costs, and different electricity profiles for different climatic zones such as South Africa, Sweden, and Italy. “The main novelty of this study relies on the parametric investigation of the profitability of li-ion batteries in commercial buildings, by modeling the savings from both peak shaving, price arbitrage, and PV self-consumption, when different sensitive parameters are considered,” the scientists explained.
Three locations were considered in the study: Stockholm, with an annual global horizontal irradiation of 961 kWh/m2; Rome, with 1,640 kWh/m2; and Johannesburg, with 2,020 kWh/m2. For each city, the electricity prices correspond to the commercial loads, and the same building–with the same characteristics–was taken into account for the three locations.
In their simulations, the academics used a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to provide a better control, compared to a simple on/off-type control. This device is commonly utilized in industrial control applications to regulate temperature, flow, pressure, speed, and other process variables. The simulated PV system had a capacity of 150 kW and was sized to avoid the overproduction of solar power. The battery was designed to have a capacity of 50 kW/200 kWh. The battery price was assumed to be $500/kWh.
The sensitivity analysis considered different parameters including electricity cost components, the capacity of the PV system, the battery capacity, the targeted peak to be shaved, the battery upfront cost, the discount rate, tax rate, and the escalation rate of the electricity price. The operational strategy was implemented through the analysis of a year's worth of hourly PV production and load profiles, which usually showed that solar power generation was higher than consumption from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. for any PV installation that was slightly oversized.
The simulations showed, according to the scientists, that the proposed hybrid operational strategy was able to considerably reduce power peaks while producing significant annual savings. However, they specified that with the assumed battery price, the net present value of the storage system does not lead to a profitable investment. “Positive net present values can be achieved with optimal design of PV and battery capacities for specific battery prices below $250/kWh,” they further explained.
The novel strategy, presented in the paper Li-ion batteries for peak shaving, price arbitrage, and photovoltaic self-consumption in commercial buildings: A Monte Carlo Analysis, published in Energy Conversion and Management, is claimed to be suitable to all markets where no incentives for distributed storage are granted.
The research team comprises scientists from Sweden's Mälardalen University and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Italy's Università Telematica eCampus, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, in the United States.

Rosatom did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, but said that the agreement includes the construction of a 2 GWh storage system manufacturing facility at an unspecified location in Russia by 2030.
“The start of the first stage of production is scheduled for 2025,” Rosatom said. “Llithium-ion batteries made in Russia will be applied in electric vehicles (buses and cars), special equipment and in power grids.”
The new factory is expected to increase Rosatom's production capacity and facilitate access to foreign markets.
“In addition, local manufacturing content in Russia means not just new technologies and products, but also new jobs,” said Natalia Nikipelova, president of TVEL Fuel Company (TVEL), which Rosatom set up in October to enter the energy storage business.
A Rosatom spokesperson told pv magazine at the time of TVEL's establishment that the group's enterprises have been developing energy storage products since 2018. “But now a special-purpose company is finally incorporated to develop this business systematically,” the spokesperson explained. 
TVEL already produces module-type lithium-ion traction batteries for electric vehicles, as well as energy storage systems for emergency power supplies, renewable energy resources, and the smoothing of load demand.

TNG’s Mount Peake Vanadium-Titanium-Iron Project (Mount Peake Project) in Australia's Northern Territory – the world’s most advanced vanadium mine – secured “major project status” from the federal government on Monday. 
The project spans two separate sites, including a mine located 235 km north of Alice Springs and a processing facility in Darwin’s investment priority area, the Middle Arm Precinct. Perth-based TNG describes the project as a “world class multi-commodity resource with in-country value adding.”
The project is set to annually produce around 6,000 tons of vanadium pentoxide to be used for vanadium redox flow batteries and steel strengthening, as well as massive quantities of iron oxide and titanium pigment. This will be done through TNG’s patented TIVAN process, which the company says allows it to “overcome limitations of the conventional processing.”
Last year, Perth-based TNG set up its own green-focused subsidiary, TNG Energy. The company is now developing applications for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). But TNG is not the only Australian company vertically integrating its vanadium-based projects. In 2016, Australian Vanadium set up a subsidiary, VSUN Energy, to drive market demand for VRFBs and help raise capital needed to open its Western Australian vanadium mine.
“It takes a lot of time to become an overnight success,” VSUN’s business development manager, Samantha McGahan, told pv magazine Australia.
Yet with its flagship project recognised for being strategic significant by both the federal government and the Northern Territory authorities, TNG’s Mount Peake Project is clearly leading Australia’s vanadium crusade.
The company is also keen to jump aboard the country’s green hydrogen craze. In September, TNG said it would partner with German strategic engineering company SMS Group to develop carbon-neutral technology and produce green hydrogen. The agreement is part of the company’s bid to optimize its Mount Peake Project, TNG said at the time.

Rio Tinto plans to spend nearly $3 million on a facility to recover tellurium, a critical mineral used in solar panels, from its Kennecott mine near Salt Lake City, Utah. And First Solar said it is now in talks with the mining group to procure the mineral for cadmium telluride (CadTel) semiconductor processing in the United States.
The mineral is a byproduct of copper smelting. Rio Tinto said it expects to start production in the fourth quarter. Its Utah plant will be able to produce around 20 tons of tellurium per year.
First Solar uses a layer of CadTel semiconductor that is 3% the thickness of a human hair. It said that CadTel is efficient, cost-competitive, and fast to produce, helping it to make its modules in around 4.5 hours. First Solar said that CadTel technology has a carbon footprint that is around 2.5 times lower than crystalline silicon panels.
First Solar sources its CadTel from suppliers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It declined to disclose quantities or names of suppliers, but said that Rio Tinto’s supply, if contracted, “could add to existing sources.”
For its part, Rio Tinto is looking to extract more from each rock it mines in order to reduce waste and meet demand for critical minerals.
Tellurium also can be used as an additive to steel and copper to improve machinability, making these metals easier to cut, as well as added to lead to increase resistance to sulfuric acid, vibration, and fatigue.
Kennecott’s smelting process in Utah also recovers gold, silver, lead carbonate, platinum, palladium, and selenium. Elsewhere, Rio Tinto is investing in facilities to extract battery-grade lithium from waste rock at its Boron, California, mine site, and scandium oxide from waste streams at a complex in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec.
