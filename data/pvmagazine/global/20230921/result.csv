The installations will feature battery storage, with generating capacities of 128 MW and 75 MW.
“The projects will have up to December 2023 to finalize conditions precedent to conclude financial close and start with project construction,” the DoE said in a statement. “The new generation capacity is expected to be online from 2025 onwards.”
The South African authorities selected the two projects in a 2 GW technology-neutral tender concluded in March 2021 under the RMIPPPP. This initiative was launched in response to the chronic short-term electricity supply gap affecting the country and its mining sector.
The DoE said that only five of the selected projects have secured project agreements so far.
One of the two projects now approved by the authorities is the Oya Energy Hybrid Facility, which will be built in Matjiesfontein, Western Cape. The project’s main developer and equity shareholders are GDF International SA, G7 Power, Meadows Oya Energy and Perpetua RMI4P Oya.
The second scheme, the Umoyilanga Energy Facility, will be located in Avondale, Northern Cape, and Dassiesridge, Eastern Cape. It is owned and managed by France-based EDF and German investment firm Perpetua Holdings.
The agreements include power purchase agreements (PPA). The sale of the contracts has been regulated by the respective independent power producers (IPP) and Eskom, South Africa’s state-owned electricity supplier.
In 2021, the South African government announced the preferred bidders to secure around 60% of the awarded capacity of the RMIPPPP, with several renewable energy projects including solar, wind and storage. The bidding prices ranged from ZAR 1,468 ($77.40)/MWh to ZAR 1,885/MWh, with the average price at ZAR 1,575/MWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/21/europe-is-still-in-the-hydrogen-race-says-bureau-veritas/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023","‘Europe is still in the hydrogen race,’ says Bureau Veritas","Laurence Boisramé, global director of hydrogen at Bureau Veritas, says that Europe is developing a set of measures that could increase its industrial and commercial weight in the global hydrogen market.
Despite some delays in production, Europe is reportedly “still in the race.” Boisramé explained that a clear policy push is leading to significant advancements in the European Union and the United States. She noted European measures such as RePowerEU and the Fit for 55 package, but also the definition of “clean hydrogen” and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the United States. 
“After the IRA announcement, some players have questioned the industrial and commercial leadership of Europe. Latest initiatives such as H2Global and more recently announced European Hydrogen Bank are instrumental to the development of production and commercialization of green hydrogen and derivatives,” Boisramé told pv magazine. “On the legal side, [the non-biological origin] definition is also a major milestone. Despite one can criticize the outcome, it provides the long-standing expected visibility.”
She said the question is whether the European definition of renewable hydrogen and derivatives, reported in the delegated act on renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO), can become a global reference.
Boisramé said that standardization, transparency, clear rules and definitions are essential to increasing trust in the energy sector, even more so in the hydrogen market. 
“Trust will come with real transparency, where production projects will be assessed by independent third parties providing assurance that they comply with the rules. This is where certification comes in,” she added, in reference to independent third parties such as certification bodies. 
Mutual recognition will be necessary globally to create a commoditized market and allow cross-border trading. Alternatively, countries, companies, and other stakeholders have to align on standard rules at the multinational level. 
“This is promoted by several global organizations such as AIE, IRENA, IPHE, and the Hydrogen Council, to name a few,” she said. “But getting to a global consensus will take time, at least a few years.”
Role of certification
The role of certification is to ensure conformity to a standard, which can be a global standard, a regulatory regime, or a voluntary scheme. 
“Currently, there is no global standard or regulatory certification scheme applying to hydrogen production worldwide,” said Boisramé. “Some countries are developing rules and certification schemes applying to domestic production, especially to grant public support.”
Bureau Veritas has developed a voluntary certification scheme to ensure that hydrogen production is safe, sustainable, and from renewable inputs, with a maximum carbon footprint of 2 kg CO2eq per kilogram of hydrogen. 
“This certification scheme addresses production assets worldwide with a single methodology applying globally. Recently, the certification has been extended to ammonia produced from the conversion of renewable hydrogen,” she said, explaining that the schemes should accelerate permitting and acceptability, while fostering project bankability.
Bureau Veritas is also performing audits and inspections of suppliers to assess the supply chain's performance and resilience, decreasing the risks connected to the projects. 
Boisramé noted the ongoing increase in the number of projects announced across different regions, fostered by government strategies and incentives schemes. 
“However, we are far from achieving a mature industry, with a lot to be put in place such as global standards, same definitions, and rules as the basis for international trade of hydrogen and derivatives,” she said. 
Boisramé also pointed to an acceleration in the number of production projects in the United States and China, despite delays in the definition of incentives supporting the demand side for green or decarbonized hydrogen. 
“Other countries such as Australia, India, Spain, and the United Kingdom can see an acceleration in the number of production projects as well,” Boisramé said. “In terms of import infrastructure, Europe is the more advanced, especially northwestern Europe with import hubs (such as Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Antwerp, and Hamburg) already involved in concrete development, bilateral agreements, investing in terminals evolution to anticipate hydrogen and derivatives offloading, storage and handling.”

In a position paper, the association outlined a due diligence program that should help PV manufacturers avoid exposure to forced labor in their supply chains.
“The EU must adopt robust legislation as soon as possible to prohibit the sale of products made with forced labor,” the trade body said, taking a clear position on the matter for the first time.
The association said it urged all its members cut their ties with suppliers and sub-suppliers from the Xinjiang region in China, where forced labor is allegedly being implemented.
“In awaiting the legislation, the EU must act urgently to prevent products made with forced labour from entering the European market,” it said.
The ESMC also proposed the creation of a database for over risk-areas and products, the implementation of a reversed burden of proof mechanism, and the introduction of due diligence obligations, among other things.
The report does not provide new evidence that forced labor is currently being used in the PV industry in the Xinjiang region. The association said its sources are reports from independent research institutes and international organizations, but cited exclusively the most recent report from Sheffield Hallam University.
The ESMC is an industry association that was created in 2019 with the aim of promoting the interests of the European PV manufacturing sector.
In the September issue of pv magazine, we examine booming solar markets in Brazil and Mexico; investigate whether TOPCon modules really are more susceptible to degradation than PERC products; attempt to unravel how US solar manufacturers can qualify for domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act; and look at how homeowners can achieve the residential solar, battery, and EV dream.

In the “Discussion paper: Solution approaches for the grid integration of solar power,” the scientists explained that expanding the European grid, for example, would not solve the problem of having too much solar power injected into grids during load peaks, which may not be absorbed by the grid nor sold to consumers, due to the lack of enough demand.
“If we want to supply Italy with wind electricity from the North Sea, of course, we must increase the transmission capacity,” the research's lead author, Christof Bucher, told pv magazine. “However, at least in Switzerland, a lot of costs are associated with the distribution grid expansion to host more PV, which we think is the wrong way to push grid integration.”
The research group proposed a series of alternative measures that consumers and grid operators could employ to avoid grid expansion. They said a general incentive approach to grid-serving behavior should be encouraged.
For example, they claim that priority dispatch for PV may be avoided during peak times, thus forcing the PV system operators to use surplus solar power for batteries or electric vehicle (EV) charging. Priority dispatch has been an important tool to facilitate renewable energy integration into power systems in the past. It consists of prioritizing the injection of power produced by clean energy sources while offsetting conventional power production. 
“There should be no right to feed load peaks into the grid when they are not relevant in terms of energy but are challenging and uneconomical for the overall system,” the paper notes.
Increasing self-consumption by PV system owners should also be encouraged. “However, one thing technical is missing: Self-consumption does not necessarily reduce stress on the grid – that’s why many grid operators don’t agree with current regulations, which throughout Europe typically support self-consumption,” Bucher stated. “If you do self-consumption for 95% of the time, but one week per year you are on vacation and do not do any self-consumption, then the whole grid infrastructure must be dimensioned for this one week. It would be very easy to avoid this situation, but currently there are no incentives to do so.”
The researchers also warned that PV curtailment will be unavoidable in the future. “Curtailment should be used, but not too much,” Bucher explained. “Anyway, it should be an economic decision of every individual PV system operator. My guess is that today, 50% of distribution grid reinforcement investments are spent for maybe 10% of the additional solar energy. This is far from the economic optimum.”
According to him, encouraging a free market vision and reducing subsidies may be only part of the solution. “I guess it will not be sufficient as a free market would not necessarily give a price to the infrastructure,” he added. “Therefore, our short-term vision is rather a shift from kilowatt-only based feed-in tariffs (FIT) towards higher tariffs for systems that avoid injecting power peaks. As system operators don’t.”
He also explained that, by not injecting 50% of power, most systems lose less than 5-10% of energy, with self-consumption being taken into account. “If PV system operators are offered a 20% higher FIT for this sort of system control, they should take this offer,” he said. “And, of course, this could be implemented cost-neutral, with those who inject more power getting a lower FIT.
“In the view of the authors, it is more expedient to invest in the decentralized handling of power peaks than in the expansion of the distribution grid,” the paper concludes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/21/p-type-solar-products-may-be-phased-out-by-2026-as-n-type-tech-rapidly-expands/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",P-type solar products may be phased out by 2026 as n-type tech ‘rapidly’ expands,"Analysis and data by Taiwan-based industry analysts TrendForce show that the superior conversion efficiencies of n-type cells have led to “rapidly” expanded capabilities in 2022 and primed the market for competition. This has led TrendForce analysts to believe p-type PERC capacities could be phased out by 2025.
“Currently, PERC cell technology for producing p-type cells stands as the market’s mainstay,” the report said. “However, with the step-by-step realization of large-scale n-type cell capacities, there looms a risk that a substantial part of PERC cell technology capacities may be phased out within the forthcoming two to three years.”
Analysis suggests that as n-type silicon incrementally comes online there might be a sporadic shortage of high-quality silicon materials and wafers fit for n-type cells. “This could further establish a noticeable price disparity between n-type silicon wafers, and their p-type counterparts,” the report said, which may lead to a noticeable price difference between the two technologies.
Polysilicon supply poses its own problems. Although supply remains “abundant,” TrendForce warned that if production continues to surge for n-type cells there could be an oversupply of p-type silicon causing its price to drop faster.
TrendForce predicts supply could reach 68.8% capacity by the end of 2023 and 40.3% capacity by the end of 2025. “By 2023’s end, it is projected that the total production capacity of polysilicon will reach 2.072 million MT,” the report said. “The actual output of silicon materials is expected to be 1.483 million MT, sufficient to support over 600 GW of solar panel consumption (given a silicon consumption rate of 0.245 MT/GW). This aligns with an annual installation demand of approximately 370-390 GW, indicating a clear oversupply of silicon.”
TrendForce said demand and limited output may lead to periodic shortages of n-type silicon, which would level out prices.
Silicon wafer production capacity is expected to reach roughly 921.6 GW by the end of the year, the report said, with silicon wafer manufacturers reacting to the n-type cell scramble by “rapidly” transforming operations and scaling up output. This may once again impact p-type cells.
“With the inclusion of rectangular silicon wafers occupying a portion of this capacity, certain dimensions of p-type wafers might experience short-term supply shortages, potentially failing to meet immediate demands,” TrendForce said. “If the n-type cell rollout falls short of expectations, there remains a risk of n-type wafer oversupply.”
But as n-cell capacity deployment experiences delays, PERC tech will most likely remain the victorious technology for 2023, the report said. Total wafer capacity primarily attributed to n-type TOPCon cell technology is expected to reach 1,172 GW by the end of the year – a 106% increase since 2022, the report said.
“However, TrendForce has observed some delays in the actual deployment of n-type cell capacity. Given the existing price difference between n-p type wafers, PERC technology is anticipated to retain its leading position in the market this year, although the penetration rate of TOPCon cells will accelerate.”

The most extreme situation in European electricity markets this year occurred during the first weekend of July. Europe saw, for most of the day, negative wholesale prices across the whole continent, from Finland to Spain.
Paradoxically, consumers in countries such as Ireland and Denmark are currently dealing with record-high retail electricity prices that are more than five times the average cost of wholesale power. The German government is also considering subsidies to shield its heavy industry from international competition and escalating energy prices. All of these circumstances show an energy system in need of serious reform. Across Europe, the electricity price that end consumers pay comprises the cost of generation, grid expense, government levies, charges, and taxes such as VAT. The approach to taxes and levies varies, with nations including Malta, Bulgaria, and Hungary imposing lighter taxes on electricity than, say, Denmark, which penalizes heavy usage.
The treatment of commercial customers and heavy industry also varies by nation with Germany being highly supportive of manufacturers while Ireland, for instance, is not. All retail electricity prices contain two common elements, however: the cost of electricity generation and maintaining grids.
Taking Germany as an example, the average retail consumer paid more than €0.46/kWh ($0.50) in the first half of the year. Those rates were nearly 50% more than what the consumer paid in 2021 and were largely a reflection of the Russian gas crisis. Interestingly, wholesale prices have now come back to 2021 levels of around €0.07/kWh to €0.10/kWh, which begs the question: Why is the German consumer still paying €0.24/kWh just for the generation component of their electricity?
 

The answer to that question is that they are doing so because many German utilities hedged their power purchases at the top of the market last year, when extreme gas prices and problems in French nuclear saw European power prices hit all-time highs. The good news is that the customer will gain the benefit of the current lower wholesale prices, going forward.
The same cannot be said for the grid costs which make up the other major component of electricity bills. Grid expenses across Europe, as a rule, are lower than generation costs, at an average of €0.06/kWh in the EU. In the first half of 2023, German grid costs were €0.095/kWh, putting them at the very upper end of European costs.
Grid expenses have surged by 50% over the last decade. The substantial investments required to connect new renewables plants and transport their energy, largely account for this trend. Complicating matters, system stability costs are rising exponentially, especially when systems are overloaded or grid bottlenecks occur.
Europe currently has an installed renewable energy fleet of 690 GW of generation capacity, comprising 255 GW of hydropower, 225 GW of wind, and 209 GW of solar. On a good weather day, that is enough to meet the electricity needs of the whole of the market. The good news is that there are now many days when 50% or more of Europe’s power needs are met by renewables. If you add nuclear to the mix, there are many days when 75% of Europe’s power needs are met by low-CO2 electricity. This is particularly the case at weekends, when peak European demand is around 320 GW and there is lots of solar electricity in the system.
This large volume of renewable energy means that the weather now determines the power price. When there is an abundance of sun, wind, and rain – as there was during the first weekend of July – power prices tumble. When there is not a lot of sun or wind, power prices increase. All generators have to monitor the weather so that they can optimize their power generation assets.
The best generation facilities are those that can be easily ramped up and down, like the many types of modern natural-gas plants. When required, the ones that are ramped down first are those with fuel costs, such as coal and gas, especially if a generator believes that they will not be able to recover the costs of fueling their power station with the price they receive on the power market.

The most difficult generation assets to manage are the “baseload” power plants, which are designed for continuous operation. Many old nuclear, coal, and gas power stations are baseload sites, along with most run-of-the-river hydro plants. They are very difficult to ramp up or down, let alone switch off, which is why, oftentimes, they accept very low power prices or even negative prices in the market.
Going forward, the economics of these baseload plants are going to be severely tested as the frequency of negative electricity prices and volatility is only going to rise, fueled by the addition of 70 GW of solar and wind power this year alone, with a similar amount expected next year and the year after. This also poses a financial challenge for new clean energy generation, as renewables plants could potentially also earn zero income during sunny or windy days.
Rapid decarbonization requires deep electrification of the energy system, starting with transport, then heating, and, eventually, cooling. Major organizations such as the International Energy Agency believe that this is the best route to net zero – not only in terms of economics, but also in order to achieve the goal at a sufficiently fast pace.
The way forward is to add sufficient renewables and nuclear generation to the system to meet growing demand for electricity and to ensure that the electricity mix is clean. This approach has the added benefit of lowering overall energy demand, as the whole process of creating, transporting, and using electricity is much more efficient than burning fossil fuels.
Despite deep electrification being generally recognized as the best way to decarbonize, most countries in Europe still have customer incentive structures in place which are skewed towards the fossil fuel alternatives. In response, governments are finally putting in place subsidies to incentivize customers to buy electric vehicles and install heat pumps.
However, such policies fail to deal with the major distortion present in the market, represented by the fact that it is still cheaper, throughout most of Europe, to fuel a car with diesel than with electricity, or to heat a house with natural gas, as opposed to a heat pump. The main reason for this is tax policies which favor fossil fuels over electricity.
Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach and will be critical if we are going to decarbonize.
There are six initial policy steps European governments could action:
Without such reforms, the road to decarbonization will be exceedingly rocky. If these measures are implemented, however, they could enable quick, effective, and economical decarbonization.

(Ampace) unveiled new battery cell tech at the RE+ trade show last week in Las Vegas. It said the new Kunlun battery cell is suitable for storage systems in rooftop PV projects.
“The long-cycle cells hold significant value for global commercial & industrial and residential energy storage systems,” Ampace said. “They empower commercial & industrial energy storage users in effectively keeping photovoltaic and energy storage systems at the same pace and to enable greater benefits for residential energy users in VPP mode, overcoming the conventional battery lifespan limitations.”
It said that the battery tech can ensure a lifetime of 15,000 cycles, or 20 years. It also said that the new product can maintain an 80% state of health rate after 15,000 cycles and more than 70% after 20,000 cycles.
The cell measures 22.5 mm x 122.7 mm x 360.5 mm and weighs around 1.8 kg. Its maximum capacity is 100 Ah and the nominal voltage is 3.2 V.
“It effectively addresses the concern of customers who would otherwise need to replace batteries during the operational phase of solar storage projects, resulting in a notable 30% reduction in overall lifecycle electricity costs,” Ampace said, noting that the new battery tech can effectively match the lifespan of solar storage and handle multiple daily cycles.

The company said it has already incorporated the module into an electric sports utility vehicle produced by an undisclosed US-based manufacturer.
“The system integrates 120 passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cells and has a power output of 300 W,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, adding that the US automaker calculated an additional range of up to 3,000 kilometers per year, depending on environmental conditions and the battery management system used.
The encapsulated PERC cells are laminated between two safety glass (VSG) panels in a two-part system, a front panel and a rear panel.  The PV units are rigid, they neither roll nor fold. They feature a top-loading outer slider mechanism, a proprietary Webasto Stockdorf design, which raises the front panel part a few millimeters and then slides it over the rear part, according to Webasto’s spokesperson.
The front sliding panel weighs 21 kg, measures 1.2 m2, and has blue decorative detailing. The rear panel is 0.9 m2 and has the same blue decorative detail. A frame supporting the weight of the front and rear panels integrates the unit’s motor.  The spokesperson added that Webasto has incorporated a tow cable design to ensure solar energy harvesting even when the panel is in the open position.
The complete sunroof assembly, including panels, tow cables, drive cable, and motor, is assembled and quality-checked at the Webasto Velky Meder facility in Slovakia, ready for integration in the factory at the stage where welded and fixed automobile frames are ready for installation of parts, such as engine, doors, and fenders.
“This solar sunroof option is an original equipment offering and is seamlessly integrated directly by the manufacturer, eliminating the need for aftermarket solutions,” the spokesperson said.
VIPV systems like this can deliver power to the high-voltage battery that drives motors or to onboard sub-systems, such as air conditioning. “The utility factor is by no means the only benefit. The appealing design of a modern solar roof from Webasto is a statement of sustainability, also demonstrating the owner’s environmental awareness,” said Jan Henning Mehlfeldt, responsible for the global roof business at Webasto.

Q Energy has started building the “Les Ilots Blandin” floating solar plant in Haute-Marne, France. The renewable energy producer said that it will be the largest floating PV project in Europe upon completion.
It was originally supposed to have a capacity of 66 MW, but Q Energy said it was later able to expand this to 74.3 MW, thanks to the design of the floats.
The construction process is expected to last approximately 18 months, with commissioning scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. A consortium of companies made up of Solutions 30 Sud-Ouest, Ciel et Terre International, and Perpetum Energy will build and operate the plant.
Q Energy secured the project in a tender by CRE, the French energy regulator, in August 2022. It will be built on an artificial lake at a former gravel pit owned by the Etablissements Blandin.
Q Energy will deploy 134,649 modules across six islands anchored on the banks or at the bottom of the flooded pits. The company said that the floating structures are manufactured in France an the materials used are designed to minimize the impact on the environment.
Since 2018, Q Energy France, headquartered in Avignon, has been developing floating solar projects in areas where former quarries existed. It currently has a floating PV development pipeline of more than 300 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/21/tackling-load-shedding-in-south-africa-one-home-at-time/,"SPONSORED,SOUTH AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023","Tackling load shedding in South Africa, one home at time","CEO David Neale discusses his company’s partnership, the challenges and opportunities for residential solar energy in South Africa, and how Metrowatt is helping to relieve load shedding in the country.
Can you tell us about the current state of energy production and supply in South Africa?
Load shedding to reduce the total load on the national energy grid has been a reality in South Africa since 2007. Much of the capacity constraints are due to old and failing infrastructure. Recently South Africa had less than 50% of its traditional coal power production available, which equates to about 20,000 MW.  South Africa’s peak electricity demand exceeds 30,000 MW of electricity.
In addition to insufficient production capacity, infrastructure failures and distribution challenges have become prevalent at the local municipal level, resulting in a significant number of unplanned outages.
Initially load shedding occurred once every few weeks. Today it is much more serious, with power outages occurring as much as three to four times a day, for between 2.5 to 4.5 hours at a time. In the event of an area outage, the electricity can be off for a few days at a time. These challenges have led customers, specifically residential homeowners, to seek alternative backup solutions, that include solar, battery and inverters, to provide power security.
How does Metrowatt help solve load shedding in South Africa?
We see a big need for residential customers to have access to backup solutions. However, this can come with a significant capital cost investment. An entry-level solar and battery system for a family home can cost from ZAR 100,000 ($5,170) to ZAR 130,000 ($6,500). Understandably, customers may be hesitant to make such a commitment due to concerns about the system’s suitability, quality, and the potential for incorrect installation and configuration.
Recognizing these concerns, Metrowatt has partnered with Huawei to deliver rental solar solutions for our customers. This removes the initial capital outlay risk for customers, and smoothes the path to an integrated solar, inverter and battery system for the homeowner, which includes support and regular monthly payments.
What's the installation process?
Customers can either purchase the system outright or rent it. For the rental option, we charge an up-front solar-ready installation fee of ZAR 10,000 ($500), as standard for Huawei products with solar panels. After that, the homeowner pays a fixed monthly rental from as little as ZAR 1,650 (+-$90). Customers renting a system from Metrowatt receive full technical support.  We also help manage and optimize the system for clients so that they get maximum savings and output.
The FusionSolar system is an integrated system.  Batteries, inverters, and panels with optimizers can all communicate with each other. This enables us to manage and support the entire installation. We also advise clients about battery and inverter settings, as well as panel usage so that they can get optimal performance from the system during different seasons.
What challenges does Metrowatt face while installing the system?
The main challenge is that every house is unique in its design and its energy usage. This is why FusionSolar products are great products for Metrowatt. The slimline, sleek, cosmetic design, and built-in safety mechanisms make it possible to install a complete solar system within the customer’s living space. When space is confined, you can put these systems into places no other systems can go.
In which locations have you currently installed the FusionSolar products?
Most Metrowatt customers are based in Johannesburg, Gauteng, with the second largest market being in Cape Town, Western Cape province. We see growing demand in Cape Town and other coastal cities for the installation of solar and batteries in high-density buildings. We have noticed, especially in apartment buildings with multi-dwelling units, that the Huawei iSitePower-M is a great solution for customers given its compact size. The Power-M can easily power apartments and three- or four-bedroom homes.

What is your current installation capacity?
We can install 100 homes per month. A typical home gets installed with about 4-5 kWp of solar panels. That's about 500 kWp per month that we are adding to the system. We aim to add 500 homes a month (2.5 MWp a month) by the end of 2023.
What is the cost of renting a solar solution for backup power?
A typical household in South Africa spends between ZAR 1,500 and ZAR 3,000 per month, depending on the household size. We pay around ZAR 2.50 to ZAR 3 per kilowatt-hour for electricity.
Will you be installing the system in commercial businesses?
We want to focus on residential homes because there isn't enough attention paid to this market. There is a big gap in the load management side in homes and because of the distribution challenges in South Africa, there will be a lot more opportunities in the long term.
What is the future for Metrowatt and FusionSolar?
We have been working closely with Huawei in the research and development of backup solutions. Going forward, we see a huge opportunity to assist customers with load management.  As South Africa’s new Minister of Electricity, Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, recently said, “South Africa’s challenge is not just power production, it’s power distribution that is a big bottleneck.” There is a lot of opportunity to have greater coverage from our systems if we can balance loads better for individual households.
In the long run, we see further opportunities to create virtual power plants and grids.

BHPs are used in DH systems to make them operate at substantially lower temperature levels, improving the coefficient of performance of central heat pumps used in the networks themselves, while simultaneously lowering DH grid losses significantly. They also help reduce heat loss along the DH system.
In the study “Integration of booster heat pumps in ultra-low temperature district heating network: Prototype demonstration and refrigerant charge investigation,” published in Energy and Buildings, the scientists explained that their assessment was based on 212 relevant papers published up to and including 2022 and said they found a significant lack of data on the influence of the refrigerant charge in BHPs operating in DH networks.
They also stressed that the refrigerant charge plays a crucial role in optimizing the BHP operation, as an insufficient charge may lead to an underutilized evaporator. “In ultra-low temperature district heating systems, the COP of the booster heat pump is significantly affected by the district heating return temperature when the temperature of the domestic hot water is fixed (e.g., 60 C),” they emphasized. “It is recommended to regulate the booster heat pump operation to a higher evaporator outlet water temperature within the allowable range of district heating return temperature.”
In the researched setup, a household’s water tank for domestic hot water acts as a sink for the BHP, while district heating is used as the heat source. The scientists proposed to use R134a as the refrigerant for the configuration. Their analysis considered varying refrigerant charge, heat sink, and source temperatures.

They found that a refrigerant charge of 4.6 kg is the most coefficient fluid quantity for the proposed system configuration, which they said may achieve a coefficient of performance (COP) value of 4.95.
“However, it is worth noting that at a higher refrigerant charge of 4.8 kg, the COP starts to decline slightly due to a slight overcharge, while the optimal heating capacity is achieved at this point,” they added. “Consequently, for this prototype, the optimal refrigerant charge for maximum COP is slightly lower than that for maximum cooling capacity, a trend observed in many air conditioners and household heat pumps.”
The researchers also found that when the inlet temperature is set to 40 C, a lower temperature lift, which is the difference in temperature between the heat source and the heat sink, leads to a higher COP, but a lower exergetic efficiency. “In practical scenarios, there may be a trade-off between energetic and exergetic efficiencies, and a balanced operation could be achieved by optimizing the operating parameters,” the research group further explained.
The scientists concluded by saying that the implementation of BHPs in ULTDHs offers many benefits, including a more efficient integration of renewable energy sources. “However, careful consideration must be given to the design of the system configuration, as various factors such as guaranteed refrigerant rate, time-sensitive parameters, and target temperature for DHW will impact its operation and performance,” they stated.
The research group is formed by scientists from the Technical University of Denmark, the University of Twente in the Netherlands, and Danish technology company Danfoss.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/21/hydrogen-stations-can-avoid-unplanned-shutdowns-with-predictive-models/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",Hydrogen stations can avoid unplanned shutdowns with predictive models,"From pv magazine USA
New research from NREL and Colorado State University (CSU) shows that consumers could develop more confidence in switching to hydrogen-fueled vehicles if fueling station operators use predictive models that help them plan for maintenance needs.
According to the research, one of the key issues consumers of fuel cell electric vehicles could face is when hydrogen refueling stations shut down for unscheduled maintenance issues, and this could slow the adoption of these zero-emission vehicles. However, the authors pointed to a “prognostics health monitoring” model that they said could help hydrogen refueling stations avoid these shut downs.
Motorists expect to be able to fuel their vehicles without any problems, and drivers of hydrogen-fueled cars should have the same experience, Jennifer Kurtz, lead author of the paper, said. Kurtz  leads NREL’s Energy Conversion and Storage Systems Center.
“This predictive model can let station operators know in advance when a problem might occur and minimize any disruptions that motorists might experience with hydrogen fueling,” Kurtz said.
NREL is the US Department of Energy's (DoE) primary laboratory for research and development connected to renewable energy and energy efficiency. This latest paper was funded by the DoE’s Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office.
The research focuses on a specific model called hydrogen station prognostics health monitoring, or H2S PHM, which uses data to reduce the frequency of unscheduled maintenance, and instead increase the frequency of preventive maintenance.
The model looks at how many fills the refueling station has completed to figure out the probability that a component will continue working, and can also estimate the remaining useful life of each component, helping to lower maintenance costs.
However, this model has its own limitations when looking at the reliability of a hydrogen station, since it cannot predict sudden failures caused by human error.
One of the most common reasons that hydrogen refueling stations shut down without warning is due to issues with the dispenser system, which includes hoses and dispenser valves, according to the National Fuel Cell Technology Evaluation Center.
Hydrogen refueling stations are still relatively rare in the U.S. As of this year, there were 59 retail hydrogen refueling stations in the United States, mostly in California, according to the DoE – compared to the 10,000 gas stations in the state.
“With relatively few choices, motorists who rely on hydrogen must be confident their needed fuel is available. Station operators must make any necessary repairs to meet the demands of consumers, but they also must investigate the causes of any failures to avoid future problems,” said NREL.
However, this could soon be changing. This year, fuel cell electric vehicle manufacturer Nikola Corporation received $58.2 million from different regulatory agencies to set up a hydrogen refueling station network for heavy-duty trucks. And last year, Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy Resources and BlackRock Renewable Power announced they had signed a memorandum of understanding to take a closer look at designing, installing and operating a charging network for medium- and heavy-duty battery electric vehicles as well as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles across the nation, with an initial investment of $650 million.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/21/recycling-solar-panels-via-supercritical-water-tech/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BRAZIL,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA",LIOR KAHANA,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",Recycling solar panels via supercritical water tech,"A Brazilian research group has developed a novel recycling method for solar panels that uses supercritical water technology.
Supercritical water is water heated and pressurized beyond its normal boiling point. In this state, it has unique properties that make it a powerful solvent. “The water reaches the supercritical state when the temperature and pressure exceed 374.3 C and 22.1 MPa, respectively. Its physicochemical properties are quite different in this state, promoting the decomposition of hazardous and persistent organic compounds,” the researchers explained, noting that the proposed process does not require toxic or hazardous chemicals.
With the new method, solar cells are first broken into smaller pieces, and placed in a reactor. That reactor is constantly fed with water that is being heated and pressured to a supercritical state. This process results in gaseous, liquid, and solid products.
In order to assess the organic degradation rate of the panels, the academics have tested the method with varied temperatures, flow rates, reaction times, and solution compositions. Then, running a further optimization method, the group achieved a 99.6% organic degradation rate at 550 C, with a reaction time in the reactor of 60 minutes, a volumetric flow rate of 10 mL/m, and a feed solution composed of an aqueous solution of residual organic compound and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2/Rorg).
“The aqueous solution of residual organic compounds, composed of methanol, acetonitrile, and chloroform, was obtained from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses,” they emphasized. “The processing of waste solar panel under supercritical conditions was conducted to evaluate the possibility of the simultaneous treatment of solid waste and organic liquid wastewater, decreasing the amount of clean water consumed.”
Regarding solid products resulting from the method, through the different supercritical conditions, an average metal recovery efficiency of 76% was observed. Among the metals recovered were aluminum, magnesium, copper, and silver. “This recovery possibility makes the process more economically attractive,” they added.
As for the gaseous byproducts, their mean composition using H2O2/Rorg was 72.9% carbon dioxide, 18.6% hydrogen and 8.6% nitrogen. “The obtained results highlight one of the supercritical water technology main advantages, that is, the possibility to use wastewater for the treatment of electronic waste producing only non-harmful gases in a controlled environment,” the scientists stressed.
The liquid byproduct produced in this recycling method mainly consisted of phenolic derivatives such as 3-ethylphenol, bisphenol A, and 4-isopropylphenol. This new byproduct can then undergo another treatment via supercritical water technology, removing almost 100% of the total organic carbon. “This allows the reuse of the liquid outputs in several treatment processes of solar panel waste,” the Brazilian group added.
Finally, the academics have proposed an energy-integrated superstructure design for a scaled-up recycling process. The proposed method for industrial-scale recycling includes a quench unit, flash tank, and fired heater, among other parts. Using simulation software, the scientists found the superstructure to have a 59.2% reduction in the hot utilities requirement and a 60.2% reduction in the cold utilities requirement, compared to a direct scale-up of the experimental setup. In addition, an operating cost reduction of 60.5% was observed.
The proposed approach is presented in the paper “Simultaneous recycling of waste solar panels and treatment of persistent organic compounds via supercritical water technology,” published in Environmental Pollution. It was written by scientists from the State University of Maringá, the Federal University of Goiás, and the University of Sao Paulo.
