In 2015, Sunwiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston warned large-scale solar developers that rooftop PV installations would end up eating their lunch.
“Now what I see is more nuanced and circular than that – renewables will eat itself,” he tells pv magazine Australia. “Transmission takes a long time to built … while you’re waiting for that transmission, there will be volatile and higher electricity prices. The natural response to that will be to install rooftop PV or install storage, potentially local storage, potentially local transmission-enhancing storage, all that sort of stuff.”
He said that batteries will be completed faster than transmission, leading to a decline in the economic justification for transmission. However, transmission projects will still be developed, which in turn will diminish the economic rationale for batteries.
While this business case conundrum most pointedly impacts big battery projects, which earn most of their revenue from spot markets, distributed energy resources like rooftop solar and network batteries will continue to utterly transform energy systems.
In April, Gabrielle Kuiper, a director of the Superpower Institute, noted the findings of ITP Renewables' modeling, which suggests that once Australia reaches its saturation point with distributed energy resources, rooftop solar combined with battery trading could potentially reduce the evening peak of the wholesale market by 67% to 92%.
The demand forecasts which have underpinned much of Australia’s transition modeling to date are increasingly being questioned, given the fact models – as Kuiper points out – have the shortfall of relying on a past which is likely completely different to the energy future.
Johnston describes the assumption that Australia should be building copious amounts of transmission as something that has remained, until vey recently, “unexamined.” A growing choir of industry insiders are questioning whether the current extent of planned transmission projects are in fact vital, but this is also a relatively recent shift.

India’s Trinano Technologies has developed nanocoatings for solar modules that can increase their power output by up to 4% and lower the temperature by up to 3 C compared to non-coated panels. 
“This means a 10 MW solar power plant with nanocoated panels would generate additional power of 720 MWh and thus an additional revenue,” Trinano Technologies CEO Harsh Sethi told pv magazine. 
The nanocoating is environmentally friendly and chemically stable. It is designed to improve light trapping, anti-reflection, and self-cleaning properties.
“Besides increasing the panel’s energy output, these help in anti-soiling and reducing potential-induced degradation (PID). The coating can last for more than five years and reduces panel maintenance and cleaning (especially water-based) costs,” said Sethi, noting that the Thus, the return on investment is about two years.
The nanocoatings underwent extensive testing in research universities and labs in India and Thailand, confirming the improvements in panel output and temperature by the National Center for Photovoltaic Research and Education (NCPRE), IIT Bombay, which has technology and R&D collaborations with USA's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Germany's Fraunhofer, and Australia's University of New South Wales.
Similar results were observed at the National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) in Gurugram, as well as in pilot projects conducted at Toyota's rooftop solar project in Mumbai, a residential rooftop solar plant in Navi Mumbai, and a Tata Power pilot project in Bengaluru.
The technology's patent application has been submitted in India and other member countries of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with expectations of its grant by 2023.
The coating process, performed with a portable coating machine and 6 kg frames, allows for application on existing panels without their removal from service. It involves solid-phase deposition without the use of liquid. In contrast, commercially available coatings, made of organic materials, are liquid and applied using paint, brush, or spray methods, but they decompose and deteriorate within two years.
The nanocoatings are suitable for monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film solar panels in both ground-mount and rooftop applications. Potential customers include solar panel manufacturers and solar plant owners.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/28/ireland-surpasses-680-mw-of-installed-pv-capacity/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,IRELAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 28, 2023",Ireland surpasses 680 MW of installed PV capacity,"Ireland has deployed around 680 MW of solar power spread across 59,888 generators to date, according to a new report from the Irish Solar Energy Association.
Most of this capacity originates from seven large-scale plants surpassing 5 MW, totaling 349 MW, and 208 MW from microgeneration solar arrays, encompassing systems up to 12 kW. Small-scale ground-mounted PV plants for self-consumption account for another 95 MW, while mini-generation systems ranging from 12 kW to 50 kW contribute 5 MW.
Ireland currently operates 22 MW of utility-scale systems (ranging from 1 MW to 5 MW), 0.3 MW of systems ranging from 200 kW to 1 MW, and 0.54 MW of systems with a capacity between 50 kW and 200 kW.
“By the end of 2023, ESB Networks forecasts almost 1 GW of solar will have connected from domestic rooftop to utility-scale solar projects,” the association said in a statement. “This makes the solar industry the fastest growing renewable power source in Ireland.”
Ireland supports rooftop PV operating under its net metering scheme, via a rebate program. The scheme is designed to deploy around 380 MW of solar capacity.
The country also supports large-scale solar via an auction mechanism. In the first renewables auction, the Irish authorities allocated 796 MW of generating capacity. The average weighted bid price for the technology-neutral auction was €0.07408 ($0.08)/kWh.

“The KTM monobloc heat pump is relying on a Panasonic DC Twin Rotary compressor, which ensures a smooth working process in a temperature range of up to -30 C,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, noting that the device also uses R32 as the refrigerant. “The unit ensures smooth operation at outdoor temperatures as low as -30 C and, thanks to the enhanced vapor injection technology used, the pump can achieve flow temperatures as high as 65 C.”
The company offers the new product in five versions with a capacity of 6 kW, 10 kW, 14 kW, and 17 kW respectively. For the heating mode, the coefficient of performance (COP) is up to 4.90 for the largest model and up to 4.91 for the smallest model, according to the company’s datasheet.
The heat pump can also achieve a maximum water temperature of 60 C and its operating range is between -30 C and 43 C.
The 6 kW device has dimensions of 970 mm x 475 mm x 835 mm and weighs 120 kg. The 17 kW system has a size of 1,050 mm x 480 mm x 1330 mm and weighs 190 kg.
“The controller with an integrated WiFi module allows for the intelligent operation of three heating circuits as standard,” the spokesperson went on to say. “Additional accessories increase the number of supported circuits and enable the installation to be equipped with room thermostats.”
The manufacturer offers a 5-year product warranty for the heat pump.
Kensol is based in Gliwice, Upper Silesia, in southern Poland, where it operates a solar module and heat pump factory.
*The article has been updated on July 3 to specify that the new product is an air-to-water heat pump, and not a water heat pump as we previously reported.

The company said it designed the system to systematically to benefit agricultural activity.
“Parameters such as solar cell coverage, height and pitch of the structure have been designed based on simulations to provide the amount of light that raspberries actually need,” said Insolight CTO Mathieu Ackermann. “Our dynamic shading screen, piloted based on sensor feedback and our own algorithms, provides extra shading during heat waves, and protects the crop from frost during spring.”
The pilot plant will be monitored over the next three years, with a focus on examining agricultural aspects. The Bern University of Applied Sciences will measure the PV-related performance.
The Swiss Federal Office of Energy supports the Bioschmid agrivoltaic plant through the P+D program (acronym for pilot and demonstration). Other supporters of the project include the Canton of Lucerne (Swisslos), the Fondation sur la Croix, The Foundation Valery, and the involved system suppliers.
The system will sell the energy it produces into the grid. However, no details about the levelized cost of electricity or capital expenditure have been disclosed.

Their approach consisted of coupling the battery with the system with a minimal amount of additional components and without any modification, which they said kept the system cost low. They also specified that, in the proposed system configuration, the microinverter does not “know” that it is connected to a battery, which pushed the researchers to investigate the use of passive or active measures to avoid maximum power point (MPP) tracking of the battery.
For this reason, the research group proposed two different system architectures, which it called passive hybridization or direct coupling and active hybridization or active coupling.
With the first one, the battery is connected to the panel without any microinverter or charge controller in between. “It is based on matching the PV and the battery respective current and voltage behaviors,” the scientists said, noting that the system is self-regulated and no battery management system is needed. “During battery charge, the system voltage increases and drives the PV towards zero current when the battery is fully charged. During discharge, a diode protects the PV from too low voltage levels.”
The active architecture implies the connection of a microinverter and a controller between the battery and PV systems, which enables active control of voltages and currents while regulating the interaction between the components. “Here, one side of a controller is placed in the parallel connection between PV modules and inverter,” the academics said. “The battery is connected on the other side of the controller.”
The passive design is cheaper than the active one but is also less efficient than MPP-tracked setups, the group noted.
The academics used real weather data and high-resolution synthetic load profiles to conduct a series of simulations via Simulink (MATLAB) to assess the performance of the two systems over a one-year period. They assumed the system consists of three series-connected PV modules with each an output of 100 W, a 36 V electric bicycle lithium-ion battery with a nominal energy of 555 Wh and a nominal capacity of 15.5 Ah, and a 250 W microinverter with an MPP tracker.
They compared the performance of the two architectures with that of a balcony PV system with the same characteristics but without storage. “The three systems were tested on separate days with different meteorological conditions,” they also explained. “For both AC and DC measurements, data was recorded in one-second increments. Weather data were recorded in ten-minute increments.”
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
Through its analysis, the German team came to the conclusion that both the active and passive systems are technically viable as they are able to provide continuous and stable operation over three days. “The passive hybrid system is conceptionally simple and allows continuous inverter operation advantageous to provide household base-load coverage,” it stated. “The active system shows intermittent inverter operation but has higher system efficiencies.”
The scientists said the financial viability of both project designs should be further investigated, as the cost of the battery may still represent a hurdle that may be removed, eventually, by increasing the size of the balcony PV system. “For a broad applicability, the system setup should be adapted for more flexibility, which will probably need to include communication with the battery,” they concluded.
Their findings were presented in the paper “Integration of a lithium-ion battery in a micro-photovoltaic system: Passive versus active coupling architectures,” published in Solar Energy.

Gamesa Electric recently published a white paper on the transition from a power grid sustained by large spinning turbine power plants to one predominantly managed by grid-forming inverters, harnessing the power of wind, solar, and batteries. The transition will be marked by a shift from generation stability to constant variation.
On June 8, pv magazine hosted a webinar to discuss the major functionalities in the most advanced inverters, corroborated by real test results by Gamesa.
Modern inverters usually rely on the power grid’s voltage, in conjunction with the current generated by solar modules, for operation. However, in grid-forming mode, the inverter’s power converter also acts as a voltage source, meaning it can independently create an electrical grid. Moreover, it has the capability to alter its operation in response to changes on the larger power scale.
This technique of managing voltage and current by the inverter, while monitoring the grid and making adjustments to maintain stability within the power conditioning system (PCS), is known as a Virtual Synchronous Machine.
Standard ancillary functions provided by Gamesa inverters include the above noted ability to manage voltage regulation, power factor regulation (also known as active power), active ramp rate, fault and voltage ride-through, power oscillation damping, and the two stages of fast frequency response: synthetic inertia and primary frequency response (also referred to as frequency droop).
