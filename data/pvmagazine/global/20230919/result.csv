The project marks the world's first steel plant to use hydrogen for heating before the rolling process. Beyond steel heating, the hydrogen will fuel cell-powered trucks, and surplus heat from the plant will support district heating. Hitachi Energy's delivery includes a modular Grid-to-Stack solution, with components such as transformers, rectifiers, control equipment, and high-current connections to convert alternating current from the distribution grid into the direct current required for the electrolyzer. The company has collaborated on the system's development with Volvo Group, H2 Green Steel, and Nel Hydrogen.
Enapter has expanded its product lineup with the introduction of the “AEM Flex 120,” a new AEM electrolyzer for industrial and refueling pilot projects. The AEM Flex 120 features up to 50 AEM Stack core modules, ensuring high reactivity to fluctuating renewable energy sources. It can produce approximately 53 kg of hydrogen per day at 99.999 percent purity, with the option for a dryer. This electrolyzer addresses the market gap between Enapter's AEM Electrolyser EL 4 (1 kg/day) and its megawatt-scale AEM Multicore (450 kg/day), and the company is scaling up its production capacities to meet demand.
The Port of Rotterdam and the inland Port of Duisburg have jointly presented the findings of a feasibility study focused on North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The results show a significant local increase in demand for low-carbon hydrogen, exceeding 3 million tons per year until 2045. To meet this growing demand for green hydrogen in the medium term, the study recommends completing the first hydrogen pipeline between the two ports by 2027. Subsequently, pipelines for hydrogen derivatives and CO2 export should follow, complementing the essential roles of inland shipping and rail transport.
Rina, in collaboration with SEA Aeroporti di Milano and the local branch of the Italian enterprises federation Confindustria, has launched the Hydrogen Valley Malpensa project – Italy's first hydrogen valley in an airport environment. The project's objective is to establish a complete hydrogen supply chain ecosystem by September 2027. Participants in the project include Air Pullman, Artelys, Circe, Emisia, and Lhyfe Labs, making it a collaborative effort involving various stakeholders.
Nuvera Fuel Cells has agreed to supply a hydrogen fuel cell system for a reachstacker developed by Hyster, which has been delivered to the Port of Valencia in Spain as part of the H2Ports project. This initiative aims to introduce hydrogen-powered vehicles and equipment into port operations. “The hydrogen is stored in high-pressure tanks and can be refilled less than 15 minutes,” said Nuvera Fuel Cells. “The hydrogen fuel cell charges the batteries, which power the electric motors and hydraulic systems, enabling the reachstacker to lift laden containers with comparable performance to a diesel alternative.”
Irish Rail and Digas have signed a contract for a proof-of-concept project to convert a diesel locomotive from traditional diesel fuel to hydrogen. As part of this €1.5 million project, Irish Rail will provide the 071 Class Diesel Locomotive for the conversion, while Digas will manufacture and install a Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine (H2 ICE). The project's success could demonstrate a practical and cost-effective means to decarbonize and operate existing diesel locomotives with hydrogen-powered engines, offering environmental benefits for rail transportation.

In the first eight months of this year, the country installed 113.16 GW of new PV systems, with 16 GW deployed in August alone. Solar power installations surged with 20.37 GW in the first two months of 2023, followed by 13.29 GW in March, 14.65 GW in April, 12.9 GW in May, and 17.2 GW in June.
FuturaSun has started building a new factory in Huaian, Jiangsu province, with an investment of CNY 5 billion ($690 million). The Italian solar cell and module manufacturer's new facility is projected to have an annual cell capacity of 10 GW and a module capacity of 2 GW, with commissioning set for March 2024. The company is also in the planning stages of a 3 GW solar module factory in Italy. It currently operates 1 GW of solar module capacity at two sites in China.
Longi says it will invest CNY 3.92 billion to expand cell capacity by 12 GW at its factory in Tongchuan, Shaanxi province. The company aims to start manufacturing on the new production lines in November 2025. The state-of-the-art facilities will produce cells based on Longi's HPBC back-contact technology. While the precise details of HPBC remain unclear, it is believed to extend p-type (positively doped silicon) IBC technology, offering a combination of the structural advantages found in PERC, TOPCon, and IBC solar technologies.

French grid operator Enedis says that all PV systems installed under France's self-consumption regime reached a combined capacity of 960 MW at the end of June, from just 347 MW a year earlier.
At the end of June, around 326,000 PV systems had been deployed under the scheme, with approximately 10,200 installations connected to battery storage.
Enedis said there are currently 400 energy communities registered for self-consumption in France. Among these, 246 are already operational, serving 3,732 users, and collectively have a capacity of 16.7 MW. It also noted that the capacity of PV systems exceeding 10 kW more than doubled in the first six months of this year.
During the first half of 2023, the power connected for self-consumption projects of less than 36 kW nearly matched the volume connected for all of 2022. Over the course of six months, almost 86,000 new self-consumers were connected, compared to just over 90,000 in the previous year.

They looked specifically into ariel imagery from Sweden by using a deep learning framework called DeepSolar CNN, which was developed by Stanford scientists. The framework uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), which enables extracting and learning features from visual data.
According to the research group, the proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 63.9% when used over a Swedish data set. That is lower than previous research conducted with the same framework in other countries. For example, a US group of researchers attained an accuracy of 91%, and a study done in Germany achieved 87.3%.
However, the Swedish-trained CNN has achieved more competitive results regarding the recall rate. While the precision rate refers to the method's ability not to make mistakes, the recall rate refers to its ability not to let positive information slip through. In that recall metric, the Swedish DeepSolar has achieved 81.8%, compared to 98.1% in the US and 87.5% in Germany.
“Regarding the lower precision achieved in this study compared to the previous publications, one explanation is that our scans of complete municipalities in the sparsely populated Sweden contain a much larger share of negative images than the mentioned studies,” the scientists explained. “As the main goal is to evaluate how useful detection of decentralized solar energy systems (SESs) by aerial images and a CNN classification algorithm are for creating as comprehensive a database as possible, a high recall is more important than a high precision.”
The scientists said the algorithm was first trained with a data set from North-Rhine Westphalia state in Germany and was then fine-tuned to Sweden with pictures from eight municipalities. It was then used to scan the whole spatial area of three Swedish municipalities – Uppvidinge, Falun, and Knivsta. These data were compared with other data collected with onsite inspections.
This iterative process involved multiple scans, with the CNN algorithm being retrained after each municipality scan, resulting in progressively enhanced accuracy. In the initial scan, the algorithm detected 89% of the detectable PV systems (excluding BIPV and vertical installations) and 59% of the ST systems,” the scientists emphasized. “Remarkably, by the fourth and final scan, these detection rates improved to 95% for PV systems and 80% for ST systems.”
They also specified that most undetected PV systems were frameless modules, typically installed on darker-colored roofs. In addition, shading from trees or structures, image reflections, and systems with high tilt angles impeded the classification algorithm's detection efficacy.
“Accuracy underscores the model's ability as both an inventory tool and a mechanism for constructing comprehensive databases of existing SESs,” the Swedish team concluded. “Connecting such a database, where the exact locations of the SESs are known, to existing building and property inventories, facilitates the generation of remarkably detailed SES market segment statistics.”
Its findings can be found in the paper “Mapping of decentralized photovoltaic and solar thermal systems by remote sensing aerial imagery and deep machine learning for statistic generation,” published in Energy and AI.

They said the cell achieved an open-circuit voltage of over 2.8 V, which compares to conventional cells with values ranging between 0.7 V and o.8 V. “This is a record value for this type of solar cell and demonstrates how photovoltaics combining perovskite and silicon offers huge untapped potential,” said the research's lead author, Juliane Borchert.
The paper “Monolithic Two-Terminal Perovskite/Perovskite/Silicon Triple-Junction Solar Cells with Open Circuit Voltage >2.8 V,” published in ACS Publications, explained that the cell's perovskite absorber was made with perovskite materials with an energy bandgap ranging from 1.56 V and 1.83 V.
“We note that the bandgaps combined in this work are not the final optimum bandgaps for a triple-junction solar cell,” they said. “However, the focus of this paper is on process optimization and integration of the subcells into triple-junction devices, and the findings are applicable to other perovskite compositions.”
The three subcells were designed with three different architectures.
The bottom cell was made with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA), an interfacial layer made of the PFN polymer, a perovskite absorber, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on a buckminsterfullerene (C60) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The second device uses an HTL made of PTAA, a PFN interlayer, a perovskite absorber, a C60 ETL, a SnO2 layer, an ITO layer, a silver (Ag) metal contact, and an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
The upper cell relies on an ITO substrate, a carbazole (2PACz) layer, a perovskite absorber, a C60 ETL, a SnO2 layer, an ITO layer, a silver (Ag) metal contact, and an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the triple-junction cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.0% PCE, an open-circuit voltage of over 2.8 V, and short-circuit current density of 8.9 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of around 78%.
“A high voltage therefore indicates that the basic physical characteristics of the solar cell are appropriate and that the fundamental aspects needed for a very efficient solar cell are in place,” the researchers stated.
“While we are currently in the process of scaling up the development of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells and readying them for use in industry in our Pero-Si-SCALE project, it’s also fantastic to see how triple-junction solar cells hold so much potential for advancing the concept in the future,” said Stefan Glunz, Division Director for Photovoltaics at Fraunhofer ISE.
“Further optimizations are required to bring it to the level of perovskite/silicon dual-junction solar cells and eventually surpass them,” the paper notes. “Moreover, the long-term stability of these solar cells under standard test conditions and elevated temperature needs to be addressed in future work.”

The current production capacity plan for the Göttingen factory is 20 GWh which is expected to be completed in four phases. By mid-2024, the actual production capacity may reach 5 GWh, said the manufacturer.
Once fully operational, the plant is estimated to generate an annual output value of EUR 2 billion ($ 2,14 billion), as company representative said at the official launch held on Saturday.
“Our Göttingen factory's production line is highly automated, with an overall automation level of nearly 70%, and close to 80% in the module assembly stage,” said Ray Chen, vice president of Gotion Global.
The company said it expects to start supplying products for European customers from October. The battery pack products from the factory include those for commercial vehicles, energy storage systems, and passenger vehicles, the company said. Additionally, the factory will serve as an R&D, logistics, and after-sales service center for Gotion's European production and operations base.
Gotion said that it has received “a large number of orders from Europe” for its “Made in Germany” products. On Saturday alone, it signed cooperation agreements with five global companies.
Specifically, Gotion will continue to collaborate with BASF China on battery material-related projects. Gotion and Switzerland’s ABB will work together on battery product supply and technology R&D, to support the Chinese manufacturer’s new factories in Europe and the United States.
Cooperation with Dutch manufacturer of electric buses Ebusco will focus on the development and production of energy storage battery systems and wind and solar energy storage projects. Gotion will also cooperate with Ficosa and Idneo in intelligent mobile energy storage and charging vehicles, battery banking, battery recycling, BMS, and Big Data engineering.
The Volkswagen-backed battery maker is on a steep growth trajectory and has commissioned or announced the construction of numerous battery factories, primarily in China.
On Monday, Gotion and Slovak battery startup Inobat said they will jointly build an electric vehicles battery factory in Europe by 2026 with an initial output of 20 GWh. Construction is expected to begin in 2024 and the final location of the plant is yet to be announced.
Gotion is also building a $2.36 billion battery plant in Michigan and a $2 billion plant in Illinois in the US. In June, it became known that Gotion was considering building a 100 GWh battery cell factory in Morocco.
As reveled in a recent pv magazine webinar, Gotion wants to reach a global production capacity of 300 GWh by 2026 with 100 GWh oversees, including 40 GWh in Europe alone.

GR2L, a small clean-tech company in Surrey, England, has secured a GBP 4 million ($4.9 million) order to supply its argon recycling technology to Mundra Solar for a planned 2 GW solar facility in India.
Solar panel makers use argon gas to purify silicon crystals, which are then used in solar cells. This process requires vast amounts of argon, with some producers needing to ship in multiple tankers of the gas each day.
GR2L has developed a closed-loop, argon purge gas recovery and purification system. Its ArgonØ tech recycles the high-purity argon purge gas used in the fabrication of silicon wafers for PV applications.
GR2L claims that its ArgonØ machinery is a world first, as it allows solar cell production – as well as other advanced manufacturing activities like microelectronics production, 3D metals printing, and aerospace heat treatments – to recycle up to 95% of used argon. The technology helps solar manufacturers to cut waste, emissions and costs.
“With production of brand-new argon creating up to a tonne of carbon dioxide for every tonne of argon, our cutting-edge gas recycling technology helps solar facilities reduce their scope 3 CO2 emissions and produce solar fuel cells more efficiently,” said Rob Grant, the CEO and founder of GR2L.

Some cells thrive at low temperature, others excel at high currents. Such specialization, however, often comes at a cost.

Battery aging is either related to time (in cases of calendar or “calendric” aging) or to usage, with charging and discharging representing “cyclic” aging.
Both forms of aging contribute to capacity and efficiency fade and increasing internal resistance as ions become trapped in unpleasant side-reactions for good. These reactions are driven by various “influencing factors.” Typically, ions react irreversibly with other materials in the cell, forming passive residue and preventing their use for energy transport.
Common influencing factors – whose impact varies by cell type – include the temperature of battery cells; device state-of-charge (SOC); and the current, or power, used during charging and discharging. Regarding state-of-charge – the amount of charge, or energy, in a battery – idle SOC matters when a battery is not in use and the SOC window (the range in which cycling occurs) is relevant when a device is cycling.
Mechanical stress, such as vibration and pressure, is another influencing factor in battery degradation but we’ll focus on the three factors above for now.
Temperature plays a pivotal role in battery life. Most cell chemistries benefit from storage and idling at low temperatures, below 20 C, as that slows calendric aging by reducing the chance of side reactions. Idling at higher temperatures can greatly increase the degradation rate.
Conversely, most cell technology is very sensitive to low-temperature operation, causing a dilemma. With more than 30 C to 40 C being less than optimal, the sweet spot for battery cell operation is around 15 C to 25 C, for most chemistries. Newer nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC)-based batteries are very sensitive to low temperature charging and dangerous defects can occur if charging at lower than 10 C. In the graph to the left, showing three high-quality NMC cells of the same type, the rate of degradation is slightly improved by reducing the operating temperature by 10 C, from 25 C (the orange line) to 15 C (violet line). Going 10 C lower (blue line), however, would crash the battery almost immediately.
Lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries are generally safe but under certain conditions – in cold temperatures, under high current, or with an already well-filled host electrode – they can experience lithium plating. The example above showcases the impact of plating at low temperature. Plating is a form of residue that occurs when lithium ions form metal deposits inside battery cells. Over time, this process can accumulate and eventually lead to internal short circuits that might trigger a thermal runaway – a rapid and dangerous release of heat and gases.
It's important to note the conditions which facilitate plating are only partially controllable by a battery management system (BMS). Operators must take responsibility for monitoring and maintaining their devices.
State of charge has a substantial impact on battery lifetime. Both idle SOC, during non-usage (which concerns calendric aging), and the SOC range or window during operation (cyclic aging) matter. The following example shows two identical NMC cells.
The graph below shows the degradation evolution of two almost identical use cases of a high-quality NMC cells.
 
Both use only around 50% of the battery, and the first use case (the blue line) does so in the upper half of the SOC, starting fully charged and falling to 50% before being fully charged again. The second use case (in orange) starts at 50% charged and ends virtually empty. As the graphs show, the impact on degradation is incredible: the orange battery will live two times to three times longer than the blue one, reducing total cost of ownership by more than half.
It should be stressed, however, this is an example of a particular cell type and other devices and cells may behave completely differently. As a rule of thumb, avoiding an SOC above 90% and below 10% generally extends battery life, but there are exceptions.
Assessing battery stress can be complex, even for experts, and can be affected by temperature changes, SOC ranges, and the profile of a device’s C-rate – its rate of discharge relative to maximum storage capacity. Such factors interact intricately with the susceptibility matrix of cell types. Stress level is a single number which gauges how stressful a battery usage profile is, compared to a reference case.
A stress level of 1.0 indicates usage is roughly as stressful as planned, 2.0 suggests a device will degrade about twice as fast as expected. Tools such as battery diagnostics automatically analyze stress levels, helping risk assessment and optimizing usage profiles.
There's an ongoing debate about whether BMS’ should control influencing factors to maintain battery health. BMS’ can prevent particularly damaging and dangerous usage but don’t typically provide recommendations for optimizing stress levels.
The global battery trend toward higher energy density for longer ranges often comes at the cost of reduced device lifetime. Battery lifetime and safety margins have, on average, retreated in recent years. That means extra care should be taken when operating the most expensive degrading component of the energy transition. The susceptibility of all li-ion cell types to influencing factors should make us aware of the untapped optimization potential in many battery usage scenarios.
The complexity of stress factors and battery usage cases highlighted above ensures simply counting cycles or logging a device’s age will not give a clear picture of its degradation. It is clear that regularly checking battery capacity and state of health is essential and we can see that slight adjustments to usage profiles can significantly reduce battery stress and extend asset lifetime by 10% to 50% or more.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/19/benchmarks-for-solar-energy-data-methods/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023","Benchmarks for solar energy data, methods","In the ever-evolving world of solar energy applications, access to accurate and reliable modeled irradiance data is crucial. Modeled irradiance data based on satellite products and numerical weather prediction models are frequently used. Many of such sources of data are offered by institutional or commercial providers. However, it is difficult and time consuming for users to independently identify the best provider for their specific application and location.
Benchmarking Solar Data
In our Task 16 report “Worldwide Benchmark of Modelled Solar Irradiance Data” we address this challenge. The report presents a benchmark of model-derived direct normal irradiance (DNI) as well as global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data that considers 129 globally distributed sites where ground-based radiation measurement stations are or have been installed. DNI and GHI estimates are compared against high-quality observations from these stations. The performance of the modeled data is analyzed with respect to different regions and climate zones. This study helps the solar industry make better informed decisions about solar resource assessments.
Building a reference database
Big efforts were made to build the reference database. We finally used data from 25 different providers with 129 stations during 2015–2020. Only quality-assured data has been considered in this benchmark through a comprehensive set of best practices and newly implemented quality-control procedures. These include automatic as well as manual data quality-control tests carried out by a team of experts led by CSP Services GmbH for all stations and result in flags describing the quality for each time stamp. The bulk of the quality-controlled data, covering all continents and many climate zones, has been published within this benchmark.
Global representation
One of the strengths of this benchmark is its global reach. The 129 ground-based stations are strategically distributed worldwide, encompassing diverse regions and climate zones. This global representation includes 31 stations in Africa, 31 in Asia, 27 in North America, 20 in Europe, 13 in Australia, 5 in South America, and even 2 in Antarctica. By spanning such a wide geographical scope, this benchmark provides insights into the performance of model-derived data in various environmental conditions, from arid deserts to polar extremes
Assessing model-derived data
Ten different models were tested, although not all provide estimates for all stations. Amongst other statistical performance parameters, the mean bias deviation, root mean square deviation, and standard deviation are calculated for each year and per station. The results for the relative mean bias deviation affecting GHI are shown in Figure 1.
Benchmark findings
Based on the results of the statistical analysis, the most appropriate dataset might depend on site, climate, or continent of interest. The model errors and the differences between the various modeled datasets are much higher for DNI than for GHI.


Figure 1: Relative mean bias deviation (rMDB) for GHI and all stations and years. Magenta color indicates results out of the color bar range. The point size corresponds to the total number of datapoints in the tested data from 2015 to 2020.
Solar irradiance measurements and time series play a decisive role in supporting solar resource assessments, especially for medium and large PV installations. Not only they represent the foundation of solar resource assessment and forecasting, but they also drive prospective PV yield studies, and can be used as a calibration reference when using satellite data, evaluating PV systems’ performance, or developing forecasting algorithms.
Challenge: data gaps
However, such datasets inevitably have gaps – periods with missing data – as a result of defaults during data-logging, sensor failures or quality check procedures that can compromise their applicability and value. An additional issue is that data gaps can be further enlarged when computing temporal aggregations, notably for intra-daily to daily, daily to monthly and yearly averages, thus further degrading the dataset.
This has raised the need for gap-filling methods that can post‑process either static historical datasets or more dynamic real-time data streams. Each case is characterized by different constraints, such as the access to data that follows a given data gap or the acceptable time lag for generating the replacement synthetic data.
Benchmark for GHI gap-filling methods
In our report “Framework for Benchmarking of GHI Gap-Filling Methods”, led by Mines Paris PSL, we propose a gap-filling benchmark framework and evaluate a set of possible baseline algorithms for intra-hourly and daily sums of GHI time series. Five methods have been compared for different lengths of gaps: Nearest neighbors, linear interpolation, two machine learning approaches and use of satellite data. For short gaps linear interpolation works best, as for longer gaps the use of satellite data is suggested.
Conclusion
With access to comprehensive statistical performance parameters and insights into model errors, analysts can make informed decisions about which data providers and models align with their needs. Our recently published reports serve as a guiding light, making the uncertainty of data and models comparable for solar industry professionals and researchers, ultimately advancing the field and promoting sustainable energy solutions worldwide.

Something needs to be done quickly.
Renewables offer a compelling solution. Not only are they the most rapidly deployable and versatile technology available. They are also the most affordable.
A recent analysis by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows that the adoption of renewable power in Africa since the year 2000 has led to USD 19 billion in fossil fuel cost savings within the electricity sector.
Given that Africa’s renewable energy potential far outstrips its projected demand for electricity in 2040, the continent has more than enough renewable resources to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development as envisioned by the African Union in its Agenda 2063.
Africa’s renewable energy resource potential, however, is unevenly distributed across the continent. There is a profound need for appropriate infrastructure to be put in place to utilize and distribute this potential among the different regions to enable efficient, sustainable, and affordable access to energy across Africa.
To realize Africa’s vast potential, we must ensure there is adequate investment and infrastructure development to support renewable energy. In the coming years, this means urgently overcoming the structural barriers across three priorities: infrastructure, policy, and institutional capabilities.
Continued investments in cross-border transmission infrastructure and a deepening of electricity trade can bring more flexibility to achieve a smart diversified generation structure and accommodate the high share of variable renewables, thus enhancing Africa’s grid reliability and resilience.
To achieve this transformation, in 2021 the African Union launched the African Single Electricity Market (AfSEM) aimed at creating one of the largest electricity markets in the world by 2040.
The Continental Power System Masterplan (CMP), under which IRENA collaborates with AUDA-NEPAD, serves as a blueprint and supports the establishment of a long-term continent-wide planning process for power generation and transmission involving all five African power pools.
Implementing this ambitious plan will be a herculean task, requiring an extraordinary level of financial resources—a burden that African nations cannot shoulder alone.  As Kenya’s President William Ruto made clear at the recent launch of the Accelerated Partnership for Renewables in Africa (APRA), which IRENA facilitates, the question is not whether Africa has the ambition, but how to translate ambition into reality.
The energy transition requires large public investment to trigger systemic change and build the physical infrastructure needed to develop a new energy system powered by renewables. This is where multilateral financial institutions come into play.
For too long, institutions have addressed symptoms rather than root causes. While funding individual projects—be they utility-scale or off-grid—is crucial, without the necessary structural changes, this approach is not comprehensive. It cannot hope to attract sufficient capital to fundamentally transform the continent’s energy reality to deliver its socioeconomic development goals. A change in approach is needed.
It is time to reimagine how multilateral cooperation works and to strengthen collaboration between the Global North and the Global South. Reform is needed to the way lending is made. Priority must be given to building supportive physical infrastructure, enhancing local capacities, and creating local supply chains leveraging Africa's abundant critical materials. All of this must be done in a way that adds economic value for African countries.
Only 2% of global investments in renewable energy in the last two decades were made in Africa. The recent initiative announced by the COP28 Presidency during Africa Climate Week marks a significant milestone for the continent. Not only is the USD 4.5 billion commitment to develop clean power in Africa a significant sum, it is also targeted to address key energy transition barriers, including the continent’s infrastructure needs.
Later this year, at COP28, the first Global Stocktake since the Paris Agreement will be held in the United Arab Emirates. This event will measure the gap that remains between climate pledges and action. The moment, however, will also present us with a chance to chart a new course.
As we approach this pivotal moment in history, it is imperative that we construct an action-oriented narrative that tackles the key barriers. Doing so will enable us to take meaningful strides towards keeping the 1.5-degree Celsius temperature rise within reach.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/19/jamaica-seeks-proposals-for-100-mw-of-renewables/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA,JAMAICA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023",Jamaica seeks proposals for 100 MW of renewables,"The Jamaican government’s Generation Procurement Entity has released tender documents inviting domestic and foreign proposals for utility-scale renewable energy projects.
Selected developers will be required to build facilities with capacity ranging from 5 MW to 50 MW using individual or hybrid technologies – wind, solar, and hydro – with or without storage. Generating units comprising hybrid technologies will not be required to be developed at a single location, but they must have single interconnection points.
However, bids with storage will not have their net capacity increased, as their total capacity will be determined without storage, and there will also be no commitment or payment regarding firmness. There will also be no incentives recognized for storage installation. Projects with storage will compete with projects without storage under the same conditions, and the energy delivered from batteries will be paid at the same price as the rest of the energy supplied.
Solar projects must be commercially operational within two years from the execution date, and projects relying on other technologies will be required to be up and running within 30 months from the execution date.
Projects will be recommended to be granted PPAs with Jamaica Public Service (JPS) Co. Ltd. acting as the single buyer. The price will be determined by JPS.
Collectively, the projects will produce 100 MW for Jamaica’s electricity grid, with the aim of “increasing the share of renewable sources of energy in the country energy mix,” according to the tender documents.
The move is part of the Caribbean nation’s commitment to sourcing 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the country had 93 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/19/indian-scientists-making-high-purity-polysilicon-ingots-from-recyled-pv-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023",Indian scientists making high-purity polysilicon ingots from recyled PV cells,"Researchers at the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) and the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, in India have used the SPS technique to produce polysilicon ingots from recycled solar cells in end-of-life PV modules. They claim to have produced small-sized ingots with purity levels of 98% to 99%.
These purity levels slightly exceed the 3N purity level, which the scientists say is greater than that of metallurgical-grade silicon. It is also “good enough” for applications other than solar cells, like battery materials.
“Currently, we are working towards the purification process of recovered silicon to grow ingot better than 5N, so that same can be used in the fabrication of new solar cells,” researcher Sushil Kumar told pv magazine. “This work is expected to be completed in the next few months.”
The scientists used a modified hot pressing technology known as SPS, involving the passage of pulsed direct current with millisecond pulse widths, high current, and low voltage through the pressing tool and sintered body. This approach enables rapid heating and short processing times, typically within a few minutes. The researchers specifically applied this technique to consolidate the silicon powder obtained from the recycled solar cells.
They conducted the experiment on a 98 cm × 164 cm solar module, weighing 17.18 kg. They used a mechanical treatment to remove the aluminum frame (0.62 kg) and the junction box. They then cut down the remaining parts of the panel into small pieces of varying sizes, ranging from 9.5 cm × 11 cm to 12 cm × 16 cm.
The process involved thermally treating the recovered wafer pieces on a stainless steel plate at an optimized temperature of 480°C for 30 minutes in a muffle furnace, resulting in a total weight of 23.04 grams. Glass, silicon cell fragments, and connecting wires were recovered, while the EVA encapsulant and backsheet were removed. To eliminate residual ash adhering to the cell pieces, the cell fragments underwent ultrasonic cleaning with hot distilled water for one hour.
Subsequently, the researchers utilized SPS to consolidate the powder at temperatures ranging from 1,100 C to 1,200 C, significantly below silicon's melting point of 1,410 C. The sintering cycles were conducted for up to 20 minutes under vacuum conditions.
The Indian team reported removal rates of 97.72% for aluminum and 99.90% for silver through this process. Using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis, they determined that the resulting ingots achieved a purity level exceeding 3N.
“Despite the fact that recovered silicon from waste is used in the production, it is highly likely that ingots of much greater purity can be easily produced through upgraded recovery and purification techniques,” the academics concluded.
They presented the new technique in “Growth and analysis of polycrystalline silicon ingots using recycled silicon from waste solar module,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

A year after the passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which created long-term industrial policy anchored by rich supply-side and demand-side incentives for manufacturing solar components, large global companies are betting big on US manufacturing.
Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, and Longi have each announced 5 GW of solar module manufacturing facilities, adding a combined 15 GW of capacity. To put the investments in context, each of these factories represent $200 million to $600 million in capital expenditure.
The United States only had about 7 GW of module manufacturing capacity in 2021. As of April 2023, American Clean Power said that i9n an eight-month period, 46 utility-scale clean energy manufacturing facilities were announced, bringing an expected 18,000 or more US jobs. Since then, several more major announcements have followed.
“The times of supply shortages are over,” said Thomas Koerner, senior vice president of Canadian Solar, in a recent interview with pv magazine USA at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas.
Canadian Solar told pv magazine USA that it is moving significant capacity into the United States to meet customer demand. A 10% adder to the investment tax credit is applied to projects that meet a certain threshold of US-made components, driving developers to shift their procurement decisions.
The move may also indicate the three companies looking to adjust to the new enforcement of anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws. Whereas the production of a solar cell used to determine the nation of origin in US Customs and Border Patrol enforcement of AD/CVD tariffs, but that has changed and the production of wafers is now used to determine the nation of origin in production.
The change in enforcement has drawn some fire from industry advocates and global panel suppliers. AD/CVD uncertainties led the supply of utility-scale solar panels to dry up in 2022, leading to a cascade of delayed and canceled projects and a deployment downturn in a year that was expected to bring installation growth.
Read industry reactions to the changes in enforcement of AD/CVD tariffs here. A guide to avoiding being assessed with AD/CVD tariffs can be found here.
For Canadian Solar, the new US production represents choice for its customers. The company has 12 GW of production of its TOPCon modules in Thailand, and 5 GW of production on the way in the United States. The sites will produce the same panels, but one will produce Made-in-USA goods that are expected to qualify for domestic content requirements for the tax credit bonus.
An upcoming pv magazine USA webinar, “Variables to consider in solar module procurement,” will address how price is no longer the defining factor in purchasing decisions. Country of origin, differences in quality and degradation rates, and other determining factors will be assessed.
Production plans
Trina Solar announced it will invest about $200 million in a Texas manufacturing plant with an annual manufacturing capacity of 5 GW. Trina’s new factory is expected to begin producing its Vertex line of modules with 210 mm wafers in 2024.
“We have long had a vision to manufacture solar products in the United States, and we are proud of the jobs we are creating and the investment we are making in the Wilmer community,” said Steven Zhu, president of Trina Solar US.
The Trina Solar facility is expected to create 1,500 local jobs.
“As someone who has lived in Texas for more than a decade, I’m proud to bring Trina’s first module factory in the Western Hemisphere to the Lone Star State,” said Zhu.
Longi says it will partner with utility-scale developer Invenergy to support a 5 GW panel assembly in Ohio. Invenergy says it will invest more than $600 million to construct a 1.1 million square foot crystalline silicon panel manufacturing facility. Operations are expected to begin in late 2023, and construction of the plant began in April. More than 850 jobs are expected to be created at the site.
“As an American company and a leading developer and operator of solar projects in the U.S., we recognize the importance of having a strong domestic supply chain to meet the fast-growing demand for affordable solar power,” said Art Fletcher, executive vice president of Global Sourcing at Invenergy.
Canadian Solar will also add 5 GW of manufacturing capacity, building a factory in Mesquite, Texas. The site will produce TOPCon solar panels. The company said it will invest $250 million in the factory, creating about 1,500 jobs along the way.
“Establishing this factory is a key milestone that will enable us to better serve our U.S. customers with the most advanced technology in the industry,” said Shawn Qu, founder and chief executive officer of Canadian Solar. “We hope that this is the first of many long-term investments we expect to make in the US, as we think strategically about a sustainable and resilient clean energy supply chain.”

Hoymiles has unveiled the HYS-LV-USG1 series of single-phase hybrid inverters. They are designed for residential and small commercial solar-plus-storage projects.
The inverters come in sizes ranging from 3.8 kW to 11.5 kW of output power. Hybrid inverters enable two-way conversion of electricity from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), as well as DC to AC.
The hybrid inverters sport a max efficiency of 97.6% and a CEC efficiency of 97%. Double maximum power point (MPPT) trackers support up to 32 A of MPPT current. The inverters support 120 V / 240 V backup power without requiring the installation of an external autotransformer.
Hoymiles’ new inverters enable a DC/AC ratio of up to 150%. The company said this leads to a lower system cost when compared with systems of the same capacity using other conventional inverters.
The inverters come with integrated arc fault protection and rapid shutdown features. The inverters also allow users to check real-time system data and perform remote operations and maintenance via a transfer stick.
An onboard energy management system allows users to shift between self-consumption mode, “economic mode,” and backup power mode to suit their needs.
“By acting as a medium between solar and grid energy, we ensure electricity is not just accessible but also adaptable and reliable,” said Neutron Wang, product director for Hoymiles. “With our latest inverters, we are pushing the frontiers of solar technology, fostering energy autonomy.”
Hoymiles is a global module-level power electronics (MLPE) solution provider specializing in module-level microinverters, storage systems and rapid shutdown systems. Spec sheets for its new products are listed here.
