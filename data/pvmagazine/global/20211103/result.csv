Engie North America has scrapped a 60 MWac solar plus 240 MWh battery storage facility that it was awarded by Hawaiian Electric Co. in May 2020.
The company blamed “elevated interconnection costs coupled with global supply chain and production issues, as well as tariffs and trade disputes” affecting the photovoltaic solar industry.
NHOA (formerly Electro Power Systems) was to supply the battery storage system for the Puako project and act as a system integrator as subcontractor to ENGIE.

K2 Management, based in Viby J, has called for the U.K. government to introduce a tariff incentive to attract investors to fund the large scale energy storage facilities needed to ramp up solar and wind power generation assets to a sufficient level to meet the nation's energy needs. An alternative solution, the consultant said, might be to set up a contracts-for-difference (CfD) regime for storage, similar to the one which guarantees returns for solar plants without the risk of tipping public finances too deeply into the red.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
By contrast with the messages emerging from the host of the COP26 climate change summit, which is keen to showcase its clean power credentials, K2 issued a press release today which stated: “The growth in U.K. renewable energy is at its lowest since 2010.”
With the consultant also calling for new measures to ramp up wind farm development, K2 said the lack of incentives for storage helped partially explain a lack of clean energy projects beyond this decade.
In addition to planning constraints on wind farms, “we also need to rapidly get a grip on storage. Over the last few weeks, the renewable energy industry has been criticized in the wake of high gas prices and the challenge this has placed on consumer energy bills,” said the appropriately-named Gary Bills, director of projects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for K2. “But renewables can only start to make a meaningful baseload power contribution through a significant increase in a mechanism that releases the storage potential – of which there are a range of bankable technologies.
“For this to take place, we therefore have to incentivize the investment for storage technology – either through a tariff or CfD mechanism, which enables us to co-locate the technology at new and existing wind and solar project sites, and deliver clean power outside the intermittency windows of renewables.”
London-based clean power developer Queequeg Renewables yesterday announced plans to construct 2 GWh of utility scale battery facilities in the U.K., in the form of 20-480 MWh projects, in addition to “some” storage systems installed alongside a planned 1.3 GW of new solar farms.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/03/chinese-pv-industry-brief-daqo-wiped-debts-as-poly-price-continued-to-rise/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",MAX HALL,"NOVEMBER 3, 2021",Chinese PV Industry Brief: Daqo wiped debts as poly price continued to rise,"With manufacturing curtailment affecting the solar industry, as a result of much-publicized electricity rationing and emissions caps in China, the latest financial update published by polysilicon manufacturer Daqo appears to acknowledge that the measures are having their desired decarbonizing effect.
While Daqo New Energy chief executive Longgen Zhang used his company's third-quarter update to praise the authorities for responding to electricity shortages by ramping up coal production – and complained about the difficulties of finding new production sites against emissions reduction regulation – he added: “We will be committed to using more renewable energy in our next polysilicon project in order to secure the energy quota, which will allow us to gradually realize the idea of ‘green poly' or ‘solar for solar'.”
Pick up the November edition of pv magazine on Friday to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
Regardless of the difficulties of securing permits for more cheap-coal-fired solar panel manufacturing facilities, however, Daqo is surfing a global solar boom which has seen rising solar equipment costs apparently failing to dent demand thus far.
Whilst more expensive input material silicon powder raised Daqo's average polysilicon production cost, from US$6.31/kg in the second quarter to US$6.84 in July-to-September, that rise was passed on to solar manufacturers further down the supply chain in the form of an average selling price during the last three-month window of US$27.55/kg, up from US$20.81 in the previous quarter.
The soaring price of the solar panel raw material was demonstrated by the fact Zhang, in comments made in the update published on Thursday, referred to polysilicon's “current level” of US$33-35/kg.
The lower, third-quarter price level was sufficient for the company to generate enough revenue – US$586 million – to pay off all its debts, after it banked a quarterly record net profit of US$292 million, from gross three-month profits of US$435 million.
And with the business running its production lines at full capacity to manufacture 62,970 tons of poly to the end of September – of which 63,714 tons were sold – Daqo expects to produce 83-85,000 tons for the full year.
Zhang warned those rising silicon powder prices would continue to affect the numbers in the current quarter but said he expected that input cost to stabilize in the first half of next year as new supply comes online and as Beijing relaxes energy and emissions restrictions for the new financial year. Strip silicon powder out of the equation and Daqo's average production costs actually fell 1%, quarter on quarter, the CEO added.
Elsewhere, the Yongxiang Co Ltd polysilicon manufacturing unit of solar cell maker Tongwei, yesterday commissioned a new poly manufacturing facility with a planned capacity of 51,000 metric tons. Located in Leshan, in Sichuan province, the fab will produce material compatible with n-type monocrystalline solar products. With the new factory, and another 50,000-ton facility under construction in Yunnan province, the company will reach an annual production capacity of 180,000 tons this year. Tongwei is also expanding capacity with two factories under development in Inner Mongolia and Yunnan. Those two facilities will have a combined output capability of 250,000 tons.
Hong Kong-listed renewables investor Kongsun Holding yesterday announced it will sell seven solar farms with a total generation capacity of 140 MW to Xinhua Power, for RMB242 million (US$37.8 million). Kongsun said it will retain 17 solar projects with a total generation capacity of 530 MW after the sale.

Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) has opened bids to set up an aggregate 1.2 GW of capacity on the interstate transmission system in India. The projects will be installed on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. 
The SECI will sign 25-year power purchase agreements with the hybrid power developers at the respective tariffs discovered after the e-reverse auction, and back-to-back power sale agreements (PSAs) with the buying entities at the PSA tariff for the total capacity allotted.
The rated capacities of both the solar and wind components shall be a minimum of 33% of the total contracted capacity, for a project to qualify as a hybrid project. For example, in case the contracted capacity of a project is 100 MW, the rated capacities of both the wind and solar components shall be a minimum of 33 MW each.
The minimum bid capacity will be 50 MW, with at least 50 MW of the project capacity being proposed at each project site, and a maximum of 1.2 GW. The bidders must submit only a single tariff bid for all the projects they apply for.
Developers can set up the projects at their chosen locations. The projects are required to be designed for interconnection with the transmission network of the central transmission unit at a voltage level of a minimum of 220 kV. The minimum project size of a single hybrid power project will be 50 MW, to be interconnected at a single delivery point.
Connectivity and long-term open access will be in the scope of the hybrid power developer.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/03/pv-system-design-for-low-cost-hot-water-production/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 3, 2021",PV system design for low-cost hot water production,"A group of scientists at the University of Cordoba, in Spain, has developed a photovoltaic system design for hot water production that is claimed to use around 95% of the available energy it can generate.
The system consists of a 300-liter water tank with electric resistance, connected to a 1.6 kW photovoltaic system by means of a low-cost, experimental electronic conversion system. “It is a model that is versatile, sustainable and economical, which only produces a 5% energy loss,” said the research's main author, Luis Cámara-Díaz.
The system is equipped with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) as it must constantly operate at the maximum power point. “Without using inverters or batteries, which are more common in traditional solar photovoltaic installations, we have developed a low-cost electronic system capable of acting as an MPPT device,” the researchers explained. “Keeping a fixed reference voltage is the MPPT tracking method used.”
A microcontroller board keeps the reference voltage at the required levels and a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) conducts or cuts the current, depending on the voltage. “The reference voltage, determined by the control system, is equivalent to the maximum power point’s voltage resulting from the grouping of photovoltaic modules,” the academics further explained.
The proposed approach was tested on a PV system built with five JinkoSolar JKM330PP modules with a power output of 330 W each. The electrical heater to produce hot water has a nominal power of 3 kW and heating electrical resistance of 37.8 V. The solar panels were connected in series to reach a nominal operating voltage close to the electrical network voltage.
The system was found to reach water temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius and to cover around 85% of the annual sanitary hot water consumption of a household with six people. “The novelty introduced by this low-cost electronic system is that it is possible to convert the available photovoltaic energy into heat, regardless of whether the existing solar radiation level is high or low,” Cámara-Díaz stated.
The tested system also includes a water recirculation system to allow the input of cold water in the DHW tank, and simulated water consumption and water renovation inside the tank. It was presented in the paper A Cost-Effective and Efficient Electronic Design for Photovoltaic Systems for Solar Hot Water Production, published in Sustainability.

The company, based in Brentford, West London, yesterday said plans for the first projects in a 1.3 GW solar project pipeline consisting of facilities ranging in scale from 10 to 50 MW of generation capacity, were “about to” be submitted as planning applications.
The solar facilities, which will deploy bifacial panels on single-axis trackers to minimize project footprint, according to Queequeg, will include an unspecified volume of associated energy storage capacity.
The company also announced plans for an entirely separate 2 GWh of “standalone” battery plants, to offer electric grid capacity and balancing services, with the first of those projects to be developed “in the months ahead.”
In a nod to the landscape concerns voiced by opponents of solar developments in the U.K., Queequeg co-founder Gabriella Palla, quoted in yesterday's statement, said: “It will be vital for us to develop strong and positive relationships in the communities in which we operate, through ensuring that each project we develop is built to the very highest ecological principles.”

Jinko today said it would invest RMB450 million ($70.3 million) in a 15% stake in Tongwei subsidiary Sichuan Yongxiang Energy Technology, which is planning a 100,000 ton annual capacity polysilicon production line in Leshan, in Sichuan province, near monosilicon wafer production facilities owned by Jinko.
Once operational, the factory will supply Jinko with 30,000 tons per year of poly, under the terms of the arrangement.
“By securing this new line of clean, high-quality and highly reliable raw material, we will be able to guarantee the long-term reliability of our wafer and module production for the next few years,” said Jinko CEO Kangping Chen, in a press release issued by the company this morning. “In addition, we have also realized that the healthy and sustainable development of the PV industry is increasingly dependent on the profound cooperation among supply chain partners.”
With Jinko having agreed to buy 93,000 tons of poly from Tongwei up to 2023, in a deal signed a year ago, the two companies in February formalized a co-operation arrangement which committed Tongwei to invest in a 30% holding in a 15 GW solar wafer production joint venture with Jinko and to purchase an additional 6.5 GW of wafers from Jinko up to 2023, on top of earlier purchase agreements.
In return, Jinko agreed to take a 35% holding in a 45,000 ton polysilicon fab planned by its partner. It is not clear whether the production facility which Jinko is now set to invest in is the same as the one highlighted in the earlier arrangement.

The ionogel is based on the polymer poly(acrylic acid), which is also known as PAA, and is claimed to enhance the module's impact resistivity and stability, as well as to reduce the possibility of lead leakage. “The commercialization of the encapsulation technique will depend on the perovskite module stability,” researcher Jinsong Huang told pv magazine. “We did a cost analysis and found this encapsulation does not increase the cost of regular modules.”
The scientists explained that ionogel sealants were applied on the panel's front glass and between electrode and encapsulation glass, with the 100μm-thick inonogel being able to hold the shattered glass together even if the glass breaks. This is claimed to effectively suppress lead leakage from broken modules after hail test or compression by car wheels, and soaking in water for 45 days.
The solar module has an area of 31.5cm2 and is relying on perovskite cells with an efficiency of 22.9%. Silicone glue was used for edge sealing and an anti-reflection polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer was applied on the front, heat-strengthened glass to improve light absorption and, at the same time, to protect the lead-adsorbing ionogels from contamination. A polyolefin elastomer (POE) sealant ensures encapsulation and separates the ionogel and the perovskite device, which is based on the perovskite MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 based on methylammonium, formamidinium, and lead iodide.
The module showed a power conversion efficiency of 18.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 10.09 V, a short-circuit current of 74.6 mA, and a fill factor of 0.773. The scientists tested the stability of the panel via damp heat (DH) and thermal cycling tests according to the IEC 61215 accelerated test standard. The capability and kinetics of the PAA ionogel to prevent lead leakage were also tested by soaking PAA ionogel film into methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) aqueous solution. “[The] incorporation of ionogel in the encapsulation markedly suppressed lead leakage from broken perovskite modules,” the scientists stated. “Undetectable lead could escape from the damaged perovskite module after a simulated hail test, followed by water [soaking] for 24 hours.”
A full description of the solar module can be found in the paper Lead-adsorbing ionogel-based encapsulation for impact-resistant, stable, and lead-safe perovskite modules, which was recently published in ScienceAdvances.  The research group includes academics from the University of North Carolina, North Carolina State University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

And as PV technology continues to diversify, with more differentiated products making their way to market, understanding how each will perform under certain conditions is an increasingly important consideration. And when a project does not meet expectations, it can cause big problems for all involved, and even harm solar’s wider reputation.
This was on the minds of a group of researchers led by Shoolini University and India’s National Institute of Technology in Hamirpur, who set out to develop a new model to predict the output of solar cells and modules over time. A key consideration for their model was accounting for the often unavoidable performance loss that PV systems experience over time. By working this into the model, the group estimates it is able to increase the accuracy of yield forecasts by as much as 26%.
The model is described in full in the paper A power prediction model and its validation for a roof top photovoltaic power plant considering module degradation, published in Solar Energy. The researchers measured the output and degradation of various solar cells in the lab under a sun simulator, and then validated these results with data from a PV installation on the institute’s rooftop. The paper also identifies different parameters to include in the model under different climate conditions, finding that a simpler model with only three parameters offered the most accurate forecast under low irradiance conditions, while four and five parameter models were more precise as the level of irradiation increased.
“Our model could be useful for developing PV power forecasting software capable of predicting daily, monthly, and yearly solar power generation, which is a crucial parameter for calculating the electricity supply and demand distribution, as well as for marketing PV systems,” said Shoolini University Professor Shyam Singh Chandel. “Being able to predict the output power of different PV technologies will help interested parties decide for the best option available in the market for a particular location. Based on the foreseen energy generation and the selected technology, one can estimate the total expenditure and payback period for a given project.”

Reporting its third-quarter figures yesterday, SolarEdge said it had posted record three-month revenue of $526 million, up 10% from the April-to-June window and 56% from the same period of a Covid-ravaged 2020.
Trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather and more will be discussed on Tuesday at pv magazine‘s virtual Roundtables USA 2021 event. Join us as solar experts discuss the big issues. For more information and to register free for the event, click here.
Those numbers included $477 million – another quarterly landmark – contributed from SolarEdge's solar-related business, which marked an 11% quarterly rise and 53% more cash generation year on year.
Quoted in a press release issued to publicize the July-to-September numbers, SolarEdge CEO Zvi Lando, said: “We are exiting the third quarter with [a] record backlog for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022,” hence the optimistic forecasts for the current quarter.
According to the press statement, SolarEdge expects to generate $530-560 million of overall revenue for the three months to the end of the year, with solar sales to supply $490-515 million of it. If achieved, those returns would mark another set of three-month records.
SolarEdge reports a ‘net income' rather than net profit figure and recorded a net $53 million in the last quarter – up 18% from the previous window and 21% year on year – and also announced it had shipped 1.9 GW of its inverters in July-to-September.
The statement did not flesh out why the company reported a considerably higher quarterly net income figure of $82 million under its own, rather than generally accepted accounting principle terms and Lando also revealed the company had experienced a 12-week Covid shutdown at its Vietnam production base.
Despite that setback, the chief executive said, SolarEdge was “able to supply products to meet the growing demand of our customers.”

Sydney-based battery company Gelion Technologies recently entered into a partnership with one of Australia’s two lead-acid battery manufacturers, Battery Energy Power Solutions. The partnership will see Gelion’s redesigned and trademarked non-flow zinc-bromide (ZnBr2) “Endure” batteries produced in Battery Energy’s facility in Sydney.
Thomas Maschmeyer, a University of Sydney chemistry professor, founded Gelion in 2015 to commercialize a significant discovery made during his research: an innovative zinc-bromide battery gel. It work as a 3D flyscreen that holds liquid, permitting chemistry to happen inside it, and thereby allowing the transport of ions to be engineered.
“As an academic, you think the best way … [is the] intellectually most elegant way. But that may not be the best at all from an engineering point of view, or from a commerce, financial, manufacturing point of view. So bringing it out of the lab and into real world manufacturing was a hugely informative journey for us,” Maschmeyer told pv magazine Australia.
This makeup is quite novel, with only Gelion and U.S. company Eos playing in the non-flow zinc-bromide space. However, there are a number of flow battery companies pursuing the chemistry, the most notable of which is Brisbane-based Redflow.
“Gelion batteries are safe, robust and recyclable,” the professor said in a statement. “For stationary energy storage, zinc-bromide batteries do away with the need for expensive cooling and maintenance systems. And they can’t catch fire.”
Maschmeyer describes zinc-bromide chemistry as ideal for solar batteries as it’s relatively slow to charge. He’s glad other companies are playing in the space, positioning lithium as the real competition – over which he says Gelion’s technology has significant advantages, particularly with regards to safety. Its electrolyte gel is a fire retardant, meaning its batteries can’t catch fire or explode. In fact, they can operate safely at temperatures up to 50 C and can be completely discharged to zero volts with no loss of function, making them “very abuse tolerant.”
Current designs of the individual Endure battery cells are between 200Wh to 300Wh.
“This capacity is being fine-tuned as we finalize our production systems,” said CEO Andrew Grimes. “However, as the Gelion Endure battery is a scalable product, these individual cells are designed to work together to provide capacity ranging from the kilowatt-hour to megawatt-hour scale.”
As it stands, its Endure battery has a round-trip efficiency of 90%, is non-toxic and the company claims it’s more than 95% recyclable. These features were refined in Gelion’s initial bipolar format, but when the company began its deep design studies with an undisclosed global partner during the pandemic, it arrived at the conclusion the smartest way to commercialize the Endure battery would be to switch the design to a parallel plate lead-acid format.
The battery is described as suitable for for irrigation, water purification and desalination systems, remote communities, mining facilities and agriculture.
Two things preceded this decision. The first was the complexity of building new manufacturing capability, and the second was the fact access to capital for such an endeavor is effectively hamstrung in Australia due to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s rules.
“If you want to produce something in a factory here, you need to have a factory reference plant the same size or bigger that has been operating for two years and that allows you to have full emissions data of the factory. That means you can never build a new factory here for new technology because you’ve got to prove it somewhere and you can’t prove it here,” said Maschmeyer. “If you can hook onto something that already exists, it’s much better … That’s why it was possible to introduce it so quickly worldwide, because they didn’t have to build everything from scratch. That’s exactly the concept behind us going for a lead-acid format.”
At the moment, Gelion is sourcing its zinc and bromide and other battery materials through existing supply chains, but its aim in future is to source most of its minerals from Australia. Its Endure zinc-bromide batteries will be deployed in production trials next year ahead of anticipated commercial availability.
The company’s model going forward is not to manufacture its batteries in-house, but rather to partner with facilities that have existing capabilities. “We don’t intend ourself to become a battery manufacturing company. We are a tech developer to get it commercialization, and we then license to partners,” said Maschmeyer. “We are going overseas but we are also staying local with the same model.”

Australia installed a record 360,000 rooftop PV systems in 2021, a whopping 40% increase on 2020, according to the Australian PV Institute.
Its National Survey of PV Power Applications in Australia report, prepared in partnership with the International Energy Agency and published this week, tells a decidedly rosy story about solar’s progress in Australia, which it says is showing no signs of slowing. In fact, at 22.3 GW of installed solar as of mid-2021,  Australia has nearly tripled its capacity since 2017.

In 2020, total rooftop installations hit a new high of 3 GW, with 1.8 GW installed on residential roofs and 1.2 GW on commercial and industrial roofs. While still smaller than the residential segment, the C&I space saw the greatest year-on-year growth.
In total, Australia’s solar capacity grew 28% in 2020, despite the global pandemic. While the residential and C&I segments broke records, the utility-scale solar segment contracted after peaking in 2019. Be that as it may, the amount of utility-scale solar connected to the grid has increased tenfold in the last three years, growing from 740 MW in 2017 to 7.4 GW in 2020.
“The Australian market is very different to most world markets as it has been dominated by rooftop PV. The demand for rooftop solar has kept Australia in the top ten markets for photovoltaics by annual installs and total installed capacity for over 10 years, a remarkable outcome for a country of only 25.7 million people,” the report said.

Australia has retained its status as global per capita solar leader, with 160 watts on our closest competitor, Germany, which has 650 watts per person. More than 31% of free-standing households across the nation are now fitted with PV systems, the report said. In Queensland and South Australia, the average is closer to 40%, with a significant number of localities have densities of rooftop solar over 50%.
“The Australian Energy Market Operator expects rooftop solar, alone, to account for up to 75% of national grid demand by 2026 and we are seeing new records for minimum demand broken each week as we move through spring, with increasing solar generation met with low demand for heating and cooling due to mild conditions,” the report said. “In contrast to other areas of global leadership, very little building-integrated PV was added in 2020, and no vehicle-integrated PV was known to occur. No additional ‘Floatovoltaics’ have been recorded beyond the single 100 kW installation in 2017.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/03/webinar-qa-the-future-of-back-contact-technology/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 3, 2021",Webinar Q&A: The future of back contact technology,"Hugo Schoot: Typically, bifacial modules are ground-mounted and installed 1m+ from the ground (often on trackers) to enable bifacial energy yield gains of 8-12%. Back-contact modules find their application primarily in rooftop installations, where they can leverage their superior power density and aesthetics. So, in that sense there is no direct competition. It is not likely that rooftop installations will adapt large shares of bifacial modules because of minimal bifacial gains and weight reasons. However, we do foresee that in the future, as the cell cost-down roadmap progresses, back-contact modules will increasingly be deployed in the ground-mounted segment too. Depending on ground albedo conditions we believe that due to the lower resistive losses, lower NOCT and reflective gains from the CBS, back-contact modules will be able to compete with bifacial modules in a significant share of the ground-mount market too.
Forced labor accusations heavily impact the global PV supply chain. Currently, the industry lacks transparency in the upstream segments to ban and prove forced labor is no longer present. The lack of supply chain transparency is valid for almost every crystalline silicon PV wafer produced today. As our solution also depends on crystalline silicon PV wafers we find ourselves in the same difficult situation. Only if the upstream segment opens up or new fully transparent supply chains emerge, will our customers be able to prove that there is no forced labor in their supply chain.
Bram Verschoor: If we look at the capacity of the back-contact production then a EuroMax90 is able to process max 5400 cells per hour, based on a 60 cell, full cell module. The total annual performance depends on the cell efficiency. 5400 cells is approximately equivalent to a maximum annual production of 290 MWp. This is based on 6.55 Wp/cell; 24/7 production and 95% uptime.
With half cells, there is a difference of 10-15% (The capacity reduces with 10-15% for half-cut cells), with a max annual production capacity of approximately 250 MWp. With tabbing/stringing the maximum capacity is approximately 100 MWp per line and half cells almost halve the production capacity. Bottom line, it is not about the capacity of a line, but about the ratio of space/production capacity and how many people are needed to run that production line. By far the most important remains the efficiency and reliability improvement.
We do quite often see on EL measurements that cells connected with tabs around the soldering site develop stress and microcracks. In addition, the cells can be damaged at the level of the tab due to stress on the radius of the bend. Both phenomena are absent in back-contact modules.
Hugo Schoot: We estimate that close to 10 GW of modules have been produced worldwide using CBS interconnection technology by the end of this year.
A conductive backsheet (CBS) is much thinner than a typical ribbon, so the total volume of used metal does not necessarily increase. With a CBS, it is even possible to improve the efficiency of using the metal by adapting the design to the current distribution.
ISC Konstanz is developing a next generation ZEBRA IBC cells to replace silver metallization by copper screen printing, which will result in a huge cost reduction without compromising on module efficiency.
In terms of cells: There are two flavors, the interdigitated back contact (IBC) cell. Or conventional front/back contacted cells that are converted into back contacted cells though metal-wrap-through (MWT) technology. In terms of performance potential we think IBC is the most promising. However, as IBC is still relatively expensive, we do see an equal share of MWT back-contact being used in the market. The speed at which IBC takes over will depend on the speed its cost will come down.
In terms of application: At this moment we do see two segments advancing more rapidly than others. First of all the high-efficiency rooftop market, particularly in residential applications and regions where aesthetics is valued. Secondly, in the integrated PV segments like VIPV and BIPV where aesthetics and flexibility of design are key.

Besides the bifacial gain, creating high power modules is simply a matter of using higher efficiency, larger and more cells per module. Converting the cells in these high-power modules into back contact cells via MWT, and interconnecting them with a conductive backsheet, will provide you with the same relative gain in energy output as in any module.
For example, let’s take a 605 W polymer backsheet module based on 210mm cells. Converting the cells into back contact cells via MWT and interconnecting these cells with a CBS will increase the power nameplate capacity of this module to around 640 W, adding up to a relative module efficiency increase of around 5.8%, or slightly more than 1% absolute, for PERC vs PERC-MWT.

Currently IBC still has a relative small market share. PERC is dominating the market but will gradually be replaced by Topcon and HJT cell technology. After that we foresee that HJ-BC and IBC will gradually take over, as shown in the ITRPV roadmap (SLIDE 8 PRESENTATION FLORIAN HAACKE)
