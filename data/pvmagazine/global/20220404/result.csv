https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/04/berlin-energy-transition-dialogue-global-challenges-and-the-role-of-renewables/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 4, 2022",Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue – global challenges and the role of renewables,"“Crises reinforce each other.” This opening statement by Svenja Schulze, federal minister of economic cooperation and development for Germany, set the scene for the second day of the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue (BETD).
Climate change, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine were introduced time and again as the converging crises that have brought us to a “momentous time in history,” according to David Turk, US deputy secretary of energy. The disruptions to gas, oil and food supplies caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine have exacerbated existing energy insecurities over supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Those in the global south have felt these effects the most and are again set to be the worst impacted by rising energy and food costs.
Panelists argued that the energy transition can only be achieved by worldwide collaboration – with no one left behind. Massive financial investment is needed to move from “ambition to action,” with the private sector to play a major role.
Green finance
The final session of the BETD sought to answer a specific question: How will we finance the energy transition? Moderator Dr. Melinda Crane opened by citing the International Renewable Energy Agency’s (IRENA) most recent outlook, which says that “success in bringing down CO2 emissions by 2030 depends on scaling up investment by at least 30% compared to where we are now.”
The panelists agreed that state funding alone will not suffice; private investment is also needed. The discussion then focused on how state funds could be effectively used to leverage private capital investment in renewable energy projects, particularly for smaller projects, which account for nearly half of all renewable energy undertakings.
The discussion centered on the role of the European Commission’s EU taxonomy in removing a major barrier to the flow of capital into renewables – the lack of knowledge of the mechanics of green finance.
Dr. Werner Hoyer, president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), opened the floor. “Our main capital is the trust of the investors,” he said. “That means that we have to be sure that what is labeled green, is green.” He referenced the European Commission’s taxonomy and argued that its basic idea is correct in giving reinsurances to investors. But he was guarded in his support, stating that “it is a great idea as long as it doesn’t develop into a bureaucratic monster.”
The fact that the taxonomy provides companies, investors, and policymakers with definitions for which economic activities may be considered environmentally sustainable within the European framework is in tension with the fact that the energy transition needs full-scale worldwide collaboration. If different definitions are agreed on outside of Europe, we might indeed be facing a bureaucratic nightmare. Interestingly, there was no discussion about how the classification of nuclear energy and gas-fired power plants as sustainable in the taxonomy will be in opposition to the assessment of its own group of experts.
The general agreement seemed to be that we are moving toward more accountability, which is critical in earning the confidence of investors. Prof. Suahasil Nazara, vice minister of finance for Indonesia, noted that his country introduced its own green taxonomy last year, and said that there will “soon there will need to be an international comparison.”
Dr. Rhian-Mari Thomas, CEO of the Green Finance Institute, said the EU taxonomy is needed for accountability for greenwashing. She proceeded to quote Laurence Tubiana, one of the key architects of the Paris Agreement, who wrote last year that “greenwashing is the new climate denial.” To that, Thomas added that “greenwashing is even more dangerous because without proper accountability it is harder to identify.” She acknowledged the intricacies involved in having a taxonomy that is fully and robustly adopted worldwide, but warned that “in the meantime, let’s not use this greenwashing accusation to stamp on the green shoots of progress.”
Thomas also argued that investors themselves have a key role to play in scrutinizing claims made by businesses and ensuring due diligence. They must ensure that all acquisitions are aligned with net-zero targets and that disposables of high carbon assets aren’t simply off-loaded to private markets where there is less scrutiny – a measure that may need more regulatory intervention.
 
 
 
As for the discussion of how state funds can be effectively deployed to maximize private capital investment in renewables, the representatives of the Maldives, Japan, and Indonesia agreed that increased government spending must serve as a catalyst for private investment.
Aminath Shauna, minister of environment, climate change, and technology for the Maldives, said her government is mobilizing funds from the private sector by investing in home solar programs, green distribution networks, and energy storage and management systems.
Naoshi Hirose, Japan's vice minister for international affairs, mentioned an investment of JPY 2 trillion ($16.3 billion) to assist specific projects in the private sector, and risk-sharing schemes as measures already put in place by the Japanese government.
Finally, Nazara said that Indonesia’s public spending measures involve a reduction of fossil fuel subsidies. He pointed out, however, that with the current international oil prices, it is becoming increasingly hard for developing countries like Indonesia to abide by these measures.
Energy security

“Cooperation” and “partnership” might have been the most used words during the second day of the BETD. All agreed that the energy transition is only possible through international cooperation and it will not be achieved without developing countries, which need significant investment from countries in the global north to end their reliance on fossil fuels.
Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), remarked that “climate change affects everyone in the world, but it doesn’t affect everyone the same,” with women in developing countries being particularly affected.
Schulze said that Germany has a 2030 “leave no one behind policy” under which “we need to take women with us,” as well as workers in carbon industries, to achieve a just energy transition.
Green hydrogen, a key topic of the first day of the BETD, was singled out as a symbiotic investment for countries in the global north and south, as the latter has the perfect conditions to satisfy the demand of the former. But as Dr. Robert Habeck, federal minister of economic affairs and climate action for Germany, said on the first day of the BETD, “you cannot steal the wind. The sun belongs to no one.”
The eighth BETD happened at “a dark time for Europe and the world,” said keynote Kwasi Kwarteng, UK secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy. The Russian invasion of Ukraine of course framed much of the discussion, with energy security placed high on the agenda. As Russia is the main supplier of oil and gas to much of Europe and Germany, in particular, many proclaimed a renewed urgency to transform the energy system. A move from fossil fuels to renewables was argued to be “ultimately what will get us behind these three crises,” said Turk.

Having announced plans to speed up the deployment of clean energy sources such as solar and wind projects, heat pumps, and renewable hydrogen under its RePower EU ambition, the EU executive stated in March: “Natural gas remains an important part of the EU energy system in the green transition.”
The commission has set up a task force on energy security with the United States and has committed to driving stable demand for more American natural gas as part of the arrangement. A statement about the task force, published on the commission website on March 25, said that the United States would strive to source at least 15 billion cubic meters of extra LNG this year, while attempting to reduce the carbon footprint of the fuel through measures such as the use of on-site clean energy generation at gas infrastructure locations.
The commission said it would work with EU member states to speed up the regulation for new LNG imports. With the US authorities, it will back final investment decisions for new import and export facilities for the fuel.
The eighth bullet point on a list of task force objectives was to reduce “overall gas demand,” through measures such as faster permitting for solar and wind projects, training for clean energy workers, clean energy procurement, smart thermostats, heat pumps, and fuel switching away from fossil fuels.

French solar company TSE has released a new photovoltaic canopy for applications in agrivoltaic projects.
The system features a rotating canopy that can host bifacial solar modules at a height of more than 5.5 meters. The canopy is placed on a four-post structure measuring 27 m x 11 m.
“Our canopy is compatible with all agricultural machinery, including very large ones like combines, sprayers and spreaders,” the company's president, Mathieu Debonnet, told pv magazine.
The company said the canopy technology is particularly suitable for cereal farms that grow rapeseed, maize, barley, and vegetable protein, as well as sheep and cattle farms, with an average size of 5 hectares to 10 hectares.
The canopy is equipped with weather sensors that regulate the movement of trackers that orient the solar modules along the axis of the sun from east to west and according to the weather forecast.
“Reaching a distance of 27 meters between the posts was a real challenge in terms of mechanics and aerodynamics,” Debonnet explained. “Each span has ten to twelve photovoltaic modules and to support them would therefore require a steel beam weighing several tons. To lighten the structure, we opted for pre-drawn cables 30 mm in diameter, extremely resistant, like those used on cable cars, on which the rotating modules are fixed.”
He said the solution also has other advantages. It reduces the carbon footprint of the structure, thanks to the reduction in the number of tons of steel used. In addition, the more aerial structure improves integration into the landscape. Finally, it is completely reversible, with the possibility of modifying the type of cultivation and/or breeding. In addition, the shade can withstand gusts exceeding 160 km/hour.
“We have recruited aerodynamic engineers into our R&D team in Bourgoin-Jallieu, which has around 50 employees, because the matter of aerodynamics and wind resistance was fundamental,” said Dubonnet.
Each row of panels is controlled independently. In the event of high winds, they automatically place themselves in a safety position at a different inclination from the next, in order to break the wind and avoid the suction effect.
In 2022, TSE will start a major program of agrivoltaic demonstrators, with 11 pilot sites of 6 hectares and 3MWp of photovoltaic capacity each, spread throughout France. The very first, equipped with Canadian Solar photovoltaic panels, will be unveiled in September in Haute Saône. It will sell the electricity produced via a power purchase agreement, but the terms have yet to be specified. Subsequently, the other 10 will be equipped with modules from French manufacturer Photowatt. Finally, a second batch of pilot projects will be set up over the next three years.
“We want to deploy 1 GW with our solution by 2025,” said Dubonnet.
TES has invested around €12 million ($13.2 million) of its own equity in developing the new technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/04/solar-tree-designs-for-urban-environments-carports/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 4, 2022","Solar tree designs for urban environments, carports","Researchers from Amity University, Noida, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, have developed four different designs for solar photovoltaic trees that purportedly require less physical space than conventional PV systems in urban environments.
“We are currently in the process of installing a prototype at Amity University campus in order to study practical applications of the concept described in the paper,” researcher Abhishek Verma told pv magazine. “Our proposed novel designs can definitely be used in practical ground applications. We tried to create a balance between aesthetics, energy generation, and technology.”
The scientists describe the system as a solution for on-grid and off-grid applications where space availability is a major constraint and shading effects should be avoided. The performance of the four designs, each with an installed power of 20kW, was measured and compared to that of conventional ground-mounted PV systems. The scientists used a series of simulations with the campus of Amity University set as a location, with solar irradiance of 1,737.4 kWh/m²/year.
The four systems – Tulip Tree, Sunflower Tree, Marigold Tree, and Daisy Tree – were named according to their different shapes. It was assumed that they would be deployed with 380W monocrystalline modules installed at a tilt angle of 20 degrees.
The Tulip Tree relies on a main support pole structure, with two branches that can each accommodate six modules. The foundation of the model takes up 4 square meters of space and the ground clearance from the lowest edge of the panels is approximately 4 meters. Five trees of this kind can be combined into a 22.8kW installation.
The Sunflower model is built with only one support structure, tilted 20 degrees, with up to 10 380W modules, to reach a total capacity of 3.8kW. Six trees can be combined together to reach a capacity of 22.8kW.
“This model can be utilized in public recreational areas in cities like parks, playgrounds, stadiums, and car parking,” the scientists explained, noting that land area occupation and clearance are the same as the Tulip design.
The Marigold model consists of a single support structure with branches inspired by the branches of real–life trees. This tree configuration can host up to 15 380W modules and reach a total power of 5.7kW. The land area occupied by the foundation of this model is 5.76 m2 and ground clearance is 4 meters.
In the Daisy system, the solar modules are arranged in landscape orientation, to optimize DC cable quantity, and a single support structure hosts up to 15 panels with a power output of 380W and a total capacity of 5.7kW. This configuration has the smallest occupation area at 3.3 m2 and a clearance of approximately 4 m. Four Daisy Trees can be combined to reach 22kW.
“One major advantage of this tree design is that we can easily integrate a double axis tracker system in the structure, to further increase the energy generation, if required,” the Indian group said.
Through the simulation, the Tulip model was found to have a land consumption ratio (LCR) of 0.083530 and a power-to-land occupancy ratio (PLR) of 0.91, while the Sunflower type had an LCR of 0.08 and a PLR of 0.95. The Marigold tree achieved an LCR of 0.077 and a PLR of 0.99. The Daisy design had the lowest LCR at 0.04 and the highest PLR at 1.7. The reference conventional ground-mounted plant reached an LCR of 1.0 and a PLR of 0.076.
“The percentage saving of land procurement cost in case of Tulip Tree, Sunflower Tree, Marigold Tree and Daisy Tree are 84.57%, 85.14%, 85.70% and 91.46%, respectively, as compared to land cost in a conventional ground-mounted SPV plant, promoting dual usage of land,” the scientists said.
Verma estimates the cost of the trees at $4,500 to $5,500 for a 5kW system, excluding the price of land. “However, the cost analysis depends on many variable factors and company to customer requirements,” he concluded.
The scientists described the solar tree design in “Solar Photovoltaic Tree: Urban PV power plants to increase power to land occupancy ratio,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.

Having missed Thursday's deadline for publishing its 2021 results – because of Covid-19 measures restricting the work of its auditors – Shunfeng instead published unaudited numbers for last year which spelled out the extent of its overdue debts.
The company had overdue borrowings of CNY 853 million ($134 million) at the end of December, plus a further CNY 473 million which became payable after breaching loan covenants.
Cash for creditors
Among its creditors, the cash owed to investor Sino Alliance fell to HKD 661 million ($84.4 million). True Bold Capital has been promised CNY 183 million of collateral from the anticipated CNY 890 million windfall from the proposed sale of those four solar projects, with a total 132MW of generation capacity. Details of the vote needed to approve that transaction are now expected by the end of April.
China Minsheng Banking Corp. has been promised an installment of HKD 65.6 million by the end of June, but one group of bondholders are awaiting HKD 175 million after that same level of payment was missed last year, with a further HKD 87.5 million due by the end of May.
Shunfeng said it hopes to reach an agreement with investor CDB over the CNY 22.2 million it is owed, after the developer missed payments of CNY 2.85 million last year.
Investors in an overdue 2015 corporate bond are owed CNY 398 million and their case is being heard by the Shanghai Arbitration Commission. Holders of a separate 2016 bond are owed CNY 317 million and those two latter cases complicate the 132MW project sale, which Shunfeng released details of in December. The developer's 95% stake in one of the four sites has been frozen by the Zhejiang Provincial High People's Court over monies owed to state-owned engineering, procurement and construction services provider Hunan Province Industrial Equipment Installation Co. Ltd.
The developer's 2021 figures showed little reason for cheer, with electricity sales revenue down from CNY 904 million in 2020 to CNY 650 million last year. The resulting loss of CNY 800 million for shareholders, up from CNY 552 million in 2020, was partly mitigated by a CNY 127 million profit from the LED business unit, which Shunfeng has sold off to pay creditors.
Zero inventory 
With zero inventory and its bank balance falling year on year, from CNY 227 million to CNY 55.7 million, the company said it had net current liabilities of CNY 979 million at the end of 2021, and a capital deficiency of CNY 880 million. The slew of project sales announced last year, however, halved current bank borrowings from CNY 3.22 billion in 2020 to CNY 1.6 billion, and slashed non-current obligations from CNY 2.22 billion to CNY 319 million.
The company was even penalized CNY 14.8 million last year for late payment of land taxes, so the sale of 132MW of its remaining solar portfolio of 489MW, it seems, cannot come soon enough.

The Croatian authorities want to auction off 300MW of PV, 300MW of wind, 8MW of biomass and biogas, 4MW of small hydropower, and 10MW of geothermal power.
For solar and geothermal, project sizes will have to exceed 500kW, while for wind projects this threshold has been set at 3MW. Hydropower projects will need to have capacities of 500kW to 10MW and biogas and biomass installations will need to be sized between 500kW and 5MW.
Selected projects will be awarded 12-year feed-in premium contracts and will have to start delivering power in 2024. The ceiling for PV has been set at HRK 495.63 ($72.40)/MWh and HRK 460.91/MWh for wind power.
The auction is part of a 2.2GW series of tenders for large-scale renewables held by HROTE. The Croatian government is also supporting rooftop PV through a rebate scheme.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Croatia had 85 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020. Croatia implemented a feed-in tariff scheme for rooftop solar that expired in 2015 after bringing online around 50 MW of capacity.

The XM-P system was designed to be used on all batten heights on pitched tiled roofs and is claimed to eliminate the need for different types of roof hooks. Aerocompact claims it can withstand snow loads of up to 4.7 kN.
The device is based on a heavy-duty stainless steel bracket that can be positioned directly in the direction of force on a purlin.
“It can be screwed through the metal roof tiles into the rafters below with two wood screws,” the manufacturer said. “The roof hook can be moved on the pantile, allowing it to be optimally positioned above the rafter.”

The forces of the hook are transferred into the rafter via a suspended support. The company said this can be adjusted to the height of the roof batten without needing any tools. Maximum stability should be ensured by applying to load to the substructure in the shortest possible path.
“With the help of our XM-P roof hook system, several work steps can be saved during installation. Installers do not need, for example, angle grinders to process or prepare the tiles on the roof because Aerocompact can provide stainless steel replacement roof tiles made of sheet metal for almost all standard roof tiles on the market,” said CEO Christian Ganahl.
The new product can be used with the company's own X40/X50 mounting rails and comes with a 25-year warranty.

The European Commission said it also wants to accelerate the expansion of photovoltaics in order to reduce dependence on energy imports from Russia. “It's a new sense of urgency,” said Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson in the opening session.
In a strategy paper released at the summit, Solar Power Europe said that 39GW of solar could be added in the short term to drop reliance on Russian gas supplies amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The would be 3.7 times more than in the pre-war scenario for rapid growth, and 9.1GW more than in the business-as-usual scenario, if no further action is taken. For short-term measures, the association is primarily focusing on rooftop systems, as there are no approval process issues for them.
The strategy paper is a response to a public consultation process launched by the European Commission, which is open until April 12. It aims to develop a new strategy for the expansion of PV. This should help to ensure that 40% of the electricity supply is provided by renewable energy in 2030. According to SolarPower Europe's new scenario, this share would be increased to 45%.
The change in mood in Europe relates not only to the expansion of photovoltaics, but also to the manufacturing of PV components. Kadri Simson repeated the well-known quote from Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on the financial crisis: “We need to bring manufacturing back to Europe – whatever it takes.”
The “European Solar Initiative” industrial program, which SolarPower Europe launched together with EIT InnoEnergy, aims to achieve a production capacity of 20GW along the entire value chain by 2025. That includes polysilicon, ingots, and wafers, as well as the production of PV cells and modules. According to the pre-war scenarios, about half of the expansion in Europe could then be covered with such capacity.
Joaquim Nunes de Almeida, the director for mobility and energy-intensive industries in the DG Grow Directorate-General, also said that dependence on energy imports should not be exchanged for dependence on module imports. He said that the EU will therefore support the production of components.
With Wacker Chemie, there is a global player from Europe, at least in polysilicon production, which is already meeting the targets of the European solar initiative. However, the president of Wacker Polysilicon, Tobias Brandis, said that the high cost of electricity is one of the biggest hurdles to building up the value chain in Europe.
Wacker Chemie, which is also one of the world's largest players in the field of semiconductor silicon, needs 0.8% of Germany's electricity. In other countries, such as the United States, there are opportunities to support companies with electricity prices, which is not the case in Europe.
It is still unclear how the industry can be supported, as EU state aid rules have strict limits. But there is relative agreement that a renaissance in manufacturing can only succeed with innovative and sustainable products. That said, there could be disagreement over which technologies to focus on.

US residential solar grew nearly 30% year on year and reached a record-breaking 4.2GW of new installations in 2021. This is a significant accomplishment, considering the challenges faced last year including volatile supply chains, rising system prices, labor shortages, and policy uncertainty.
Wood Mackenzie reports that Freedom Forever, a California-based solar installer, secured nearly 4% of the US residential solar market share last year, overtaking Tesla in the top three spot for the first time.
For the fifth consecutive year, Sunrun holds onto its No. 1 top residential installer position, with 13% of the total market. However, Sunrun’s market share declined – down nearly a point since the previous year. Sunrun’s direct and indirect installation volumes continued to grow, but Covid-19 was to blame for flat fourth-quarter volumes due to labor shortages.
“While Sunrun still maintains a comfortable lead, the rising pressure on the company’s growth rate is a testament to the unyielding momentum of other top players,” said Wood Mackenzie research associate Caitlin Connelly. “An example is Freedom Forever, who made the most notable shift in rankings as it secured 3.9% of the total US residential solar market and squeezed Tesla out of a top three spot for the first time. ”
Freedom Forever’s installation volumes grew by 80% in 2021, and the company entered 12 new US state markets. Simultaneously, Tesla has become increasingly dependent on subcontractors for solar installations as the company shifts its business model more towards that of a full-suite technology supplier. Given these two factors, we expect to see Tesla continue to decline in the installer rankings over the next several quarters.
If Freedom Forever maintains its momentum, it could edge Titan Solar Power out of its N0. 2 position (4.8% market share) going into 2022. Titan grew installation volumes and market share in 2021, but its growth was smaller compared to previous years. Both Freedom Forever and Titan are  large regional installers with expansive networks, and they have similar business models that rely solely on third-party sales. Their operations overlap in 15 state markets. Sunrun also has a similar model of outsourcing sales to third-party companies, which is a popular tactic for top installers looking to create efficiencies as they expand their geographic footprints.
Interestingly, early in 2021 Freedom Forever selected Sunrun as its primary solar-plus-storage as-a-service provider for the next three years. The company planned to leverage Sunrun’s home solar and battery service offering, as well as its favorably branding among consumers.
Together, Sunrun, Titan Solar Power, and Freedom Forever command over 20% of the US residential solar market, and the competition among the rest is intensifying. In October 2021, SunPower acquired residential solar provider Blue Raven Solar, a move intended to help SunPower expand in the Northwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. With this acquisition, SunPower now holds 2.7% of the market. Momentum has 2.2% in the No. 6 spot, and Trinity Solar is No. 7 with a 2% share.
“The acquisition of Blue Raven strengthens SunPower’s direct installation business, expanding their geographic footprint for direct installs from eight to 19 states. SunPower has noted that direct installs are central to expanding service options and revenue streams,” Connelly said.
Residential finance
The top five in the residential finance market accounted for 70% of the financing of the residential market in 2021, up from 60% the previous year. This market is consolidating, which drives up competition and drives down interest rates and dealer fees.
Top financier position again goes to GoodLeap with 26% of the total market. Sunrun leads the third-party owned (TPO) market, capturing 15%. While TPO capacity volumes grew in 2021, loan volumes continue to dominate new growth and now represent over 60% of the market. Wood Mackenzie analysts expect this trend to become the norm over the next couple of years before the investment tax credit expires for customer-owned systems in 2023.
The US commercial solar market continues to consolidate for both development and asset ownership. Borrego leads the pack with 10% of total market share for the second year in a row.
The top 75 national installers accounted for over 60% of the market for the first time since 2013, when Leaderboard data begins. The top asset owners now command almost 40% of the annual market, up from 32% last year. While commercial solar remains a difficult business to scale, many top developers and asset owners have grown their businesses faster through this route, according to WoodMac.
