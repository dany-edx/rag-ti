With a total capital investment of $10 billion, the project is expected to produce 2 million tons of green ammonia annually for regional and global markets. The feasibility and implementation agreement between Hyphen and the government is set to be signed this week, in cooperation with German investors.
Plug Power has secured three 5 MW electrolyzer projects with Ardagh Glass Limmared in Sweden, Hydro Havrand in Norway, and APEX Group in Germany. The projects mark the inaugural use of large-scale green hydrogen in glass manufacturing, aluminum recycling, and steel production. With a production capacity exceeding 2 tons per day, Plug Power says its standardized turnkey system is unmatched in the market.
Thyssenkrupp Nucera has partnered with H2 Green Steel to establish Europe's inaugural large-scale green steel plant. The project in Boden, northern Sweden, will deploy standardized 20 MW electrolysis modules, enabling a capacity of more than 700 MW. This collaboration will also result in one of Europe's largest water electrolysis facilities, said Thyssenkrupp Nucera. Operations will start by the end of 2025, with a gradual scale-up in 2026. During the initial phase, the plant will produce 2.5 million tons of green steel, with a projected increase to 5 million tons by 2030.
An international research team have proposed the use of solid nitrogen or oxygen to recycle cold energy in the hydrogen liquefaction supply chain. The researchers – from Austria, Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea – said the process involves re-gasifying hydrogen upon arrival, generating solid nitrogen or oxygen. These solids are then transported back to a hydrogen liquefaction facility within the liquid hydrogen carrier, effectively reducing energy consumption for cooling gaseous hydrogen. They noted a significant energy reduction of 25.4% with N2 and a saving of 27.3% with O2. The team concluded that solid air hydrogen liquefaction (SAHL) could serve as the crucial component for a global hydrogen economy. They published their findings in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.
New York State Governor Kathy Hochul has announced a $10 million initiative to advance innovative clean hydrogen R&D and demonstration projects in hard-to-electrify sectors. “This solicitation is open to fund projects proposed by New York-based entities that are also actively applying for federal clean hydrogen funding opportunities,” said Hochul.
Lifte H2 and Cratos have agreed to collaborate on hydrogen solutions for utilities and industrial customers. “Industry collaboration is necessary in order to unlock the full potential of a hydrogen economy,” said Paul Karzel, Lifte H2 head of industry relations.

A real-world study was recently conducted at the Green Energy Park research platform in Ben Guerir, Morocco, to evaluate the performance of antistatic and hydrophobic coatings for PV panels in challenging, semi-arid weather conditions.
The study, done in collaboration with Portuguese anti-soiling specialist ChemiTek Solar, involved testing various coating and cleaning strategies on five PV systems, all featuring the same technologies and electrical configurations.
The first PV system remained uncleaned and did not undergo any coating or cleaning solutions. The second PV system was periodically cleaned with just water. The third PV system employed ChemiTek's Solar Wash Protect (SWP) cleaning and antistatic protection solution. The fourth and fifth PV systems, the company's other solutions D-Solar Defender (DSD) and Industrial Glass Protect (IGP) respectively, employed unique combinations of two hydrophobic coatings.
After nine months of operation, the results demonstrated significant efficiency gains in the coated PV panels compared to the reference system. During the initial three-month cleaning period, the average efficiency gain of the coated PV panels was approximately 10%. In the subsequent non-cleaning period of six months, the efficiency gain remained around 5%. The cumulative energy gain of the coated systems, compared to the water-cleaned reference, reached an average of 3% after the outdoor exposure period.
The presence of the coatings on the PV modules significantly reduced the quantity of water needed to clean them. The SWP  cleaning and antistatic protection solution, for instance, required 50% less water compared to the system cleaned without a cleaning solution. The SWP detergent for solar module cleaning and protection was more successful at dust removal during the dry season (August-February) with low rain rates. However, during the rainy season (March-April), IGP outperformed SWP and DSD, with a small difference in PV performance.
“This study demonstrates the significance of using new cleaning strategies such as anti-soling coatings in dry areas to enhance the performance of photovoltaic systems, which may be useful for investors, researchers, and engineers interested in grid-connected photovoltaic and self-cleaning technology,” the researchers said in “Performance Analysis of Innovative Cleaning and Soiling Mitigation Solutions in the Semi-Arid Climate of Benguerir, Morocco,” which was recently published in Heliyon.

The Environmental Assessment Service (SEA) of the Chilean region of Antofagasta has approved the environmental impact study for the 862.5 MW Parque Terra Energía Renovable hybrid solar-wind project, which will consist of a photovoltaic plant with a capacity of 512.5 MW and a 350 MW wind farm, to be located in the commune of Taltal in the northern province of Antofagasta.
The $750 million project, presented by Energía Eólica Paposo and approved by the SEA, is scheduled to start feeding energy into the national electrical grid in the first half of 2027. Energía Eólica Paposo is a subsidiary of AES, part of US energy company AES Corporation.
The 512.5 MW PV park will comprise more than 1.1 million panels and arranged “in chains,” each of which will be made up of 28 panels.
“In this context, the photovoltaic park will be made up of a total of 164 blocks of photovoltaic panels made up of a total of 13,117 chains mounted on support structures following a mobile N-S axis,” the project report reads.
For its part, the wind farm will have an installed capacity of 350 MW and include 50 generators of 7 MW each.
The project is expected to have a lifespan of 35 years; the construction phase is estimated to take two years, which will require a maximum of 900 workers in the construction phase, while 20 people are expected to be hired for the operation phase.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/26/annual-floating-solar-additions-to-top-6-gw-by-2031-says-woodmac/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 26, 2023","Annual floating solar additions to top 6 GW by 2031, says WoodMac","The global FPV fleet is expected to grow at a steady rate as land scarcity and increasing land cost for ground-mounted PV projects continues to drive demand. By 2031, the annual FPV capacity additions are expected to top the 6 GW threshold, according to research firm Wood Mackenzie.
Fifteen countries are forecasted to exceed 500 MW of cumulative FPV installations by 2031. China, India, and Indonesia, which made up almost 70% of the total FPV demand in 2022, are forecast to stay in the lead.
WoodMac expects FPV to have a steady market share compared to overall global solar demand, with the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for FPV expected to rise 15% in the 2022-31 period.
“Despite development costs of FPVs ranging between 20-50% higher than comparable ground-mount projects, increased competitiveness in the developer and EPC landscape is helping to drive down costs in the sector,” Ting Yu, a consultant at Wood Mackenzie, said at the SNEC PV Power Expo in Shanghai this week.

The Asia-Pacific market will continue to lead demand. The region had approximately 3 GW of floating solar projects in 2022, capturing over 90% of the global FPV market. In China, cumulative FPV capacity is projected to cross 13 GW by 2031 at a 12% CAGR over the next 10 years.
“China will continue to lead in floating solar installations. The country has been able to utilize flooded coal mines that have been decommissioned to develop floating solar,” said Yu.
With almost 150 MW, Europe is the second largest region for FPV demand. The Netherlands, representing 32% of Europe’s FPV market in 2022, is the top developer of FPV projects in Europe, followed by France.
The Netherlands is home to the largest FPV project outside the Asia-Pacific region – the 41.4 MW Sellingen floating solar park, which came online in 2021. However, WoodMac predicts slow growth for the Dutch market after 2025 “as the main spots would have already been developed by this point.”
For the US, floating solar CAGR is estimated at roughly 13% by 2031, where development is being driven in regions with high demand for solar but expensive land costs, including California, Florida, and New Jersey.
“Overall, the floating solar industry has seen high costs across all market segments, due to component costs and other soft cost increases, as a result of supply chain constraints in 2022,” Yu said.
For instance, the rise in price for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was the main driver of high structural balance of system (SBOS) costs for FPV. However, WoodMac expects the cost to fall as the supply chain expands.
According to S&P Global, 3.4 GW of floating PV capacity was installed across the world by the end of 2021. The market intelligence firm predicts that global floating PV demand will reach up to 14 GW by 2026. About 92% of those installations will likely be built in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by favorable policies and installation targets, says S&P Global.

It was launched less than a year ago, but benefits from a decade of experience in electronics manufacturing. It makes one-stop-shop residential PV solutions.
The company made its debut at the SNEC conference in Shanghai, China, showcasing its products for the first time. Among the new entrants at the trade show, Slenergy – a manufacturer with a factory in Chuzhou, in China's Anhui province – said that it produces 15 GW of inverters per year. While currently serving the Chinese market, the company is also exporting to Germany and the Netherlands. Expansion into additional European markets is planned throughout the year, with distribution companies set to be established in Germany, Spain, and Australia.
The ship mentioned by Liu carries the initial shipment of Slenergy's iShare-Home systems bound for Germany. What distinguishes the company is that customers can purchase everything they need from a single supplier, including modules, inverters, batteries, cables, EV-wallboxes, and racking, all packaged together. Installers or end-customers no longer need to select and configure different products; they simply choose the desired system size.
Installation services will be streamlined as Slenergy aims to train installation companies to work specifically with its system. Only installers certified by Slenergy will be authorized to mount the systems on residential rooftops. In exchange, distributors and installers can benefit from simplified logistics, as the systems are pre-assembled and packaged as complete units in warehouses. There is no need to select cable thicknesses or sort batteries and inverters based on size. The cables also come with pre-installed terminals, and the racking solution is directly supplied with the system.
Initially, the company will offer PERC modules, but plans to switch to TOPcon modules next year. The PERC module generates 405 W, has a short circuit current of 13.76 A, an efficiency rating of 20.70%, and weighs 21.2 kg.
According to Slenergy, their smallest system requires around 20 m2 to 30 m2 of roof area, while the largest system covers between 120 m2 and 135 m2. The hybrid inverters have a nominal AC output power ranging from 4 kW to 15 kW. The systems can provide full back-up power equivalent to the respective AC output of the model. The European weighted inverter efficiency ranges from 97.3% to 97.5%, depending on the system size.
The batteries consist of up to four modules, each with 4.6 kWh of usable capacity. CATL supplies the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells. The manufacturer says that the batteries can be discharged up to 90% and have a projected lifespan of 10,000 cycles. Slenergy offers a 10-year performance warranty on the battery. The system is IP65 protected, allowing for outdoor installation.

In the Dominican Republic, the National Energy Commission (CNE) has granted the definitive concession to three contracts for the installation of solar parks located in different regions of the country with a total combined capacity of 148 MW.
The fact that three definitive concessions to as many plants have been granted on the same day has been judged in a statement by the CNE as “a historic milestone.”
The executive director of the CNE, Edward Veras, signed the concessions for the following companies: LCV Ecoener Solares Dominicana, to develop the Planta Solar Photovoltaica Payita 1 project; Cotoperí Solar FV, for the Cotoperí Solar I Photovoltaic Park; and Renewable Energy World Dominicus (R.E.W.D.), for the Parque Solar R.E.W.D. project.
LCV Ecoener Solares Dominicana's Planta Solar Photovoltaica Payita 1 will have a nominal capacity of 50 MW and will be located in the Payita area of the Nagua municipality in the country's northeastern María Trinidad Sánchez province.
Renewable Energy World Dominicus' Parque Solar R.E.W.D., which will also have a nominal capacity of 50 MW, will be developed in the municipality of Villa Hermosa, in the province of La Romana, east of the capital city of Santo Domingo.
The 48.06 MW Cotoperí Solar I Photovoltaic Park, built by Cotoperí Solar FV, will be located in the municipality of Guaymate, also in the province of La Romana.

Sonnen has expanded its production faster than planned, thereby doubling its capacity.
Responding to skyrocketing demand over the past year, the company implemented its expansion to 120,000 PV home storage systems a year earlier than originally planned.
Industry experts expect Sonnen to already reach the 1 million installed PV home storage system mark this year. The German Solar Association reports that around 214,000 new battery storage systems were installed in Germany last year. According to the RWTH Aachen University, more than 110,000 new PV home storage systems were added in the first quarter alone.
As demand grows, so does Sonnen. The number of employees has almost doubled from 800 to 1,500 since the beginning of 2022. Around 450 of them work at the company's headquarters in Wildpoldsried, located in the southern Germany region of Allgäu. Sonnen has also expanded its development center there and added a new training center on site.
“Last year we experienced an unprecedented increase in demand, which we were not able to cover completely despite our production facility, which was only inaugurated in 2021,” explained Sonnen CEO Oliver Koch. “But even if the demand for home storage systems normalizes again, it will remain at a high level.”
With the early expansion of its production capacities, Sonnen can also reliably serve demand from other markets. “With our virtual power plant technology, we are expanding the added value beyond storage and thus securing critical know-how for the digital energy transition in Germany as an industrial and technology location,” Koch said.
Sonnen connects its PV home storage systems to a virtual power plant, offering them on the balancing power market for frequency services, among other things, and allowing the battery systems to contribute to grid stability — a task that is still mainly performed by conventional power plants or large storage facilities. The households that have installed the home storage systems receive additional income opportunities. Recently, Sonnen has also included electric cars in its virtual power plant.

The talk in the packed 28 halls of SNEC (another record) is of 400,000 visitors and more than 2,800 exhibitors. SNEC 2023 is the first post-pandemic show and with China expected to install at least 130 GW this year, it fits this booming market that its leading trade show is also breaking all records.
Leading Chinese module manufacturers have some of the biggest booths at this show and are touting record conversion efficiencies, both on the cell- and module-level, and both in the lab and in mass production. There is much talk of the migration from p-type PERC to n-type technologies, including TOPCon and HJT. Higher and higher conversion efficiencies are accompanied by higher and higher production scale to meet both Chinese demand and overseas demand.
Scaling up quickly is not an art reserved to module manufacturers. pv magazine met with one Chinese inverter manufacturer that is scaling up in blocks of 40 GW. Several production blocks are already in place and either churning out product already or in the near future and additional blocks (up to a cumulative total of ten) can readily be added to meet global demand.
The scale and execution speed of Chinese PV manufacturers is very impressive and flexibility is also at hand when needed. This year’s SNEC is a case in point: when the show’s organizers ran out of conventional exhibition halls they simply filled the old “valley of death” (the vast empty area in the middle of the triangular arrangement of the SNEC exhibition halls) with temporary tent-like exhibition halls. But even without the old “valley of death” it remains a heroic feat to cover all 28 halls in the two-and-a-half days of the SNEC exhibition.
Meanwhile, almost all major research institutes raised their installation targets for China in 2023. BloombergNEF said it expects now 154 GW on new PV, while in its previous forecast it said 129 GW. S & P said 136 GW.
Representatives from multiple module makers expressed even greater optimism, with projections ranging from 150 GW to 200 GW. While last year the technology was heralded as a competitor in the new high-efficiency squad, the trade show floor in Shanghai this year showed a different picture. A whole range of new companies, some of which just a few weeks old, touted modules using TOPcon cells with efficiencies beyond the 23% mark.
These suppliers also stated to make a start in manufacturing in the two-digit gigawatt scale. While it appeared that most manufacturers have made their bet on TOPCon, there were also many new module makers offering HJT modules, similarly with efficiency of above 23%. With some companies offering both module types.
Once a supplier can make modules there is no holding back on storage or inverters. Another trend that could be observed at SNEC that many companies now get their feet wet in the entire solar product portfolio. This was true for well-esteemed players of the solar market, such as GoodWe, which presented a range of BIPV options including solar tiles, or Jinko which has aside from its modules also storage and inverters on offer. But also new market entrants don’t hold back widening their product portfolio.

The Chinese module manufacturer said the Star Pro series is available in five different versions, with power outputs ranging from 560 W to 580 W, and power conversion efficiencies from 21.67% to 22.45%. The open-circuit voltage is between 50.70 V and 51.42 V and the short-circuit current is between 14.12 A and 14.37 A. The panel can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and operating temperatures of -40 C and 85 C.
The modules measure 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 31.7 kg. They also feature an IP68-rated junction box, 2 mm tempered glass, an anodized aluminum alloy frame, and multi-busbar (MBB) technology. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius.
“Compared with the same version of P-type products, Eging PV Star-Pro products power increased by 10 W to 15W, with lower linear power degradation, better temperature coefficient, and low irradiance power generation performance,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “This can increase power generation by 3%, reduce balance of system costs by 2.5%, and reduce LCOE by 6%.”
The new products come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
The solar panels are based on n-type wafers and 182 mm cells. They are suitable for utility-scale projects, as well as industrial and commercial rooftop projects.

Temperatures were recorded as high as 31 C at 60° latitudes, close to 35 C in British Columbia and over 32 C in Alberta.
 
Source: Solcast
The province of Alberta saw close to 100 wildfires raging from the beginning of the month with serious consequences and evacuations for over 30,000 residents and several still burning out of control.
Source: Solcast
Smoke impacts irradiance
Smoke produced by the fires has covered most of western Canada and is being pushed east by the prevailing winds. Aerosols present in smoke can be of concern for health and visibility for residents in the region but also affect solar generation: thick clouds of aerosols from burning biomass are spreading all the way to US's Midwest states, and are clearly visible in ECMWF's CAMS data.
Solar asset operators throughout the impacted regions can expect reduced efficiency from both the irradiance impacts and increased panel soiling.

Irradiance and cloud combine to limit irradiance
Solcast ingests aerosols data for its radiation modeling and the effect on solar generation from the fire's smoke is clearly visible in data accessed via the Solcast API Toolkit. The below comparison shows the irradiance impact in Alberta, differentiating aerosol losses and cloud losses.
This comparison uses the average clearsky May 2022 data as a non-aerosol impacted baseline, and aerosol impacted clearsky data from May 2023, plus Solcast actuals for May 22 and May 23, 2023. Despite dissipating aerosols on the 23rd, peak irradiance was suppressed on both days by cloud and smoke.

Solcast produces these figures via its irradiance forecasting and weather API by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1 to 2 km resolution globally using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

The Association of Energy Market Innovators (BNE) initiated the development of the model contract, with contributions from the German Association of Towns and Municipalities (DStGB), the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW), and the German Association of Local Public Utilities (VKU).
According to the BNE, a ground-mounted PV system with a 50 MW output can result in annual contributions of €100,000 ($107.4 million) to the community budget. Robert Busch, managing director of the BNE, said that increased participation in the energy transition benefits structurally weak regions and promotes acceptance, ensuring that local communities, farmers, and biodiversity benefit from photovoltaics.
Gerd Landsberg, general manager of DStGB, urged operators to promptly submit offers to affected communities, streamlining the process of financial participation and minimizing bureaucracy. Local acceptance of the energy transition is crucial for the PV sector to achieve its ambitious expansion targets.
Wieland Lehnert, an attorney at law firm Becker Büttner Held (BBH), noted that the updated model contract fully incorporates the new legal framework. The updated supplementary sheet addresses legal questions concerning the contract for all parties involved.

On May 23, OPIS assessed the market’s mainstream options, Mono M10 cells at $0.1228 per W and Mono G12 cells at $0.1262/W. Prices of both cell sizes sustained an average 4% drop week on week.

Prices of Mono G1 and M6 cells remain unchanged on-week at $0.1529/W and $0.1316/W respectively; very few transactions around Mono G1 and M6 cells have been reported in the market. Multi cell prices, however, dropped 2.75% to $0.1095/W this week with a source from a major Multi cell manufacturer explaining that the price is expected to drop further due to the significant price cuts in upstream materials.
Although prices along the PV value chain are currently falling, a market participant disclosed that cell prices are expected to stabilize in the coming weeks due to the limited expansion in the production output of p-type cells. Despite this anticipation, cell manufacturers are still maintaining high operating rates on their lines since the market inventory in the cell segment is still at a manageable level.
According to a source at a leading Tier-1 cell manufacturer, they have switched a big part of their production lines from M10 cells to G12 cells due to the high demand for G12 cells which has also resulted in the wider price difference between Mono G12 and M10 cells. The current 20-80 ratio of market share between n-type TOPCon and p-type cells are expected to level off to 50-50 by the middle of 2024, the source expounded further.
Moving forward, cell price trends are expected to mirror upstream prices, but with smaller and gradual drops.
Meanwhile, market players downstream confirmed that module prices remain unchanged this week despite upstream price movements. Like his peers, a source at a leading Tier-1 manufacturer declared that they have no announcements of pricing until after SNEC, suggesting that deals struck between industry players during the trade show will “shift pricing”.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

Agrivoltaics can mitigate the effects of drought on plant-based food production, according to a new study. While shading often reduces crop yields when there is sufficient water, it can actually lead to increased yields during dry phases, as plants benefit from less evaporation, according to “How to reconcile renewable energy and agricultural production in a drying world,” which was recently published in Plants, People, Planet.
The stabilizing effect of agrivoltaics on crop yields has been deemed promising by researchers, particularly in regions with population growth and pronounced droughts like India or Africa, as well as in Europe, where longer dry periods are expected due to climate change. However, additional research is needed to determine the most suitable plants for different systems.
Current studies indicate that most crops tolerate shading up to 15% without significant yield loss, with berries, fruiting crops, and some vegetables benefiting from shading. Leafy vegetables, tubers, root crops, and certain cereals experience minimal yield reduction.
In addition, investigating plant-based stress signals for real-time control of panel orientation and shading could contribute to the development of intelligent agrivoltaic systems, according to the scientists.

US-based Enphase Energy has launched what it says is its most powerful home battery to date in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
The IQ Battery 5P can deliver 3.84 kW continuous power and 7.68 kW peak power for 3 seconds, the company reports. The battery uses a modular design, which starts at 5 kWh of capacity and can be configured up to 80 kWh. The third generation of Enphase Energy System components includes the IQ Battery 5P, IQSystem Controller 3/3G, and IQ Combiner 5/5C. The Enphase Energy System with the IQ Battery 5P can be configured for self-consumption, savings, or full backup functionality.
The IQ Battery 5P can also be used in a grid-tied configuration without backup capabilities, which means it comes without the IQ System Controller. This is a less expensive configuration, and an IQ System Controller can be added at later time to provide backup functionality.
Enphase reports that using the Storm Guard feature of the Enphase app, homeowners can stay prepared for outages by monitoring the National Weather Service for approaching storms. If bad weather is detected, the batteries will fully charge automatically.
IQ batteries feature lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, which provides a long lifecycle and safer operation with thermal stability. Enphase reports that because the battery operates with low-voltage DC power,  installing the battery is safe, as installers are not exposed to high-voltage current. Enphase reports that its batteries are NEMA 3R rated, which is a designation by the National Electrical Manufacturers’ Association that indicates that the battery enclosure is safe for indoor and outdoor use and is protected from adverse weather conditions. The batteries meet UL 9540A performance criteria, a test for thermal runaway fire propagation protection in residential indoor wall-mounted systems.
The IQ Battery 5P comes with a 15-year limited warranty.
In Q1 2023, Enphase battery sales were down 23% over the previous quarter, as installers focused on rolling out new solar systems. Enphase CEO, Badri Kothandaraman, said he expects this trend to continue in the next quarter. “After that, we see NEM 3.0 as a net positive for California and expect strong demand to resume for solar plus storage.”
NEM 3.0 went into effect on April 15, 2023, after the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved the new net metering scheme which will slash payments for excess solar production sent to the grid by 75%. For customers in California, the Enphase system is optimized to support California’s new NEM 3.0 rules by enabling self-consumption and exporting energy at the appropriate times to create maximum value.
California installers can also use Enphase’s Solargraf platform to design and generate system proposals that optimize for NEM 3.0.
“California continues to be one of our top markets and the new IQ Battery 5P will enable our customers to maximize the value of their home solar systems with the new net metering rules,” said Bryson Solomon, chief executive officer of Infinity Energy, a Rocklin, Calif.-based installer of residential and commercial solar and storage.
The IQ Battery 5P can be ordered now, with shipments expected to begin in the third quarter of 2023.
