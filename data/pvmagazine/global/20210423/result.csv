France's renewable energy associations, Enerplan and SER, have cooperated with several regional governments in the country to publish a report on the impact of ground-mounted PV parks on biodiversity.
They conducted the research over a relatively short period of time – the first half of 2020. They aim to supplement it with a second research project in the 2021-22 period. They looked at 111 solar projects in Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie and other parts of France. They looked at three different ecosystems – Atlantic, Mediterranean, and mid-European.
They looked at the flora and three faunal components, including butterflies, reptiles, and birds. However, there was too little information to analyze evolutionary trends applicable to other insects such as amphibians, bats, and terrestrial mammals.
The observed a positive impact and noted that the effects of the projects were often linked to the appearance of new species, both local and invasive. For the fauna, the findings depended on the species observed. The researchers observed positive trends for butterflies, for example. For the flora, the impact mainly depends on the original state of the environment, they said.
The impact on birds also varies greatly, depending on the species, they found. The transformation of a site with heavy vegetation to a more open environment due to the clearing of trees seems to favor the arrival of new anthropophilic species, the researchers said.

Coradia iLint is reportedly the world’s first hydrogen train. “After 18 months in passenger service, we are very pleased with the performance of the Alstom Coradia iLint fuel cell hydrogen trains. The technology is now tried and true ticking all boxes: sustainability, economic viability and customer satisfaction. We can’t wait to have the first serial trains in operation,” commented Carmen Schwabl, CEO of Lower Saxony Transport Authority, during an event organized on Wednesday.
Building a low-carbon hydrogen economy can be a crucial cornerstone in achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement, reads the study “Laying the foundations of a low carbon hydrogen market in Europe” by Strategy&, the strategy consulting arm of management consulting firm PwC. According to the report, global demand for hydrogen will almost double from 71 to 137 million metric tons per year by 2040, compared with 2019. The growth will be primarily due to the decarbonization of various sectors such as transportation, aviation and industry. Demand is expected to reach 519 million metric tons by 2070.
Chile‘s Economic Development Agency, Corfo, and the Ministry of Energy launched the first call for funding Green Hydrogen projects in the South American country.”National and foreign companies that want to develop and implement a green hydrogen production project greater than 10 MW that will be operational no later than December 2025 may apply. To this end, resources for a maximum of 30 million dollars will be provided to one or more projects,” the call states. The deadline to apply for Chile’s first call is September 6, 2021.
Australia will spend US$213.07 million to develop hydrogen, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday, adding that $203.94 million will be invested in carbon capture storage (CCS) projects. The announcement came on Wednesday ahead of the ongoing Climate Summit organized by US President Joe Biden. “I want Australia and hydrogen technology to be synonymous around the world,” he commented, adding that the government wants to invest in four regional hubs, while implementing a certification scheme. According to an article published in The Conversation by Michelle Grattan, potential areas for the hubs include Latrobe Valley (Victoria), Darwin (Northern Territory), the Pilbara (Western Australia), Gladstone (Queensland), the Hunter Valley (NSW), Bell Bay (Tasmania) and the Eyre Peninsula (South Australia).
Meanwhile, Japan and South Korea are looking into a stronger hydrogen collaboration with Australia. “Santos is already attracting strong interest from Japanese and Korean customers and investors who are looking to reduce emissions from coal-fired power stations using hydrogen and the possibility of shipping their CO2 to Australia for permanent storage,” said Kevin Gallagher, managing director and CEO of the Australian energy company, on Wednesday.
Queensland-based aerospace firm Hypersonix Launch Systems has announced a partnership with Linde’s subsidiary BOC. The deal will see Hypersonix use green hydrogen produced by solar electrolysis as rocket fuel to launch re-useable satellites into lower earth orbit. “Both the automotive and the aviation sectors are well along the path to making the use of hydrogen fuel as a clean fuel option for day-to-day use,” commented Chris Dolman, business development manager of clean hydrogen at BOC.
The H2SITE consortium, created a year ago by Spain's Tecnalia in collaboration with the French company Engie and the University of Eindhoven (TUe), is building a plant in the Spanish Basque Country for the industrialization of its membranes. These reactors “use very little electrical energy, only a few tens of kilowatts, because we do not use electricity to obtain hydrogen, as is the case with electrolysis,” Andrés Galnares, CEO of H2SITE, told pv magazine. “In terms of hydrogen production capacity, our intention is to design systems that can go up to 4,000 kg per day,” he added.
Barcelona-based Carburos Metálicos, a subsidiary of US-headquartered Air Products active in the industrial and medical gases sector, will provide hydrogen for local transportation in Oviedo, the capital of Asturias. Local transportation company Transportes Unidos de Asturias (TUA) will operate the first urban bus line in Spain running on renewable hydrogen. The testing phase will last three months. “Our participation in this new project exemplifies our collaborative strategy to promote the creation of a hydrogen ecosystem in Spain,” said Miquel Lope, general manager of Carburos Metálicos and vice president of Air Products in Southern Europe and the Maghreb.
Japanese car manufacturer Toyota announced on Thursday that it is developing a hydrogen engine for motorsports. “It has installed the engine on a racing vehicle based on Toyota's Corolla Sport, which it will enter in competition under the ORC ROOKIE Racing banner starting with the Super Taikyu Series 2021 Powered by Hankook Round 3 NAPAC Fuji Super TEC 24 Hours Race on May 21-23,” reads a press note.
US-based oil and gas companies Chevron and Toyota Motor North America signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on commercially viable, large-scale businesses in hydrogen. The focus of the strategic collaboration will be on fuel cell electric vehicles and joint research and development activities in hydrogen-powered transportation and storage.
Zero-emission vehicles manufacturer Nikola Corporation and TravelCenters of America, the largest publicly-traded operator of full-service travel centers in the United States, have agreed to collaborate on the installation of hydrogen fueling stations for heavy-duty trucks at two existing TA-Petro sites. “This collaboration is a first step for the parties to explore the mutual development of a nationwide network of hydrogen fueling stations. The collaboration is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive documentation acceptable to the parties,” reads a press release published on Thursday. The first stations should be commercially operational by Q1 2023.

“This value measured under the terrestrial AM1.5g spectrum sets a new world record and demonstrates the potential of silicon-based tandem photovoltaics,” the research institute stated.
The cell, which looks externally like a device with a two-terminal architecture, was built with III-V semiconductor layers that were connected to the silicon sub-cell on the atomic level. The key for achieving the record power conversion efficiency was the use of a semiconductor material based on gallium-indium-arsenide-phosphide (GaInAsP) for the middle cell.
“The new material allowed us to further improve the lifetime of the charge carriers and thus achieve a higher cell voltage,” said researcher Patrick Schygulla. “It's great to see how our material development has successfully contributed to improvements in III-V//Si triple-junction solar cells.”
The scientists claim the cell may be used in electrically powered aircraft and drones.
In August, the Fraunhofer ISE achieved a 25.9% conversion efficiency rate for a III-V tandem solar cell grown directly on silicon. This cell is a modified version of a 34.5%-efficient III-V solar cell that is manufactured through a process known as direct wafer bonding, where the III-V layers are first deposited on an aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate and then pressed together.
The cost of producing solar cells based on compounds of III-V element materials – named according to the groups of the periodic table that they belong to – has confined such devices to niche applications, including drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than costs in relation to the energy produced.
Researchers at the Tampere University in Finland have recently developed a III-V multi-junction solar cell which is claimed to have the potential for reaching a power conversion efficiency of close to 50%. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States announced last year a 32.9% efficiency for a tandem cell device utilizing III-V materials.

The panel has a power conversion efficiency of 22.3% and a claimed temperature coefficient of 0.28% degrees Celsius. “The price of 1m2 of Hevel BIPV is comparable to that of middle-range hinged ventilated facades,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine. “However its PV-generation capacity allows for an investment return in several years by saving on electricity costs.”
The new product measures 2004 х 1048 х 46 mm and weighs 40 kg. It features an open-circuit voltage of 53.18 V and a short-circuit current of 9.21 А. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.

The HR-Hybrid Coalition has urged the Dutch government to allocate €600 million for the plan, which envisages the deployment of up to 2 million hybrid heat pumps before 2030, which would generate CO2 savings of up to 2.6 megatons. The organizations described the plan in a joint statement as a “substantial contribution to the objectives of the Climate Agreement and the stricter CO2 requirements of 55% of the European Union.”
The funds for the incentive program should be allocated on an annual basis in the amount of €120 million until 2026 and the money would be initially used for demonstrators, product innovation and monitoring the performance of hybrid systems. After 2026, no more subsidies would be required, as innovation and lower product and installation costs should drive down hybrid heat pump costs. “In every district, work can already be done on making it more sustainable to prepare for a completely natural gas-free heating supply,” said Dick Weiffenbach, director of Netbeheer Nederland.
The organizations explained that each year more than 400,000 natural gas boilers are replaced, and that new high-efficiency boilers should be combined with hybrid heat pumps where possible. Hybrid heat pumps are said to be relatively easy to install and to save homeowners up to 70% on natural gas consumption for heating.
The coalition wants to focus on residential areas that will not become free of natural gas for the time being and areas where municipalities opt for hybrid heat pumps as a sustainable heat supply for the coming years. “At a later stage, these homes can still be made natural gas-free,” stated Doekle Terpstra, president of Techniek Nederland. “But until then, let's limit CO2 emissions as much as possible. Then the homeowner or tenant will also benefit from a lower energy bill.”
The Netherlands continues to be one of the would's most creative countries in terms of innovative ways to integrate solar power, as network constraints are growing with the deployment of new PV capacity. In March, the country’s largest utility, Liander, said that it would test a new solution developed by Amsterdam-based startup Recoy to manage the growing amount of solar power going through its grid at peak times during sunny hours. They will use demand from big electric boilers that convert electricity into heat in the form of steam and hot water.
In January, Dutch transmission system operator Tennet, which also serves Germany, said it was planning to create flexible electricity demand and reduce grid congestion by promoting the use of smarter heating systems and heat pumps that can also be powered by solar and wind energy. According to its experts, intelligent control of heat pumps may result in the creation of between 0.5 and 1 GW of temporary grid flexibility by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/23/average-silver-price-expected-to-reach-27-3-per-ounce-this-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 23, 2021",Average silver price expected to reach $27.3 per ounce this year,"The overall global supply of silver is expected to grow 8% year-on-year in 2021, according to industry body The Silver Institute.
Mine production is also forecast to rise by 8% this year as output recovers after last year's pandemic–related disruptions, which led to a 5.9% decline in global silver supply last year. “This forecast pick-up in demand is predicated on a recovery in vehicle manufacturing, strong consumer electronics demand, and further gains from the solar sector,” the analysts said. “Jewelry and silverware demand should enjoy double-digit increases in 2021.”
Citing data from Metal Focus, a US-based independent precious metals research consultancy, the Silver Institute experts said that silver price would peak at $32 per ounce later this year and that it would average $27.30 overall in 2021, which would be the highest average silver price since 2013. This price level would represent a 33% increase compared to last year, when the metal's average price reached $20.55, which was in turn 27% higher than in 2019.
In 2020, total silver demand for the PV industry totaled 101.0 million ounces and in 2019 it reached 98.7 million ounces.
The analyst said the Covid-19 crisis revived investors' appetite for silver last year. “Strong institutional and retail investor demand, fueled initially by the onset of the pandemic, combined with intermittently lower silver prices, as well as an unprecedented wave of quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus across all major economies, led to the sizeable silver investment recorded last year.
“Although significant, this growth in the average price is still far away from any critical threshold that would make silver supply for the solar industry problematic,” Michael DiRienzo, executive director at The Silver Institute, told pv magazine in mid-February. “An average price of over $40, which would mean peak prices of around $45, would eventually become the critical limit to cross.”
In a recent interview with pv magazine, US analyst Matthew Watson said that the share of silver in PV module costs had risen by around 5% in recent months to account for approximately 10% of the total. “With PV module costs in the neighborhood of $0.018-$0.019/watt and silver representing around 10% of the overall module cost structure, and module and cell prices still declining, finding a means to lower the silver cost component is going to become an increasingly difficult task,” Watson stated. “Over the past 20 years, silver has averaged an 8.31% year-on-year growth in prices, which is greater than the current rate of design thrifting. This means lowering that silver $/watt component is going to be very difficult.”

Gujarat-based Torrent Power, the integrated power utility of the Torrent Group, has announced it has secured a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for 300 MW of solar capacity that it will build in Gujarat.
Under the PPA, the company will supply the electricity produced from the plant to its licensed distribution business unit at a price of INR 2.22/kWh ($0.03/kWh).
The project is estimated to cost INR 1,250 crore ($167 million) and is scheduled to be commissioned within 18 months from the PPA date.
Torrent Power is one of the largest companies in the country’s power sector, with a presence across the entire power value chain – generation, transmission, and distribution. It has an installed renewable power capacity of 786.5 MW (comprising 648.5 MW of operational wind power capacity and 138 MW of solar power), in addition to 2,730 MW of gas-based capacity and 362 MW of coal-based capacity. Further, it has an under-development RE portfolio comprising 115 MW of wind power capacity and 400 MW of solar power (including the 300 MW capacity for which it recently signed the PPA).
For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the company reported a significant increase in profitability after the pandemic-hit first half of FY2020-21. It attributed improved results to a marked improvement in collection efficiency in the franchised distribution business; an increase in contribution from renewable generation due to capacity addition; and a decrease in interest cost, both due to lower debt and reduction in interest rates.

“There is a storm of supply and demand factors going on here,” he said in a statement to pv magazine. “But basically, there is a new level of capacity demand that can’t be kept up with, everyone is facing the brunt of this crisis situation.” The most affected by the supply glut are the Tier 2 module manufacturers, as they found themselves at the back of the queue when a first rebound materialized after the market contraction by the outbreak of the Covid-19 crisis, he added.
Qian further explained that, initially, the problem was only a temporary delay in supplies as factories had to shut down when the coronavirus pandemic first hit. “Although the production is back to normal now, the new surge in downstream demand has driven the polysilicon shortage to a crisis point,” he stated. Tier 1 panel makers, instead, will be the first choice for polysilicon suppliers and will always get preference in the pecking order, irrespective of market conditions, due to their scale and purchasing power, according Qian.
The company's analysts are convinced that the polysilicon shortage will continue “for a while,” as there are no signs of its supply catching up anytime soon, with consequences on the whole PV supply chain. Furthermore, it is expected that silver and copper will also see upward price trends. According to the company's projections, polysilicon prices are not expected to decline in the next six-month time frame and the upward trend may stay for “even longer.”
Citing a recent report from the Taiwanese market research company EnergyTrend,  the manufacturer said that the latest polysilicon price was around RMB 135 ($20.8)/kg, which was 3.31% higher compared to the previous month, and that a further price increase to RMB 150/kg was likely to be reported very soon.
Referring to the Indian market, Daniel Liu, Jinko's general manager for South & Central Asia, said that Jinko had not backed out from any of the signed deals with its Indian customers due to the raw material supply shortage and the rising prices, as reported by unspecified false reports. “There will be an overlap, with demand peaking during Q4 in India too because of the BCD [basic customs duty] announcement from next year forcing developers to secure shipments by March 2022,” he stated. “This will further leave little or no room for price drops, but we are well equipped to face this challenge.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/23/asia-pacifics-solarized-digitization-agenda/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,ASIA",,"APRIL 23, 2021",Asia Pacific’s solarized digitization agenda,"Asia-Pacific accounts for 60% of the global population (4.4 billion people). It also comprises some of the world’s fastest rising economies supported by technological/cryptocurrency innovation that is highly energy intensive. This has resulted in a high growth of electricity generation, fueled predominantly (85%) by fossil fuels and, in particular, coal.
Three of the six largest carbon dioxide-emitting countries – China, India, and Japan – are located in Asia-Pacific; they produce around half of the world’s carbon dioxide with the highest emission intensity. As a result, the region is also increasingly exposed to extreme weather events.


CBCD

With 2020 witnessing the Covid-19 pandemic and being the warmest year on record, there is an urgent need to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to transition the Asia-Pacific region towards carbon neutrality.
A few countries in the region, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Bhutan, Fiji, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, and Nepal have set 2050 carbon neutrality targets. China also has net zero goals set for 2060. These commitments are incorporated in their Nationally Determined Contributions.
The energy sector is the world’s number one pollutant, accounting for 72% of global GHG emissions (of which electricity and heat account for over 30%), according to the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions. With energy demands continually increasing, pushing CO2 emissions to their highest levels in history, methods of generating large quantities of clean energy have become a survival concern for the Asia-Pacific region.
As a result, the region has shifted its focus to decarbonization of the grid and production of electricity from renewable energy with 65 new renewable power plant contracts announced in the region during March 2021 alone. Eighty percent of these plants are solar.
China leads the world as the top producer of solar energy to transform industrial structure, economy, and society with disruptive innovation in the next generation of photovoltaic module technology for both earth and space applications. Japan ranks second, India third, and South Korea fourth in the region in this regard. These four countries are also conducting research on space-based solar power and power beaming as a solution to the region’s transition towards carbon neutrality, with Japan and China emerging as international leaders in this area.
Recently, the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) conducted a Photovoltaic Radio-frequency Antenna Module Flight Experiment (PRAM-FX) to transform solar power into radio frequency microwave energy aboard the U.S. Space Force's X-37B robotic space plane. According to Dr. Paul Jaffe of NRL,  PRAM-FX is a 12-inch (30.5 centimeters) square tile that collects solar energy and converts it to microwave power but is not beaming it anywhere. Rather, the experiment is gauging the performance of sunlight-to-microwave conversion.
With the Covid-19 pandemic, industrial digitization has entered a new phase of explosive development. “Today, we are faced with not one but two deep transformations. The first one, driven by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things, 5G and many others, is changing how governments, businesses, and individuals will act in this new century,” said Houlin Zhao, Secretary-General, International Telecommunication Union, which organizes events and publishes reports to raise awareness of the role of frontier technologies with regards to the environment, climate change, and the circular economy.
He continued, “As for the second transformation, climate change, it disrupts ecosystems, jeopardizing biodiversity, food, and water security and the future of life on our planet. The question for us is whether humanity can turn this digital revolution into climate action and, most importantly, whether we can do it before it is too late…… [Because] with more and more people coming online, more data being generated and more devices connecting to the network, the digital ecosystem’s carbon footprint is growing.”
The Asia-Pacific region boasts tremendous potential, owing to growing prominence in mobile payments, and the implementation of central bank issued currencies (CBDC) in various countries. For example, China’s Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) is developing a global network that will support future CBDCs from multiple countries. The adoption of 5G technology is also a catalyst for blockchain implementation to improve scalability and interoperability.
The role of digitization has become central to continued economic and societal activity and to the lessening of the Covid pandemic impact. According to recent reports, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to contribute about 19.3% of the overall global spending on blockchain technology fueled by increased investments by the Fintech sector. Integration of biometrics in smartphones amid the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to grow blockchain based digital identity solutions by 21%.
The ever-increasing demand for connectivity and bandwidth by billions of devices in the region has made it important for wireless networks, blockchain platforms, and computing devices to limit the total communications energy consumption and associated carbon footprint.With 5G being commercially deployed worldwide, LG Electronics and Huawei have already began working towards launching 6G networks which will be 50 times faster than the 5G network in spectrum efficiency, positioning capabilities, and mobility. Studies show that 6G could provide energy self-sustainability (ESS) to massive IoE devices with blockchain technology central to addressing significant challenges.
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing Asia-Pacific. A newly released IMF staff paper makes fiscal policy recommendations for the region focused in three areas:

Purified spherical graphite is a key component of lithium-ion batteries, which is why a handful of companies across the world are racing to become the first producers outside of China, as the global wave of demand begins begins to peak.
South Australian company Renascor Resources seems to have taken a lead in the race, announcing that it has raised enough to fund its Siviour battery anode material project to the construction phase, which is set to begin in 2022.
The AUD 15 million ($11.6 million) fundraising was led by institutional investors in Australia and overseas. Their monetary commitments will fund the completion of all technical, regulatory and marketing work streams, as the company works toward reaching a final investment decision on the Siviour project, it said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange.
Renascor’s Siviour project is a vertically integrated battery anode material manufacturing operation in South Australia. It includes the AUD 118 million Siviour graphite mine and concentrator on the Eyre Peninsula. It also includes a $90 million purified spherical graphite (PSG) manufacturing facility in Port Adelaide.
The company is sitting on the world’s second-largest proven reserve of graphite and the largest graphite reserve outside of Africa. It says it will be able to create graphite concentrate at among the lowest costs in the world, “competitive with current Chinese production and advantaged over other developments outside of China.”
There are a handful of other companies vying to get in early, banking on market appetite for diversifying purified spherical graphite supply chains outside of China. Norway, Sweden and Germany are all in the game, and Australian startup International Graphite is well on its way, too.
International Graphite’s CEO Neil Rinaldi believes increased production will drive demand. “There’s room of us, there’s room for others. I think the industry only benefits from having more participants,” he told pv magazine Australia.

The political parties that form Germany's current coalition government, CDU/CSU and SPD, have reached an agreement on how to expand the nation's tenders for renewable energy.
Their agreement for additional power tenders is particularly encouraging for photovoltaics, as allocations for solar could increase from 1.9 GW to 6 GW in 2022. An additional 2 GW could become available for ground-mounted projects, as well as 2 GW of rooftop installations. And another 100 MW might also be allocated for innovation tenders focusing on agrivoltaics and floating PV, according to a letter from the CDU/CSU and SPD parliamentary groups that pv magazine has seen.
They aim to increase the amount of tendered onshore wind power from 2.9 to 4 GW in 2022. In addition, they have argued that the number of tenders not awarded in 2021 and 2022 should be made up for in the following years. If the volumes are not awarded or built again, they should be allocated to the volumes in the following innovation tenders, the parties said.
The CDU/CSU and the SPD have also agreed to lower the levy in 2023 and 2024 that finances all of Germany’s renewable energy incentives programs under its renewable energy law (EEG). By as early as 2021 and 2022, the federal government has decided to lower the EEG levy slightly to €0.065 and €0.060 per kWh with its pandemic stimulus package.
“In addition to the growing income from CO2 certificate trading, it is currently becoming apparent that the additional funds in the energy and climate fund for the EEG surcharge are not needed in full,” the parties said in their letter.
A reduction of around €0.015 per kWh is planned for 2023 from CO2 trading income alone. The reduction to below €0.05 per kWh is therefore probably possible.
Improvements also seem to be on the way for the storage industry. The government coalition plans to improve the investment and operating conditions for storage through regulations that go beyond the provisions in the previous draft, according to the letter to the members of parliament.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/23/solar-101-attaching-your-pv-system-to-your-roof/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 23, 2021",Solar 101: Attaching your PV system to your roof,"From pv magazine USA
In our first article of our Solar 101 series, (Is my roof ready for solar?) we discussed the age of our roof and how it affects the finances involved in a solar installation.
Now, we’ll consider the roof’s physical characteristics. After all, the roofing material type and its underlying structure, as well the various angles of its faces and layout, will affect many aspects of the installation.
Attaching the panels
Most rooftops in the United States are built up from plywood and finished with asphalt shingles. However, depending on your region and neighborhood aesthetic, the top layer of the roofing type can vary greatly. We often find Spanish tiles in the south, metal seam roofs in the far north, and clay, slate, and concrete tile products peppered all over the map.
All of these roof types will require a mechanical attachment.
QuickMountPV offers up an installation guide – with a very nice series of images – for those installing solar power on top of tiled roofs.
In this installation tweet from Sunrun, you can see how to attach to the plywood base layer of a roof. Underneath the metal flashing, you can see a series of lag bolts and silicon that cures and seals the attachment.
A metal seam roof will also require a hard attachment to the roof, but via a less obtrusive tool, perhaps by someone like S-5!. This quick video by S-5! gives an idea of how that attachment occurs.
But most installations won’t be like these three examples. They will use standard flashing and lag bolts drilled through the existing asphalt shingles.
All major racking manufacturers provide this hardware. Quickbolt offers a unique – almost cute – “microflashing” unit. This is as simple as it gets: drill hole, install sealant, tighten fastener.
Racking hardware connects your panels to the L-feet and the flashing connections mentioned above. All of this hardware is built to engineering specifications and are ready to hold up to the worst that Mother Nature can deliver.
Building codes
In South Florida, the local building code requires some rooftop solar systems within a mile of the ocean to be able to withstand uplift generated by winds greater than 180 miles per hour. In the northern United States, snow loads greater than 50 pounds per square foot must be accounted for.
Wind and snow loads dictate a lot about how your solar system is designed. Racking manufacturer Unirac includes general solar panel setback from the edge of roof requirements in its installation manuals.
In the images below, the areas where wind forces are highest are represented in gray. Thus, engineers suggest we ‘”set back” our solar panels from these areas, or pay extra for hardware to strengthen the attachment points.
The strength of a solar racking system is determined in part by the metal racking, but it also depends on the roof’s underlying structure. Specifically, rafters (or trusses) and any supporting structures must be strong enough to withstand your region’s maximum wind loads.
The lag bolts noted above are generally drilled into the wood beams underneath the base layer of your roof’s plywood. As a rule of thumb, in most homes we’re looking for a minimum of two-inch-thick wood beams spaced no more than 36 inches apart.
Your installer will most likely consult with a state-certified structural engineer to determine if your home’s construction is appropriate for solar. While most homes are deemed structurally sound, proving that to some building departments can sometimes be a bit costly.
Roof chunks
Now that we’ve covered the basics of connecting solar panels to a roof, it’s time to find a place for the panels. The most obvious feature we’re looking for is large, uninterrupted roof space. Bigger chunks of roof are easier, and cheaper, to install solar panels.
Keep in mind that a standard residential solar panel is roughly five and a half feet tall by three feet wide. Pictured below, this 290 to 320 watt solar panel from URE represents a standard residential product. Panel sizes vary by manufacturer and model. For instance, Solaria’s 400 W PowerXT high efficiency panel is an extra six inches wider.
Using these approximate sizes of the panels and our roof, we can determine roughly how many panels will fit on our roof, and where.
