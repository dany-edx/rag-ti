On Sept. 14, Spanish grid operator Red Eléctrica de España (REE) reported that large-scale PV capacity in Spain had reached 17,142 MW. This means that solar has surpassed hydro, which up until now was in third place, with 17,094 MW. But PV is still behind wind power, with 29,512 MW, and combined cycle plants at 26,250 MW.
The total installed generating capacity in Spain currently stands at 115,957 MW. In percentage terms, the PV plants represent 14.78% of the country's total power generation capacity.
About 2.5 GW of additional solar projects – mostly residential and C&I installations – have been built under Spain's self-consumption regime. This means that the country’s total installed PV capacity, including large-scale projects, could already be above the 20 GW mark.
In early September, the REE said that in the first eight months of the year, the country's PV systems collectively generated around 21,000 GWh, which already exceeds the full-year total of 20,954 GWh in 2021.

Germany's Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has announced that it will soon launch an additional tender to deploy 1.5 GW of PV capacity.
The deadline to submit project proposals will be set for Jan. 15, 2023. In this so-called “crisis tender,” projects must not exceed 100 MW in size. The selected PV projects will have to reach completion within nine months after securing feed-in premium tariffs.
The German Solar Association (BSW-Solar) had previously criticized the time limit for the construction of the systems, claiming that the period is too short. BSW-Solar is also calling for existing land restrictions to be relaxed. A number of federal states have yet to open up a lot of arable land and grassland areas in disadvantaged parts of the country for the construction of PV plants, it said. Those kinds of potential development sites are still very limited, it added.
In recent months, the Bundesnetzagentur was unable to allocate all of the planned capacity in its solar tenders. In the latest exercise, held in June, it only allocated 700 MW out of the original plan for 1,126 MW.

The offer includes the South Korean manufacturer's own solar modules and Q. Home Core batteries. Samsung, meanwhile, supplied its Eco Heating System heat pump. The offering includes an app called Q.ommand that reportedly optimizes power consumption while maximizing solar power utilization.
“Our package also includes the inverters, and while the Samsung heat pump is currently purchased separately, a complete bundle package is planned for the market in the near future,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Hanwha Q Cells said homeowners can slas their electricity bills with Samsung’s Smart Things Energy Iot platform.
“Using its ‘Net Zero Home' solutions, households can automatically switch home appliances to energy-saving mode at night or on cloudy days,” said Hanwha Q Cells.
In July 2021, Q Cells and Samsung signed a “zero-energy homes” deal under which they agreed to combine their hardware and software platforms to provide comprehensive energy services. The Hanwha Group also recently reorganized its solar business in Europe by creating Q Energy Solutions SE, a new holding company. It will be a direct affiliate of the group's Hanwha Solutions Corp. unit and will control the German division Q Energy Europe GmbH, as well as a France-based subsidiary, Q Energy France SAS.

Its PairTree product can be used in on-grid or off-grid modes and can be paired with lithium-ion battery systems with storage capacities of up to 40 kWh.
“The product is currently only being sold in the US, Paired Power is focused on the US market but will consider international opportunities down the line,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The carport can host up to 10 bifacial solar modules and can be installed within a single workday, with just two workers using standard hand tools.
“The installation of traditional EV chargers and solar canopies is a time and labor-intensive process, not to mention the disruption and delays of construction,” said CEO Tom McCalmont. “We designed PairTree to eliminate these hassles and make the transition to solar and EV charging simple and scalable while also being modular enough to accommodate future needs.”
The system measures 3.2 meters x 5.2 meters x 3.7 meters and supports single- and dual-port “Level 2” charging and a universal SAE J1772 charging interface. The J1772 5-pin is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles.
The canopy sits on a ballasted steel foundation, which the company said allows customers to avoid costly foundation work and permitting delays.
“PairTree offers additional options of batteries or ground screws to secure the charger in high winds,” it said. “PairTree is designed to be installed side by side in multi-unit configurations for additional energy output to power additional chargers.”
It also claimed that the system needs minimal maintenance, as there are no moving parts.
“AC charging stations are offered to support Level 2 charging, and 120V outlet panels can be added to support emergency or temporary power,” it explained.”Orders for PairTree can be placed now and are expected for general delivery starting in Q2 2023.”

In “Flywheel energy storage systems: A critical review on technologies, applications, and future prospects,” which was recently published in Electrical Energy Systems, the researchers explain that FESS are an optimal mechanical storage solution under high energy and power density, higher efficiency, and rapid response.
“With the potential of 500 MJ storage and power range of kW to GW, FESS operates many applications, among which most common are for power quality enhancement, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and flexible AC transmission system (FACTS),” they said. “For such applications, BESS is unlikely to last longer, even for 10 years, due to its short lifecycle since the number of cycles for these applications is frequently too high.”
Compared to other mechanical energy storage technologies such as pumped hydro and compressed air, flywheel storage has higher values for specific power, specific energy, power and energy density, lifecycle, efficiency, self-discharge rate, and energy capital costs. By contrast, it has lower values for lifespan, scale, maintenance and power capital costs. Its impact on the environment is described as “extremely low,” while that of pumped hydro and compressed air is presented as “medium to low” and “high to medium,” respectively. The scientists said extremely high self-discharge rates and safety are the main shortcomings for FESS.
The study reviews all components used in FESS in terms of different rotor configurations, motor/generator (M/G), rotor bearings, various power electronic interfaces, and housing. It also presents a state-of-the-art survey of different applications for uninterrupted power supply (UPS), transportation, solar and wind energy storage, flexible-AC-transmission-system (FACTS) devices, marine, space, power smoothing, and frequency regulation.
In addition, the paper looks at FESS costs and assesses various control approaches. It also looks at stability and maintenance.
“Modern technology advancement and investigation reveal that the FESS is an assuring candidate for administering ancillary benefits, promoting the incorporation of renewable energy generation, and delivering a promising future in commercialization,” the academics said. “FESS holds many merits compared to other ESSs units such as modular, recyclable, quick response, larger peak power, long life-cycle, highly efficient, eco-friendly, and high energy density.”

BlackRock Real Assets, a subsidiary of US-based investment giant BlackRock, said on Wednesday that it has agreed to acquire SolarZero and will commit almost AUD 90 million ($60.8 million) over the next three years to accelerate the growth of the company’s solar and battery technology platform.
SolarZero has installed approximately 8,500 rooftop solar PV systems across the residential, commercial, and community sectors. It has linked them with its proprietary smart battery and energy management platform to build what is said is the largest virtual power plant (VPP) in the Asia-Pacific region.
SolarZero said the VPP currently generates more than 89 GWh of energy per year, with over 48 MWh of storage. The VPP provides active support to the national grid by reducing peak loads across Australia by 16 MW per day.
SolarZero CEO Andrew Booth said BlackRock’s acquisition of the company would allow it to build on its track record and drive its next phase of growth, with plans to invest AUD 1 billion in new solar and battery systems across New Zealand over the next 10 years.
“BlackRock Climate Infrastructure team’s investment and backing will enable us to rapidly scale, grow our energy services network, and accelerate the transition to a 100% clean energy future,” he said. “By 2030, 50% of the world’s energy will be generated in the Asia-Pacific region. The window to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing fast and the power couple of solar plus storage is one of the few true paths to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity, and a liveable planet.”
New Zealand has set a target of 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035 and to be a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. But with rooftop solar penetration currently at 2% and expected demand for electricity in the nation to double by 2050, there is a clear need for additional residential solar.
BlackRock’s co-head of climate infrastructure for the Asia-Pacific region, Charlie Reid, said the acquisition of SolarZero is the United States-headquartered company’s first investment in New Zealand and its first residential solar investment in the Asia Pacific.
“Our move into New Zealand demonstrates BlackRock’s commitment to invest in attractive markets as part of our broader efforts to offer a flow of addressable global climate investment opportunities for our clients,” he said. “SolarZero is a global pioneer, and we look forward to supporting its expansion into other Asia-Pacific markets and, at the same time, to accelerating New Zealand’s net zero journey.”
The acquisition is subject to various conditions, including approval by the New Zealand Overseas Investment Office. The investment in SolarZero also follows BlackRock’s recent acquisition of Melbourne-based battery storage developer Akaysha Energy and its portfolio of nine projects in the national grid.
BlackRock renewables portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region also includes recent investments in Taiwanese solar energy firm, New Green Power, Korean renewables energy developers, KREDO and Brite Energy Partners, and Australian electric vehicle (EV) charging provider JOLT.

Installations rose significantly from 362 MW in the same period last year, 267 MW in the first half of 2020, and 231 MW in the January-June 2019 period. Most of this year's capacity was installed in the second quarter, when 628 MW was connected to the Italian grid.
According to the latest statistics, PV projects below 1 MW in size represented almost all of the newly deployed capacity, at 686 MW. Solar parks above 1 MW in size only accounted for 375 MW of the total.
Residential PV systems up to 20 kW in size still accounted for the largest share, at around 426 MW of capacity. PV systems ranging from 20 kW to 100 kW accounted for 76 MW of the total. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial PV installations ranging from 100 kW to 1 MW hit 184 MW in the first six months of the year.
The parts of the country with the highest development volumes were the Lombardy region, which brought 147 MW of new solar online, and the central region of Lazio, with 144 MW. Sicily and Sardinia finished the first half of the year with 139 MW and 103 MW, respectively.
The provisional figures indicate that Italy exceeded 22.4 GW of solar capacity at the end of June. The nation’s National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy aims for 50 GW of solar by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/15/perovskite-solar-module-achieves-21-07-efficiency-via-nanosecond-laser-tech/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",Perovskite solar module achieves 21.07% efficiency via nanosecond laser tech,"Scientists from Jinan University in China have used selective nanosecond-pulse, laser-induced ablation to fabricate a perovskite solar module with a reduced heat-affected zone.
“Considering the conversion efficiency and the recent progress in the accelerated stability measurement, we believe that it is time to start the mass production of this type of solar modules,” researcher Yaohua Mai told pv magazine. “To our knowledge, there are already tens of startup companies which are involved in the perovskite PV manufacturing. Microquanta, a company based in Zhejiang province, China, has rolled out a square meter size prototype. In addition, we recently set up a new company and started to build a pilot line and then a commercial production line.”
The research team used inverted perovksite cells with a p-i-n structure for the panel. These cells have an efficiency of 22.16%,an open-circuit voltage of 1.15 V, a short-circuit current of 23.23 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.83. The scientists divided the cells into an array of sub-cells that are interconnected in series. This configuration is intended at achieving a high voltage and low photocurrent device, which should result in lower resistive losses.
The researchers built the cells with a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate, a hole transport layer (HTL) the perovskite layer, an electron transport layer (ETL), and a silver (Ag) metal contact. They interconnected the solar cells via P1, P2, and P3 scribes.
“We used a 30 ns laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm to scribe P1 because a wide band gap indium tin oxide (ITO) has free carrier absorption in the near-infrared region,” the scientists said noting that the high pulse-to-pulse overlap is used in P1 patterning to obtain clean and smooth scribe line valleys. “In the P2 patterning step, the perovskite layer, as well as other functional layers are removed to construct interconnections between the sub-cells. In the P3 step, the top electrode is removed along with all other layers except the ITO, to exclude shunting of adjacent sub-cells of the device.”
The academics described the manufacturing process based on the nanosecond laser as “good enough” to obtain the high-quality interconnection for perovskite solar modules.
“The champion perovskite solar module yielded a certified aperture efficiency of 21.07% and a geometric fill factor of 95.5%, which is one of the highest reported so far,” they concluded. “This result leads the way to further simplification and reliability in perovskite solar module production.”
They presented the details of the module tech in “Can Nanosecond Laser Achieve High-Performance Perovskite Solar Modules with Aperture Area Efficiency Over 21%?” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
