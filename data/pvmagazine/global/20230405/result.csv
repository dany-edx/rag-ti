However, since the price of vanadium, the most widely used active material for redox flow batteries, has been rising in recent years, scientists have been actively searching for redox materials to replace it.
Now a research team from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in South Korea has developed a highly soluble and stable active molecule – naphthalene diimide (NDI). It was used in place of vanadates in aqueous flow batteries.
Although NDI molecules are almost insoluble in water and were therefore little explored, the South Korean research team managed to tether four ammonium functionalities and achieved a solubility as high as 1.5M in water. By regulating the π–π interactions of these organic molecules, the researchers have avoided any severe side reactions and reduced cyclability which could have been caused by radical formation during the electron transfer process.
“We have demonstrated the principles of molecular design by modifying an existing organic active molecule with low solubility and utilizing it as an active molecule for redox flow batteries,” Professor Hye Ryung Byon said. “We have also shown that during a redox reaction, we can use molecular interactions to suppress the chemical reactivity of radically formed molecules.”
Furthermore, the researchers showed that when a 1M solution of NDI was used in neutral redox flow batteries for 500 cycles, 98% of its capacity was maintained. This means 0.004% capacity decay per cycle, and only 2% of its capacity would be lost if the battery were to be operated for 45 days.
The researchers also showed that the developed NDI molecule can hold two electrons per molecule, meaning that 2M of electrons could be stored in every 1M of NDI solution used.
For reference, vanadium used in vanadium redox flow batteries, which require a highly concentrated sulfuric acid solution, has a solubility of about 1.6M and can only hold one electron per molecule, meaning it can store a total of 1.6M of electrons. Therefore, the newly developed NDI active molecule shows a higher storage capacity compared to existing vanadium devices.
“Should this be used later for aqueous redox flow batteries, along with its high energy density and high solubility, it would also have the advantage of being available for use in neutral pH electrolytes,” Ryung Byon said. “Vanadium redox flow batteries currently use acidic solutions, which cause corrosion, and we expect our molecule to solve this issue. Since existing lithium ion-based ESS are flammable, we must develop safer and cheaper next-generation ESS, and our research has shown great promise in addressing this.”
The researchers discussed their findings in the paper “Controlling π-π interactions of highly soluble naphthalene diimide derivatives for neutral pH aqueous redox flow batteries,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials.

The solar footpath, which spans 400 square meters, was recently installed in Groningen, the Netherlands, as part of the “Making City” European Union project.
“Our patented technology has been developed so no microcracks appear in the solar cell and do not affect the performance,” Helga Ruscsák, marketing manager at Platio, told pv magazine when asked about mechanical stress. “This rule is valid under intended use, i.e. if a Platio solar paver is not subjected to a pressure of more than 2 tons. Therefore it is safe to walk on it.”
The solar footpath consists of 2,544 solar pavers. It will generate 55,000 kWh of electricity a year to power Groningen's city hall. Platio’s solar pavers are made of four monocrystalline cells with 21.5 W output and 21.8% efficiency. The open-circuit voltage is 2.69 V and the short circuit current is 10.5 A. Each cell measures 158.75 mm x 158.75 mm while the solar paver module measures 353 mm x 353 mm x 41 mm and weighs 6.5 kg. The module is covered by a 10 mm temperated opal glass and its frame is made of a recycled polymer composite. It comes with a 5-year warranty.
The Platio solar paver is suitable for pavements, terraces, driveways, and bicycle roads, among others. Vehicles weighing up to eight tons can purportedly drive on it.
“Platio solar pavers are doubly sustainable because they not only provide green energy but are made of recycled plastic,” said Philip Broeksma, council of energy from the municipality of Groningen. “And it makes double use of space: the solar footpath generates electricity, while people can simply and safely walk on it.  It is an example of how to use space in the city in a smart and sustainable way.”
The system’s performance is being monitored through an app. When it was inaugurated on March 24, it reportedly produced enough electricity to power 47 Dutch houses for one day. The EU Making City project aims to develop Positive Energy Districts (PED), demonstrating the potential of innovative solutions to tackle climate-neutral goals.

French startup Luciole & Basilic has developed a tracker for residential PV installation that can reportedly offer a 12% higher energy yield.
“The principle is simple,” the company's founder, Nicolas Ditleblanc, told pv magazine France. “We have developed an adjustable fixing system associated with an application, called Zenitrack, which indicates the optimal angle of inclination of the solar panel facing the zenith throughout the year.”
PV system owners can slightly modify the angle of their solar panels every two weeks, so that it always faces the sun. They can move the structure manually by using a telescopic rod.
“We have utilized the function of a power grip, which is a handle used in sailing to precisely adjust the length of a telescopic tube,” said the inventor. “Thanks to a graduation system, the user can modify the inclination of his solar panel, between 15 degrees and 80 degrees, to follow the zenith.”
Ditleblanc claims that the system can increase the electricity yield of solar panels by 12% over the course of a year.
“We compared a 1 kW system on a fixed roof oriented at 30 degrees and a 1 kW Zenitrack system placed on the ground in a garden,” he explained. “During the summer months, the difference is minimal, but during the winter months – when production is low and the household's electricity consumption is at its maximum – our adjustable device allows gains of 30% to 50% compared to a fixed installation.”
The April issue of pv magazine, which hits the streets today, takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
The system can be used with any solar panel up to 1.20 meters wide. Production of the first prototypes has already begun.
“Our structure is aimed at small residential self-consumption, with one, two or even three panels and we would like to sell it below €170 ($186) including taxes,” said Ditleblanc. “We are currently looking for distributors across Europe.”

The CEO of LG Electronics North America, Thomas Yoon, disclosed the company’s intentions this week during a White House executive roundtable on heat pump production and deployment, according to the company's LinkedIn account. The factory will reportedly manufacture indoor, 100% electrical units, with plans to produce outdoor heat pumps at some point in the future.
“The market transformation enabled by heat pump technologies will be accelerated by delivering on the long-awaited promise of the smart home, coupled with today’s emphasis on a zero-carbon lifestyle,” Yoon told White House officials, including US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.
Yoon reportedly praised the US government’s investments for driving demand through tax incentives and rebates such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). However, he noted that market uptake is still limited by a lack of awareness of the benefits of heat pump technology.
“From our perspective, the bigger issue is not supply but demand. We applaud the government’s major investments in driving demand through tax incentives and rebates,” Cooling Post cited Yoon as saying. “However, lack of awareness and familiarity about the benefits of heat pump technology is a barrier to market adoption.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/05/least-cost-model-for-compressed-air-energy-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 5, 2023",‘Least-cost’ model for compressed air energy storage,"A research group led by Stanford University has developed a new model to calculate the lowest-cost way to combining compressed air energy storage (CAES) in energy systems with large shares of renewable energy.
“CAES can be suitable for any energy system such as renewable energy, gas/coal turbine, fuel cells, and other systems in the future,” researcher Sarah Ashfaq told pv magazine. “It is usually considered best for medium to large-scale energy systems. The availability of suitable geographic features for the formation and locations of underground storage caverns is still considered a constraint to the rate of adoption of CAES as a bulk energy storage technology.”
The academics said their new model assesses how much CAES capacity might be needed for the deep decarbonization of power systems, while compensating for the variability of wind and solar-based power systems. They presented their findings in “Least-cost analysis of bulk energy storage for deep decarbonized power system with increased share of renewable energy,” which was recently published in Electric Power Systems Research.
They used California as a case study with different penetration levels of renewable energy. They used demand inputs from the US-Energy Information Administration (EIA) data portal, and data for wind and solar power generation from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA–2).
“The collected data was updated with desired capacity factors and number of years,” they said. “Each technology is represented by a fixed cost and a variable cost.”
The research team did not consider restrictions on the energy sources based on societal complications such as technological acceptance
or local preferences. They calculated the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) at each hourly time step, based on the availability of generation capacity, wind and solar resources, storage resources, and demand.
The study considers four scenarios. It features a base case, with the share of renewables California reached in 2021, as well as a scenario in which wind has 50% more potential. It also looks at a case in which solar has 50% more potential, and a scenario in which both technologies have 100% more potential.
“In case of increase in the potential of both wind and solar the main node curtailment is close to the increase in solar dispatch curve, due to the availability and dispatch of abundant solar power,” said the researchers. 
The scientists found that the electricity mix in the lowest-cost system would be more or less independent from the amount of excess power generation. But they also ascertained that this mix would have a strong impact on the required CAES capacity.
“For example, in case of 100% excess wind the optimal mix of renewable sources is 68.9% wind and 31.1% solar with CAES capacity of 3.40 TWh and in case of 100% excess solar, the optimal mix is 35.6% wind and 64.4% solar with CAES capacity of 2.77 TWh,” they stated. “In case of 100% excess wind and solar, the optimal mix is 52.5% solar and 47.5% wind with 3.10TWh of CAES capacity.”
They also found that California's estimated annual demand of 277 TWh would need a CAES capacity of 3.83TWh at a cost of $0.175/kWh. The aforementioned fourth scenario with the highest penetration of wind and solar would result in a cost reduction of 14.1%, at a cost of $0.123/kWh) and a 7.4% reduction in CAES capacity.
“CAES is very competitive and on a $/kWh basis,” Ashfaq concluded. “Pumped hydro storage) and CAES are the most cost-effective energy storage technologies, as they offer the lowest cost in $/kWh for long-term storage. For short-duration storage, however, lithium-ion performs best.”

Jakson Group, an Indian energy conglomerate, said this week that it has signed a contract with China’s Jinchen Corp. for a 600 MW PV production line. The deal is a step forward in Jakson’s plan to expand its solar manufacturing capacity in India to 3 GW per year by fiscal 2026, while also serving international markets.
Currently, Jakson has a 500 MW solar module facility in Greater Noida. Jinchen’s 600 MW equipment line will augment its existing capacity in Greater Noida to 1.1 GW. 
Jakson said that the installation of the new production line will be completed by the middle of this year. The fully automated line will be equipped to produce the latest p-type, n-type, and G-12 modules, in both mono-facial and bifacial variants.
The Indian company first revealed its plan to produce solar panels in September. It said it will expand its cumulative module capacity to 1 GW in five to six months, from 500 MW at present. It aims to have 2 GW of cumulative, operational cell and module capacity by the end of 2024.
The company also has ambitious plans in place for green hydrogen, green ammonia, and electrolyzer production. It is now in talks with leading alkaline electrolyzer technology suppliers to start electrolyzer production under a joint venture.

“The battery is particularly suitable to be combined with a rooftop PV system or a residential photovoltaic-thermal installation,” One Solution Holland Sales Engineer Kaz Collé told pv magazine, noting that very little maintenance is required, as there are no moving parts. “The general advantage of our battery is the small volume and low thermal loss. Moreover, it is environmentally friendly as no toxic materials are used and it's fully recyclable.”
The manufacturer describes the device as a thermal charging station that converts power directly into heat and stores it for the provision of hot water.
“It is is a very efficient appliance with energy label A+,” Collé said, noting that the battery uses an inorganic salt as a phase-change material (PCM). PCMs are able to absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range and have often been used, at the research level, for PV module cooling.
The FlexTherm Eco battery is able in three versions with storage capacities of 3.5 kWh, 7.0 kWh, and 10.5 kWh.
“The 7.0 kWh device can supply 12.5 liters of hot water per minute,” said Collé.
The smallest battery measures 360 mm x 570 mm x 445 mm and weighs 70 kg. The largest device has dimensions of 360 mm x 570 mm x 880 mm and a weight of 170 kg. All of the products have a minimum working pressure of 1.0 bar and a discharge water temperature ranging from 50 C to 55 C.
One Solution Holland estimates the heat loss per hour between 18.7 W and 30.7 W, depending on the system size. It says the battery has already been used on multiple projects featuring PV.
“The total storage capacity of these projects in the Netherlands is currently 13.65 MW,” Collé said, noting that the company is offering a five-year warranty.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/05/san-miguel-edges-closer-to-delivering-1-gw-battery-fleet-in-philippines/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,PHILIPPINES",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 5, 2023",San Miguel edges closer to delivering 1 GW battery fleet in Philippines,"The power arm of Philippines-based conglomerate San Miguel Corp. has unveiled a 50 MW BESS in Limay, Philippines, as part of its nationwide 1 GW/1 GWh rollout. The facility is one of 32 battery sites the group is building across the islands of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. It expects to deliver all of the projects by the end of the year, according to a press release by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the president of the Philippines.
“BESS technology will support our goal of generating 35% of our total energy requirements from renewables by 2030,” Marcos said at an inauguration ceremony last week.
San Miguel's battery storage portfolio started to take shape back in 2018, when it acquired the country’s first BESS project – the 10 MW Masinloc Power Plant. In January 2022, the conglomerate said it was ready to start operating an initial 690 MW of battery storage facilities, as part of a plan to deliver a 1 GW BESS fleet by the year's end.
The Philippine Star quoted San Miguel CEO Ramon S. Ang as saying that the company had already delivered 640 MW of projects, with the balance expected to be finished by December of this year.
“Government is working to avert a power crisis,” Ang said. “But we know it takes time to complete new power facilities. The BESS network is here already and it can provide immediate mitigation to the power crisis.”
San Miguel partnered with ABB Philippines, Fluence, and Wartsila and their engineering, procurement and construction contractors on the project. This week, Fluence confirmed that it has completed 570 MW of BESS projects for San Miguel. These projects provide critical grid-stability services throughout the national transmission network in the Philippines, including frequency response, reserve power, and voltage regulation.
“Over the next couple of years, we estimate the integration of up to 5000 MW of renewable power into the grid due largely to our BESS facilities,” said Ang.
At the inauguration ceremony, President Marcos vowed to extend substantial support to investors in the renewable energy space and streamline regulations at the national and local levels.
“We will improve the policy and regulatory framework for the renewable energy industry, especially for the ESS technology, to encourage the further development of our fledgling renewables industry,” he said.
Marcos added that his administration will continue working with San Miguel. He noted that the company has “other BESS projects in the pipeline, accounting for 95% of BOI-approved projects, with 2,000 MW total capacity distributed across the country …  I and the rest of the Filipino people look forward to the rollout of these projects in the near future.”

India is set to reach 110 GW of solar PV module capacity by fiscal 2026, with 72 GW of new manufacturing capacity to go online within the next three years. The significant jump will establish self-sufficiency and make the nation the second-largest PV manufacturing country after China, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research.
The report says India will have a notable presence in all upstream components of PV manufacturing. It claims that cell capacity will reach 59 GW by fiscal 2026, ingot/wafer capacity will hit 56 GW, and polysilicon will touch 38 GW.
“The future of the Indian PV manufacturing sector is bright,” said the report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg, director of South Asia for IEEFA. “The favorable policy environment created by the Indian government is helping the PV manufacturing industry to grow rapidly, which is evident in the frequent announcements of expansions or new investments in the sector.”
The report shows that India’s cumulative module manufacturing nameplate capacity more than doubled from 18 GW in March 2022 to 38 GW in March 2023.
“The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme is one of the primary catalysts spurring the growth of the entire PV manufacturing ecosystem in India,” said Jyoti Gulia, the founder of JMK Research. “Besides the augmentation of infrastructure in all stages of PV manufacturing, from polysilicon to modules, it will also lead to the simultaneous development of a market for PV ancillary components, such as glass, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and backsheets.”
The results of both tranches of the PLI scheme show that there will be an increase of 51.6 GW of module capacity and at least 27.4 GW of integrated “polysilicon-to-module” capacity in India in the next three to four years.
While the PLI scheme is a supply-side measure, the government has also taken steps to increase demand for locally made solar modules. One such step was the introduction of domestic content requirements (DCR) for solar power in several government schemes, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) Scheme and the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme.
One of the key steps taken by the government to drive up demand for domestic PV modules was the introduction of the Approved List of Module Manufacturers (ALMM) in 2019. The report notes that even after applying higher basic customs duty (BCD) on imported modules, the cost differential compared to domestic modules is negligible. 
“In such a scenario, the ALMM acts as an absolute trade barrier protecting the interests of domestic manufacturers. Thus, over the past year, ALMM has been the most important driver for the development of domestic PV manufacturing,” said Prabhakar Sharma, a consultant for JMK Research. “The latest ALMM list, updated on 27 February 2023 by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, includes 70+ domestic manufacturers with an enlisted capacity of 22,389 MW.”
The report also identifies obstacles holding back the domestic PV manufacturing industry. Chief among them is an over-reliance on Chinese imports for upstream components of PV modules, such as polysilicon, ingots, and wafers.
