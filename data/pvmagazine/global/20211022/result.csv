Initially the materials were thought more difficult to process than their mixed organic/inorganic counterparts. And though the highest efficiency and stability achievements so far still belong to mixed organic/inorganic perovskite combinations, those based on inorganic materials are catching up.
All-inorganic perovskites swap the molecule of hydrogen and carbon (methylammonium or formamidinum) for another material, most commonly cesium. And since the organic components are the first to break down on exposure to moisture and other conditions, replacing them can quickly lead to better stability.
All-inorganic perovskites are typically more difficult to work with, however, and developing techniques to process them at scale will be particularly challenging – and this is one reason most of the industrial development for perovskite continues to focus on mixed organic-inorganic recipes.
Scientists led by Chonnam National University noted that one challenge in producing all-inorganic perovskites comes from the deposition of an electron transport layer (ETL), a process that typically requires high temperatures to deposit tin or titanium based material. The group instead chose to work with zinc oxide for the ETL, and demonstrated a spray coating process to apply a smooth and compact layer, which they describe as “simple and scalable.”
The work is described in full in the paper Ambient processed and stable all-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells with efficiencies nearing 20% using a spray coated Zn1−xCsxO electron transport layer, published in Nano Energy. Cells produced by the group incorporating the spray coated ETL achieved stabilized efficiency of 18.63%, independently certified by the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology. And the group was able to scale the material up somewhat, achieving 18.46% on a device measuring 1cm x 1cm.
In both cases, the devices maintained better than 95% of their initial efficiency after 300 hours heated to 80 degrees Celsius. “The impressive device performance originates from the promising optoelectronic properties of the low-temperature processed ETL and doped perovskite absorber layer, enabling suppressed non-radiative recombination and improved carrier management,” the group states in the paper. “We believe that chalcogenide doped all-inorganic perovskites absorber will be an effective approach to improve the stability of the solar-friendly [all-inorganic] perovskite composition.”

Some of our Norwegian projects under development show hydrogen cost levels of US$ 3.5-4.5/kg [€3.01-3.87/ kg]. In the current market environment, with very high gas prices, this matches the cost levels for grey hydrogen,” Knut Nyborg, Chief Executive Officer of Aker Clean Hydrogen, commented in a press release. The company is primarily focusing on Norway, but it is also eyeing collaborations and investments in other countries, including Tunisia.
Statkraft, the hydropower company fully owned by the Norwegian state, wrote that green hydrogen is necessary to reach the objectives stated in the Paris Agreement, adding that Europe will rely on green hydrogen more than other continents. “About 10% (9.6%) of global power demand will come from green hydrogen production in 2050 and more than 20% for Europe in the Low Emissions Scenario,” wrote the Oslo-based renewable energy company. Statkraft said that costs of electrolyzers have fallen by 60% over the last five years, adding it expects that investment costs for green hydrogen production will fall an additional 60% by 2050. In its report published on Thursday, Statkraft also reported that solar power capacity would grow by a factor of 21, and wind power by a factor of 7 in the next 30 years.
An MIT-led team presented a framework to analyze how to optimize electric power and hydrogen supply chain infrastructure. “Hydrogen is an interesting energy carrier to explore, but understanding the role for hydrogen requires us to study the interactions between the electricity system and a future hydrogen supply chain,” Dharik Mallapragada, a research scientist at the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI), said in a press release published on Thursday. In a recent paper, researchers from MIT and Shell presented the framework, which takes into account interactions with the electric grid and the spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and supply. “The developed framework co-optimizes infrastructure investment and operation across the electricity and hydrogen supply chain under various emissions price scenarios,” MIT reported. The paper applied the framework to the U.S. Northeast case. “Specifically, P2G [Power-to-Gas] provides grid flexibility to support VRE integration without the round-trip efficiency penalty and additional cost incurred by P2G2P routes. This form of sector coupling leads to: (a) VRE generation increase by 13–56%, and (b) total system cost (and levelized costs of energy) reduction by 7–16% under deep decarbonization scenarios. Both effects increase as hydrogen demand for other end-uses increases, more than doubling for a 97% decarbonization scenario as H2 demand quadruples,” reads the academic paper published in September on the Energy & Environmental Science journal.
The Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Taiwan Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Partnership on Thursday, committing to improving bilateral engagement. “UK-Taiwan collaboration is growing fast in low carbon energy development, especially offshore wind. And Taiwan’s domestic fuel cell industry which is already a vital part of global hydrogen supply chains is increasingly strong and innovative,” John Dennis, Representative of British Office Taipei, commented in the official announcement. UK-Taiwan collaboration opportunities include the deployment of hydrogen in medium-to-long distance public road transportation, the production of green hydrogen from offshore wind, and collaborations in third markets.
Inovyn, a subsidiary of UK-based Ineos, has announced investment plans to upgrade existing production at a site in Runcorn in Northwest England, in order to supply compressed fuel-cell quality hydrogen to mobility, mostly trucks buses, and power generation sectors. “Specifically, the investment will deliver dedicated on-site facilities for the purification and compression of existing low carbon, fuel cell quality hydrogen for subsequent loading and transportation and distribution to fuelling stations across the UK,” Ineos wrote on Wednesday. Earlier this week, the British multinational chemicals company announced €2bn investment in green hydrogen.
India’s state-owned Gail natural gas company wants to build the country’s largest green hydrogen plant in the next 12-14 months. As written in an article by Millennium Post then re-published by the natural gas corporation, Gail aims to buy a 10 MW electrolyzer to produce 4.5 tons of green hydrogen daily. Gail, which has already launched a global tender, is looking into a couple of different potential sites for the plant, including one at Vijaipur, in the state of Madhya Pradesh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/22/china-pv-industry-brief-installations-slow-but-deals-continue-despite-rising-prices/,"INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"OCTOBER 22, 2021","China PV Industry Brief: Installations slow, deals continue despite rising prices","China’s energy agency, the National Energy Administration (NEA), released new information on its official site this Thursday about PV installations in the world’s largest market.
China installed 3.51 GW of new PV in September, which brings the cumulative figure for the first nine months to 25.56 GW, with a YoY increase of 44.33% over the same period of 2020. However, due to growing polysilicon costs, and following rising PV module prices, the 3.51 GW installed in September represented the second consecutive month of decline. China hit an installation peak in July which was 4.93 GW, but only 4.11 GW in August.
On the same day, NEA also released statistics of residential PV installation which connected to grid and have been included in the government incentive list. New installation in September in this space amounted to 2.14 GW and make the cumulative figure in 2021 to 11.68 GW. Shanghai province once again topped regional installation rankings, with 699 MW installed in the month. Following are Hebei and Henan provinces, with new installations of 579 MW and 323 MW, respectively.
One of the largest state-owned energy companies in China, the China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC) announced on Thursday that the company has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the local government of Pu’er City, Yunnan Province for comprehensive electric power investments and projects over the coming five years.
According to the statement, CEEC will invest and construct a wind + solar + storage integration project. The planned installation of wind power will be 1 GW, new installation of solar PV will be 4 GW, and supporting storage will be 500 MW / 1,000 MWh. The total investment is estimated to be CNY 23 billion, around US$ 3.57 billion. Once put into operation, the integration project will produce clean electricity power of 740 GWh annually, and with saving of standard coal of 2.3 million metric tons, and reduction in CO2 emissions of 6.48 million MT per year.
Prices across the solar PV supply chain continue to rise. The selling price of polysilicon reached  CNY 270 (US$42.25)/kg with actual deals. Total output of polysilicon recorded a 3-6% cut off due to energy shortage in production and this contributed to the existing tension in the supply chain. While prices continue shooting up, actual deal volume is also growing, because market believes the price will continue to rise, at least up to Q1 2022, and power price increases will compensate for the extra cost.
Wafer prices remained unchanged this week after rising again last week. Because of the cut down of operation rate in downstream cell production, wafer price is estimated to remain unchanged. Cell prices experienced a slightly rise of CNY 0.01-0.02. The latest quote for 166mm is about CNY 1.14 (US$0.17)/W, and CNY 1.16 (US$0.18)/W for 182mm cell. 210mm cells currently fetch a slightly lower price of CNY 1.12/W
Module prices also kept growing this week. Products of tier 1 brands quoted to CNY 2.10/W on average, with an increase of CNY 0.05 over last week. It was said some domestic projects have been suspended due to high module prices.

The round has closed at €32 million. Of this, the Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited, headed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has contributed €25 million – in a deal announced on Oct. 13.
Reliance completed its acquisition of Singaporean-based cell and module maker REC on Oct. 11, for a little over $770 million.
Nexwafe specializes in the development of high-efficiency monocrystalline silicon wafers. The Freiburg, Germany-based company plans to use the funds raised in the Series C financing round to advance the production and commercialization of its epi-wafers.
As part of the investment, Reliance has entered into a strategic partnership with Nexwafe to jointly develop and commercialize Nexwafe's ultra-thin wafers. In return, Reliance will be granted access to the patented technology. The Indian company plans to utilize the technology in its planned gigawatt manufacturing facility in India.
“The commercialization of this promising technology for high-power wafers has strategic importance for Germany, Europe and the world,” said Claas Helmke, partner at Wermuth Asset Management. He added that the efficiency gains provided by the technology are significant. In addition, CO2 emissions from the production of the wafers will be significantly reduced, Helmke said. “These are milestones on the way to the global and sustainable spread of solar technology.”
Kerfless wafer production has been pursued by a number of PV technology developers. Alongside Nexwafe, U.S.-based 1336 Technologies had developed multicrystalline kerfless wafer production – and had achieved promising results in a partnership with Q-Cells. However, the industry switch to monocrystalline technology placed 1366 at a disadvantage, and the company merged with Hunt Perovskite Technologies (HPT) to form a new company, CubicPV, in June of this year.
Alongside allowing for the production of thinner crystalline-silicon wafers, kerfless wafer production also significantly reduces polysilicon production by avoiding the waste material, or kerf, produced through the conventional, diamond wire wafering process.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/22/the-burgeoning-underground-scene-of-hydrogen-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 22, 2021",The burgeoning underground scene of hydrogen storage,"With work already underway on a test cavern for hydrogen storage from German energy provider EWE, as well as Dutch gas giant Gasunie beginning storage of hydrogen at its underground facility in Zuidwending, and geologically resourceful countries such as Canada estimating huge potential for large scale seasonal underground hydrogen storage (UHS), it is no surprise that resource-rich Australia is also eyeing up the “massive opportunity” for UHS, which is being pointed to by many as a feasible solution that could foster true growth for the hydrogen economy. 
Research from Future Fuels Cooperative Research Centre (FFCRC), an industry focussed research, development and demonstration partnership, has mapped Australia's UHS capacity at potentially 310 million tons (38,000 PJ), a figure approximately 60 times larger than what a developed domestic and export Australian hydrogen industry would need, which FFCRC estimates at around five million tonnes (600 PJ). 
The research was led by Jonathan Ennis-King, leading reservoir simulation researcher at Australia's National Science Agency, the CSIRO, with the CSIRO's Hydrogen Industry Mission. 
FFCRC pulls that figure from research mapping potential sites suitable for UHS, such as salt caverns (created by circulation of freshwater), depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifers and engineered caverns. Of course, each rock formation has its own advantages and disadvantages, but once the scale of storage at a site exceeds the tens of tons, says FFCRC, “UHS is the cheapest and safest large-scale storage option for industrial-sized purposes.” 
Salt caverns are an established hydrogen storage technology already, although Australia's sedimentary basins where potential salt deposits may be suitable for the creation of large storage caverns are not proximate to locations touted for large-scale hydrogen production. However, there are some interesting options. The report places the most likely locations as the north-western part of the Canning Basin, near to renewable energy resources on the North West Shelf, the Adavale Basin in western Queensland, and the Amadeus Basin in the Northern Territory. 

However, the most promising storage options for UHS in Australia might just be depleted gas fields, though it is not clear whether stored hydrogen and residual hydrocarbons would play nicely together. Although the re-use of depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs would be far cheaper than developing UHS-specific salt caverns. But long-term storage operating costs of such a site “may only constitute a small fraction of the total cost of storage”. 

Of course, what needs to be stressed is that potential UHS sites would need to be assessed on a site-by-site basis. And the same goes for any purpose-built or re-purposed UHS infrastructure, still a very nascent technology, but with the potential to be implemented in close proximity to renewable resources. 
Cost is also highly dependent on site-by-site analysis, however the report does provide a helpful table: 

Ultimately, the report posits “The cost of UHS may only constitute a comparatively small fraction of the whole hydrogen value chain.” 
Challenges to UHS
There are, however, numerous challenges to UHS, including the fluid flow behaviour of hydrogen in subsurface reservoirs, geochemical reactions caused by the injection of hydrogen, biotic reactions caused by excess hydrogen and the geomechanical response of the subsurface itself to hydrogen storage.

Indeed, in a study titled “Enabling large-scale hydrogen storage in porous media – the scientific challenges“, published in Energy & Environmental Science, European scientists part of the GEO 8 association of European geoscientific research organizations, stressed that there is still an enormous amount of study which needs to be done before UHS can be performed safely and efficiently. 
Natural analogues 
The FFCRC also points to the promising study of natural analogues, which is to say, natural occurrences of UHS, such as hydrothermal fluids and hydrogen-rich gas at Lidy Hot Spring, Idaho, and Kansas respectively. Further examples are to be found under the Central Indian Ocean Ridge and in the hydrogen-rich gas seep at Chimaera in Turkey. These sites are pointed to as “evidence for the ability of seals to retain hydrogen for significant time periods.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/22/spains-renewables-auction-problem-or-opportunity/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE,SPAIN",LUISA CABELLO,"OCTOBER 22, 2021",Spain’s renewables auction: Problem or opportunity?,"With official results of Spain’s auction now published, it is time to take stock. For the first in time in the history of Spain’s auction program, photovoltaics does not cover all of the offered capacity. Just 5.75 MW of a 300 MW reserve set aside for small projects was awarded, and another 600 MW reserve for facilities already at an advanced stage of development saw just 21.9 MW awarded to distributed generation projects.
Several of the biggest players active in Spain’s project market – including Iberdrola and Enel (via subsidiary Endesa) – chose not to participate in this auction, and look to be exploring investment in other countries. Ignacio Galán, president of Iberdrola, shared billion-investment plans for the UK market, accompanied by photos with the Queen and Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Three days ago, it emerged that the company had fired its communications director.
Reports from Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, citing sources familiar with the company’s plans, say that Enel has “decided to limit its investment ambition in its Spanish subsidiary, and redirect a part of the investment planned for Spain to the United States.
Spanish PV industry association UNEF has so far not spoken publicly about the auction, other players involved in the sector, however, shared their assessments.
José M.ª González Moya, general director of the Association of Renewable Energy Companies (APPA), affirms that “in general terms, our assessment is positive because almost all of the offered capacity has been covered at prices which are more than competitive,” he told pv magazine. “But the quota was not covered entirely, even though there seemed to be reasonable competitive pressure. We do not know the reasons for this.”
The association expressed surprise at the “the high level of wind power awarded, and the relatively small capacity won by photovoltaics.” Since not all data on the auction is made public, the association says it does not know why wind took such a large share of the capacity on offer, or if it was due to a lack of mature projects. “It is probably due to the fact that photovoltaics has more uncertainty in the longer term, due to the rising price of raw materials,” said Moya.
He goes on to add that “two companies have taken a very high volume of this auction, and in other cases there is much more dispersion in the number of successful bid. This should give us pause for thought.” Moya agrees with others involved in the auction that the “almost deserted” quota for projects with accelerated availability should be redesigned, and that the other segment reserved for distributed generation projects was “an even greater failure”. The reasons for this are not clear,  he continues, “perhaps the requirements to bid were not adequate, or there was not enough time to prepare.”
Moya further notes the absence of the large players, “some will have resigned due to problems with uncertainty, we do not know if they had been preparing projects to participate.”
“We will know the success of this auction once these projects are working, not today,” he summarizes. “We can say that everything is fine, the auction resulted in very competitive prices. But now we have to put all of that into operation.”
Regarding the prices, he says that “they are surprisingly low, as happened in January. In renewables, and in solar in particular, economies of scale matter, project sizes matter. We do not know if the social or distributed quota was not covered because not enough bids were made, or they were left out due to price. The reserve price is not public, it could be that projects were left out because they could not reach this price. This is the key.”
For Fundación Renovables, the results are “generally quite in tune with our expectations. It is true that it is surprising that the maximum bid volume of 3498 MW was not covered,” explained the Fundacion’s communications director Ismael Morales.
The key takeaway, in Morales’ opinion, is “low participation of PV generation, in addition to the fact that prices have been low for electricity companies that have participated, and that the majority was awarded to two developers.”
He adds that, “the accelerated quota is a reflection of the fact that real projects are not presented here with the maturity to meet installation deadlines, but are presented rather to gain market position. This issue should be analyzed because it can make the difference between reality and wishes.”
Regarding the non-participation of large companies, he states “the auctions are not designed for integrated electricity companies, it will always be more interesting for them to get a transfer price with clients than a competitive auction. To see this as a protest or boycott, however, is not really accurate.”
A final point, he notes that “it is curious that the proposals of less than 5 MW have prices offered in the same range as much larger projects. This could mean that the larger plants could have bid even lower.”
National Association of Photovoltaic Energy Produceres (Anpier) director Rafael Barrera focused more on the consolidation among winners. “for Anpier, the result has been bittersweet, the reserves for rapid installation and distributed generation did not function well. We understand the gesture in trying to make the auction more accessible to small producers, but we warned from the start that there would still be barriers. We hope to see a new auction proposed, with a new, higher quota that’s more adjusted to realities of smaller players.”
He cites economies of scale, access to grid connections, and the short time between the call for bids and the auction deadline, as issues with the capacity reserved for distributed generation projects.
“When calculations are made, the cutoff price is very low. It is very difficult to reach prices below €42/MWh with price increases in steel and modules.” Barrera concludes by stating that “Europe says it wants to put citizens at the center, but we are not here and don’t expect to be.”
Capital Energy, which walked away with the largest share of capacity on offer, told Spanish newspaper El Mundo that “investor appetite in Spain is very high. The fundamentals of the renewables sector remain solid.”
Forestalia and Enerland Group both shared assessments “Forestalia will comply with the obligations derived from this award as it has been doing up to now, with the same rigor and compliance with deadlines as in previous auctions,” says the company, which has been awarded 777.90 MW in the auction (562, 40 MW wind and 215.50 MW photovoltaic).
Enerland Group, which was awarded three projects within the group of local photovoltaic installations, where it has been, together with Blacksalt, one of the only two awardees. “We are proud to have been awarded the projects in a category in which there are only two companies. We work both large and local projects because we like to bet on our territory and give value to it by promoting the development of renewable energy ”, says the company from Zaragoza.
The third vice president and minister for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Teresa Ribera, highlighted that the auction, raised at a particularly delicate moment in the European energy panorama, “represents the consolidation of new actors” and “the interest and confidence of investors ”. Time will tell.

The eighth edition of “Renewable Energy and Jobs: Annual Review 2021” confirms that COVID-19 caused delays and supply chain disruptions, with impacts on jobs varying by country, and among parts of the value chain.
Solar and wind jobs continued to lead global employment growth in the sector, accounting for 4 million and 1.25 million jobs, respectively. Employment in liquid biofuels declined, however, as demand for transport fuels fell. While off-grid solar lighting sales also suffered, companies were able to limit job losses.
China accounted for 39% of renewable energy jobs worldwide in 2020, followed by Brazil, India, the United States and European Union member states.
Many other countries are also creating jobs in the renewables sector, among them Vietnam and Malaysia, which have become key solar PV exporters; Indonesia and Colombia, which have large agricultural supply chains for biofuels; and Mexico and Russia, where wind power is growing. In Sub-Saharan Africa, solar jobs are expanding in diverse countries like Nigeria, Togo and South Africa.
“Renewable energy’s ability to create jobs and meet climate goals is beyond doubt,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco la Camera. “With COP26 in front of us, governments must raise their ambition to reach net zero. The only path forward is to increase investments in a just and inclusive transition, reaping the full socioeconomic benefits along the way.”
ILO Director-General Guy Ryder added that the potential for renewables to generate decent work was “a clear indication that we do not have to choose between environmental sustainability on the one hand, and employment creation on the other. The two can go hand-in-hand.”
The report stresses that that more jobs will be gained by the energy transition than lost and cites an ILO global sustainability scenario to 2030 estimating that some 25 million new jobs will far surpass losses of up to 7 million jobs. In addition, some 5 million of the workers who lose their jobs will be able to find new jobs in the same occupation in another industry, it adds. By 2050, IRENA’s World Energy Transition Outlook forecasts 43 million renewable energy sector employees.
The report also highlights the importance of domestic value chains in view of the disruptions to cross-border supplies caused by COVID-19 restrictions. “Strengthening them will facilitate local job creation and income generation, by leveraging existing and new economic activities,” IRENA states.
To that end, the report calls for industrial policies to form viable supply chains; education and training strategies to create a skilled workforce; active labour market measures to provide adequate employment services; retraining and recertification along with social protection to assist workers and communities dependent on fossil fuels; and public investment strategies to support regional economic development and diversification.
International Labour Standards and collective bargaining arrangements are crucial for a just transition that provides employment for all people, it adds.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/22/will-chinas-double-carbon-and-dual-control-policies-drive-demand-for-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",,"OCTOBER 22, 2021",Will China’s ‘double carbon’ and ‘dual control’ policies drive demand for solar?,"There have been a range of measures taken by the Chinese authorities to achieve emission reductions, and I set out such policies in detail in an article on Wednesday. One immediate impact of such policies is that distributed solar PV has gained significant importance, simply because it enables factories to consume, on-site, their locally generated power, which often is significantly more affordable than grid-supplied power – in particular during hours of peak demand. Currently, the average payback period of a commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftop system in China is approximately 5-6 years. Furthermore, deployment of rooftop solar will help reduce manufacturers’ carbon footprints and their reliance on coal power.
In this context, in late August China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) approved a new pilot program specifically designed to promote the deployment of distributed solar PV. Accordingly, by the end of 2023, existing buildings will be required to install a rooftop PV system. Under the mandate, a minimum percentage of buildings will be required to install solar PV, with the requirements as follows: government buildings (no fewer than 50%); public structures (40%); commercial properties (30%); and rural buildings (20%), across 676 counties, will be required to have a solar rooftop system. Assuming 200-250 MW per county, total demand deriving from this program alone could be in the order of between 130 and 170 GW by the end of 2023.
Pick up your copy of the latest edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
Furthermore, if a solar PV system is combined with an electrical energy storage (EES) unit, it enables a factory to shift and extend its production hours. To date, approximately two-thirds of provinces have mandated that every new C&I solar rooftop, and ground-mounted system, must be combined with an EES unit.
At the end of September, the National Development and Reform Committee issued urban development guidelines which explicitly encouraged the deployment of distributed solar PV, and business models based on energy performance management contracts. The immediate impact of those guidelines has yet to be quantified.
In the near to mid-term, significant demand for PV will come from “GW-hybrid bases,” a concept which features the combination of renewables, hydro and coal, depending on location. China’s premier, Li Keqiang, while recently chairing a session addressing the current power supply constraints, explicitly called for the construction of massive GW-bases (in particular those including PV and wind) in the Gobi Desert, in order to serve as a power supply back-up system. Last week, it was China’s president, Xi Jinping, who announced that the construction of the first phase of such a GW-base – with a capacity of up to 100 GW – had already been initiated. Details relating to that project have yet to be published.
In addition to supporting solar PV installations, recently, an increasing number of provincial governments – notably Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu, among others – have been planning to introduce a more differentiated electricity tariff structure scheme, in an attempt to stimulate more rational use of power. For example, the ‘peak vs. valley' price difference amounts to RMB1.173/kWh ($0.18/kWh) and RMB0.85/kWh ($0.13/kWh) in Guangdong and Henan, respectively.
Guangdong’s average tariff is RMB0.65/kWh ($0.10) and its lowest is RMB0.28/kWh ($0.04) between midnight and 7 a.m. Such time-of-use based electricity tariff schemes, anticipated to become effective during this month and next, will drive the emergence and development of new business models, in particular when combined with distributed solar PV.
Regardless of the impact of the double carbon and dual control policies, over the past eight weeks polysilicon prices have been increasing – to reach RMB270/kg ($41.95). Over the past few months, transitioning from a tight to a now-short-of-supply situation, the polysilicon supply crunch has led to existing and new companies announcing their intention to construct new polysilicon production capacities or add to existing facilities. According to the latest estimates, provided all 18 poly projects currently planned are executed, a total of 3 million tons of annual polysilicon production could be added by 2025-2026.
However, in the near-term, polysilicon prices are expected to stay high, given the limited additional supply coming online in the next couple of months, and due to a massive shift of demand from 2021 into next year. Over the past few weeks, countless provinces have approved double-digit-gigawatt scale solar project pipelines, the overwhelming majority scheduled to be connected to the grid by December next year.
This week, during an official press conference, representatives of China’s NEA announced that, between January and September, 22 GW of new solar PV generation capacity was installed, representing an increase of 16%, year on year. Taking into account the most recent developments, the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory estimates that in 2021 the market could grow between 4% and 13%, year on year – 50-55 GW – thereby crossing the 300 GW mark.

The levelized cost of rooftop solar generation is the lowest in India ($66/MWh) and China ($68/MWh), while the United States ($238/MWh) and the United Kingdom ($251/MWh) are some of the most expensive countries, according to a new international study.
The study was co-authored by Priyadarshi Shukla, a professor at Ahmedabad University and the director of its Global Centre for Environment and Energy, along with Shivika Mittal from Imperial College London and James Glynn from Columbia University. The team was led by Siddharth Joshi, a researcher at MaREI, the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine in University College Cork. 
The study showed a global rooftop solar generation potential of 27 petawatt-hours (PWh) per year. Nearly 20% of the global potential is located within the areas with a high population density due to a corresponding increase in the building stock. Among countries, China (4.3 PWh/year), the United States (4.2 PWh/year) and India (1.7 PWh/year) have the highest solar energy generation potential.
“Solar energy is generated during daytime coinciding with the time when electricity demand is at its peak. India’s solar rooftop potential of 1.7 petawatt-hour per year is very significant. We would be able to match India’s current electricity demand of 1.3 petawatt-hour per annum if we install efficient solar panels on 40% of the country’s available rooftop area,” said Shukla. 
The researchers used a modeling framework to assess the electricity generation potential of rooftop solar PV systems globally and its associated costs. The authors mapped 130 million square kilometers of global land surface area to identify 0.2 million square kilometers of rooftop area using a machine-learning algorithm. This rooftop area was then analyzed to document the global electricity generation potential of rooftop solar PV. 
The energy generation potential of rooftop solar panels exceeded the global yearly aggregated energy consumption in 2018. However, its future potential will depend on the development and cost of storage solutions for the generated energy, said the report.

South Korean battery manufacturer LG Energy Solution has launched a new inverter in the Australian market, adding a 5 kW hybrid inverter to its residential energy storage unit (RESU) home battery energy storage range.
LG Energy Solution said the new LGES-5048 hybrid inverter would be available in Australia from November. It described it as a highly efficient AC-coupled or DC-coupled unit that when coupled with a battery can deliver back-up power and keep essential appliances running during grid interruptions or power outages.
LG said the hybrid inverter is designed for either new solar and storage installations, or to add storage to an existing solar system. The company said the RESU Home battery and LGES-5048 inverter pairing allows up to 7.5 kW of solar PV capacity for new systems and up to 7.5 kW expansion of existing solar PV systems, including those installed on three-phase power.
The company said the inverter, which measures 516 mm x 440 mm x 184 mm and weighs in at 30kg and has 97% efficiency, and max voltage of 580 W DC. It has an operating temperature range of -25 C to 60 C, fan-less design, low noise emissions, and comes with a 10-year warranty. Customers also have the option to add automated remote control, such as with virtual power plant (VPP) participation.
The LGES-5048 is designed to fit with LG’s RESU Home range of lithium-ion residential battery energy storage solutions which includes the RESU6.5 (6.5 kWh), RESU10 (9.8kWh), RESU12 (11.7 kWh) and RESU13 (12.4 kWh) versions with each inverter able to connect up to two battery units.
LG Energy Solution Residential General Manager Philip Crotty said the range of battery and inverter-pairing capacities allows system designs to be tailored to each household’s unique requirements, catering for a “clear trend” towards larger solar PV systems backed by battery storage as solar feed-in tariffs are reduced or eliminated.
“Exporting excess solar power is increasingly disallowed in some regions with high solar penetration and excess solar power is simply of higher value to the consumer than it is to the utilities,” he said. “These changes reduce the value proposition for solar PV-only and increase the value proposition of solar PV plus battery storage.”
Crotty said there is a growing demand for home batteries with more than half of existing home battery users looking to scale up their energy capacity for increased energy resiliency.
He said the Covid-19 pandemic had contributed to the rise in residential demand, having triggered a worldwide stay home and work from home culture, with indoor activities like video conferencing, streaming, chatting and gaming increasing in popularity.
“There is a trend towards larger capacity batteries and customers who want to leave open the possibility of expanding their batteries in the future,” he said. “This is particularly notable for those who have already experienced the benefits of having batteries and want even more flexibility in their power system.”

As the U.S. power grid progresses toward being sourced with 100% renewable energy, storage becomes critical to operating reliably and cost-effectively. Research at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) suggests that there is no single “silver bullet” storage technology, but instead, a mix of technologies that could offer the most optimal future. 
In a study published in Energy & Environmental Science, researchers from NREL used a custom, high-resolution model to compare energy storage possibilities across the United States. The group found geographic variation, among other factors, can determine the optimal energy storage portfolio. 
For example, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) grid has high solar penetration, and would benefit from discharging seasonal storage for around 50 days to cover winter months in the model. Compare this to the wind-driven Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which could deploy shorter-duration seasonal storage, with a capacity of five to 14 days. The researchers said these durations are currently much longer than currently deployed storage technologies. 
Storage faces trade-offs in efficiency and capital costs for both the power and energy components, which is why the researchers say multiple technologies are useful. Short-duration technologies like Li-ion batteries have high efficiencies but also high energy-related costs, while long-duration storage like compressed air or pumped thermal have lower energy-related costs but suffer from lower efficiencies. 
The study found that as a system approaches 100% renewable operations, a growing share of its storage portfolio would benefit from multiple-day to even seasonal capacity. This is due to an increasing seasonal mismatch of the remaining load and supply of renewable energy.
NREL also said a strategy of storage-to-storage charging may arise, to drop the rate of renewable energy curtailments and store more power where it’s needed.
The researchers said their models are important for renewable developers and stakeholders who are planning 10 to 20 years ahead. They said that because storage technologies are flexible they can be used for a variety of grid services. A next research step will be to understand the full range of energy storage benefits to inform optimal storage portfolios.

Limited (BCRECL), a joint venture between power producers in the two countries, is setting up a 60 MW solar power plant, as part of a larger deal to generate 450-MW electricity from renewables in the South Asian country. And the joint venture is now seeking an EPC provider to build the project.
China will invest some $500 million for the 500 MW renewable electricity ventures in the country. Of this total sum, 50 MW will come from wind.
The selected EPC contractor for the 60 MW project will also be responsible for construction of a 37 kilometre 132 kV double circuit transmission line with substation bay extension, on a turnkey basis. Having a minimum average annual turnover of $100 million within the last three years, the bidders should have completed at least two solar PV projects, both of which are outside of their home countries, each with a minimum capacity of 50 MW (AC), within the last five years.
The power plants should have been in continuous commercial operation for a minimum of one year prior to the bid closing date. The work scope for the EPC include design, installation, testing and commissioning of the PV plant and auxiliaries including grid connection.
The bidders have to furnish a bid security payment amounting $1.5 million in the form of an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee by a scheduled bank in Bangladesh, or a foreign bank duly endorsed and authenticated by a scheduled bank in Bangladesh.
Selling of bid documents will start on 24 October 2021 and be ended on 26 December 2021.
Bangladesh’s state run North-West Power Generation Company Ltd (NWPGCL) and the China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) jointly formed a company namely Bangladesh-China Renewable Energy Company (Pvt.) Limited (BCRECL) in September last year to generate 500 MW electricity from renewables.
The 60 MW solar power plant in Sujanagar, Pabna, in the northwest of Bangladesh, will be set up in 205.7 acres of land and the authority expects the project to start commercial operation by December 2022.
The BCRECL already invited EPC contractors to bid for another 68 MW solar power plant in Sirajganj district this July. To be established in 214 acres of land, the project is also expected to be completed by next year.
Another 50 MW Wind Power Plant of the BCRECL in Patuakhali district is also expected to start commercial operation in December 2023. Bangladesh presently generates 776 MW clean energy, around 3% of its power mix, and aims to source 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2050.
