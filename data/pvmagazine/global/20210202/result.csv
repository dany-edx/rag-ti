The order includes high-speed, multi-busbar cell soldering stringer and PV cell laser cutting machinery, with an estimated value of RMB80 million (US$12.5 million). The equipment will be delivered from April.
Gaojing Technology has begun construction of its 50 GW wafer factory in Zhuhai City, Guangdong province. The fab will produce 210mm mono-type wafers and will be built in three phases. The first, 15 GW section is expected to be complete by September and a second 15 GW phase is scheduled for completion in 2022. The final, 20 GW portion should be finalized in 2023.
Monocrystalline module provider Longi has secured a 500 MW solar panel supply deal with U.S. solar developer Strata Solar. The panels will be shipped over the next two years. The financial details of the supply agreement were not disclosed.
Monocrystalline wafer manufacturer Wuxi Shangji Automation announced on Thursday its wholly-owned subsidiary Baotou Hongyuan has signed a long-term supply agreement with Chinese solar cell maker Tongwei. Under the terms of the agreement, Baotou Hongyuan will supply more than 270 million monocrystalline wafers this year to Tongwei subsidiaries, on a monthly pricing basis. The estimated value of the supply contract is around RMB1.3 billion (US$204 million). The deal is the second long-term contract signed by Shangji Automation in the last two weeks, following an arrangement with Chint.
There was a more positive update on trading from polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly yesterday. The Hong Kong-listed company said it will officially raise the annual production capacity at its Jiangsu Zhongneng Polysilicon Technology Development Co Ltd unit from 6,000 to 10,000 metric tons from tomorrow. The company went into cross-default on Saturday after the non-payment of US$500 million of three-year senior notes and the unpaid creditors have until Monday to sign up to a reorganization of debts at GCL.
Battery manufacturer Ganfeng Lithium on Friday upgraded its expectations for 2020. The company had stated it expected to post RMB400-500 million (US$61.9-77.4 million) more net profit for shareholders than the figure banked in 2019 but that number has now risen to an estimated RMB910 million-1.07 billion. The company said the increase was down to rising lithium salt production volumes and sales figures – even as average selling prices fell last year – plus a “significant” rise in the fair value of assets including Ganfeng’s offtake agreements from Australia’s Pilbarra lithium mine. Ganfeng added, the latest figure is still based on unaudited accounts.

As part of the event staged by trade body the Africa Solar Industry Association (AFSIA), Bernardo Lazo, of London-based, East and West Africa-focused PV distributor Namene Solar, discussed how carbon credit financing had helped fill the funding gaps on a project to distribute 652,000 ‘pico-solar' lights for 1.2 million people in Namibia.
The financing model offered by the company – formerly known as Yingli Namene West Africa – involves companies or organizations which have pledged to compensate for their carbon emissions and/or go carbon neutral, buying carbon credits issued for each ton of greenhouse gas emission removed by accredited clean power plants. The cash raised by selling carbon credits can help bridge funding gaps to bring such schemes to life, as it did in Namibia.
Lazo stressed, though, the cost of independently certifying the amount of carbon saved meant such projects had a minimum scale of driving at least 10-20,000 tons of annual carbon savings, with the Namibia scheme demonstrating the efficacy of aggregating numerous small scale renewables consumers into single investment opportunities.
The successful roll-out of such projects requires selection of the correct solar product and project partners, Lazo told the AFSIA webinar, as well as efficient data collection – to verify carbon savings – and a fully-functioning distribution model and monitoring of the units distributed, for after-sales service.
Saul Wainwright, chief financial officer at Cape Town based solar cell leasing business The Sun Exchange, discussed his company's use of people-powered solar to get installations up and running.
The South African company – founded in 2014 and which now claims 19,000 members in 168 countries – offers small scale, crowdfunding-style solar investors the chance to fund individual solar cells in its planned arrays, in return for banking 20 years of lease payments on each generation device once projects come to fruition.
Wainwright told the AFSIA webinar his company only considers projects which can generate electricity cheaper than existing options and aims to supply power at 20-60% lower than what's available on the market.
With The Sun Exchange providing insurance for its renewables projects, and replacing inverters and panels, Wainwright said the company also accepted cell investments through Bitcoin, enabling the micro payments at minimal transaction cost. The company's website claims it offers many of its clients their first experience of Bitcoin and blockchain systems.

Green Investment Group (GIG), which is part of Australia-based venture capital fund Macquarie, has launched Cero Generation (Cero), a specialized solar energy company that will operate in Europe.
Cero will act as an independently operating GIG holding company and will build a PV portfolio of 8 GW spread across 150 projects located in the U.K., Italy, Spain, Poland, France and the Netherlands.
GIG said that Cero's team of professionals is comprised of more than 40 energy experts who work alongside local partners to bring their “world-class industrial, commercial and technical knowledge” to the company's projects and clients. The team members, led by CEO Nikolaj Harbo, come from GIG's European development team.
Cero specializes in carrying out ground-mounted and commercial solar power projects and is also a provider of integrated energy storage solutions. The company is said to work through all phases of a project life cycle, from development to construction and operation.
In North America and the Asia-Pacific region, GIG operates as a solar project developer, through Savion LLC and Blueleaf Energy, respectively. Together with Cero, these platforms have advanced the realization of a portfolio of solar energy projects, on a global scale, of more than 20 GW.
In 2019, Macquarie and Univergy launched Nara Solar, a European solar development platform that aimed to focus on the Spanish market.

France’s Ministry of Ecological and Solidarity Transition has announced the winners of the 11th round of tenders for commercial and industrial rooftop PV systems with generation capacities ranging from 100 kW to 8 MW.
The ministry selected 405 projects with a total installed capacity of 191.3 MW in the procurement exercise. The projects will value the electricity produced at an average price of €91.2/MWh for projects whose generating capacities are between 100 kW and 500 kW, and €79.8/MWh for those whose capacities range from 500 kW to 8 MW.
Overall, 25 developers were successful in the 11th round and 12 of them secured less than 3 MW of capacity. Urbasolar won the largest amount of 33.8 MW.
In the previous procurement exercise — the 10th round of the scheme — the final average prices for the two categories were €96.49/MWh and €86.17/MWh, respectively. According to French consultant Finergreen, after the strong volatility of the six rounds of the tender scheme, prices have stabilized with a slow and gradual drop in average prices. Between the seventh and the latest round average prices fell by more than 10%.
The final average prices of the latest four tenders, however, were higher than those registered in previous procurement rounds. In a tender in September 2018, for example, the final average price of all selected projects was €76.80/MWh, down 5% from the €80.80 recorded in the round held five months earlier. Then ecology minister François De Rugy said at the time that the largest rooftop projects assigned in the exercise had achieved a historically low price of €72.20/MWh.

The researchers said that the system could rely on different material combinations with hydrophobic and hydrophilic behaviors and that they utilized two kinds of coatings: a sperfluoro-octyltrichlorosilane (FOTS)-trimethylsilanol (TMS) self-assembled monolayer (SAM); and a Cytop-TMS spin-coated thin-film. “Cytop is an amorphous fluoropolymer with good transparency over the visible and UV wavelength ranges, good solubility to coat various surface designs, and excellent water repellent properties,” they explained.
After the FOTS-TMS treatment, the glass of the module is still transparent and optically flat, while the Cytop-TMS film improved the transmission with an enhancement of between 2.5 and 3.5% over the visible wavelength range. “The Cytop-TMS coating generated higher optical output power than bare glass and FOTS-TMS surface treatment, in accordance with the light transmission measurements,” the academics said. “The optical performance demonstrated that our coating systems were compatible with solar module cover glass and can even have anti-reflective properties to improve solar module power output efficiency.”
The tested PV device was equipped with the ARC patterns and placed on a vibration stage. Water droplets were applied with a pipette to the surface and transported, under vibration, to the contaminated parts to remove dust particles. The droplets were able to overcome the force of gravity and climb on the device's inclined surface under orthogonal vibration. “Our experiment showed that the droplet can climb uphill at up to a 15-degree inclination of the surface,” the scientists highlighted. “With higher inclination angles, the droplet tended to be shaken off  the surface.”
According to their measurements, the tension force of the module surface and the water hydrodynamic shear force are able to remove the surface contaminants as the droplet moves onto the surface contaminants, which include water-soluble, insoluble, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic dust particles. “Dust particles were dislodged by the surface tension force and the hydrodynamic force, while encapsulated by the internal flow of the vibrating droplet,” the group explained.
The researchers claim that the system makes limited use of water as it uses 10 μL droplets. “The entire fabrication consists of a single-mask process to reduce manufacturing costs,” they concluded, without adding specific figures on the costs that the technique will add to those of a PV system.
The proposed approach is presented in the paper An active self-cleaning surface system for photovoltaic modules using anisotropic ratchet conveyors and mechanical vibration, published in Microsystems & Nanoengineering.

Shoals Technologies Group marked its Wall Street premiere by raising more than $2.2 billion in the solar company’s initial public offering (IPO).
Shoals said its balance-of-systems (BOS) systems are deployed on more than 20 GW of solar projects globally.
The Tennessee-based firm and its parent entity first intended to offer 50 million shares of Class A common stock priced between $19.00 and $21.00 per share. Shoals later upsized the IPO to 77 million shares at $25.00 each.
The stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “SHLS” on January 27. According to reports, shares climbed to above $30.00 and raised about $1.9 billion by the time the market closed.
“Shoals is excited to become a Nasdaq-listed company,” President and CEO Jason Whitaker told pv magazine USA. “This is a key milestone for our company as we execute on our mission to deliver innovative products that reduce the cost and improve the reliability and safety of renewable energy.”
Shoals announced the completion of the upsized IPO on January 29, noting the company and its parent entity ultimately sold more than 88.5 million shares.
Shoals itself sold more than 11.5 million shares totaling almost $289 million. That included an additional 2.5 million shares following the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase more.
Meanwhile, a parent entity controlled by funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management LP sold 77 million shares, including an additional 9 million to underwriters. That totaled almost $1.93 billion.
All told, the IPO raised more than $2.21 billion for Shoals and the Oaktree-managed parent entity.
The company’s IPO is among the most successful in the solar industry, joining that of tracker builder Array Technologies last year.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan acted as joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters for the Shoals offering. Guggenheim Securities and UBS Investment Bank acted as joint book-running managers. Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Credit Suisse are acting as book-runners. Cowen and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. are acting as co-managers.

Scatec – known as Scatec Solar until the addition of SN Power's 2.5 GW of hydro assets in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa – today confirmed it had completed the acquisition from Norwegian state-owned investor Norfund, to add the hydro portfolio “after transaction close.”
With Scatec swelling its own pipeline 800 MW last year – including its first wind farm – the company hit the 10.5 GW mark with the addition of planned assets in South Africa and Vietnam. The developer also added the 150 MW Sukkur project in Pakistan to its list of ‘backlog' projects which have secured firm electricity offtake agreements and are 90% certain of completion.
In this morning's financial update, Oslo-based Scatec reported fourth-quarter “proportionate” revenue of NOK497 million ($57.8 million), gross earnings of NOK223 million and a power production figure that was 37% higher than in the corresponding period of 2019, at 407 GWh. Scatec's October-to-December consolidated result, however, was a net loss of NOK561 million on the back of NOK679 million revenue and gross earnings of NOK448 million.
The company explained its use of proportionate figures by stating: “With proportionate financials, Scatec reports its share of revenues, expenses, profits and cash flows from its subsidiaries without eliminations based on Scatec’s economic interest in the subsidiaries.”
Despite the annual loss, the board sanctioned a NOK1.09/share ($0.13) dividend for 2020, based on full year proportionate revenue of NOK2.84 billion ($330 million), for a consolidated NOK2.75 billion; and gross earnings of NOK1.3 billion, for a consolidated NOK2.07 billion.
The company said power generation for 2020 had risen 44%, year-on-year, with CEO Raymond Carlsen announcing: “In 2020, we made the greatest expansion since our establishment by broadening our growth strategy and acquiring SN Power.”
This copy was amended on 03/02/21 to indicate Scatec lost $42.7 million in 2020, not “more than $65 million,” as previously stated, and to remove the statement it had not released full-year consolidated figures – they had merely been left out of the press release announcing the latest update. Scatec's definition of proportionate figures has been added, along with the full-year consolidated figures for 2020.

The proposed model is based on the stochastic fractal search (SFS) – a powerful metaheuristic – and a nature-inspired algorithm that is claimed to solve complex optimization problems. The algorithm imitates the natural phenomenon of growth and uses the diffusion process based on random fractals. The mathematical concept of fractals defines any complex geometric shape that is distinct from the simple figures of Euclidean geometry.
The scientists explained that the mathematical modeling of PV can be classified into the three following categories: single-diode model (SDM); double-diode model (DDM); and three diode model (TDM). The proposed model was applied only to the first two categories. “Since the required parameters for the modeling are not provided by the manufacturer, the parameter estimation of a solar PV [product] has attained high priority, which helps to improve the efficiency of the solar PV system,” the academics specified.
Several experimental, measured datasets were used and the SDM and DDM models were analyzed over real-time measurements at different weather conditions. Three different case studies were considered in the analysis. “From the examined three cases, it can be understood that exploitation and exploration capability in SFS have a solid effect in avoiding premature convergence,” the research group stated.
Premature convergence arises in an algorithm when the genes of some high-rated individuals quickly attain to dominate the population, constraining it to converge to a local optimum, which reduces significantly the algorithm's ability to continue the search for better solutions. An algorithm operates on a set of individuals which is called a population and each individual is a solution to the problem to be solved.
The scientists concluded that the achieved parameters were closely matched with the experimental dataset, which in their view shows the “perfectness” of the method. “The proposed SFS method can be recommended as a high-valued optimization technique for the estimation of solar PV parameters under any test conditions,” they affirmed.
The model was described in the study A robust parameter estimation approach based on stochastic fractal search optimization algorithm applied to solar PV parameters, published in Energy Reports.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/02/renewable-energy-project-financing-in-chile-analyzed/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHILE",,"FEBRUARY 2, 2021",Renewable energy project financing in Chile analyzed,"Underlying terms and conditions refer to financial covenants, but also to cash-trap or lock-up periods, equity pre-funding requirements, additional administrative, legal and technical burdens to meet funding criteria, and fiscal impacts from rigid transaction structures.
To illustrate, in the past five years major project finance banks such as Japan’s MUFC, Spain-based Banco Santander and France’s Natixis, among many others, and capital markets, have increasingly offered long-term traditional non-recourse financing.
This array of optionality allows developers to obtain more efficient financing in both cost and tenor terms. However, the macroeconomic shocks from the global pandemic have taken their toll. Banks across the globe are forced to once again walk the tightrope of lending cheaply in order to stimulate economies without over compromising their limited capital, and as pricing is essentially taken out of banks’ hands, their focus has shifted to things they can still control: underlying terms and conditions.
Faced with this predicament, banks are attempting to control their risk exposure as much as possible, and how a bank goes about attempting to control said risks is the difference between a lender that is simply willing and a lender that understands a project.
In the Chilean renewables sector, project debt headline terms (rate, leverage and tenor) and overall appetite have not drastically deteriorated, but banks’ risk committees are attempting to further reduce their risk exposure. In Chile, this has translated into stricter underlying terms and conditions with many implications at the project and HoldCo levels.
In these Covid-19 times, we have seen firsthand where project loans’ underlying conditions and their resulting operational issues have as great an impact on a portfolio’s profitability as does the nominal cost of the debt.
Because of their nature, it is highly complex to compare terms and conditions (not least because of confidentiality issues), but project sponsors need to be mindful that a lender should not only be willing to finance the project (which is essential), but also understand their project’s specific risks and particularities so that the loan reflects (as best as possible) the reality on the ground.
When a project finance mandate is executed, a substantial amount of time should be dedicated to sourcing and speaking with potential lenders. This stage can (and should) be highly hands-on and time intensive, but it is time well spent because this is where we can gauge a potential lender’s level of understanding. Their overall level of comfort will ultimately be reflected in the loan’s underlying conditions, which will in turn greatly affect a project’s long-term profitability.
One possible lesson from recent experiences is that the cost of debt should become slightly less important to a project sponsor, especially since interest rates are pushed lower and lower by central banks across the globe.
Interest rate margins are once again tightening, and yield curves are flattening. Benchmark rates are being lowered, as are spreads, to incentivize investment in the midst of the global Covid-induced recession.
One conclusion is that the most expensive project debt will not be vastly more expensive than the least expensive project debt. The other is that sponsors should instead be increasingly focused on anticipating the operational aspects of a loan’s underlying terms and conditions.
Firstly, banks are taking steps to further minimize their exposure to construction risk. This is done by enforcing stricter conditions in the security package before a project can be considered eligible for funding (more milestones must be accomplished by the sponsor), increased pre-funding equity amounts, increased conservatism in revenue and cost projections, greater oversight into the EPC and insurance companies and, in some cases, the involvement of credit agencies to assess counter-party risks.
These measures increase the amount of cash required from the sponsor at this stage, in addition to raising the overall cost. As a developer, your most precious tangible asset is cash, and its finite nature means it has a high opportunity cost associated to it.
Increased cash requirements per project means that other projects (opportunities) are being passed on or delayed. In development, the opportunity cost of development equity is a sort of Golden Rule, and raising the cash amount a sponsor needs to commit to a single project for it to reach COD has profound implications on their business.
During the operational phase, there are several measures Chilean lenders are opting to put in place to further control risks. For example, forcing a certain organizational structure (DevCo, BuyCo, HoldCo*, etc.) on the sponsor could have tax implications and administrative inefficiencies that will need to be borne at the corporate level.
It is not new for a lender to isolate the financing structure as much as possible, but we have seen additional layers or burdens put in place. Also, additional reserve accounts of an increased magnitude mean that less of the raised funds will be available to the sponsor. Along these lines, increased limitations (time and operative) on when a project can declare dividends means that a sponsor will need to wait longer before beginning to recoup its equity.
Of the previously mentioned points, this last topic particularly has a direct and significant impact on a project’s Internal Rate of Return (IRR). That being said, one way that can generate additional value for the invested equity is by raising subordinated debt tranches. By negotiating rates and tenors that behave like the project’s senior debt, the subordinated debt or junior debt can help boost equity returns.
In closing, in today’s macroeconomic environment, a project sponsor should consider reformulating their focus when analyzing potential lenders. Instead of targeting the cheapest lenders and asking, “at what rate?”, going forward maybe it should be replaced by “do you understand my project?” and “how will you lend?”

Canadian gas giant Atco has bought the rights to develop the $500m 325 MW Central West Pumped Storage Hydro Project near Yetholme in Central West New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The project marks Atco’s first major move into renewables in the National Energy Market (NEM) and could prove a significant one considering its centrality to the proposed Central West-Orana Renewable Energy Zone (CWOREZ). 
The 325 MW pumped storage project will be able to generate 2,600 MWh of stored energy for a period of up to eight hours. The location’s close proximity to copious resources of solar and wind and also a 330 kV grid connection supporting the Sydney load centre makes it an important firming agent to the NSW government’s CWOREZ. 
Ben Bolot, Atco Australia’s executive general manager of business development, credited the policy certainty provided by the NSW government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, for providing Ato the security it needed to invest in such a large scale renewable energy project. It's another strong demonstration that the policy vacuum at the federal level is haemorrhaging potential investment in the renewable space. 
“The Central West Pumped Storage Hydro Project will be an integral piece of the puzzle in supporting the development of new renewable generation capacity in NSW and transitioning our energy system,” said Bolot. “Grid stability and security is one of the most pressing issues confronting the energy sector. Pumped storage hydro projects provide the long duration energy solution required to complement the short duration battery projects that have been recently announced. This project is a critical part of securing our energy future and making NSW an attractive location for industry with stable, low cost energy supply as we transition away from carbon based fuels.” 
The CWOREZ, currently in its early stages of feasibility testing and planning, is set to be NSW’s first pilot REZ and expected to unlock up to 3 GW of new renewable generation by the middle of the decade. Atco believes its pumped storage project will be a key source of dispatchable power “to ensure the grid is reliable and secure to support the growth of variable renewable energy.” 
Atco expects construction on the project to begin in early 2023 and to see operations commence by late 2025.

The new module has a power output of 410/420 W and a conversion efficiency between 20.5% and 21.0%. It has a size of 1924 x 1038 mm, a weight of 22 kg and a total surface of around 2 m2. “The width of the module is standardized, while three different length options allow the Hi-MO 4m series to maximize the photovoltaic system's installation capacity in residential rooftops,” the manufacturer specified.
“In terms of electrical matching, the current at maximum power of the Hi-MO 4m module is lower than 11A, which is a perfect match for the various brands of string inverters, power optimizers and micro inverters available worldwide,” Longi further explained, adding that the product also has strong resistance to wind and snow loads.
The new product will be part of the Hi-MO 4 series that Longi launched in early 2019 and includes two more panels: a 60-cell panel with a power output of 370-385 W, a conversion efficiency ranging from 20.3% to 21.1%, with a size of 1755 x 1038 mm and a weight of 19.5 kg; and a 72-cell panel with a power output of 450-460 W, a conversion efficiency ranging from 20.7% to 21.2%, with a size of 2094 x 1038 mm and a weight of 23 kg.
All the modules of the series can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C, while the operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree (Celsius). They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The junction box has an IP 68 rating. The panel's front side is covered with 3.2 mm of coated tempered glass.
