The project to be installed at the Southwest European Logistics Platform in Badajoz will cover a total surface area of 177,000 square meters for an expected investment of €400 million. Initially, the project should have a 2 GW capacity in 2023 and gradually increase to reach 10 GW in 2025, with an option to expand to 20 GW in 2027. “The project is the private initiative of Phi4tech (battery and cathode factories), Lithium Iberia (Las Navas mining project and lithium transformation factory) and individual partners in the case of the Aguablanca mine,” Phi4tech said in a statement, adding that the battery project was part of a wider storage project that includes the construction of a cathode factory and the extraction of lithium and nickel throughout Spain.
Total subsidiary Total Quadran announced the commissioning of a 1.5 MWp project in Vichy. The project includes a photovoltaic parking lot and charging stations for electric vehicles. Nearly 4,000 solar panels on a surface of 9,500 m2 have been installed. “The inauguration of this photovoltaic plant allows the Vichy plant, carbon neutral since 2018, to produce more than 30% of its electricity locally in this way,” said Jean-Yves Larraufie, director of Cosmétique Active Production (CAP) L’Oréal.
Stockholm-based Alight has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with building materials company Kingspan Group to provide a 1,310 kWp rooftop installation to a factory in Stigamo outside Jönköping, Sweden. “Under the terms of the agreement, the rooftop solar power plant will provide 20% of the factory’s total electricity requirements. Once commissioned, the Stigamo factory solar power plant will be one of Sweden's largest rooftop solar installations,” Alight said, arguing that rooftops are vastly underutilized areas in Sweden. The installation, which should produce around 1.15 GWh a year, will be completed in summer 2021.
German manufacturer Singulus Technologies reported a 58.8% decrease in sales of photovoltaic equipment in 2020. This week, the company from Kahl am Main reported sales of around €34 million, compared to just under €80 million in 2019 and €127.5 million in 2018. In terms of operating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), excluding extraordinary impairment charges, the company expects a loss of between €32.5 million and €33.5 million.
Many African industrial units, small and medium enterprises, still suffer from a lack of access to electricity, which is one of the major obstacles to economic and social development in Africa, the African Development Bank (AfDB) reported. According to the AfDB, the rate of access to electricity in Africa increased from 42% in 2015 to 54% in 2019, thanks largely to the financing of interconnection projects between African member countries and the increase in renewable energy projects, which account for 60% of the new 291 MW of electricity generation capacity installed in 2019. The bank mentioned the 580 MW Noor Ouarzazate, operational since late 2018, as a positive example.
Spanish solar tracker company Soltec Power has signed a contract with Madrid-based Elecnor to supply bifacial solar trackers for a 359 MW project in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. “We are very proud to be able to work with Elecnor on this project, reflecting Soltec's commitment to the Brazilian market while consolidating our leadership position in the photovoltaic sector of this country,” commented Raúl Morales, CEO of Soltec Power Holdings. With the project in the Pirapora region, Soltec increases “its leadership in Brazil with a market share of 35.7% and a track record of 2.2 GW in installed projects.” The company has a total of 8.4 GW installed projects (26% in Brazil).
Colombia-headquartered Celsia, the energy company of Grupo Argos, achieved consolidated revenues of $3.5 billion with a reduction of 5.1% compared to the previous year due, among other reasons, to the sale of Zona Franca Celsia and other assets to Caoba Inversiones. Generation contributed $1.3 billion, and the distribution business contributed $2.2 billion. The EBITDA reached $1.23 billion with a 2.1% decrease.
Madrid-based Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) has closed the financing deal for the development of the largest large-scale solar power plant in Armenia. The agreement for the 55 MW photovoltaic facility located in the municipality of Mets Masrik in the Gegharkunik region was signed with the support of the Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2), a government entity aimed at promoting the development of the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors in the country. FRV and the Armenian Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure signed in 2018 the Government Support Agreement (GSA) for the design, financing, construction, ownership, and operation of the solar plant.
The Czechia-headquartered Solek Group, through its Chilean subsidiaries, and France's Natixis, as the issuing bank, have signed a €85.25 million secured facility for the financing of solar power plants in Chile, totaling at least 110 MWp. These solar projects will operate under Chile's special regime for Small Medium Distributed Generation (SMDG) plants.

The U.S. Department of Energy announced a goal to cut the cost of solar energy by 60% within the next 10 years. It also announced nearly $128 million in funding to lower costs, improve performance, and speed the deployment of solar energy technologies.
Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said that solar is already cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels in many parts of the country. “With more innovation we can cut the cost again by more than half within the decade.”
DOE set a new goal of cutting the current cost of 4.6 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to 3 cents/kWh by 2025 and 2 cents/kWh by 2030. DOE said that by 2035, solar PV could represent between 30% and 50% of electricity supply.
The $128 million funding initiatives are through DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) and aim to support advancements in perovskites and cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin films. The awards include:
$40 million for perovskite R&D: Perovskites are a family of emerging solar materials that have potential to make highly efficient thin-film solar cells with low production costs. DOE awarded $40 million to 22 projects that will advance perovskite PV device and manufacturing research and development as well as performance.
Projects that received funding included $2 million for work to design and prototype 1-meter by 2-meter tandem perovskite modules and investigate encapsulation and backsheets to enhance module durability in the field, and $500,000 to develop a new low-bandgap perovskite for perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells. A full list of funded projects is here.
$3 million Perovskite Startup Prize: This new prize competition is intended to speed entrepreneurs’ path to commercializing perovskite technologies by providing seed capital for newly formed companies.
$20 million for CdTe thin films: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will set up a consortium to advance less expensive CdTe thin-film solar technologies. The goal is to advance low-cost manufacturing techniques and domestic research to increase opportunities for U.S. firms to capture a larger portion of the $60 billion global solar manufacturing sector.
In addition, DOE announced $7 million for projects to increase the lifetime of silicon-based PV systems from about 30 years to 50 years to lower the cost of energy and reduce waste. The aim is to improve PV system components, such as inverters, connectors, cables, racks, and trackers.
The announcement also supports several concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP) projects.
$33 million for CSP advances: The new funding includes funding for improvements to the reliability and performance of CSP plants, which can dispatch solar energy whenever it is needed; identifies new solar applications for industrial processes, which contribute 20% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions; and advances long-duration thermal-energy storage devices. DOE said that long-duration energy storage is critical to decarbonizing the electricity sector and couples well with CSP plants, but the cost must fall by a factor of two to unlock deployment.
$25 million to demonstrate a next-generation CSP power plant: Sandia National Laboratories will receive funding to build a facility where researchers, developers, and manufacturers can test next-generation CSP components and systems and advance toward DOE’s 2030 cost target of 5 cents/kWh for CSP plants.
Sandia also received $9 million as part of funding to establish a testing center to validate the performance of new perovskite devices.  The New Mexico-based lab will join with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in setting up the lab. NREL received $5 million in funding for its role in the initiative.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/26/sma-exceeds-e1bn-in-sales-for-first-time-since-2012/,"FINANCE,INVERTERS,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 26, 2021",SMA exceeds €1bn in sales for first time since 2012,"From pv magazine Germany
German inverter manufacturer SMA Solar Technology AG reported a 26% year-on-year jump in revenue to €1.03 billion in fiscal 2020, as shipments rose 12% to 14.4 GW, pushing total revenue past the €1 billion mark for the first time since 2012.
It also posted a net profit of €28.1 million, from a net loss of €8.6 million in 2019. Net liquidity fell from €303 million to €226 million in 2020, it said.
“The decline is in particular due to the fact that the comparative figure at the end of 2019 included increased customer prepayments on account of a major order that was processed in the first quarter of 2020,” the manufacturer said. “By the end of 2020, customer prepayments were back to normal levels.”
The company reported strong demand in the residential PV segment, especially in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In the large-scale business, it gained market share, especially in the United States, and it was able to consolidate its leading position in Australia.
“SMA headquarters is now supplied with electricity exclusively from PV and wind turbine systems in the immediate vicinity,” said SMA CEO Jürgen Reinert. “Our heating supply here is now also completely CO2 neutral. It is our goal to make SMA fully CO2 neutral around the world starting 2025 at the latest.”
The SMA managing board has also confirmed its sales and earnings forecast for 2021, first published in February. The aim is to increase sales to between €1.07 billion and €1.17 billion, with EBITDA to rise to between €75 million and €95 million. For the first quarter of 2021, SMA expects sales between €235 million and €245 million, up slightly from last year. First-quarter EBITDA is forecast between €14 million and €17 million – slightly higher than in the first quarter of 2020.
“Due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis worldwide and increasing prices for raw materials and PV modules, we have recorded a relatively subdued start to the year,” said Reinert. “At the same time, incoming orders increased in March. Our current product order backlog plus sales already cover around 50% of the annual guidance.”
However, the management board assumes that SMA will be able to benefit from expected growth in PV markets in Europe and North America, as well as the global storage market. The implementation of cost-cutting measures in 2018 is also set to have a positive impact on profitability this year.

The underlining assumptions are a cost of $16/MWh and a 100 MW electrolyzer running 16.4 hours a day on average. The German company is set to roll out its in-house proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis technology to implement a gigawatt production of electrolyzers. Siemens Energy describes green hydrogen as “the second stage of the energy transition.”
British energy company BP and UK gas distributor Northern Gas Networks (NGN) signed a memorandum of understanding last week to collaborate on hydrogen projects in the north of England. The two companies will study the impact of BP’s Teesside hydrogen plans on local industrial and domestic consumers. BP also announced last week a project to build a 1 GW blue hydrogen facility in the conurbation around the River Tees, covering 20% of the UK’s hydrogen target by 2030. “It’s fantastic to see BP planning to invest in hydrogen production at Teesside, placing our region at the forefront of a green recovery,” said NGN CEO Mark Horsley. The gas distributor said the conversion of the UK gas network to transport 100% hydrogen was economically viable. Pending regulatory approval expected in the next three months, NGN will start delivering a blend of 20% hydrogen to 670 properties in Winlaton, near Gateshead, while working to demonstrate the safety of hydrogen-fuelled appliances to earn the local population’s support.

Industry partners Arcelor Mittal Bremen, EWE, FAUN, Gasunie, swb and Tennet launched the Clean Hydrogen Coastline project in northern Germany on Wednesday. The project is aimed at integrating hydrogen technology into the German and European energy systems. Around 400 MW of electrolysis capacity should be deployed by 2024, with corresponding storage of hydrogen in the energy system. The project envisages total investments of up to €1.3 billion, Arcelor Mittal Bremen said in a statement. “We have the best conditions in northern Germany — the wind power region — to integrate hydrogen as an integral part of the energy system and lay the foundation for a European hydrogen economy,” commented EWE CEO Stefan Dohler.
South Korea-based industrial conglomerate Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings (HHIH) and Saudi state-run oil company Saudi Aramco signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly developed hydrogen and ammonia-related businesses. The two companies are looking for cooperation opportunities in joint research and development and using subsidiaries to promote specific projects. Hyundai Oilbank, the oil refinery unit of HHIH, is to import liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for conversion into blue hydrogen. It plans to open 300 hydrogen charging stations in the country by 2040. In the next three years, Hyundai Oilbank also expects to receive blue ammonia from Saudi Aramco and use it as fuel for liquefied natural gas (LNG) boilers. “The two parties will also strengthen cooperation in the shipbuilding business. Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering will be the first shipbuilder to develop a ship that can carry both liquefied petroleum gas cargoes and captured carbon dioxide at once,” HHIH said in a statement.
Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Investment Company and Italian gas infrastructure specialist Snam signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on hydrogen projects in the United Arab Emirates. They will carry out technical and economic feasibility studies to promote hydrogen development in the Gulf and elsewhere. The companies have not explained what type of hydrogen they are focusing on. “This signing with Snam is an extension of our joint efforts to develop a hydrogen economy for the UAE, and we are committed to advancing the role hydrogen will play to meet future energy demand globally,” said Musabbeh Al Kaabi, CEO of UAE Investments at Mubadala Investment Company. Snam said it considered the UAE and Gulf region of strategic importance “because of their crucial role in the energy transition.”
The UK government announced an £11.2 million project to manufacture low-cost hydrogen fuel cell technology for buses and create a hydrogen center in Ballymena, Northern Ireland. “This will continue to level up our local economy, allowing Wrightbus to continue producing the next generation of world-leading hydrogen buses,” commented Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis. Wrightbus Executive Chairman Jo Bamford aims to increase production and significantly lower costs. The investment is part of a £54 million package, including a project for electric propulsion systems for heavy goods vehicles in Wales and a second project for energy-saving technology for cars and vans in Warwickshire.
French industrial gas provider Air Liquide, through its majority-owned joint venture Air Liquide Far Eastern (ALFE), has completed the first phase of the construction of hydrogen electrolyzers in Taiwan. The €200 million plan announced in April 2020 aims to produce up to 5,000 Nm3 of ultra-high purity hydrogen per hour. The hydrogen will be used by the semiconductor industry and emerging hydrogen applications in the island. The group will continue the construction of its phase 2 to phase 5 hydrogen electrolyzer plants in Taiwan over the next two years for a total capacity of 25 MW.
The California Energy Commission, the primary energy policy and planning agency of the US state, awarded Sierra Northern Railway and GTI nearly $4 million to fund the design, integration and demonstration of a hydrogen fuel cell switching locomotive at the Port of West Sacramento. The project includes advanced hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen storage, advanced battery and system control technologies. The demonstration project will collect data on the performance and the costs of the technology. “The potential California market for new hydrogen locomotives includes more than 260 switcher locomotives and up to 500 intrastate locomotives,” Sierra Northern Railway said in a statement.
Boeing subsidiary Insitu announced earlier this month that it completed the first flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) powered by a hydrogen-fuelled, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The 30-minute flight conducted in December 2020 lays the ground for test flights using a Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) storage tank on the aircraft later this year. “The 3-D-printed LH2 tank is an industry first, and is expected to support 10+ hours of endurance for ScanEagle3,” the company said in a statement, explaining that fuel cells showed improved reliability and significantly lower logistics costs in comparison to small IC engine propulsion solutions. “For our global defence customers, fuel-cell-powered UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] in this Group 2 space represents a significant game-changer in the battlespace,” said Andrew Duggan, managing director of Insitu Pacific.

The two companies started the approval process for the Agnes project at the beginning of 2019. “The permitting process is ongoing and the concession request for the offshore area and permit for the construction should be finalized within the end of 2023,” a spokesperson from Saipem told pv magazine.”The entire facility is planned to come online by the end of 2025.”
The plant will be built with a modularized approach and may include a 50 MW battery to balance the grid demand peak.
Saipem, through its subsidiary Moss Maritime, is also partnering with Norwegian oil giant Equinor to test an offshore floating solar array off the island of Froya, near Trondheim, in the Norwegian Sea. “At the moment, there is no involvement of Equinor in the Agnes project,” Saipem's spokesperson stated, adding that the Italian project will differ from the Norwegian plant. “It will be adjusted to fit the local weather conditions”.
Moss Maritime, which focuses on design and engineering services for the offshore energy sector, aims to become a leading provider of near coastal and offshore solutions for floating solar panel parks. Saipem expects to launch new offshore solar projects in the near future. “Most probably pilot projects first, but also commercial projects if applicable,” the spokesperson added.
The company will focus on the regions of Southeast Asia, North America, South America and the Mediterranean Sea. The company expects offshore PV installations to show a 5-10% higher production rate compared to ground-mounted installations.
Saipem recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Florence-based hydrogen specialist Alboran Hydrogen for the joint development of five green hydrogen plants — three in Italy, one in Albania and one in Morocco.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/26/perovskite-solar-module-with-17-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 26, 2021",Perovskite solar module with 17% efficiency,"An international research group has used a novel doping strategy to design a perovskite solar module that is claimed to achieve higher efficiency compared to other perovskite-based devices and, at the same time, to maintain remarkable operational stability.
While perovskite solar cells look to be well on the way to mass production, interest in the technology is still tempered by concerns about the stability of the hole transport layer (HTL) and its sensitivity to atmospheric conditions.
The scientists said they were able to vary the molecular weight (MW) of a hole transporter material (HTM) doped with poly(triarylamine) (PTAA). “The monotonic increase of the power conversion efficiency as a function of the MW is related to a similar increase of the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), and fill-factor (FF),” they explained, adding that, through this approach, the charge mobility inside the HTL and the charge transfer at the perovskite/HTL interface were increased by one order of magnitude.
This improvement was achieved, they went on to say, thanks to the polaron delocalization on the polymeric chains through the combined effect of doping strategy and MW tuning. Polaron formation in perovskite solar cells has been indicated in scientific research as a possible factor for making this kind of cell particularly efficient, although the mechanism behind polarons’ action is completely unknown. Polarons are a sort of fleeting distortions in a material's atomic lattice that form around a moving electron in a few trillionths of a second and then disappear.
The 17%-efficient panel was built with 20%-efficient perovskite cells connected in 14 series on a total active area of 42.8 cm2 and aperture area of 50 cm2. The increase of delocalized polarons in the HMW PTAA layer did not only provide a significant contribution to the device's high efficiency but also positively affected the underlying perovskite lattice, which improved its overall stability. The cells are claimed to retain over 90% of the initial efficiency after 1080 h thermal stress at 85° C and 87% of initial efficiency after 160 h exposure. The panel was able to maintain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after 800 h thermal stress at 85° C.
The module was presented in the paper “Beyond 17% stable perovskite solar module via polaron arrangement of tuned polymeric hole transport layer,” published in Nano Energy. The research group includes scientists from the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Italy, the University College London and the University of Cambridge in the UK and Germany's Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/26/how-much-floating-pv-is-enough/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 26, 2021",How much floating PV is enough?,"Scientists from Lancaster University and the University of Stirling in the United Kingdom have conducted a series of simulations to assess the environmental effects of floating PV plants on bodies of water.
In the paper “Floating photovoltaics could mitigate climate change impacts on water body temperature and stratification”, published in Solar Energy, the UK researchers explained that their approach was intended to assess both the positive and negative environmental consequences of floating PV deployment, as well as identifying scientific evidence of its impacts.
The academics simulated the effects of floating PV installations at a test lake in North West England, which they described as a typical monomictic, mesotrophic, deep and temperate lake. “We simulate water temperature, mixed depth and stratification timing to determine the sensitivity of a lake’s thermal structure to floating PV deployed at varying scale,” they explained. “We then consider the potential ecosystem consequences and implications for lake management in a changing climate.”
Their modeling was based on a one-dimensional process-based model, known as MyLake v1.2, which is commonly used to simulate the daily vertical distributions of water body temperature, evaporation, and instances of ice cover. The model was calibrated for a one-year period against observed water body temperatures.
The simulations showed that a floating array can have a significant cooling effect on water and that this effect is higher when the floating array occupies a large portion of the water basin. “As many metabolic processes are highly temperature-dependent, the deployment of floating PV at large coverages has the potential to change the functioning of lentic ecosystems by modifying animal behaviour, food web dynamics, life histories, species interactions and carbon cycling,” the study notes. “Reduced water temperatures may also present operational challenges, particularly to networks comprised of cast iron distribution mains.”
Furthermore, the researchers ascertained that, combined with the reduced wind speeds caused by the PV installations, the lower water temperature favored the formation of high surface coverages. “This considerable temporal shift in ice cover regime may have implications for cyanobacterial community composition and fish behaviour while enhancing cultural ecosystem service provisioning,” the researchers specified.
If the cooling effect of the PV plant on the water is considered a positive factor by the UK group, as it mitigates blooms of toxic blue-green algae and increased water evaporation, which are both caused by global warming, they also warned that colder water may result in a reduction of the duration of so-called thermal stratification, which they described as the formation of distinct layers of water at different temperatures. “This tends to happen more in the warmer summer months and can result in the bottom layer of water becoming deoxygenated, which deteriorates water quality – an obvious issue for supplies of drinking water,” they emphasized.
“There are also real risks of detrimental impacts, such as deoxygenation causing undesirable increases in nutrient concentrations and killing fish,” research co-author Giles Exley said. “We need to do more research to understand the likelihood of both positive and negative impacts.”
The right proportion between the surface occupied by the PV array and a water surface's total area would be key for addressing all of the above-mentioned potential issues.
The researchers found that floating projects with low surface coverages had a negligible effect on the thermal structure of the water, while projects with large portions of water covered were found to be major disruptors of the lake's archetypal thermal structure. “Appropriate design and deployment of floating PV will be required to mitigate the likelihood of hypolimnetic anoxia and to optimize changes in the composition of phytoplankton communities as floating PV modifies lake thermal structure and light climate,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/26/cost-comparison-between-agrivoltaics-and-ground-mounted-pv/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,RACKING,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 26, 2021",Cost comparison between agrivoltaics and ground-mounted PV,"Researchers from Germany's Technology and Support Centre (TFZ) have made a comparison between the upfront costs of several types of agrivoltaic power plants and conventional ground-mounted projects.
In an 88-page report, the institute's experts have analyzed, on top of the agrivoltaic technology costs, its land-use rate, other economic aspects, the legal framework in Germany, social acceptance issues, and the current need for research.
The authors of the paper specified that the substantial difference in costs between agrivoltaics and ground-mounted solar results from higher tracker system costs. Agrivoltaic projects also face more system design constraints as they have to deal with subsoil conditions and are strictly dependent on the chosen type of agricultural use.
Furthermore, agrivoltaic project developers may also incur higher costs during the approval process. These include the identification of the location, soil and environmental reports, development plans, and legal fees of different kinds. Ground preparation, however, may be a factor that increases costs for conventional solar parks, as these require groundworks that are usually avoided in agrivoltaic projects. When these must be implemented, however, costs may be much higher for the latter. For example, cables must be laid at a safe depth of at least one meter in order to ensure trouble-free agricultural activity.
Agrivoltaic plants are commonly built with special modules, bifacial panels or products with a higher degree of transparency, which results, along with the mounting systems, in higher costs. “The costs of the other components, such as cables, inverters and transformer stations, however, do not differ between the two project typologies,” the researchers stated, adding that the costs of the plant grid-connection, the assembly of the components, or the monitoring system are almost the same.
Vertically erected agrivoltaic projects are usually built with bifacial panels with a high degree of bifaciality and a west-east orientation. The additional costs of these panels, however, do not justify the disproportionately higher costs, the authors of the report stated. Yet the required special mounting structures are not produced on a mass scale, which also increase a project's costs, they add. The increase in costs is estimated from €220 to €250/kW for the modules and from €75 to up to €200/kW for the racks.
For agrivoltaic systems installed at a high distance from the ground, which is necessary to let the agricultural machinery operate under the solar panels, the costs are even higher compared to conventional solar plants. The scientists estimated a total cost of €400/kW for the entire plant construction including the foundations. Mounting systems are expected to cost between €130 and €220/kW, while the cost of highly transparent modules may rise to up to €330/kW. Site preparation and component deployment costs between €250 to €350/kW.
Agrivoltaic installations relying on trackers may be much more expensive, as the tracking system may have to be placed at a height of up to six meters. In this regard, the report cites a project in Germany that had a total cost of €850/kW. “The costs for the elevation depend on the desired application and on the height of the structure,” the researchers explained.
For cost estimation, the German group took as a reference project an 850 kW ground-mounted plant with an average total cost of €572/kW and a required investment of €486,200/hectare. The estimated costs for a vertical agrivoltaic project with a capacity of 345.8 kW is €688/kW and the required investment is €237,760/hectare. For an agrivoltaic system with elevated module and a capacity of 650 kW, the total cost was estimated at €1,234/kW and the total investment at €802,100/hectare. 
In another report published by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of agrivoltaic projects with a 20-year term located in Germany was estimated at between €0.07 and €0.12 per kWh for an average value of €0.093 per kWh.

The announcement, which was related to a procurement process launched in January, was made by Belhassen Chiboud, the head of the ministry's energy program.
“Tunisia continues to attract renewable energy investments with 40 applications filed for 1 MW projects and 17 for 10 MW projects,” he said, adding that the prices for the 10 MW projects are between €35/MWh and €37/MWh.
The government did not disclose any other details about the procurement exercise. The final results will be announced at a later date. The selected projects will sell electricity to state-owned utility STEG under long-term power purchase agreements.
By comparison, in Tunisia's third tender, the final bids fell in the €0.0387/kWh range.

Australia’s first publicly available hydrogen refueling station has opened in Canberra.
French renewables giant Neoen developed the project with Australia’s ActewAGL. Neoen’s delivery of the refueling station goes hand in hand with the Australia Capital Territory (ACT) government’s new fleet of 20 Hyundai Nexo hydrogen vehicles. The project is part of a contract with the ACT government for the Hornsdale Wind Farm Stage 3.
The ACT’s minister for energy and emissions reduction, Shane Rattenbury, described the opening as a major milestone in the rollout of zero emissions vehicles. Green hydrogen produced using the ACT’s 100% renewable electricity supply will be available at the station, said Rattenbury. He added that this was made possible by the state’s “innovative” reverse auctions for renewable electricity. 
“There are many benefits with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles like these. They have short refuelling times, can be powered hydrogen made from renewable-energy and they also purify the air as they drive which will help remove harmful particulates produced by petrol and diesel vehicles,” Rattenbury said. “This station will allow fuel cell electric vehicles on our roads alongside battery electric vehicles, forming a strong pathway to zero emissions transport in Canberra.”
Louis de Sambucy, managing director of Neoen Australia, said that the station’s opening paves the way for the delivery of many more hydrogen refueling stations across Australia.
“Renewable hydrogen represents an exciting opportunity for the decarbonisation of transport, gas and industrial sectors in the ACT and beyond as we transition towards a high penetration renewable energy electricity grid,” he said.

A new study by U.S. researchers has shown that India needs to be considerably more ambitious than its renewable-energy target of 450 GW of capacity by 2030.
The report showed that 600 GW of solar and wind capacity could keep Indian power-sector emissions at 2018 levels. The cost of doing so would be comparable to a fossil fuel-dominated grid, while almost doubling electricity supply, the researchers claimed. In carbon-mitigation and customer price terms, the most cost-effective approaches would entail a broad balance of solar and wind power or a power mix concentrated more on the latter, the study also showed.
Researchers from the University of California and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory studied a range of energy demand and cost scenarios, operational strategies, and battery storage investments. They also looked at differing clean- energy mixes, weather patterns, and energy infrastructure networks.
The results of the study, recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicated that renewables would not completely eliminate the need for fossil-fuel generation, but would better position the nation to exploit clean power.
