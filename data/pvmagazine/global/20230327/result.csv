Systovi recently unveiled a new prototype of ultra-lightweight solar modules weigh just 3 kg/m2.
“With the mounting structure, the total weight will be 4 kg/m2,” Matthieu del Rizzo, a Systovi spokesperson, told pv magazine France.
The French PV manufacturer says the panels can only be deploye by approved installers. The prototype measures 1.80 m2 and has 330 W of power output. It features M6 cells, encapsulated in fiberglass.
Systovi says it will begin selling the new panels in 2024. Baptiste Duclos, marketing project manager for the company, said it will switch to M10 cells from 2025.
Systovi opened a new assembly line in March near Nantes, France. It invested €1.5 million ($1.59 million) to double its production capacity from 40 MW to 80 MW. The company says it hopes the investments will help to shift the PV supply chain to France.

Highly selective contacts are the key to achieving high efficiency in thin-film solar cells. These contacts allow one type of carrier (holes) to conduct and block other types (electrons).
Nickel oxide (NiO) is an optimum material for hole-selective contacts and is extensively used in multiple PV technologies. Nickel oxide films with thicknesses in the nanometre range (a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of a single human hair) must be produced for use in advanced-architecture silicon solar cells.
However, the current process of developing nanometric thin nickel oxide membranes through sputtering is highly expensive as the equipment used in its production has to be imported. Precursor components such as nickel acetylacetonate used in the development of these membranes are also extremely expensive. The cost of this technique limits the possibilities of its use. 
Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi (IIT Mandi) have developed a low-cost process to produce ultra-thin films of metal oxides from cheaper starting materials. Specifically, they used an aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition technique to deposit nickel oxide thin film on a silicon substrate.
“Aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition technique can produce high-quality, uniform thin films on various surfaces, including silicon, by delivering a vapor phase precursor in the form of an aerosol,” said researcher Kunal Ghosh, who led the study. “The aerosol enables the deposition of a wide range of oxide-based materials with high precision, making it a versatile and cost-effective method for various applications in materials science and engineering:”
The team used nickel nitrate hexahydrate as the nickel salt and the deposition was performed at 550 C for a time period of 15 minutes to produce nickel oxide films with a thickness of approximately 15 nanometres. They analyzed the morphology and composition of the nickel oxide films produced using various characterization techniques. 
The project is still in the early stages of development. However, the technology has the potential to be adopted by the industry. This research will enhance the fabrication process of advanced architecture silicon photovoltaic devices, reducing the cost and complexity of commercial techniques.
“Our research shows that it is possible to develop a cost-effective and scalable process for the production of metal oxide layers for solar cells,” said Ghosh. “This new method has the potential to revolutionize the solar industry by reducing the cost and complexity of current production techniques. Additionally, as the whole process including the equipment is developed in-house, the generated IP will contribute towards India’s self-reliance in the area of advanced-architecture silicon solar cells.”

Sirea has unveiled a new line of batteries for applications with rooftop PV arrays. The systems have storage capacities ranging from 100 kWh to 1 MWh and can deliver from 20 kW (AC) to 500 kW of output, depending on the model.
The energy company, which is based in the French department of Réunion, says the Programmable Storage Systems (PSS) are calibrated for medium-sized self-consumption projects. They can also be used as tools to optimize electric vehicle charging, network load shedding, or power clipping.
“Our system is particularly suitable for industrial sites, supermarkets or hotels,” said Sirea General Manager Bruno Bouteille.
Sirea says the systems feature thermal regulation devices, fire-detection sensors, and an alarm deferral system. In addition, the so-called “shelter” format allows the systems to be installed outside buildings.
The new products feature control and monitoring systems to regulate temperature variations, control charge/discharge cycles, and the state of the battery.
“Now that the deployment of batteries is becoming more popular, PSS shelters stand out for their ability to manage storage according to customer demand and specifications,” said David Grand, communication manager for Sirea.

What can we expect this year?
It will be different. Last year, around 80% of new PV installs came from the residential market segment. This year, there will be two factors  limiting its growth. First is the switch from net metering to net billing announced last spring, and the second is the government’s decision to freeze electricity prices for consumers who stay within certain levels of electricity consumption. Namely, the government has set up three levels of the energy consumption at 2000 kWh, 2600 kWh and 3000 kWh/year, with the last one reserved for big families, farmers, and senior citizens. Those who do not exceed these limits will stay with energy prices from last year, and the rest will pay the new prices which are 20% to 22% higher. It is expected that not many households will be able to stay within these limits, but nonetheless the very information about frozen prices has already cooled demand.
Meanwhile, we are seeing a growing demand on the commercial and industrial (C&I) side driven by two factors: the electricity prices have not been frozen for them, so they are exposed to market prices that are quite high, and also companies are under pressure to decarbonize under initiatives such RE100. In a nutshell, I hope that the market will maintain the last year’s volumes, but the growth will be driven by the C&I sector rather than the residential one. For example, Poland's leading provider of photovoltaic solutions for business Quanta  presently has over 100 MW of pure C&I PV projects in their pipeline.
You mentioned the transition from net metering to net billing, which initially had a strong negative impact on the market – some companies even reported bankruptcies. Has the market adapted to this change?
Before the switch, people were panic buying. If you look at our residential sales in Poland, 80% of it happened in the January-March period. In April, the market simply vanished. In May, activity started to pick up slowly. But by this point, people have already realized how net billing works, so this is no longer holding them back from installing solar as it did in the first place. In case of Menlo, Poland represents 30% of our revenues so we didn’t feel the pinch since at the time we had strong demand coming from Germany, Baltic states, and southern Europe.
Solar was the main winner in the most recent renewables auctions, but overall uptake was disappointing, as big, unsubsidized PV projects have started to gain market share. What can we expect from the utility-scale PV market in Poland?
This is very difficult to say. Putting aside the local legislation, there are two factors to consider. The significant price drop for solar modules driven by the falling polysilicon prices has created a strong expectation of decreasing price trends, so investors are reluctant to buy now and are waiting for further price declines. Meanwhile, there is a large gap in supply of large-scale inverters. So, market leaders like Sungrow and Huawei still have backlog of orders from last year that will be fulfilled no sooner than September or October this year. These two factors are extending the planning phase for another six to nine months and slowing down utility-scale PV development in Poland.
As a leading distributor in Poland, what does Menlo Electric see in terms of tech preferences among project developers?
Customers are after new technologies that can secure bigger efficiency and yield. In terms of PV modules, for example, around 95% of our JinkoSolar offers are their n-type TOPCon products. The latest TOPCon products stand for higher efficiency (up to 23%), longevity (30 years), and low degradation (only 0,4%/year). What is especially important in markets such as Poland, UK and Scandinavia, which are more shaded than the rest of the Europe, is the better weak light response that such modules are capable of, adding an extra two hours of production a day.
Meanwhile, large-scale inverters with 350 kW power have attracted much attention, but they have not been widely available so we cannot talk a lot about their benefits. Meanwhile, this year FoxESS, Sungrow, and SolarEdge have successfully introduced hybrid inverters together with storage solutions which already represent 60-70% of our inverter sale. We are fully stocked with FoxESS and Sungrow hybrid solutions and can deliver them all across Europe within five working days. However, Polish households are still reluctant to install batteries and are likely waiting for substantial government support. But we are seeing that the C&I and utility-scale projects are planning batteries and are already installing hybrid inverters. We also expect demand for microinverters to accelerate in Poland and we stand ready to cater to it with TSUN products.
Menlo Electric launched its Energy to Power Your Future charity program last year to provide free PV installations for institutions that take care of children in Ukraine. What is happening with this project?
We signed the contract for 10 installations, with a total of 300 kW of power. We are about to commence the first installation on the children’s hospital in Chernigov, in northern Ukraine. We have already secured components for another two installations thanks to the support of our partners Deye and FoxESS. Previously, we delivered free-of-charge installations in Poland, Romania, and soon Bulgaria. Our business partners, such as JinkoSolar and Sungrow, we're all very interested in partnering on such charity initiatives and willing to help.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/27/paper-thin-carbon-fiber-for-battery-with-428-wh-kg-energy-density/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 27, 2023",Paper-thin carbon fiber for battery with 428 Wh/kg energy density,"The integration of lithium metal into lithium-ion batteries, in order to replace the graphite commonly used today as an anode material, will be a major step forward in energy storage technology that could allow for a big jump in battery capacity and performance. But lithium metal is a difficult material to work with, and its tendency to form “dendrite” structures that branch out of the anode and cause short circuits has limited development.
Researchers are pursuing various strategies to overcome the challenge posed by lithium metal, and a group led by Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology and Jeonbuk National University in South Korea has proposed an approach that appears to offer several advantages. The group has worked with carbon fiber paper as a replacement for the copper foil commonly used to form the lithium metal anode structure.
The group prepared carbon fiber with polymer binders and used a 3D framework into which lithium metal was infused. The preparation is described in full in the paper Construction of Hierarchical Surface on Carbon Fiber Paper for Lithium Metal Batteries with Superior Stability, recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
Batteries developed using the carbon fiber/lithium metal anode achieved a high specific energy of 428 Wh/kg.
“Considering the five times lower density and lower cost of carbon fiber compared to copper, our proposed anode material is an important achievement that can accelerate the commercialization of durable and lightweight lithium metal batteries,” said Sung-Ho Lee, head of the Carbon Composite Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology.
The current issue of pv magazine focuses on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
Further testing showed that during cycling, lithium coated the carbon fiber without formation of dendrites thanks to the formation of an inorganic solid electrolyte interphase layer. Full battery cells fabricated using the anodes maintained 85% of their initial capacity after 300 cycles. The group says it plans to continue working on this approach, which could offer a simplified solution to integrating lithium-metal into energy storage.
“We believe that our advanced strategy, which is different to previously reported technologies, such as adding novel and toxic additives in electrolytes and surface morphology modification using complicated methods, will enable the realization of a highly stable LMA with outstanding electrochemical performance for application in the practical energy storage fields to replace conventional LiBs,” the group concluded.

The Germany-based heat pump manufacturer said its heat pump is designed for retrofit installations and new buildings.
“Our new aroTHERM plus in air-to-water heat pump that can also be used in retrofit installations as it can reach high flow temperatures,” Vaillant said on its website. “Even systems with existing radiators, which require flow temperatures of up to 55 C, can be operated efficiently.”
It has a heating capacity between 3.5 kW and 12 kW, measures between 765 mm x 1,100 mm x 450 mm and 1,565 mm x 1,100 mm x 450 mm, and weighs 114 kg, 128 kg, or 210 kg, depending on the variant. The coefficient of performance (COP) varies between 3.9 and 4.6 to heat water to 35 C, with external air down to 2 C, and between 5.3 and 5.7 with external air at 10 C.
The pumps can purportedly produce hot water between 22 C and 75 C. The new devices can be installed indoors or outdoors, but the 190-liter water tank must be installed indoors.
“The acquisition costs are also comparatively low, because the aroTHERM plus is one of the cheaper heat pumps on the market,” according to Valliant.
It said savings can be maximized by pairing the heat pump with rooftop PV. It also noted that the noise level ranges from 54 dB(A) to 59 dB(A) during the day and 46 dB(A) in night mode – roughly equivalent to the sound of a refrigerator.
“If the aroTHERM plus is set up three meters away, the sound pressure level is only 29 dB(A), which corresponds to the ticking of a wristwatch,” said Valliant.
*This article was updated on 29/03/2023 to reflect that while the heat pump was showcased at the ISH tradeshow, it was originally launched in April 2020.

California-based Amprius has verified the performance of its silicon anode battery cells with third-party tester Mobile Power Solutions. The results show that the cell model provides 504 Wh per kg and 1321 Wh per L at 25 C.
Amprius said the silicon anode cell is roughly half the weight and volume of leading conventional commercially available lithium-ion cells. The cells have applications in the rapidly growing electric aviation space and could be integrated with electric vehicles. Together, electric aviation and light-duty EV battery demand is estimated to exceed $100 billion throughout the world by 2025, said the company.
The Amprius cells offer a run time of 200% compared to leading graphite battery cells. However, they are lighter and smaller than other batteries with the same energy content.
“This latest validation continues Amprius’ track record of producing the world’s most powerful battery cells and sets an industry benchmark for next-generation battery technology that will ultimately revolutionize how high we fly, how far we travel and how long we can use our devices,” said Jon Bornstein, president of Amprius Labs.
Customers can adjust specifications on the battery cell platform to meet a project’s engineering needs. The customizable platform allows customers to select the option to either increase energy content in a battery pack without increasing weight, reduce weight in applications that target a fixed energy content, or a combinations of the two. Higher energy is important for longer run times, range and endurance, while lighter packs increase energy efficiency.
The battery cells are planned to be integrated with the AALTO Zephyr, a high-altitude platform station (HAPS). The solar-electric telecommunications aircraft offers persistent earth observation with 18cm ground sampling distance, near-real-time video and imagery from the stratosphere, day and night.
“We look forward to taking advantage of Amprius’ 500 Wh/kg cell to further develop Zephyr’s unrivalled stratospheric endurance capabilities,” said Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technical officer at AALTO HAPS, an Airbus subsidiary. “Amprius is a valued current supplier with a great track-record, and we are confident that its battery will deliver the capability we need.”
Amprius operates a research and development laboratory in Fremont, California. It recently signed a letter of intent for a 774,000 square foot facility in Brighton, Colorado that would provide up to 5 GWh of manufacturing capacity.
The US Department of Energy (DoE) targets improvements in battery performance to stabilize the critical materials supply chain and offer attractive products to vehicle buyers. “While a number of electric drive vehicles are available on the market, further improvements in batteries could make them more affordable and convenient to consumers,” according to the DoE.
The DoE funds advanced battery development, systems analysis, and testing in pursuit of these goals. Read more about DoE’s involvement with batteries here.
