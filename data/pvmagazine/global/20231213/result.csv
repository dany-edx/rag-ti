German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (Social Democratic Party), Minister of Economics Robert Habeck (Greens), and Finance Minister Christian Lindner (Free Democratic Party) have announced that cuts to solar spending could solve a €60 billion budget crisis that left politicians scrambling in November.
The German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) has nullified the Bundestag's unconstitutional supplementary 2021 budget, which attempted to shuffle €60 billion of pandemic-era funding into the climate protection portfolio. Germany has strict debt brake rules, meaning the public deficit cannot exceed 0.35% of gross domestic product.
The faction leaders have issued a joint statement stating that they are satisfied with the compromise that would make up for the shortfall. Savings could be achieved through reducing spending in transport, environment and labor ministries, they said. Most notable, however, are cuts to renewable industries.
There will be an earlier phase-out of the environmental premium for electric cars and slashed solar subsidies.
All national climate and industrial transformation funds (KTF) projects will continue, such as establishing a hydrogen network and decarbonizing industry and the citizens' programs. Surcharges for the renewable energy sources legislation (EEG) will continue to be scrapped, and support for homeowners replacing heating systems will also be maintained, they said.
BSW-Solar has criticized the announcement, saying that the construction of new PV factories in Germany would be affected. According to government statements, however, no cuts are planned for solar subsidies via the EEG legislation.
BSW-Solar said the savings would affect the expression of interest procedures for lighthouse projects designed to ramp up industrial PV production capacities, estimated to cost around €1.3 billion of federal funding.
BSW-Solar Managing Director Carsten Körnig it would be a major setback for Europe's solar industry's renaissance if this money is affected. He also said that it was important that the ‘Solar Package I' and its measures – aimed at reducing bureaucracy – should be implemented at the beginning of next year unhindered. But, if any subsidy program cuts could impact the planned expansion of solar factories as part of the package, they should be announced soon, said Körnig.
In November, the association presented a proposal for the introduction of resilience bonuses and auctions in “Solar Package 1”.
The final decision on whether resilience bonuses and auctions will be included is planned for the end of this week. The “Solar Package 1” will be on the Bundestag's agenda. According to the current status, the discussion and final vote on the EEG amendment is scheduled to begin at 1.40 pm on the last sitting day of the year. But it's possible that just a small part of the measures will be decided.

According to the draft legislation, rooftop solar would be linked to the national grid for self-use, but the energy cannot be sold to other organizations, individuals or back to the grid.
Moritz Stitcher, a Southeast Asia solar analyst for renewable energy advisory firm Apricum, told pv magazine that although there would be a negligible impact on independent power producers managing commercial and industrial projects, “it sends another rather negative signal on solar development in the country.”
“It seems MOIT is still aiming to regulate the rooftop segment even further,” he said.
Stitcher said the zero-export mechanism is common in other Southeast Asian countries – such as Thailand and the Philippines – but if the regulatory framework was rolled out in Vietnam it would, “take away the beauty of the use of excess energy, which is unfortunate.”
Agencies and organizations can offer their feedback until Dec. 26, 2023.
MOIT first flagged it would propose rooftop solar amendments in August, with the change aiming to promote the development of rooftop solar self-consumption, according to local media reports.
In May the Vietnamese government announced it would pump $135 billion to develop an energy strategy, which aims to equip half the country’s residential rooftops with PV schemes under a net-metering scheme, and make Vietnam a net exporter by the end of the decade, among the strategy’s key pillars.
Vietnam recorded 18 GW of solar installed capacity at the end of last year, according to the most up-to-date data provided by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/13/solars-success-story-could-soon-be-over-says-solarpower-europe/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE",ANGELA SKUJINS,"DECEMBER 13, 2023","Solar’s ‘success story’ could soon be over, says SolarPower Europe","Solar has been installed at “record-breaking” speed in the European Union for the third year in a row, said SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger ahead of a recently published report.
According to the report, member states installed a combined total of 56 GW in the last 12 months – consistent with three years of 40% year-on-year gains. Germany took the top spot by installing 14.1 GW, followed by Spain with 8.2 GW, Italy with 4.8 GW, Poland with 4.6 GW and the Netherlands with 4.1 GW.
But this “success story” could soon be over, SolarPower Europe cautions, with the last three years of “extremely fast growth” expected to slow as energy prices dip to pre-crisis levels and the PV development landscape becoming increasingly “aggravated” by an “inflationary environment” plagued with high-interest rates. The association forecasts next year's growth to only be 11%.
Residential demand for rooftop solar has also slowed, with a one-year minimum wait for utility-scale legislative instruments to take effect, said SolarPower Europe.
“Despite impressive achievements until now, solar is reaching a critical juncture at which the further growth path for the lowest cost, most versatile, and most simply deployable power technology will be decided on,” according to the report.
SolarPower Europe Policy Director Dries Acke said it is “fortunate” that extreme energy prices are not driving solar’s achievements but this means governments should pick up the slack.
“We cannot accept grid connection times of more than 4 years, we cannot allow slow local progress on permitting, we cannot risk trade barriers slowing deployment, nor miss the chance to re-shore European solar manufacturing,” he said. “That does mean; however, the onus is back on policymakers to ensure good investment conditions for solar.”
According to the report, the European Union's total installed is currently 263 GW – a 27% increase from last year – with 2025 installation figures forecasted to be 73.8 GW followed by 84.2 GW in 2026 and 93.1 GW in 2027.
The association recommends policy amendments to support solar expansion in Europe. This includes the European Central Bank lowering the cost of capital for “green investments,” improving grid flexibility, nurturing the workforce, improving permitting processes, and scaling up sustainable, “diversified” solar supply chains.
SolarPower Europe said that trade defense “instruments” are not part of the solution as investigating and implementing trade barriers on solar is a “lose-lose strategy for Europe.”
SolarPower Europe and another major player in the solar debate, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), have recently been at loggerheads over whether the European Union should limit products from entering the region made from alleged forced labor.
SolarPower Europe said in the report that it “looks forward” to the first European Commission's environmental rules for solar taking effect, as well as the upcoming Forced Labour Ban Act and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. These initiatives will help the supply chain become “more sustainable, transparent and free of any links to forced labor,” it said.
The association also said it had called on EU decision-makers to recognize its Solar Stewardship Initiative (SSI) in legislation to ensure “transparency” across the global solar value chain.

The survey, conducted by Dutch consultancy Generation.Energy, presents data for all municipalities and regions in which there is available space.
The tool features a data viewer highlighting obstacles on specific rooftops, including asbestos, diverse roof shapes, skylights, grid congestion risks, connection issues, and existing PV systems.
“This survey shows that approximately 8% of potentially suitable roofs can already be used for solar panels,” the RVO said in a statement, adding that it will regularly update the database in 2024.
The Netherlands could reach between 100 GW and 180 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a new report by Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national-regional electricity and gas network operators.
The country reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 16.5 GW at the end of June 2022, according to the most recent statistics from CBS, the nation’s statistics agency. It said the country installed 3,803 MW in 2021 and 3,882 MW in 2022.

The grant marks the first step toward financing the production plant. Enerpoly will raise additional private capital through a Series A funding round, which will come on top of $13.8 million the company has raised to date.
“Enerpoly’s current production line is 100 kWh a year,” Enerpoly CEO Eloisa de Castro told pv magazine. “We plan to have the factory up and running in 2026 and aim to have the production scaled to 100 MWh a year by the end of that same year.”
Enerpoly’s goal is to demonstrate that zinc-ion batteries can be “affordably and profitably mass-produced at scale, with attractive returns for investors.”
The project roadmap for the grant includes developing automated manufacturing systems to streamline processes, improving energy efficiency in cell production, and ensuring optimal productivity and safety at the plant, according to the company. Enerpoly will also work to build a sustainable European value chain, strengthen intellectual property protection, and further expand its workforce in Sweden.
Enerpoly has developed its zinc-ion battery technology from abundant materials. Specifically, it uses zinc metal as the anode and manganese dioxide as the cathode, with a water-based electrolyte. Its proprietary battery cells are built with a prismatic form factor.
Enerpoly’s batteries are best suited for medium to long duration applications for stationary energy storage with two- to 10-hour discharge durations.
The modular battery technology is said to be non-flammable and non-explosive properties and therefore well-suited for use in challenging applications, such as critical infrastructure and densely populated urban areas. Enerpoly batteries have been tested against the UL 9540A standard.
Its 3 kWh battery packs weigh 60 kilograms and measure 800 mm x 177 mm x 432 mm. They operate in the temperature range of -10 C to 50 C. The nominal voltage stands at 48 V, with a nominal capacity of 60 Ah. The battery packs have a maximum charge/discharge power of 2.8 kW, with 1.4 kW of continuous power.
In February, Enerpoly announced plans to develop prototypes of a residential plug-in storage system with rechargeable zinc batteries in Europe, under an EU-funded collaborative project with Austrian startup EET.
Under the “ZincMate” project, the partners will produce prototypes of a plug-in storage system with rechargeable zinc batteries. The technical basis for ZincMate is EET's on-grid technology, in combination with Enerpoly's cost-effective batteries.
EET makes photovoltaic systems with energy storage that can be set up on a balcony and plugged into a wall outlet. Founded in 2017, EET is said to be the only company producing storage devices that can be installed by amateurs, without the help of technicians.
EET’s innovation core for the SolMate device is an integrated and patented measurement technology that can assess the energy demand of a household via a power outlet connection. This eliminates the need for further installation or connection to a household’s electric grid.
“Currently, EET’s SolMate device is equipped with a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery and it’s obvious that battery technology needs to improve,” EET CEO Christoph Grimmer said earlier this year. “Moving to zinc-ion technology for residential applications is the next step in the right direction.”

Residential solar posted modest growth in installations in the United States through the first three quarters of 2023, rising 24% year over year, according to Wood Mackenzie’s latest market insight report. 
Residential solar grew as the supply chain constraints of 2022 improved and Californians rushed to secure solar under a more lucrative rate structure before it transitioned to NEM 3.0 in April. 
However, Wood Mackenzie said the market should temper its expectations for 2024, as high interest rates persist, lowering residential solar demand. It said it expects the California NEM 2.0 backlog of orders to continue into early 2024, temporarily buoying installations figures before they take a dive.
In the third quarter of 2023, residential solar developers installed 1.8 GW, up 12% year over year and setting a new quarterly record for the nation. However, Arizona, Florida, and Texas – all major residential solar markets – experienced quarterly and annual declines in installed capacity in the third quarter.
Installers are meeting these challenges by focusing on operational efficiencies and experimenting with pricing and product offerings to survive the slowdown. 
While high interest rates and policy changes like those seen in California are pushing down the 2024 outlook for residential solar, Wood Mackenzie said there are some tailwinds at play. 
“While high interest rates persist, the segment has some tailwinds, such as module oversupply resulting in lower pricing,” it said. “Coupled with increasing retail rates, installers can still provide customers with a compelling value proposition in some states. With third-party ownership (TPO) products less sensitive to interest rate increases than loans, installers also continue to report an increase in TPO installations.” 
Wood Mackenzie forecasts 13% growth in the residential solar market in 2023. However, looking ahead to 2024, the firm expects a 12% national contraction.  
“The residential solar market will recover in 2025 and grow at an average annual rate of 10% between 2025-2028 as growth picks up in emerging markets,” it said. 
As the residential solar-plus-storage market grows, competition is increasing among battery vendors. Wood Mackenzie said that in the third quarter of 2023, 11% of residential solar and 5% of non-residential solar systems were paired with storage. 
According to Wood Mackenzie, Tesla, LG and Enphase remain the big three battery vendors, holding 80% of the cumulative market from 2018 through the third quarter of 2023. However, new entrants are beginning to leave their mark on market share. In 2018, the big three providers were installed on 96% of solar-plus-storage systems, but in 2023 they represented 65%. 

Energy equipment companies like SunPower, Generac, and SolarEdge have carved out spots among the top seven providers. FranklinWH ranks eighth in storage only two years after launching its first product for the sector. 
“The top five players in the residential solar-plus-storage ranking hold 59% of the market, while the top five players in the residential solar market hold just 24%,” said Max Issokson, research analyst for Wood Mackenzie.

It said the new product offers up to 45% more capacity and a 40% decrease in commissioning time compared to the previous 2.0 iteration.
The 20-foot containerized battery system offers up to 2.35 MW of power and a capacity of 5 MWh. It features higher density energy cells, advanced safety systems, liquid cooling, and active balance controls.
SolBank 3.0 features lithium-ferro-phosphate cells and sports a 93% round-trip efficiency. It is offered in two-hour and four-hour duration configurations. The battery pack is IP-67 rated for safety.
The battery comes equipped with a pack and electrical redundancy protection system, abnormal performance detection, multi-level fire alarms, suppression protection, and more as part of its safety and controls system. An optimized thermal management system reduces auxiliary power consumption by up to 30% compared to the previous generation, said Canadian Solar.
“SolBank 3.0 features exceptional new elements like higher energy density cells and advanced safety design,” said Colin Parkin, president of e-Storage. “In addition, our e-STORAGE team also provides value-added services, such as system capacity maintenance and augmentations, operation and maintenance, and plant optimization.”
In November, Canadian Solar reported $1.85 billion of revenue for the third quarter.  Solar module shipments fell short of expectations at 8.3 GW. However, the company’s module shipments have increased 39% on a year-on-year basis.
Canadian Solar expects module demand to rise sharply in 2024, with shipments increasing roughly 50% year on year. But Roth Capital Partners said that this may be a bit optimistic as the company looks to clear excess inventory channels in Europe. It expects module demand to increase by only 10% to 15% in 2024, driven mostly by utility-scale demand, while residential solar demand could fall in 2024.

“Our heat pump utilizes the phase change of a proprietary fluid to transfer heat,” the company's CEO, Lorenzo Rossi, told pv magazine. “The prototype is currently undergoing testing in Worksport's climate chamber in Toronto.”
The company conducted tests at its facility in Ontario to monitor the system performance across a range of 12 temperature points from -10 C to -35 C. It also tested refrigerant pressure zones, airflow, and the energy consumption of all heat pump components. Furthermore, it said conventional heat pumps on the market are not efficient at providing sufficient comfort levels at temperatures under -20 C.
“Our heat pump’s goal is to provide heat to homes in as low as -35 C, which we believe will make us the most effective heat pump technology in the market,” Rossi added.
The heat pump showed a coefficient of performance (COP) of around 1.8 and a seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) of approximately 3.0. “It's essential to note that these values are influenced by our local climate conditions and might differ in other regions”, Rossi explained.
The prototype is currently using R32 refrigerant, which has a global warming potential (GWP) of 675, which the company said aligns with the new mandate for 2024 requiring refrigerants to have a GWP of 750 or less in Canada.
The company also said the heat pump system doesn't utilize expensive electric resistance heating.
“The price of the Terravis Energy heat pump is expected to align with current market offerings, though it might be slightly higher, in the range of $1,000 to $2,000,” Rossi stressed. “This increase can be attributed to the advanced technology and AI software embedded in the motherboard, as well as the inclusion of new hardware components, which contribute to its advanced features and capabilities.

The phenomenon that occurs when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow is known as a “compound energy drought,” and researchers at PNNL studied these droughts and found that in some parts of the country, they can last nearly a week.
“When we have a completely decarbonized grid and depend heavily on solar and wind, energy droughts could have huge amounts of impact on the grid,” said Cameron Bracken, a scientist at PNNL.
It’s important for grid operators to know where, when and for how long energy droughts occur so that they can call on other energy sources as well as manage grid-level battery systems to store enough electricity needed during times when energy is needed most.
The team recently published the findings in Renewable Energy and will present them at this week’s annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. The researchers report that the paper is the first to provide a uniform standard of what a compound energy drought is and how long it can last in different parts of the country.
The researchers researched 40 years of weather data and then used historical energy demand data for the entire country in order to understand how often an energy drought occurs when that energy is needed the most. The weather data included wind speeds at the height of wind turbines as well as the intensity of solar energy on solar panels. The team focused on areas where there’s currently a lot of solar and wind generation and looked at the times when the weather data showed stagnant air and cloudy skies that resulted in lower energy generation.
“We essentially took a snapshot of the infrastructure as of 2020 and ran it through the 40 years of weather data, starting in 1980,” said Bracken. “We are basically saying ‘here is how the current infrastructure would have performed under historical weather conditions.’”
The researchers found that energy droughts happen at any time of year in various regions, and for varying frequency and duration. In some areas, Texas, for example, energy droughts are frequent but last only hours. While in other areas, such as in California, they may be of a longer duration but are less frequent. Researchers noted that the longest energy drought happened in California and lasted for six days. Understanding the duration and frequency will help predict the drought’s impact on the grid.

In the study “How do heat demand and energy consumption change when households transition from gas boilers to heat pumps in the UK,” published in Energy & Buildings, the research group explained that heat demand should increase due to the change in heating patterns households experience after replacing their heating system, as they are typically recommended to maintain a constant setback temperature of 2-5 C less than the desired temperature.
“Households are often advised to increase the setback temperature to reduce the need for a rapid warm-up at the start of each heating period,” the scientists noted. “Home Energy Scotland suggests a setback temperature 5 C lower than the household's preferred daytime indoor temperature. This would be 16 C for a preferred daytime indoor temperature of 21 C. Most other sources recommend only 2-3 C lower.”
The scientists believe that with the transition to heat pumps UK households may still suffer from high heat losses, due to the lack of good insulation, which would in turn may raise energy demand by 20%. For houses with better walls, practicing a twice-a-day heat pattern, a 15% increase is recorded; while houses that only heat the home once a day will experience a 5% increase in heat demand after switching to heat pumps.
“A problem is that electricity from the grid costs 32 euro cents ($0.35) per kWh, whereas gas costs about 9 euro cents per kWh, so it's not guaranteed that the expense of installing a heat pump will pay for itself,” research co-author, Ray Galvin, told pv magazine. “Another step is to add rooftop photovoltaics, which reduces the energy coming into the building even more, and provides more or less free electricity for the times when the sun is shining and the heat pump is pumping.”
The researchers also explained that a change in heating patterns is crucial for the advice of a household in terms of energy costs. “The most usual practice in the UK is to base the estimate on existing bills or the heating requirement stated on the dwelling Energy Performance Certificate,” they stressed. “In either case this heat demand is for the heating pattern with the old heating system, leading to an underestimate of the electricity demand for the heat pump.”
The scientists believe, by contrast, that the increment in heating demand can be accurately predicted based on heating hours, local climate, heat loss and thermal mass. They also recommended including heat loss and thermal mass parameters in buildings' energy performance certificates, so households can make more informed decisions before changing their system.
“Unfortunately this information is not available at the point when a householder asks an installer for a quote,” they added. “The householder is often asked to accept a quote based on an unrealistic prediction of their bills rather than an actual survey.”
In conducting this research, the scientist used 12 archetypes of homes prevalent across the UK and assumed them to run on gas boilers across the cities of Aberdeen, Finningley and Gatwick. They then measured their heat needs under different setback heating patterns, and finally transformed the consumption change to electricity usage of an air source heat pump would need.
“My usual definition of ‘heat pump ready’ is a heat pump that does not cost more, or at least not much more, than I pay now for my heating,’” co-author, Nicola Terry, told pv magazine. “This of course depends a great deal on the relative cost of gas and electricity, but also on the heat loss of your house and your radiator sizes.”

Solarge focuses on developing lightweight products suitable for installation on rooftops with limited load-bearing capacity, eliminating the need for extensive roof reinforcement. It claims strong and light polymers result in a module weight per square meter of 5.5 kg. Instead of glass, it uses a novel polymer material developed in collaboration with petrochemical manufacturer Sabic.
Project partner Soltronergy, a Dutch installer, deployed the modules on mounting systems from Utrecht-based Sunbeam BV. The modules are installed back-to-back with ballasts and have both East-West and North-South orientation.
“Because the building is brand new the customer preferred a ballast solution. If we had used roof anchors, we could have realized the project at 7 kg/m2,” Solarge CEO, Jan Vesseur, told pv magazine.
The modules belong to the company’s Solo line, which ranges in size from 480 W to 490 W. They are made with PERC cells, Staubli connectors, and weigh in at just 5.5 kg/m2 without ballast.
Earlier installations this year include an Alcochem rooftop system with 72 solar panels installed by Solarge partner Youen, and a 120-panel rooftop installation at Fruitbedrijf De Groen, a Dutch fruit grower, which was installed by Megaproject.
“Our biggest project to date is coming up at Sabic’s plant in Genk, Belgium with 5,000 modules for 2.3 MW capacity,” said Vesseur.
Solarge’s products are available through distributors and directly. “Our scope is worldwide, we have already shipped panels to New Zealand,” said Vesseur.
Solarge inaugurated its first large-scale production line for lightweight solar panels with a low carbon footprint in May. Situated in Weert, the Netherlands, the facility can manufacture 200,000 panels per year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/13/novel-mathematical-model-to-assess-wind-stability-of-solar-trackers/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,SPAIN,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"DECEMBER 13, 2023",Novel mathematical model to assess wind stability of solar trackers,"Researchers at the Technical University of Madrid in Spain have introduced a novel way to calculate the effective damping coefficient of single-axis solar trackers. In aerodynamics, damping is the force that opposes the motion of a vibrating or oscillating system, and its effective coefficient is a parameter regarding its stability.
With the proposed approach, developers can estimate the critical speed a tracker can withstand.
“We do not rule out extending our research to two-axis tracking systems,” corresponding author Juan A. Cárdenas-Rondón told pv magazine. “The main challenges to be addressed include dealing with two degrees of freedom in torsion as well as three-dimensional aerodynamic phenomena.”
The researchers are planning to increase the number of tested cases to develop a mathematical model.
In the study “Stability analysis of two-dimensional flat solar trackers using aerodynamic derivatives at different heights above ground,” published in the Journal of Wind Engineering & Industrial Aerodynamics, the research group attempted to create as general as possible a methodology to determine the stability curve of a PV tracker.
The mathematical model they developed is dependent on several parameters, such as the chord length of the solar tracker's supporting structure, the height of the solar tracker axis, and the angle of the air's attack on the rotating PV.
Moreover, the model requires using two derivatives – one related to aerodynamic damping and the other to stiffness. While damping relates to the force that opposes the motion, stiffness refers to the system's resistance of an object to deformation. Those derivatives were obtained with a series of lab tests with different angles of attack and standard axis height (H) to chord (B) ratios.
“The values that have been tested are H/B = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 1, and 2,” the academics stated. “For each of the height-to-width values, the nominal angle of attack has been varied. The angles tested are 0◦, ±5◦, ±10◦, ±20◦, ±30◦, ±40◦. The tests were limited to angles within the range of ±40◦ because, for lower H/B ratios, the model could not be tested at higher absolute nominal angles as it would collide with the ground.”
After finding both derivatives for all of these different conditions, the scientists were able to calculate the effective damping coefficient of solar trackers as a function of the incident wind speed. They then conducted a series of tests on an additional experimental setup to validate their mathematical model.
“The results obtained with the model exhibit a good agreement with the results obtained in the validation tests performed in the auxiliary experimental setup for the case of large angles of attack,” they stated. “Conversely, for small angles of attack, it can be noted that the value of the maximum critical reduced speed has been accurately determined, but both results do not align regarding the angle of attack at which it is achieved.”
The team also found that, as for the oscillation frequency, the model forecasts the experimental results for low reduced speeds. “But as the system approaches unstable conditions, the predictions become overestimated,” it concluded.
