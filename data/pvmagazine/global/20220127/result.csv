Tesla’s fourth quarter earnings call for 2022 referenced solar power in passing, and only touched on the subject of energy storage. And though it was reiterated that energy storage has terawatt potential, expectations for 2022 growth have been muted due to continued chip challenges. Additionally, Musk made it clear that energy storage deployment took a backseat to deliveries of their much higher margin electric vehicle products in 2021.
The company’s slide deck stated that the Solar Roof product tripled in volume deployed; however, the company has yet to deliver any actual values associated with the product.
Both Tesla’s solar power and energy storage booked sales grew for the whole of the year versus 2020 — solar grew 68% and energy storage grew 32%. However, when comparing quarter sales, the numbers were a bit disappointing, with 4th quarter rates for the two products ranging between a decrease of 34% and growth of 2.4%.

In Summary
For the quarter, Tesla installed 85MW of solar power. For the year, it totaled 345MW; a significant increase from 2020, more than double the trough of 2019. The volume is still far from the peak value of 870MW deployed in 2015, with almost 250MW in Q4’15.
Energy storage deployment was just shy of 4GWh, showing a year over year increase of 32% over 2020’s 3.0GWh. Tesla’s growth was far behind the broader stationary energy storage’s market’s expansion projected to be triple digits.
Roughly speaking, the car company manufactured around 80GWh of energy storage cells, and only 5% of them went to energy storage.
This year’s 4TWh was first projected for 2019, when hundreds of percent growth was projected in prior Tesla earnings calls.

“We did short-change the energy business last year, in that vehicles took priority over storage, we do see a terawatt hour per year energy business,” said Musk, who has uttered similar variations on this theme in several prior earnings calls.
Regarding market potential, NREL does think the USA alone might need 6 TWh of energy storage to shift the power grid to “Zero Carbon”.
Considering quarterly growth numbers, Q4’21 was a disappointing quarter. Solar power grew only 2.4% – that’s 2MW – versus the prior quarter. And it was down by 1MW compared to the prior year. Energy storage was actually down significantly on the quarter – compared to both Q3’21 and Q4’20.

The energy storage department lost money both in the quarter, and year over year.
Total revenue for the year was $2.789 billion, while the cost of said revenue was $2.918 billion — a loss of $129 million. The energy department’s revenues were not discussed in the quarterly call.
Tesla earned $688 million in revenue for the quarter, spending $739 million. This was down from the 3rd quarter’s $806 million in revenue, as well 2020’s Q4 revenue of $752 million.

Over the last five quarters, Tesla has mostly lost money on its energy department.
As in many prior earnings calls, Musk said he believed energy storage will catch up, and eventually grow faster than vehicles.
Looking at 2022, Musk said the batteries will probably not be the limiting factor when building vehicles. Instead, the challenge will be in manufacturing chips. Silicon carbide inverters were noted as the critical, specific component of EVs, which are currently challenging to acquire.
Unfortunately, it was suggested that chip issues will also affect energy storage deployment. Accordingly, growth in deployment volumes will also be muted, at least for the short term.
Musk posited a potential growth rate of 50% for energy storage deployment, and joined another company representative in suggesting that several hundred percent growth is still possible — though less likely.
After the chip limitation is projected to be alleviated next year, it was predicted that then a battery cell limitation might arise.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/27/industry-heavyweights-look-to-solid-state-battery-cells-resources-and-recycling/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,SUSTAINABILITY,GERMANY,JAPAN,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 27, 2022","Industry heavyweights look to solid-state battery cells, resources, and recycling","In light of its ambition to go all electric by 2030, German luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz continues to expand its network of tech partners, this time through a collaboration with Taiwanese solid-state battery specialist ProLogium.
The first Mercedes-Benz test vehicles equipped with solid-state batteries co-developed with ProLogium are expected to be introduced in the coming years. The companies have agreed on milestones to enable the integration of solid-state battery technology into a range of passenger vehicles in the second half of this decade.
“We believe that range and efficiency are the new industry benchmarks for electric cars,” said Daimler head of development Markus Schäfer. “Solid state technology helps to cut down battery size and weight. This is why we are partnering with companies like ProLogium to ensure that Mercedes-Benz continues to break new ground in the automotive sector for the benefit of our customers.”
Under the agreement, Mercedes will take a seat on the ProLogium board. The high double-digit million euro investment by the carmaker will be used to support the development of the technology and ProLogium's plan of establishing production capacity in Europe. The Taiwanese battery maker focuses on the development of next-generation batteries including solid-state devices with silicon and lithium metal anodes and bipolar technology.
“We have been working with Mercedes-Benz on the testing of our EV [electric vehicle] battery cells since 2016 and are excited to strengthen and expand our partnership,” said ProLogium CEO and founder Vincent Yang. “At ProLogium, we believe that innovative technology must be backed by the scalability of production. We look forward to ramping up our new plant by the end of 2022 and working with our customers toward successful mass production.”
Thus far, the development of solid-state batteries has been primarily driven by automotive companies. Mercedes has partnered with Canadian battery material specialist Hydro-Québec to integrate the technology into field applications and cut development cycle times and other legacy automakers have invested heavily in solid-state devices, including Toyota and Volkswagen.
Offering potentially higher energy density, more cycles at a reduced rate of degradation, and less weight, solid-state battery cells are described as one of the key levers for determining the cost, scalability, and energy density of EV batteries. A solid-state electrolyte offers the option of using materials with high storage capacity, high-ionic conductivity, and better chemical stability; replacing the flammable electrolytes used in conventional lithium-ion batteries.
The innovative materials and design of solid-state batteries could almost double the range of today’s conventional li-ion battery cells and could be far cheaper as they do not require cobalt. However, the technology remains relatively unproven, with auto manufacturers hoping their battery partners will give them an edge and help bring forward commercial production.
Elsewhere, Toyota and Panasonic have started research with the University of Tokyo into battery resources and recycling. In addition to closing the loop and realizing carbon neutrality, the aim of the project is to reduce production costs in the battery supply chain.
Four project partners: the Institute of Industrial Science at The University of Tokyo; the Prime Planet Energy & Solutions Inc joint venture set up by Toyota and Pansonic; Panasonic's Energy Company unit; and Toyota trading arm the Toyota Tsusho Corporation, will look at two aspects of the battery economy. They will focus on the development of new processes in an integrated manner, ranging from the development of nickel, lithium, and cobalt metal resources to refining them during the development and manufacture of battery materials. The research will also consider the development of new processes for the recycling of battery waste and used batteries.
With the aim of further improving the recycling rate of batteries, the research project will promote the development of technology for the efficient and waste-free recycling of leftover materials from battery manufacturing and used devices. Combining the knowhow of the partners – manufacturing experience; commercial collection, processing and recycling of materials; and university research into rare metal refining technology – the project aims to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and recycling costs, which are currently a big issue.
“We will not only supply battery materials but also contribute to the reduction of environmental impact and the formation of a recycling-oriented society by promoting recycling, making use of our knowledge in the recycling-oriented venous business,” said Masaharu Katayama, chief operating officer for Toyota’s Metals Business Unit.
Following its historic listing on the Korean Stock Exchange, LG Energy Solution unveiled its expansion plans yesterday, with a commitment to construct a $2.1 billion battery manufacturing plant in the U.S. with General Motors. The facility will begin mass production in early 2025 and will produce 50GWh of EV batteries annually once fully operational.
The factory will be located in Lansing, Michigan and will produce batteries under the Ultium brand developed by a joint venture between General Motors and LG Chem. Ultium devices are said to be unique because their large-format, pouch-style cells can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside a battery pack, enabling engineers to optimize energy storage and layout for each vehicle design.
LG and General Motors are building two other battery cell manufacturing sites – one in Ohio and another in Tennessee – both of which will be capable of producing 35GWh of battery cells. “With a shared vision, GM and LG Energy Solution pioneered the EV sector by seizing new opportunities in the market well before anyone else did,” LG Energy Solution chief executive Young-Soo Kwon said. “Our third battery manufacturing plant, fittingly located in America’s automotive heartland, will serve as a gateway to charge thousands, and later, millions of EVs in the future.”
LG Energy Solution shares were sold at an IPO price of KRW300,000 ($250) this month in Asia's second largest float, behind only the $12.9 billion initial public offering for the Alibaba Group in 2019. On its trading debut today, LG Solution's shares surged 68%, solidifying the battery maker's rank as South Korea's second-most valued company.

Akuo Energy, Amarenco, BayWa re, EDF Renouvelables, Enel Green Power, Engie, Iberdrola and Vattenfall Solar, brought together by SolarPower Europe, wrote, on January 26, to the European Commission asking for a European strategy aimed at strengthening the photovoltaic supply chain.
In their letter, the eight companies said that Europe will have to install 870GW of solar power by 2030 to be on the path to climate neutrality and added they are ready to deploy photovoltaic energy at a faster rate.
“We must commit to developing a European strategy for the solar photovoltaic value chain which will be approved by the competitiveness council in 2022,” wrote the signatories. “This is necessary to achieve the European Green Deal targets set by the European Commission.”
Pragmatic and progressive, such a strategy should include a comprehensive set of measures ensuring a level playing field for European industry, in line with the EU's approach to strategic autonomy.
Major EU partners such as India and the United States have already identified the solar PV industry as strategic and are reinvesting in this sector as strategic, and reinvesting in domestic manufacturing. Europe has many assets on which it can count: an industrial ecosystem and historical knowhow; a technological lead on the cells of the future, thanks to a dynamic research and innovation community; and a vibrant research and innovation community.
According to the eight signatories, if the measures are taken in time, a production capacity of 20GW can be redeveloped in Europe before 2030.
The industrial interest is there, and already, 2GW of cell manufacturing capacity has been redeveloped in Europe, financed mainly by the private sector.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/27/singapore-sovereign-wealth-fund-backs-australian-green-hydrogen-developer/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SAUDI ARABIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Singapore sovereign wealth fund backs Australian green hydrogen developer,"Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, has estimated fund assets of US$744 billion and has just become a strategic investor in future fuels company InterContinental Energy (ICE), the business behind two proposed green hydrogen projects in Western Australia, the US$37 billion, 26GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub, and the US$70 billion, 50GW Western Green Energy Hub.
ICE is also looking to develop green hydrogen production projects in Oman and Saudi Arabia, locations which, like Western Australia, feature coastal deserts abundant in solar and wind resources plus easy access to seaborne distribution. 
GIC's chief investment officer of infrastructure, Ang Eng Seng, said: “This is a strategic investment to position GIC early for the emerging hydrogen economy. We believe that, in time, hydrogen will play a crucial role in decarbonization globally and that InterContinental Energy will be a key player in this transformation.”
Last year, ICE chief strategy officer Sacha Thacker told pv magazine that when it comes to green hydrogen and ammonia there is no shortage of demand, with key sectors including marine fuels, co-fired power generation, industrial processes and heavy transport. 
“Often when you have these types of transitions there is a lead country that takes up all the supply and other nations sort of hold back,” said Thacker, “but that is not what is happening this time. Everyone has agreed something needs to be done. So, there is a lot of demand and not that many choices, and even fewer choices that can be produced at scale.” 
ICE's portfolio boasts 200GW of upstream onshore wind and solar said to be capable of producing 14 million tons of green hydrogen annually, or 80 million tons of green ammonia.
ICE chief executive Alexander Tancock said the investment by GIC is exciting because the fund shares “the same long-term commitment to global decarbonization.” 
Valery Tubbax, ICE's chief financial officer, said the investment by GIC “is testament to their support of the energy transition and is a key step in finding global climate change solutions, including delivering critical new infrastructure and policies to help hard-to-abate sectors adopt zero-emission fuels such as green ammonia in shipping.”
Much like the size of GIC, the scale of some of ICE's proposed projects is staggering. And while renewable energy production plants are normally constrained by the necessity of feeding into the grid, mega-scale green hydrogen and ammonia plants are prioritized for direct export, albeit with some facilities for domestic use as well. 
For perspective, Australia’s largest coal plant has a generation capacity of just 2.9GW. To put it another way, the generation capacity of all the coal, gas and renewables currently in the Australian wholesale electricity market, which includes all states except Western Australia and the Northern Territory, is just over 50GW.
Thacker told pv magazine ICE's projects are structured off templates which feature a modular roll-out. That means, while figures like 26GW and 50GW seem intimidatingly large, “it is really a dozen large scale projects on the same site. For example, on the solar side, it's … [multiple] 500MW-1GW projects that happen to be on the same site and leverage some of the same infrastructure and planning.” 
Brendan Hammond, chairman of the new Western Green Energy Hub’s board, described the 50GW project as “historic,” both in terms of its scale and its partnership with First Nations landowners. According to the project group’s statement, Mirning Green Energy Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mirning Traditional Lands Aboriginal Corporation, will have a “meaningful carried equity stake” in the project and a permanent seat on the project’s consortium board.
ICE estimates the green hydrogen sector will become a US$2.5 trillion market by 2050.
The GIC investment remains subject to approval from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board.

Those are the main conclusions of a study conducted by researchers at Durham University, in the U.K., in which the authors assessed the techno-economic potential of hydrogen interconnector systems (HIS'), by calculating the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) as the main parameters.
According to the paper, there are currently only 4,500km of hydrogen pipelines globally, which compares to over 160,000km of oil and gas pipelines. “Due to the lower energy density of hydrogen compared to methane, hydrogen pipelines require larger capacities than natural gas pipelines to transport the same amount of energy,” the scientists explained. “This would be achieved either through compressing the hydrogen to higher inlet pressures or designing pipelines with larger internal diameters.”
The modeling considered a system based on a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer plant requiring nine liters of feedstock water to produce 1kg of hydrogen; a pipeline made with API 5L Grade X52 carbon steel and with an internal diameter of 50-120cm; and PEM fuel cells (PEMFC) or hydrogen-fired gas turbines (H2GT), to re-convert hydrogen into electricity.

The LCOE of the HIS' was compared with that of a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line for a base case of a 1,000MW, 100km system under “high,” “medium” and “low” scenarios based on construction years in 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2050. “The results show that the total cost of the HIS is highly sensitive to the cost of input electricity and [the] efficiency of the hydrogen-[to]-electricity or electricity-[to]-hydrogen conversion,” the British group stated. “The most cost-effective HIS uses a gas turbine at pipeline outlet for construction in 2020-2030, being replaced by a fuel cell combined with a direct current to alternating current converter in 2050.”
For the proposed HIS system, the LCOE was found to range from $0.105-0.184/kWh for construction in 2020, and to be between $0.056 and $0.098/kWh for construction in 2050. “The main driver of the decrease in LCOE over time is the improvement in electrolyzer efficiency, which increases the total system efficiency from 32.4 to 48.4% in the case of the “medium” scenario, reducing the lifetime electricity demand by … 30%,” the paper reads.
From an LCOS perspective, the proposed HIS system provides cheaper stored energy than an HVDC system using long duration hydrogen storage, for construction from 2030, with the potential to become competitive in 2025. Its LCOS was estimated at $0.732/kWh in 2020, between $0.398 and $0.685/kWh in 2030, and $0.398/kWh in 2050.
“The HIS has significant advantages from a storage perspective, with an LCOS four times less than that of the HVDC system,” the academics explained. “This demonstrates the benefits of the HIS when used for large scale storage.”
Their findings can be found in the paper “The techno-economics potential of hydrogen interconnectors for electrical energy transmission and storage,” which was recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

The Kabankalan battery is the first utility scale project controlled by a grid operator in the Philippines and the first operational energy storage asset on the Visayas regional grid, which hosts the largest amount of solar generation capacity in the country.
Kabankalan is also the first energy storage system in a 470MW/470MWh portfolio German and U.S.-owned energy storage joint venture Fluence has been contracted to supply and maintain for the SMC Global Power unit of the Filipino conglomerate.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
SMC Global Power this month said it was ready to start operation of an initial 690MW of battery storage facilities as part of a plan to complete 31 energy storage systems this year, with an accumulated capacity of 1GW.
The company's battery portfolio started to take shape last year when SMC revealed it was nearing completion on projects nationwide. It announced 31 batteries would be deployed this year, not only to improve power reliability and help frequency control, but also to pave the way for the integration of 3GW of intermittent renewables capacity.
At the time, SMC president Ramon See Ang said his company would build solar plants in combination with battery storage at 10 locations. These are scheduled to go online by next year.
Kabankalan is the first battery in SMC's portfolio to enter commercial operation. The project was unveiled last year when Fluence said it had commissioned two 20MW/20MWh batteries for SMC Global Power. With project sites ranging in size from 20-60MW, the SMC portfolio procured with Fluence is spread across 13 sites.
Located in Negros Occidental, Kabankalan is only the second grid scale battery in the Philippines, following a 10MW/10MWh system at the Masinloc Power Plant in Zambales, also supplied by Fluence, in 2016.
The new system is the first such asset in the country to be directly controlled by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines, using automatic generation control to provide grid stabilization services including managing frequency and voltage, and supplying reactive power. Such services are critical for ensuring the stability of regional electricity grids across the Philippines which are often plagued by power outages.
Fluence said the Kabankalan project was delivered on time despite challenges stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, including supply chain delays, worker travel restrictions and coordinating construction amid complex on-site rules.
“Each new battery asset we and SMCGPH [SMC Global Power Holdings] bring online strengthens the Philippine grid, adding flexibility in the right places and with the right capabilities to support the nation’s energy transition,” said Fluence president for Asia-Pacific, Jan Teichmann. Fluence will continue deploying storage systems for SMC’s portfolio of projects across the Philippines through July, with additional facilities planned for commissioning and testing in “early 2022.”
SMC’s battery-based energy storage portfolio is reportedly the largest such procurement to date in Southeast Asia.

The polymer bilayer, which is also said to allow unhindered charge transfer within a PV device, was placed directly on the cell's perovskite layer. The upper layer was doped with a non-ionic acid, while the lower layer remained dopant-free. The latter is responsible for transferring the charge and providing protection against corrosion.
The dopant-free polymer provides an acid barrier between the perovskite and the acid-doped polymer, which in turn helps the bilayer structure offer stable ohmic contact at elevated temperatures.
‘This architecture helps protect the extremely sensitive perovskite interface, whilst at the same time demonstrating an extraordinarily high conductivity, even at elevated temperatures,” said FAU researcher Yicheng Zhao.
A solar cell built with this design exhibited operational stability of more than 1,400 hours at a temperature of 65 C under an artificial sun. No corrosion or reduction in performance was detected during the observation period.
“The device also shows negligible hysteresis during the entire ageing period.” the scientists said, noting that the device could also reach up to 20,000 operating hours in the future.
The German group investigated 160 different types of perovskites during the research.
“Such a huge spectrum can only be tackled by carrying out parallel research into whole classes of materials, the traditional methods of investigating and optimising individual materials sequentially are simply not suitable in this context,” said researcher Christoph Brabec.
They presented the cell design in “A bilayer conducting polymer structure for planar perovskite solar cells with over 1,400 hours operational stability at elevated temperatures,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.

This effect creates a temperature difference by transferring heat between the two electrical junctions of a semiconductor-based electronic component, which is the key element, working as a small solid-state heat pump. According to the research team, TECs have the advantage of being easy to install and refrigerant free as well as having no movable parts and offering resilient operation.
The proposed combination was labeled a solar thermoelectric air-conditioning system (STEACS) and its performance was analyzed through a machine learning prediction model known as a random vector functional link network (RVFL), which is a randomized version of a single-layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN). The latter is the simplest kind of neural network, in which there is only one layer of input nodes that send weighted inputs to a subsequent layer of receiving nodes.
The RVFL was used in combination with four different techniques: the Jellyfish Search Algorithm (JFSA); the Artificial Ecosystem-based Optimization (AEO); the Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) model; and the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). Through the four models, the academics assessed the PV-fed current, the cooling power, the average air chamber temperature, and the coefficient of performance (COP) of a PV-powered STEACS for air conditioning of a 1m3 test chamber under diversified cooling loads varying from 65 to 260W.
The system was built with six solar panels, an air duct system, four batteries, a charge controller, TECs, an inverter, heat sinks, a test chamber, and condenser fans. “The TECs were mainly connected with the air duct arrangement and placed close to each other [and] were placed between the air duct and heat sinks,” the researchers explained. “When direct PV current was fed to TECs arranged on the sheet of the air duct system, one face [became] cold, defined as a cold air duct, and another side [became] hot, called “hot air.” The air ducts were composed of an acrylic enclosure wrapped with a protection sheet.”
Six rectangular finned heat sinks were linked to the hot side of TECs for increasing heat dissipation and an aluminum foil was wrapped over the air duct to avoid heat losses. Under this configuration, the STEACS was able to provide up to 272W of cooling power.
The modeling based on the RVFL combined with the Jellyfish Search Algorithm (JFSA) was found to outperform the other three hybrid models in predicting the system performance. “The determination coefficient (R2) of the predicted PV input current by RVFL-JFSA during the training stage was equal to unity for PV input current, average chamber temperature, and cooling capacity; while it was 0.999 for COP,” the scientists explained. “The values of R2 are slightly decreased during the test stage, to be 0.993899, 0.999282, 0.995293, and 0.948428 for PV input current, average chamber temperature … cooling capacity, and COP, respectively.”
The model was proposed in the study “Modeling of a solar-powered thermoelectric air-conditioning system using a random vector functional link network integrated with jellyfish search algorithm,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. The research team includes scientists from the Zagazig and Tanta universities, in Egypt, as well as from the Henan Institute of Science and Technology, in China.

With Poly GCL’s controlling shareholders also having a big stake in GCL New Energy, the terms of the senior notes in question would have to be amended to remove limits on spending their proceeds with affiliate companies and the scope of businesses their proceeds could finance would also have to be expanded to include hydrogen.
GCL New Energy has offered the holders of the notes US$0.002 for each US$1 worth of their investment as an incentive to back the proposal, provided the majority of approvals required is secured before the offer closes, on Feb. 8.
GCL New Energy told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last month it would pay Poly GCL Petroleum a maximum US$1.1335 per cubic meter of natural gas supplied under the proposed agreement.
The solar developer also announced another 30MW solar project sale to state-owned energy company Hunan Xinhua Water Conservancy and Electric Power Co Ltd on Tuesday, having last year transferred ownership of 10 PV parks with a total generation capacity of 469MW between the two parties.
The latest project sale, like the previous two, concerned a site with unspecified “engineering and compliance defects,” in this case requiring RMB2.28 million (US$360,000) to rectify. The sale will generate a net profit of RMB174,000 (US$27,500) for GCL on the book value of the project and will bring in a net RMB233 million (US$36.8 million), which will be used to pay down debt.

Rystad Energy Senior Analyst David Dixon has revealed that the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia, recently acquired by Indonesian solar PV developer SUN Energy, was the nation’s top-performing solar PV asset for 2021.
Dixon highlighted the achievement in a LinkedIn post. He noted that the facility, originally developed by Risen Energy, had topped the list of Australia’s best performing utility-scale (>15 MW) solar farms for the year.
Adani Australia’s 65 MW Rugby Run Solar Farm near Moranbah in central Queensland was second, with an average capacity factor (AC CF) of 28.3%, followed by Neoen’s 36 MW Griffith Solar Farm (27.1% AC CF) in New South Wales (NSW). Genex’s 50 KW Kidston Solar Farm in northern Queensland and the 132 MWp Nevertire Solar Farm in northwestern New South Wales rounded out the top five.
Singapore-based SUN Energy purchased the Merredin Solar Farm, about 260 kilometers east of Perth, from Risen Energy in October. The project features approximately 360,000 Risen 370 W high performance monocrystalline PERC module panels mounted on a single-axis tracking system.
SUN Energy CEO Philip Lee said at the time of the acquisition that the solar farm is an integral part of the company’s expansion strategy and provides the group with a strong foothold to grow its renewable energy presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
“The Australian market is key for us, given the long-term potential for renewable energy and its geographical proximity,” he said. “The acquisition supports our strategy to become one of the leading renewable energy companies in the region, through a combination of new project development and selective acquisitions.”
SUN Energy’s acquisition came just months after mining giant BHP signed an offtake agreement for the Merredin Solar Farm to supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs for its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years. The project, which is adjacent to Western Power’s Merredin Terminal Substation, has also secured development approval to deploy up to 20 MW/40 MWh of battery energy storage onsite.
Merredin’s performance was part of a record-breaking year for utility-scale PV and wind generation in Australia. Dixon said large-scale solar PV and wind generation totaled 35,564 GWh in 2021, with utility PV contributing 9,184 GWh and wind 26,380 GWh. That equated to a 22% rise on the previous year (29,052 GWh).
At the state level, Victoria was the largest generator of utility-scale PV and wind generation in 2021 with 9,767 GWh, followed by New South Wales (8,819 GWh) and South Australia (6,396 GWh).
APA Group’s 130 MW Badgingarra Wind Farm in Western Australia was the top-performing wind farm for 2021, with an average capacity factor of 46.7% CF. It was followed by the 31 MW Kiata Wind Farm (43.0% CF) in Victoria, ahead of the 112 MW Granville Harbor Wind Farm (41.6% AC CF) in Tasmania.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/27/solar-noise-barrier-along-highway-in-massachusetts/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Solar noise barrier along highway in Massachusetts,"From pv magazine USA
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) is launching a highway solar noise barrier project, which it says is the first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.
In 2015, Ko-Solar and its partners approached MassDOT to discuss the concept of photovoltaic noise barriers (PVNBs).  MassDOT agreed to the pilot PVNB project along Interstate 95 in Lexington, Massachusetts. The existing noise barrier will be retrofitted into a PVNB, which will be built and financed in partnership with Solect Energy, a Massachusetts-based solar energy provider.
For procurement and contracting of the project, MassDOT will make use of its membership in PowerOptions, an energy-buying consortium in New England. Solect Energy will finance, install, monitor and maintain the project.
MassDOT plans to use the results of the pilot, including information about noise impacts, maintenance, cost, and community perceptions, to determine the feasibility of PVNB applications elsewhere in the Commonwealth.
The PVNB will be on the north side of the highway, and will extend for 3,000 feet. It will be 20-feet tall, and will be made of reinforced concrete. The retrofit PV system capacity is expected to be 637.5kW(DC), with an estimated 802,000kWh to be generated annually, or the equivalent of supplying 120 homes per year with electricity.
In partnership with Ko-Solar and its partners, MassDOT solicited input on the project from abutters and other Lexington residents through letters to those living near the project site, a public meeting, and meetings with other stakeholders, as 100% support was required to move forward. All votes were in support of the pilot project.
One outcome of the public input process was to require that noise level monitoring would be part of the pilot program. Desktop noise modeling suggests there may be a slight improvement or even a reduction in noise levels for the abutters.
