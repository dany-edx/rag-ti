The device is based on a polymer electrolyte composed of a phosphonated polymer and a perfluorosulfonic acid that is claimed to be able to operate at higher temperatures. The fuel cell's proton conductivity was found to enhance when a proton from the perfluorosulfonic acid transfered to the phosphonated polymer. By applying the composite polymer electrolyte, the researchers were able to achieve nearly 800 milliwatts per square centimeter of rated power density for the fuel cell at 160 degrees Celsius, which is a 60 percent improvement of the phosphoric acid-based fuel cells, the New Mexico researchers wrote in an article published by nature energy last week. By solving the overheating issue, the fuel cell overcomes a technical barrier to using medium and heavy-duty fuel cells in trucks and buses, they added.
Mexican cement producer Cemex invested in HiiROC, a UK-based hydrogen production startup that has developed a scalable technology using thermal plasma electrolysis to convert biomethane, flare gas, or natural gas into hydrogen at a reportedly lower cost than competing solutions. “HiiROC … has developed a novel process that efficiently produces high purity hydrogen and clean carbon black at superior temperatures and pressure,” the company announced Tuesday. “As part of this investment, Cemex and HiiROC aim to increase Cemex’s hydrogen injection capacity in its cement kilns, allowing for a higher alternative fuel substitution rate of fossil fuels.” Cemex has not disclosed details of the investment.
Danish energy fund Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) is partnering with Spanish companies Enagás, Naturgy, Fertiberia and Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas on the development of the first phase of Project Catalina, a green hydrogen and green ammonia gigawatt-scale project that aims to bring the renewable resources of Aragon to the industrial consumption points on Spain's eastern coast. The companies intend to develop 5 GW of combined wind and solar and deploy a 2 GW electrolyzer. “Once fully implemented, Catalina will produce enough green hydrogen to supply 30% of Spain’s current hydrogen demand,” CIP wrote on Tuesday. The companies expect the first phase of the project to be fully developed and approved in less than two years, while construction is planned to start at the end of 2023. The first phase of the project will consist of 1.7 GW of wind and solar energy facilities as well as a 500 MW electrolyzer.
CIP is also supporting a project in Norway. Hydrogen company Hy2gen plans to produce green ammonia as a fuel for the maritime sector in the municipality of Sauda on Norway's southwestern coast, CIP said Wednesday. The green ammonia production facility, Iverson eFuels AS, will be owned by Hy2gen, commodity trading company Trafigura and CIP. The pre-study was completed in 2021 and the project owners have now started the front-end engineering design (FEED) phase, which will result in a full plan for the construction of the facility by 2023. “Following a final investment decision, the commencement of construction is scheduled in the first quarter of 2024, and the facility will be fully operational at the beginning of 2027,” CIP stated in a separate press release.
Polish state oil refiner and petrol retailer PKN Orlen committed PLN 7.4 billion (€ 1.63 billion) by 2030 to low- and zero-carbon hydrogen development projects based on renewable energy sources and municipal waste conversion technology. “As a result, ten hydrogen hubs will be developed by the end of the decade, with motorists in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia provided with access to a network of over 100 hydrogen refuelling stations,” the Polish company wrote on Wednesday, explaining that the move is a key part of the group’s transformation into a carbon-neutral multi-utility. By the end of the decade, the Orlen group aims to install 0.5 GW of new hydrogen production capacity using renewable energy sources and municipal waste conversion. “The Group deployed its first hydrogen hub in Trzebinia in 2021, which makes grey hydrogen for transport and is to ultimately produce low-carbon hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Another hub is being developed in Włocławek, which is due to start producing green hydrogen in the second half of 2023. Two years later, a hub in Płock will be launched to make green hydrogen for industrial and transport applications.”
Ten Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel cell electric cars and a Toyota fuel cell forklift truck were handed over to the Tees Valley Hydrogen Transport Hub in England. The deliveries took place at the opening of the new Element 2 hydrogen fuelling station at Teesside International Airport in Darlington. “As part of the Tees Valley Hydrogen Hub demonstration programme, the airport has two Mirai, and alongside other regional organisations it will be testing zero emission, hydrogen-fuelled commercial and support vehicles as part of a Department of Transport led £2.5 million region-wide trial,” Toyota wrote on Thursday, referring to the UK’s first Hydrogen Transport Hub announced by the British government in September 2020. The multi-modal hydrogen transport hub study also focuses on the quantity of green hydrogen required alongside related production, storage, and distribution facilities.
UK energy company bp won approval to become a joint venture partner of Aberdeen City Council (ACC) for the construction of a solar power facility connected to a green hydrogen production and refueling facility. “We plan to create a blueprint which can be replicated around the world by the cities and regions looking to reach net zero,” said Councillor Ryan Houghton, Aberdeen City Council growth and resources convener.
The energy transition process should focus on battery electric vehicles in passenger transport, and possibly also in freight transport, according to Patrick Plötz, head of the Energy Economy business unit at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research. While there are only two passenger fuel cell car models globally, there are more than 350 models of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, Plötz noted in a commentary published in nature electronics. “With economies of scale in full effect for batteries, and with further cost reductions and performance improvement of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure coming, fuel cell cars are highly unlikely to be able to compete.” With regard to zero-emission trucks, Plötz said they are in a much earlier market phase and mostly available in China. He remained dubious about the potential of hydrogen trucks, despite some recent positive developments. “If truck manufacturers do not start the mass production of fuel cell trucks soon to reduce costs, such vehicles will never succeed in low-carbon road transport. Policymakers and industry need to decide quickly whether the fuel cell electric truck niche is large enough to sustain further hydrogen technology development, or whether it is time to cut their losses and to focus efforts elsewhere.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/04/forget-batteries-what-if-surplus-renewable-energy-could-be-stored-as-information/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022","Forget batteries, what if surplus renewable energy could be stored as information?","While there is so much work going into developing new and existent battery chemistries and system designs, a pair of researchers from UC San Diego has proposed a new battery system that involves no physical device.
The team dubbed their concept information batteries, in which energy is stored in the form of information—specifically, the results of completed computational tasks. The idea is to speculatively perform computations in large, energy-intensive data centers when solar and wind energy is available in excess and store the results on servers for later use, when there is less renewable energy on the grid.
In other words, information batteries would provide storage through speculative load shifting, anticipating computation that will be performed in the future.
The most likely candidates for implementing this concept are energy-hungry data centers – from Google and Facebook to Hollywood movie rendering. For instance, every day, YouTube data centers transcode more than 700,000 hours of videos to different resolutions and many of these computations are predictable and can be performed at a time when there is excess green energy.
In addition to taking advantage of task predictability, the system is also flexible: the computations that are completed in advance do not need to match exactly with the computations completed at a later time.
“We support pre-computing many fragments of computation and then later can pick and choose small pieces of computation done before, like puzzle pieces, and assemble them together to quickly compute a totally new computational task,” said Barath Raghavan, an assistant professor in computer science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
Challenges
While the idea itself is relatively simple, the challenge, said the researchers, is determining what computation to perform, where and when, and how these computations should be done to efficiently retrieve the results later.
In the paper Information Batteries: Storing Opportunity Power with Speculative Execution, the researchers describe their proof-of-concept implementation of information batteries, which includes recurrent neural networks for predicting the upcoming tasks in data centers, a cache where functions are stored enabling fast retrieval of precomputed results, and a modified compiler to automatically modify code to store and retrieve results.
However, as with all technologies, there are certain limitations to this concept. For instance, it is only possible in some workloads and in some contexts, which the researchers further explore in their study. But Raghavan believes with improved prediction and integration into large systems, the technology points towards a promising future alternative for storing green energy. “In the civilization-scale challenge of sustainability, we need every tool we can get,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/04/multiple-effects-of-potential-induced-degradation-on-solar-module-performance/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Multiple effects of potential-induced degradation on solar module performance,"Researchers from the University of York have conducted a standard test on the multiple effects of potential-induced degradation (PID) on the thermal and electrical performance of PV modules.
“For many PV systems, PID is one of the leading causes of module degradation caused by the high voltage between the encapsulants and the front glass surface, which is grounded via the substructure of the cell or the frame,” they explained in the study Power loss and hotspot analysis for photovoltaic modules affected by potential induced degradation, published in npj materials degradation. “PID becomes more prevailing as the module ages, and whilst it normally does not affect all the solar cells in the module, it does have a critical impact as it cannot be repaired.”
The novel approach considered all multiple PID effects through a comprehensive analysis, which included power losses, hotspots, mm-level defects, and the performance ratio (PR) of 28 modules affected by PID at an outdoor testing field.

Through the test, the scientists ascertained that power losses caused by PID may be significant. “For example, if a PV module has around 8% power losses at the initial state of the PID test, the power losses would likely be in the range of 30%  and 50% after 96 h,” they specified. “This plot gives an indication of the PID impact over time.”
Electroluminescence images were taken during the experiment to estimate power losses and they showed that only a few solar cells were unaffected, with their output power losses not exceeding 5%. “This suggests that these cells were influenced by lower shading rates, heat, humidity, or any form of cracks during their working life,” the scientists emphasized.
After 96 h, the PV module had 30 hotspots and four panels saw their temperature increase significantly by up to 40 degrees Celsius, with four panels being affected by a significant increase in the temperature to 45 °C.

Their analysis also showed that the power losses of the PV modules at irradiance levels between 50 and 200 W/m2 are up to four times higher than at 1000 W/m2 and that solar cells attacked by PID can develop hotspots, increasing the temperature of the cells from 25 to 45 degrees Celsius. The average performance ratio of the tested modules at the end of the PID experiment was 71.16%.
“Following the IEC61215 standard we found 60% of the examined PV modules failed the reliability test after completing the PID experiment,” the academics concluded. “In addition, on a mm-level, we have discovered that PID can impact the solar cells with different damages, such as discontinuation of the cells fingers and busbars.”

The PV system deployed on the structure has a nominal power of 8 kW and relies on JAM72S20 MR 455W solar panels provided by Chinese manufacturer JA Solar. The entire structure comprising the solar array has a footprint of 55 m2, offers a shade area of 25 m2 and weighs 57kg/m2. The modules were deployed by Lodeal Green and Tasvalor was the project developer.
“The project was built at a cost of €12,500,” Borrego stated.

When the all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck hits the road later this spring, it will deliver the same utility that has made the F-150 line a leader among all truck offerings. However, the Lightning will be able to deliver something that no pickup truck has done before: it can power your home.
Ford has teamed up with Sunrun to enhance home energy management, leveraging the substantial onboard battery capability of the Lightning with Ford Intelligent Backup Power, to give customers the ability to use bidirectional power technology from their all-electric truck to provide energy to their homes during an outage, or to reduce their reliance on the grid when electricity prices are high.
With Ford Intelligent Backup Power and the Home Integration System, developed in collaboration with Sunrun, F-150 Lightning automatically kicks in to power the home if the grid goes down. The Home Integration System and Ford Charge Station Pro, the truck’s charging unit, are composed of a power inverter plus a dark start battery and transfer switch, enabling the two-way power flow. Buyers of the extended-range F-150 Lightning automatically receive the Ford Charge Station Pro, while standard-range truck customers can purchase the 80-amp Ford Charge Station Pro and pay for activation separately.
The Home Integration System and Ford Charge Station Pro are designed in what is called a vehicle-to-grid direct current configuration (V2G-DC). In V2G-DC, power conversion and smart functions are housed in the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), where the EVSE essentially works like a stationary smart inverter offering grid-support benefits and communication functions to asset operators, in addition to converting power.
The Lightning’s extended-range battery system can store up to 131kWh of electricity and deliver up to 9.6kW. For comparison, a Tesla Powerwall 2, one of the leading home storage solutions can store up to 14kWh of electricity and deliver up to 5kW continuously, with a max peak of 7kW.
As a battery alone, the Lightning has a storage capacity equivalent to roughly 9.4 Tesla Powerwall 2 units.  Ten batteries would cost approximately $5,500 each before installation costs, while the Lightning is available at a price that can range from $39,974 to upwards of $95,000, depending on which available options the customer chooses. Plus, you can’t drive a home battery to work.
Once power is restored, the system automatically reverts back to utility power, but users can configure the system to charge their truck using their residential solar installation, if they so choose. Based on an average U.S. home at 30 kilowatt-hours of use per day, F-150 Lightning with extended-range battery provides full home power for up to three days, or as long as 10 days when used in conjunction with solar power or considerable energy usage rationing.
Outside of the development assistance with the Home Integration System Ford and Sunrun are partnering to provide a seamless installation solution with Sunrun employees installing the specific charging hardware. As part of the partnership, Ford shares that customers interested in combining Ford Charge Station Pro installation with solar power may be eligible to do so for zero dollars down and reduced installation pricing.

Insolvent Austrian PV module manufacturer Energetica has a new owner, Wien-based company Irma Power GmbH.
“Irma Power GmbH has taken over all shares in the company,” Energetica managing director Erwin Toplac told pv magazine. “There was a bidding process from which Irma Power emerged as the winner.”
Insolvency administrator Ferdinand Lanker told Austrian broadcaster ORF that the move could be considered a hostile takeover, as the consent of the previous shareholders was not necessary and they were not asked to approve the transaction. “I now have a new owner and this owner has taken over the rights and obligations of the previous shareholder,” said Lanker.
The new owner is financially strong and is planning to maintain and expand module production at the company's manufacturing facility in Liebenfels, he added. Toplac confirmed Lanker's comments but at the same time emphasized that Irma Power had so far only taken over the business shares, not the operational business. Due to the insolvency proceedings, this remains Lanker's responsibility. However, he hopes that the insolvency administrator and creditors' approval for the takeover of the operational business by Irma Power can be obtained by March.
Energetica's insolvency was announced in autumn 2021. At that time, the management said the liabilities amounted to almost €25 million. Insolvency proceedings began in November and the search for a financially strong investor to maintain photovoltaic production in the state of Carinthia began.
Energetica pursued the goal of setting up gigawatt-scale solar module production in Liebenfels, but manufacturing activities there are currently continuing on a small scale.

A year earlier, this percentage had reached around 87%. “The number of applications to disconnect existing homes from natural gas is also increasing,” the organization said. “For example, households are switching to all-electric as a sustainable alternative.”
Netbeheer Nederland specified that the 10% of new homes built last year that were still linked to the gas grid were granted this possibility as their environmental permit was filed before 1 July 2018. “In addition, municipalities still have the option of granting an exemption for new construction projects after 1 July 2018, for example when solutions other than natural gas are technically impossible,” it added.
The association also said that around 3,000 homes per week will have to be made more sustainable by 2030 if the country's climate targets have to be achieved. “This is an enormous task, especially due to the chronic shortage of technical personnel,” it explained.
In April, Netbeheer Nederland formed an alliance with Techniek Nederland, the national association of electric installers, and environmental association Natuur & Milieu to develop a plan to install at least 100,000 hybrid heat pumps in homes and buildings every year from 2024. The HR-Hybrid Coalition has urged the Dutch government to allocate €600 million for the plan, which envisages the deployment of up to 2 million hybrid heat pumps before 2030, which would generate CO2 savings of up to 2.6 megatons.

The Ubol Ratana Dam Hydro-Floating Solar Hybrid Project will have a capacity of 24 MW and will be located the company's Ubol Ratana Dam in Khok Sung, Ubolratana District, approximately 50 km (31 mi) north of Khon Kaen, Khon Kaen Province. The project is scheduled to start commercial operation in 2023.
Interested developers will have time until March 9 to submit their bids.
“The Hydro-Floating Solar Hybrid Project at Ubol Ratana Dam is included in the Thailand Power Development Plan B.E. 2561-2580, Revision 1 (PDP2018 Rev.1) that specifies development of hydro-floating solar hybrid projects with a total capacity of 2,725 MW,” EGAT said in a statement.
Thailand's first floating PV plant went online in February 2021. Thailand aims to develop its capacity for floating PV installations, particularly on dams. According to Bloomberg, the country plans to install nearly 2.7 GW of solar capacity on nine dams by 2037.
In June 2019, EGAT issued a call for tenders to develop 55 MW of floating solar. Four months later, French floating PV specialist Ciel&Terre, and SCG, an Asian petrochemical company, signed a memorandum of understanding to develop floating PV systems on hydroelectric dams in Thailand. Chinese inverter maker Sungrow announced in September the grid connection of what it says is Thailand‘s largest floating solar plant – a 58.5 MW project in the northeastern province of Ubon Ratchathani.
EGAT operates 45 power generation assets totaling 15.54 GW. Of these, three are thermal, six combined cycle gas turbines, 24 hydropower, eight renewable energy and four diesel. The company has a 37% share of Thailand’s power market.

Western Australia grid operator Western Power this week announced the $15 million Kalbarri microgrid, which will utilize wind and solar PV power, battery energy storage and the grid to improve the reliability of electricity supply to the remote community on the state’s mid-west coast, has been switched on.
“It’s ‘power on’ for the Kalbarri microgrid,” Western Power said in a social media post.
“Today our renewable microgrid in Kalbarri, the largest of its kind in Australia, was officially launched.
“The local wind farm, residential solar panels and a big battery power this high-tech microgrid, dramatically improving power reliability in this edge-of-the-grid town. And it’s already saved hours of power outages.”
The microgrid, developed by Western Power in partnership with state-owned gentailer Synergy, is powered by 1 MW of feed-in from residential rooftop solar and a 1.6 MW wind farm, backed by a 5 MW/2 MWh battery energy storage system. The smart system is connected to the grid and will be able to reverse power flows overnight when stored energy is insufficient to meet demand and disconnect from the larger network should a fault occur.
Western Power said the project is one of Australia’s largest microgrids capable of operating in complete renewable mode.
“It can run independently or connect to the main electricity network. During an outage the microgrid maintains supply to the community using both solar and wind, and stored energy in the battery,” the grid operator said.
First announced in 2016, the microgrid was originally scheduled to come online more than three years ago but it has been beset by multiple delays, during which the Kalbarri community has been forced to deal with ongoing energy supply problems and extended outages.
The coastal tourist town, about 600 kilometers north of Perth, is at the end of a 140-kilometre-long rural feeder line connecting it to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) at Geraldton.
About 1,500 customers and more than 100,000 visitors to the town each year are served by the 33 kV feeder line which is exposed to the elements and susceptible to interference which can cause extended outages.
Western Power said the microgrid is expected to eliminate 80% of outages experienced by the town and can significantly reduce the length of outages.
“The microgrid uses leading-edge technology to minimise disruptions, and in the event of a network interruption can run independently from the main electricity network,” Western Power said.
“This advanced system will address even momentary outages, responding in milliseconds to maintain a seemingly uninterrupted power supply.”
Western Power said the modular design of the $15 million project, the state’s fourth microgrid, allows for future renewable generation sources to be integrated as they become available.
Energy Minister Bill Johnston said improving how energy is delivered in regional areas and delivering better power reliability for Western Australians is a key part of the government’s Distributed Energy Resources Roadmap.
“The Kalbarri microgrid is an important step towards improving power reliability for the local community,” he said.
“It also paves the way in delivering greater renewable energy solutions across WA, particularly in regional areas, as we move forward in achieving net zero emissions by 2050.
Mining and Pastoral Region MLC Peter Foster said the microgrid would serve as a blueprint for the delivery of innovative energy solutions throughout the state.
“The new microgrid is one of Australia’s most sophisticated and will be used as a blueprint for other regional areas to support the provision of stable, secure and clean energy into the future,” he said.
The launch of the microgrid coincided with the announcement that Kalbarri District High School (DHS) had been included in Synergy’s Schools Virtual Power Plant (VPP) project.
A 40 kW solar system and a 180 kWh battery energy storage system will be installed at Kalbarri DHS before the end of the year as part of the $8.8 million project.
The Schools VPP regional expansion now includes seven new locations, including in Geraldton and Kalgoorlie, bringing the number of participating schools to 17.

The system was built in a 4-layer configuration including a perovskite light absorber, a sandwich joint electrode, an aqueous alkaline electrolyte, and zinc metal. “Benefiting from the integrated device structure, specially designed components and narrow-range voltage-matching mechanism, our inexpensive SRZB shows remarkably high specific energy, high specific power, high safety and high overall efficiency,” the researchers stated.
The sandwich joint electrode was embedded in the device to integrate the aqueous zinc battery with the water-sensitive perovskite solar cells. “Intrinsically, the sandwich joint electrode possesses a hydrophilic-hydrophobic-hydrophilic structure feature, which ‘hides' the impermeable protective layer internally and exposes two external hydrophilic interfaces to simultaneously achieve protection and electrical performance,” they further explained.
One of the two hydrophilic sides of the electrode was doped with nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) to improve its compatibility with the other layers, while the other side acts as the counter electrode of perovskite solar cells to obtain better interfacial contact.
The electricity generated by the perovskite solar cells is fed into the fluorine-doped tin oxide (TiO2/FTO) substrate and is transferred to the Zn electrode to reduce zinc ions. Holes can then spread through the sandwich joint carbon layer to achieve an oxidation reaction on the positive electrode. “In this way, the SRZB can harness the infinite power of solar irradiation and store this solar energy in terms of electrochemical energy,” the Chinese group stated. “The as-stored electrochemical energy can be subsequently released with controllable and steady output according to the demand.”
After measuring the system performance, the scientists found it can achieve high specific energy of 366 Wh/kg, high specific power of 54.01 kW/kg, an overall efficiency of 6.4%, and a steady operation for more than 200 cycles with little performance degradation. “High safety and low-cost demands are also satisfied owing to the use of cost-effective materials, a safe aqueous electrolyte and a special photocharge mode,” they concluded.
The device is presented in the paper Coupling aqueous zinc batteries and perovskite solar cells for simultaneous energy harvest, conversion and storage, published in nature communications.

Norway’s Scatec and Indian developer Acme Solar have decided to put their 900 MW solar project in the Indian state of Rajasthan on hold.
Scatec pointed a lack of domestically made solar panels and a 40% import duty on PV modules from April as the reasons for putting the project on hold. The project has been moved from backlog to pipeline, the developer said, adding it still sees India as a robust market.
Scatec has a 50% stake in the Rajasthan solar project, which is being developed by Acme. The project was scheduled for commissioning in 2022. It will benefit from a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Solar Energy Corp. of India.
Scatec stated the main reason for putting the Rajasthan project back in the pipeline was “the realization or confirmation that the import duty was not going to be lifted for some of the projects in that [it’s 900 MW project] category … There will be a change in the market in terms of where are the modules being sourced from, China or all the production being built up in India. We are a bit uncertain how quickly that is moving. That’s why we have decided to take this large project into the pipeline from the backlog.”
It also pointed to a “gap in between the price level that we have seen in modules from China and the expected price level” for panels made in India.
“We expect that over time, production lines for modules in India will approach the same cost level as in China,” it added. “But that needs to be confirmed. Without knowing that, we have decided to move the project from backlog to pipeline.”
Scatec said last year that the 900 MW solar project has an estimated total capex of $400 million, with 75% debt financing from an Indian state-owned lender. Scatec holds a 50% stake in the project, with Acme holding the other half.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/04/solarapp-permitting-software-reduces-project-times-in-pilot-run/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",SolarAPP+ permitting software reduces project times in pilot run,"From pv magazine USA
Last July, the US Department of Energy (DoE) and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) released Solar Automated Permit Processing (SolarAPP+), a free software program to automate residential solar permitting. The tool – launched in a webinar by DoE Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm, with help from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) – was later adopted by several pilot cities. 
The results from the pilot program are now in, and it appears SolarAPP+ delivered on its promise to reduce project times. In the pilot of five jurisdictions across diverse residential solar market characteristics and needs, SolarAPP+ reduced overall project times by an average of 12 days. 
Although the cost for PV equipment has lowered in the last decade, costs from permitting, inspection, and interconnection remain high, said NREL. Shortened project times are viewed as an important feature of customer experience and retention, as residential solar soft costs like customer acquisition are also relatively expensive in the United States.  
A smooth permitting process can help both keep a customer satisfied throughout the installation process and make them more likely to refer their friends, family, or neighbors to adopt solar. Referrals are an important part of the residential solar sales process, creating a network of customers and lowering soft costs for developers.
Three Californian cities and two jurisdictions in Arizona were chosen for the pilot study. In all areas, project permit approvals were reduced to less than one day on average. The most relief came to Tucson, Arizona, where the paper permitting process averaged 24 days.
The tool also provides relief to authorities having jurisdiction – that is, city and county employees who no longer have to process a massive influx of paperwork due to the steep rise in residential solar demand. The software has been approved for both solar photovoltaic systems and battery energy storage. 
On Feb. 17, SEIA will host a webinar to overview the pilot study results.
