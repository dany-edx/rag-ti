Maharashtra-headquartered Mahindra Susten, the renewables arm of Mahindra Group, has commissioned a 175 MW (AC) solar project in Bikaner district, Rajasthan. The capacity is the first portion of a bigger 250 MW solar project it is developing across a site spanning 900 acres, all of which will be connected to the interstate transmission system.
The project will supply electricity to Solar Energy Corporation of India over a period of 25 years at a fixed tariff of INR 2.54/kWh, Saurabh Mehta, Mahindra Susten’s business development and projects lead, told pv magazine.
“Mahindra Susten developed the project with engineering, procurement, and construction work done in-house. Operation and maintenance services for the plant are being provided by Mahindra Teqo [a sister company of Mahindra Susten],” said Mehta.
The project uses bifacial modules to maximize yield and reduce the land requirement. Water-free robots have been deployed to clean the solar panels. The project is purportedly the first of this scale in India to use bifacial module technology. Before implementing the project, Mahindra Susten deployed a prototype at a number of sites to analyze the advantages of bifacial technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/23/indoor-commercial-storage-with-fire-protection-housing/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GERMANY",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 23, 2022",Indoor commercial storage with fire protection housing,"Intilion, a battery storage manufacturer based in Paderborn, Germany, presented its first indoor commercial energy storage, with a unique fire protection feature, at the Smarter E trade show in Munich earlier this month.
Although relatively rare, fire hazards in lithium-ion batteries are an important issue. By fine-tuning existing technologies and introducing new safety features, battery manufacturers are seeking to dispel customer concerns and meet rigorous safety requirement standards in markets across the world.
In the German market, battery systems for indoor use need to meet certification standards set by VDE, including the requirement that no fire can propagate between neighboring battery modules.
To this end, Intilion has designed an additional mechanical housing to go around each module. In case of an internal cell short circuit or mechanical damage, the protection housing ensures that the surrounding modules are protected against fire propagation while any gases released are being directed through special exhaust ducts to ensure optimal outgassing and cooling effects.
In other words, the special air ducts achieve supersaturation of escaping gas, which prevent ignitable mixtures and additionally spark extinguishing chambers. The fire risk is therefore limited to a single battery module, and there can be no open flames or explosion. In addition, the Intilion system includes a tray beneath the modules to collect any leaked electrolyte, preventing contamination of groundwater.
The system therefore meets the safety requirements in the German application guide VDE-AR-E 2510-50 for stationary storage systems with lithium-ion battery cells. The manufacturer also claims the new fire protection feature facilitates the usual coordination with property insurers and fire departments and protects against follow-up investments.
“With our new fire protection option, we ensure maximum safety,” says Manuel Schmidt, business unit manager of the energy storage product line at Intilion. “We are convinced that we will succeed in becoming one of the largest providers in Germany and Europe in the field of indoor commercial storage.”
Intilion, a wholly owned subsidiary of battery technology company Hoppecke Carl Zoellner & Sohn GmbH, launched the indoor commercial storage system Scalestac in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in June 2021. The flexible system is intended for public utilities, municipalities, industrial companies, businesses, and farmers and can be expanded from 25 kVA to 400 kVA and is available with a capacity from 123 kWh up to 1 MWh.
The charging and discharging power can be selected from 0.3 C to 2 C. As the storage unit is only 2 meters high, it fits through any standard door and can also be installed in rooms with low ceilings. The fire protection housing is retrofittable to the existing Scalestac systems.

The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement. “We were looking for a strong partner who also has a focus on sustainability and technical expertise to support our mission to accelerate the transition to renewable energy worldwide,” said Sven Lehmann, CEO and co-founder of PI Berlin.
The structure and the company name will remain unchanged. The only change is that the company will have a single owner, Kiwa Germany, rather than individual private shareholders.
Kiwa offers laboratory, inspection, audit and consulting services. It serves private and public sector customers in virtually every market and employs more than 10,000 people in over 35 countries throughout Europe, Asia, North America, Latin America and Oceania. It is based in Rijswijk, the Netherlands, and is a member of the SHV Holdings consortium.
In the field of renewable energy, Kiwa offers testing and certification services for solar modules, inverters and batteries, as well as technical consulting services for PV plants.
PI Berlin was founded in 2006 and offers technical advice, risk management, and quality assurance for solar projects and storage installations. The international team includes more than 100 professionals and provides audit, testing, inspection and engineering services to investors, utilities, developers, EPCs and government agencies. The most important locations of PI Berlin are Germany, Spain, the United States, and China. PI Berlin also has a licensing deal for PV module tests with Mitsui Chemicals in Japan and India.
Sven Lehmann and Steven Xuereb, members of the PI Berlin board of directors, will continue to lead the business of PI Berlin as active members of the management board. Gero Schoenwasser from Kiwa Deutschland GmbH will also join the board of PI Berlin.
“This acquisition represents a strong momentum for PI Berlin, which will undoubtedly lead both to a reinforcement of the services already offered in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America, and to the inclusion of new capacities thanks to the infrastructure already owned by the Kiwa Group,” said Asier Ukar, general manager of the Spanish subsidiary of PI Berlin. “The improvement will be reflected in the areas of factory, laboratory and field services, which will benefit our customers developing greenfield projects, but also those repowering or refurbishing existing assets, which is of increasing importance for the Spanish market.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/23/extraordinary-week-capped-off-with-pv-ipcei-launch-in-brussels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 23, 2022",‘Extraordinary week’ capped off with PV-IPCEI launch in Brussels,"Following only two days after the European Commission's (EC) landmark Solar Strategy on May 18, the mood of the PV-IPCEI event was one of renewed ambition and confidence. Europe's solar manufacturing industry wants to help the bloc disentangle itself from Russian fossil fuel reliance without immediately succumbing to another dependency on Chinese PV.
As SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger put it to the small crowd in attendance and larger audience tuning in virtually: “Interesting times can lead to watershed moments. The RePower Initiative is just such a moment. Commissioner Kadri Simson has taken bold decisions which should lead to peaceful years built on renewables.”
Commissioner Simson, also in attendance, described the week as “extraordinary,” noting that reality is very different now than even six months ago now that Russia's actions have revealed them as “untrustworthy.”
“We are doubling down,” said Simson. “Before we focused on energy from the ground. Now we will look up to wind and sun … Citizens will move from consumers to prosumers … Necessity is driving us on. We want to reach 320 GW of newly installed solar by 2025. This represents an opportunity to hand power back to the citizens.”
Finally, Commissioner Simson said the newly bolstered European ambition “will be a game-changer,” particularly in terms of the new building solar PV mandate, an accelerated permitting process and, importantly, for manufacturing. “We are signaling demand for PV, and that represents an opportunity for supply … The future has always looked bright for solar. But now, thanks to circumstances outside our control, the future is here.”
Simson's rallying words were then seconded by Maive Rute, deputy director general for internal market, industry, entrepreneurship and SMEs. “Our aim is to build a strong value chain for the EU,” Rute said
It is a goal to be achieved through a strong project pipeline, an accelerated standardization process, and a competitive edge in innovation and sustainability which the PV-IPCEI should prove a valuable tool for in the hands of member states.
“It's all hands on deck for the implementation of the solar strategy,” Rute declared.
It is a notion supported by rare political accord behind the need for strong European PV manufacturing. As the Greens politician and Member of the European Parliament Michael Bloss related, whereas normally a speaker from the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR Group) would disagree with everything, “(the ECR member) told me he agreed about the need for EU solar manufacturing. This is a first and a good sign.”
Though lacking representation from France and Germany, the launch was attended by representatives from Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, Poland and Lithuania. Joan Groizard, Spain's director general of the Institute for Diversification and Energy Savings, said the Iberian nation “is preparing to lead this PV-IPCEI” and the EU can “count on Spain for this initiative.”
Key projects
Although ostensibly a chance for the ESMC and potential PV-IPCEI projects to meet and gain insights into the IPCEI process of procuring state aid, those in attendance were also provided an overview of said projects. Among those which will seek to procure state aid through the PV-IPCEI process are a heterojunction cell and module production facility with a first-stage capacity of 300 MW, with plans to ramp to 3 GW and ultimately 15 GW by 2028.
MCPV's Marc Rechter spoke to the EU's lack of upstream strength, noting that the bloc needs scale. This is a huge opportunity to take advantage of Europe's “great knowledge in the next phase of PV tech … the tech jump is there.” Rechter also noted the need for short-term credit guarantees and the opportunity the EU has to set standards.
Similarly, machine supplier Singulus' Stefan Rinck said: “We are at the point to industrialize these new technologies. We have to build a pilot plant with new tech, to show that it works and we can then we can introduce industrial scale as soon as possible. It's available, but has to be tested in mass production.”
Other potential technological production projects focused on TOPCon (GIGA PV) industrializing Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC), which is largely based on PERC. Both of which emphasized innovative European solutions to reduce costs or improve sustainability.
Solitek's Julius Denafas presented a project for the mass production of integrated PV solutions, which is to say building integrated PV (BIPV), infrastructure integrated PV (IIPV), vehicle integrated PV (VIPV) and AgriPV. The project has capacity targets between 1 GW to 2.5 GW across the various integrated segments, though Denafras noted that BIPV manufacturers need standardization for scale. The potential mass production start date is penciled in for 2025.
Since sustainability is considered key to European manufacturing's competitive advantage, IFE's Sean Erik Foss and REC Solar's Trude Nysæter presented a circular PV project to strengthen the value chain for recycling PV modules. Foss noted the need for clean silicon and described current standards as insufficient.
“There is a lot of refined material which can remain refined if we're smart about it,” said Foss, noting that the suggested target would see recycling increase to 98% (volume) of annual waste.
The event concluded with a presentation and Q&A session with Demos Spartharis, head of unit for state aid at IPCEI's Environment and Innovation I, DG Competition and Marc Isabelle, founder and director of consultancy firm European Economics, which helps projects submit their proposals. Both Spatharis and Isabelle provided the example of the Battery PV-IPCEI and warned of mistakes and misadventures in the hydrogen IPCEI.
Among a litany of other requirements, for a project to be eligible for state aid, it requires a cross-border element including at least four member states. This shouldn't be a problem for PV, as evidenced by the five member states in attendance, though since funding ultimately comes from member states, Spatharis warned that the process moved as fast as the slowest state.
Half-jokingly, Spatharsis said that projects could follow the “Tesla Method” if they are in a rush, but noted that a project could only be considered for state aid if it started after submitting an aid proposal. “We want to push you to be better than the Chinese,” said Spatharis, “in terms of tech and price.”

They claim it reduces fill factor losses to a minimum.
“Our cells were conceived for applications in large-scale solar modules,” researcher Wenzhu Liu told pv magazine.
The scientists fabricated the cell with a 244.63 cm2 Czochralski n-c-Si wafer provided by China-based Sichuan Yongxiang Silicon Material Company. They used light soaking to improve the dark conductance of the a-Si:H films, in order to help the diffusion and hopping of weakly bound hydrogen atoms, resulting in efficient boron tetrasilicide (B−Si4) doping.
“The light-soaking devices are made of LED arrays and were developed by Chinese companies at our request,” Liu said.
The scientists have found that boron doping, which stems from weakly bound hydrogen atoms, plays a crucial part in the formation of metastable hydrogen configurations in the a-Si:H films. Under standard illumination conditions, the solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.18%, an open-circuit voltage of 749 mV, and a fill factor of 85.42%, which the scientists described as the highest values among two-side contacted silicon solar cells.
An encapsulated device was also able to retain 98.70% and 97.59% of the fill factor and efficiency, respectively, after 1,000 hours. The scientists claimed that this demonstrates high stability against extreme climate degradation factors.
The scientists described the process in “Light-induced activation of boron doping in hydrogenated amorphous silicon for over 25% efficiency silicon solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. “We participated in their design and now both the cells and the light-soaking devices will be available in the market,” said Liu.

“Our method can be applied to all silicon-based solar panels,” researcher Ady Suwardi told pv magazine.
The scientists said thermoelectric devices are very tolerant to defects and impurities, which makes them particularly suitable for recycled silicon, which is uneconomical to recycle due to its defect- and impurity-sensitive nature.
Their new technique consists of pulverizing polycrystalline silicon into powder and pelletizing it into ingots. The process relies on spark plasma sintering to dope the silicon with germanium and phosphorus. The combination of doping and reduced thermal conductivity is designed to improve the power conversion and cooling efficiency of applicable thermoelectric technologies.
The researchers tested their technique on 15.6 cm x 15.6 cm solar cells provided by Singaporean manufacturer Green Research Scientific.
“The silicon pieces were pulverized using ball milling into fine powder,” they said, noting that the ball milling is done for an hour in argon atmosphere to ensure homogeneity and prevent oxidation. “Subsequently, the mixed powders were consolidated using spark plasma sintering at 1,150 C for five minutes.”
The group found that phosphorus doping modified the electronic structure of the silicon, while improving its power factor and carrier scattering. Germanium doping helped further improve both the electronic and thermal transport properties of the upcycled silicon.
“Furthermore, the recycled silicon with low germanium content in this work is expected to have good stability since silicon-based thermoelectrics such as Silicon-germanium (SiGe) have been widely known to have good mechanical and chemical stability during long-term, high-temperature operation,” they said. “This results in attractive energy harvested/dollar ratio compared to conventional thermoelectrics that mainly rely on heavy elements.”
The academics presented their findings in “Upcycling Silicon Photovoltaic Waste into Thermoelectrics,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials. The research group includes scientists from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.
“At this point, it is difficult to estimate the cost of our recycling technology as it depends on many external factors such as scale, supply, labor, technology, and so on,” Suwardi said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/23/new-australian-prime-minister-vows-to-turn-nation-into-renewables-superpower/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 23, 2022",New Australian prime minister vows to turn nation into renewables ‘superpower’,"From pv magazine Australia
Australian Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese, who will be sworn this week as Australia’s 31st prime minister, has vowed to “end the climate wars” in the country and boost the share of renewables in the National Electricity Market (NEM), as part of the party’s pledge to combat global warming.
With nearly 71% of the vote counted on Sunday night, the Australian Electoral Commission had Labor ahead in 75 seats, just one short of the 76 needed to secure a majority in the 151-member lower house of parliament. The counting of postal and pre-poll votes over the coming days will determine the final numbers, but Labor appears likely to form a slim majority government, providing an opportunity for the party to turn its climate policy platform into reality.
Albanese used his victory speech in Sydney on Saturday night to reinforce Labor’s commitment to a renewable energy future, saying he would lead a government “worthy of the people of Australia …  but we can have an even better future if we seize the opportunities that are right there in front of us. The opportunity to shape change, rather than be shaped by it. Together we can end the climate wars. Together we can take advantage of the opportunity for Australia to be a renewable energy superpower.”
Federal Labor has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 43% by 2030 based on 2005 emissions levels, boost renewables, boost demand for electric vehicles (EVs) through tax breaks and help build community-owned solar power and battery projects. Labor’s Powering Australia Plan would see renewable capacity grow to 26GW, or 82% of all NEM generation by 2030. The plan also assumes that EVs will make up 89% of new car sales in Australia by the end of the decade.
Labor’s approach centers on a AUD 20 billion ($14.2 billion) government intervention to fast-track upgrades to the national electricity grid to accommodate the influx of renewable energy. The policy is designed to bring forward the construction of high-voltage infrastructure by lowering financial and planning barriers to unlock the commercial development of large-scale renewable energy resources.
The party’s Powering Australia Plan also includes AUD 200 million to install 400 community batteries, AUD 100 million for the development of shared “solar banks,” and a commitment to reduce the emissions of the Australian Public Service to net-zero by 2030. It also intends to tighten the country’s emissions “safeguard mechanism,” to gradually tighten limits on pollution by the biggest industrial emitters. That mechanism sets a baseline of allowable emissions for the 215 big mining, energy and materials companies that emit more than 100,000 tonnes a year of carbon dioxide equivalent.
The party’s federal election victory has been welcomed by many, including mining billionaire Andrew Forrest. Forrest, who made his billions in the iron ore industry but is now betting big on renewable energy, said the election result shows “the majority of Australians are unhappy with Australia’s approach to climate change.”
That viewpoint was shared by Atlassian co-founder and climate activist Mike Cannon-Brookes, who is attempting to block the demerger of AGL Energy. “After bushfires and bullshit, floods and fables … comes hope,” he tweeted.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/23/ireland-allocates-1-53-gw-of-pv-in-second-renewables-auction/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,IRELAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 23, 2022",Ireland allocates 1.53 GW of PV in second renewables auction,"Irish grid operator EirGrid has announced the provisional results of the country's second renewable energy auction, which was launched in late April.
The company allocated 1,948.2 MW of renewable energy capacity in the auction, including 1,534.1 MW of solar and 414.1 MW of wind power capacity. The final average price came in at €0.09787/kWh.
Overall, EirGrid selected 80 of the 130 projects that were submitted to compete in the auction. The projects range in size from 0.5 MW to 104.4 MW and are mostly located in central and southern Ireland. Project developers secure feed-in premiums to top up the wholesale power price for up to 16.5 years, depending on project delivery dates.
“The provisional results have been issued to the Minister for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) for consideration,” the grid operator said. “If approved by the minister and government, the final auction results will be issued on June 15.”
The success of solar over wind power can be explained by the fact that the auction did not include, as in the first auction, a standalone preference category for PV. This allowed solar projects to compete on a like-for-like basis with other solar projects, rather than competing with wind, which is a well-established industry in Ireland. The ministry said this choice was due to the low competitive costs seen for solar in the first auction.
In the first renewables auction, the Irish authorities allocated 796 MW of generating capacity. The average weighted bid price for the technology-neutral auction was €0.07408/kWh.
*The article was updated on May 23 to amend the dollar value of the auction's final average price.

As solar costs have dropped, it now makes economic sense to implement them even in the deep north, yet there is concern about the effects of snow on energy generation. While solar panels operate best in colder temperatures, panels covered in snow will generate less energy, known as snow loss.  A study conducted at Western University in Ontario, Canada, shows how to beat snow losses using solar energy systems.
The difference between bifacial and monofacial modules is that bifacial modules absorb light from the front and back, while monofacial only collect sunlight on the front. The study analyzed snow losses on these two types of systems using hourly data including energy, solar irradiation and albedo, the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation.
The researchers found by using bifacial solar modules instead of trading monofacial, snow losses could be cut from double digits to just 2% on an annual basis. The bifacial solar installation had a 19% gain largely from the reflection of the snow compared to the traditional monofacial systems.
The study was conducted at a pair of solar arrays that used both monofacial and bifacial modules, and data was generated in both summer and winter to determine snow loss. A camera was aimed at each of the arrays to track snow cover. A total of 4,826 images were analyzed for each module from November 2020 to March 2021.  Each day 32 images were taken at 15-minute intervals. The researchers used image processing to identify and quantify the snow cover on each module automatically.
The researchers used this information to figure out what the impact of snow was on both arrays when we coupled it with the pyranometer data and energy values coming off the modules, according to Joshua Pearce, lead researcher and John M. Thompson Chair in Information Technology and Innovation at Western University’s Thompson Centre for Engineering Leadership and Innovation.
The two major results of this study are that 1) bifacial essentially crush snow losses because they help clear modules much faster than traditional modules, and  2) bifacial modules get a major bump in the winter from snow albedo. The results found monofacial snow losses are in average 33% for winter period, and 16% on an annual basis.
Bifacial systems perform better than monofacial in severe winter conditions as average winter snow losses was 16% and the annual losses were 2% in the worst-case scenario. In addition, there was a bifacial gain of 19% compared to monofacial system during winter.
“Preliminary results suggested bifacial systems performed better, but this study has put the nail in the coffin for monofacial systems in the northern United States and Canada. It is clear all northern solar farms should be using bifacial PV,” said Pearce.
The paper was published in Renewable Energy. It comes with free software so anyone can replicate the experiment or do other type of snow-PV study using a single camera monitoring of their own.
A previous study, conducted two  years ago at Sandia National Labs, looked at bifacial modules and trackers and found that bifacial modules overall produced 14% more energy than monofacial modules, in addition to the estimated 35% to 40% boost provided by dual-axis trackers.

The companies said the feasibility study showed the project's ability to procure energy for two visiting cruise ships at times of low demand. Due to the relatively low density of each battery cell, projects with a scale of up to 50 MW/600 MWh could be built with this storage technology.
“The battery consists of 11 strings of battery modules with 13 modules in each string producing a DC voltage of 690 V,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The total energy capacity is 6.1 MWH and it has an output power of 650 kW.”
The battery is expected to be charged using a shore connection a 50 Hz 415 V three-phase supply and to rely on an output transformer allowing it to discharge to vessels at 60 Hz and 440 V.
“We compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for this battery against lithium-ion and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) at four-hour, eight-hour and 16-hour durations. The LCOE for this eight-hour demonstration battery will be equivalent to a lithium battery, but the LCOE for a 16-hour battery will be 25% cheaper,” the spokesperson said, noting that it expects this technology to outperform lithium ion at all durations above four hours by 2030. “The LCOE of this battery will outperform conventional VRFB at all durations.”
UK-based Swanbarton is developing the organic redox flow battery, while German battery manufacturer CMBlu will supply the electro-chemistry for the batteries. The system will be based on high-performance organic energy storage molecules.The material used, lignin, can be sourced as a by-product from pulp mills. It is filled into two separate tanks and combined for a biochemical reaction in a special unit. The material is organic, non-flammable, non-explosive, and can live through more than 10,000 charging cycles. The flow battery system has a multi-cell stack design and is only really suitable for stationary storage applications, but it is easily scalable to the gigawatt level.
