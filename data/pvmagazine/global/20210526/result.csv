Roberto Murgioni, Head of Technical Service & Product Management, JinkoSolar Europe: Global distributed generation (DG) market demands will increase rapidly with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.81% between 2020 and 2024. The Tiger Pro 54 HC solar module is a high-end solution for residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) PV rooftop owners. For the residential market, the investment is relatively small and return on investment can be already visible with lower balance of system (BOS) costs or state subsidies. For C&I projects, higher energy conservation and emission reductions, which ultimately drive lower levelized costs of electricity, are among the key benefits. From an aesthetics perspective, the 54 cells all black versions also make it much more attractive to install on rooftops and to meet architectural requirements, as well as customers’ needs.
In this pv magazine Spotlight, Roberto Murgioni, Head of Technical Service & Product Management at JinkoSolar Europe shared his experience researching and developing the Tiger Pro 415W module. As one of the module’s “creators”, he highlighted the technical and design aspects of this innovative roof-top module. Watch the Spotlight for free 
The Tiger pro 54 HC provides a significant enhancement of our 10BB and TR technology and offers customers a highly competitive performance-to-cost advantage product. The solar module can generate a more than 2% BOS cost reduction. The cost benefit can also be seen in easier transportation and faster installation processes. Moreover, the developed combination in design and efficiency reduces the payback time of residential/commercial PV plants from 12 to nine months.
Gallium-doping technology has been used in the Tiger Pro 54 HC solar module series to avoid the degradation associated with the boron oxygen complexes, so that the quality assurance was updated. The standard quality assurance for our monofacial modules is 2%/0.55% degradation, and for bifacial modules, 2%/0.45%. Our product warranty has been also updated and improved to 15 years.
The module length is around 1.7 m, the width around 1.1 m, and the weight is 22 kg, making it both portable and convenient for safe installation. The Tiger Pro 54 frame design has been also optimized by increasing the internal cavity to distribute the mechanical stress uniformly. This makes the module compatible with the most standard mounting systems including short side clamping.
The background behind this choice is the result of a distribution market analysis we carried out in 2020. We conducted specific surveys around the EU by contacting our main distributors and installers to better understand their needs. This product targets the distribution market, especially the PV rooftop segment. Listening to customers and considering the safety handling of the modules on rooftops, we redesigned the module size around the human dimensions. With 54 solar cells we are able to provide an optimal balance between size, power, and efficiency.
Yes, by using M10 cells instead of the M6 standard we can decrease the solar cell gaps and increase the module efficiency. In conclusion, a higher power output and more energy yield are guaranteed by using less surface.
We use 182 mm high-efficiency solar cells and normal HC- technology. The advantage of the mix of these technologies is that they are state of the art, mature, and highly reliable.
We developed circular ribbon technology and applied it to our PV module portfolio. This type of ribbon improves the light utilization rate inside of the solar cells. The two main advantages are: (i) Improved total reflection of oblique light; and (ii) Improved absorption of the reflected light.

The International Finance Corp (IFC) private-sector arm of the World Bank, which helped design the tender, has announced Masdar will supply solar electricity for $0.01791/kWh from a solar farm in Samarkand, and for $0.01823/kWh in Jizzakh.
pv magazine, reporting on the launch of the tender, stated the Samarkand project would be installed in the Kattakurgan district and that the Jizzakh facility was “expected to be” developed in Gallaorol.
The May edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The project wins represent the latest successes for Masdar in Uzbekistan after the developer – which is part of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company – last week secured the tender to supply power from a 200 MW project in Sherabad, Surkhandarya, which is expected to have an eventual generation capacity of 457 MW.
While that Sherabad award was secured through a 1 GW program run with the backing of the Asian Development Bank, Masdar also landed the contract for a 100 MW solar park in Navoi in December which will be financed with the help of a $60 million IFC loan.
The latest, 400 MW contract win – which was announced by the IFC on Thursday, just a day after pv magazine reported the Sherabad award to Masdar – is part of the Scaling Solar program run by the World Bank which aims to drive 900 MW of solar capacity in Uzbekistan, to help the country towards its recently raised target of installing 5 GW of solar this decade.
The latest contract award, which will secure payments to Masdar under a 25-year power purchase agreement, was described by the IFC as a public-private partnership despite the state-owned nature of the winning bidder.
The Scaling Solar program in Uzbekistan is being run with the backing of the German and Swiss governments.

Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, and the Austrian Institute of Technology, have developed a PV system solution for motorways.
The demonstrator consists of a PV system with a 10x17m roof area that has to be installed on a steel structure about 5.5m above the road. Construction on the pilot project is expected to begin next autumn and its operations will be then monitored for about a year. Based on the experience gained, further pilot applications may be implemented.
The project is part of the joint road construction research carried out by Germany, Austria and Switzerland. “With the research project, we want to develop the potential of the highways for the generation of renewable energies,” explained Steffen Bilger, German state secretary at the Federal Ministry of Transport. He emphasized that the roofing of a motorway is a particular technical challenge because of the fast-moving traffic underneath. “But the vision of using an area that has already been sealed off, for the generation of the energy that is needed underneath by electric vehicles, has to be pursued,” said Bilger.
The German Federal Ministry of Transport pointed out that building PV systems over roads is significantly more expensive than rooftop PV or ground-mounted solar plants. In the event of an accident on the road underneath, the supporting structure must be protected against a possible vehicle impact so that it does not collapse. To make matters worse, from a length of 80 meters, such supporting structures would have to be classified as similar to tunnels and the structure would then have to meet even higher safety requirements.
Although the modular construction of the demonstrator has some cost advantages, widespread use of solar roofs over motorways is not to be expected in the medium term, according to the ministry. In comparison, there is still a large potential for areas on which renewable energy can be generated less expensively. But for special, locally limited areas of application, the experts see possible uses for a solar roof over motorways.

The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency has invited applications for incentives from solar manufacturers prepared to set up high-efficiency module factories under an INR4500 crore ($618 million) production-linked incentive scheme.
Manufacturers setting up any solar technology-based production facilities will be eligible for assistance, provided they commit to develop facilities which manufacture at least solar cells and modules; meet a minimum level of production capacity; and adhere to minimum standards for solar module performance. The latter requirement sets standards for module efficiency and level of temperature coefficient of Pmax – which concerns the amount of power generation lost for every degree Celsius a panel is above 25 degrees Celsius.
Applicants bidding for incentives must indicate the annual scale of compensation they expect, based on the number of rupees they will accept per Watt of product manufactured and how many megawatts of products they expect to sell each year. They will also have to list any local value addition and any tapering factor to the incentives they are applying for.
Beneficiaries of the separate manufacturing-linked solar plant tender conducted by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, or the Special Incentive Package Scheme run by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, cannot also apply for support from the production-linked incentive program.
Applicants must also meet minimum requirements related to the size of their business or the volume of equity investment they can commit to each gigawatt of planned production capacity, with the value varying depending on how many layers of the solar production chain their facilities will perform. Those requirements are as follows:

India aims to install 175 GW of renewable energy generation capacity by next year, and 450 GW this decade. Based on techno-economic analysis, the country's Central Electricity Authority has projected an optimal clean power generation mix will require the nation to add 280 GW of solar capacity by 2029-30. That would mean around 25 GW of solar would need to be added annually. 
The government wants to ramp up Indian PV module manufacturing to support such growth. With the country currently hosting only 9-10 GW of solar module annual production capacity, and around 2.5 GW of cell fabrication facilities, India's solar industry is heavily reliant on imported cells and modules.

The three-phase device is available as a Tauro and Tauro ECO and has a power output ranging from 50 to 100 kW. It measures 755 x 1,109 x 346 mm for all four variants of the new product. The 50 kW product weighs 92 kg while the 99 kW and 100 kW versions weigh 103 kg. 
The efficiency of the 50 kW device is 98.6% and that of the 100 kW product is 98.5%. The European efficiency for the two inverters is 98.1% and 98.2%, respectively.
The 50 kW Tauro device comes with three maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs while its DC input voltage range is 200-1000 V. Its maximum input current (DC) spans from 134 A to 175 A and the maximum short circuit current from 72A to 125 A. “The Tauro ECO has one MPP tracker, is optimized for cost and efficiency and is available in the 50, 99 and 100 kW power categories,” the manufacturer specified.
The new product is equipped with IP65 protection, active cooling technology, a double wall system and can be used with temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 65 degrees Celsius.
“A reduction in the BOS costs, which can account for roughly a third of the investment costs (CAPEX), make the Tauro unbeatable,” Fronius explained. “The innovative AC Daisy Chaining option allows the installer to link the AC cables of a number of Tauro inverters together directly in the device.”
The inverter's housing offers enough room in the AC connection area for third-party components, according to the company. “No external box or similar is required, thus saving on costs. V-type terminals and a mounting bracket ensure extremely easy handling, saving more money as fewer additional components such as cable lugs are required.”
The Fronius Tauro Eco inverter will be available starting from June and the Tauro device from September.

Presented in the paper “Holographic low concentration optical system increasing light collection efficiency of regular solar panels”, published in the Journal of Photonics for Energy (JPE), the collector is built with a low-cost holographic optical element (HOE) and a diffuser and can be easily embedded into conventional PV modules, according to its creators.
In this system design, the optical element is placed symmetrically at the center of the solar panel in order to increase the length of the effective light collection region. “The left half of the HOE diffracts light to a PV cell on the left side of the inactive module surface area (IMSA), and the right half of the HOE diffracts light to a cell on the right,” the academics explained, adding that each hologram in the proposed system is able to separate the colors of sunlight and direct them to the solar cells within the solar panel.
According to the researchers, this system configuration allows the light diffracted from the collector to exceed the critical angle of the module’s glass cover, which in turn extends the distance over which light can be collected and transferred to the solar cells. The diffuser scatters the light that is not diffracted by the HOE.
The light collector was tested in PV systems with dual-axis and single-axis tracking, as well as in a fixed non-tracking array. Multiple interactions of light scattered by the diffuser and diffracted by the hologram into the PV cell surface were also considered in the simulation. The thickness of the cover glass was assumed to be 3.2 mm. The US group also specified that the IMSA distribution was assumed to be uniform for simplification purposes, although it is not uniformly distributed in conventional solar panels.
“The corresponding improvements to the annual energy yield for a system with modules that have an IMSA of 8.25% are, respectively, 4.5%, 4.1%, and 3.8% with direct illumination,” the scientists stated. “With direct and diffuse solar illumination, the corresponding annual energy yield improvements are, respectively, 4.3%, 4.0%, and 3.6%.”
A cost assessment for the integration of the technology into commercial solar products was not provided.
Looking forward, the scientists intend to test the collector in materials with optimized thickness and refractive index modulation profiles, such as dichromated gelatin.
In another recent research project, Russian scientists developed a holographic film based on prismatic concentrators that is able to reduce the operating temperature of solar panels, including thermal-photovoltaic devices.

Rainer Sedlmaier from Nauheim near Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was concerned that his son's rooftop PV system could have been damaged by the presence of pigeons, which sometimes can make their nests right under the modules.
Sedlmaier did not observe any issues with pigeons in his own photovoltaic system or that of his neighbors, as the inclination of the roofs was between 35% and 45%. In the case of his son, however, the roof inclination was only 20%, which means pigeons will have no problems nesting there.
To prevent pigeons from reaching the array, Sedlmaier applied rotating brushes with a diameter of 12 cm to the PV system frames and this solution, according to him, make the pigeons reluctant to approach the installation.
He calculated that for an average rooftop PV system, these brushes may cost a total of between €100 and €200 and recommended installing the brushes when a project is being built, as a retrofit may be more complex.
Brooding pigeons under the modules are particularly problematic because they can contaminate the systems with their aggressive droppings. Once they have nested there, they will be happy to come back, as these birds are loyal to their area. And they come back often because they breed several times a year.

According to a press release issued by the municipality,
The municipality said in a press release that it had received around 73 notifications from concerned residents in the surrounding area who were alarmed by the presence of PV module fragments on their properties.
“Thin, sharp parts of solar panels, which were on the roof of the warehouse, were released during the fire,” the town's authorities stated. “These particles have spread in an area of several kilometers around Noardburgum.”
They further explained that the sharp fragments pose a potential hazard, particularly to livestock. “We, therefore, advise livestock farmers to bring their livestock indoors. You can throw the particles away in the container yourself,” they added. “Grass contaminated with particles from solar panels is not suitable as feed for livestock.”
Residents have also formed initiatives to help clean up solar panel particles from farmland, the municipality said. “We understand that people want to help and we appreciate that but we ask everyone not to go into the fields to clean them up,” it stated, adding that farmers should rely on authorized companies for the removal of the fragments.
According to Urs Muntwyler, an expert on fire incidents in PV installations and CEO of Swiss engineering company Ingenieurbüro Muntwyler, the particles found by the residents, which are also seen in a picture published in the municipality press statement, are similar to those that he found after a fire occurred at a PV system located in Lanzenhäusern, Switzerland. “There are silicon particles,” he told pv magazine. ” I investigated them in a Raster-Elektronic-Microscope and I have ascertained this is mainly silicon, while the rest, such as the lead from the string, has evaporated.”
At the time, Muntwyler took the particles for examination to Samuel Kohler, a professor of veterinary medicine at the Bern University of Applied Sciences' School of Agricultural, Forest and Food Science in Zollikofen, Switzerland. Cows, which always take big chunks of grass in their mouths, could eat the particles with no problem, according to Kohler. “Other animals such as horses and sheep wouldn't even take these particles as they select everything they eat,” Muntwyler further explained, adding that the fragments found in the Netherlands may not be dangerous either, provided they come from crystalline silicon modules.
The fire incident was shown in a video published on the YouTube channel of local media outlet Noorden Nieuws.

Enel is testing it for applications on large solar plants,"Italian renewable energy company Enel Green Power, a unit of national utility Enel, is partnering with Italian research agency ENEA in the development of what it described as an innovative technology that combines photovoltaic electricity production with microalgae cultivation.
“The PV plant will be a ground-mounted PV facility, which is the conventional layout for utility-scale systems, and the integration with the microalgae plant is designed so as to not change the layout of the PV plant,” Nicola Rossi, head of innovation at Enel Green Power, told pv magazine. “Microalgae cultivation will be carried out in a dedicated system.”  
The integration scheme is aimed at minimizing interferences with the PV plant and maximizing the benefits in microalgae yield. “Currently, we do not expect variations in PV plant layout and related support structures, in line with our agrivoltaic approach, which aims to adapt agriculture to the existing PV layout in order avoid increasing electricity generation costs,” he explained.
The pilot project is being deployed at the Enea-Portici experimental area, near Naples, as the aim of the test is to evaluate the interferences between solar energy generation and microalgae yield. “The PV size will be about 7 kW, and tests will be carried out with mono and bifacial panels,” Rossi specified.
As for the kind of algae that will be cultivated at the facility, he added that these will be high-value products, such as Acutodesmus obliquus and Nannochloropsis gaditana, both of which have a commercial value of around €150/kg or Haematococcus pluvialis, whose commercial value may reach up to €205/kg.
“With this agreement we are launching a new possible synergy for the shared use of the land that we have identified with our ‘algovoltaic' brand and this is an ideal opportunity for the agrivoltaic sector, in which we are investing significant resources to implement the guidelines in Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan,” said Ezio Terzini, head of the Photovoltaic and Smart Devices Division at ENEA's Renewable Energy Technologies Department.
A scalability analysis will be carried out for applications on large photovoltaic plants, Enel Green Power said in a statement released last week.

The storage system is based on a low-cost organic compound known as fluorenone (C13H8O), which is largely used as a precursor to synthesize a variety of organic electronic materials and is bright fluorescent yellow in color. “Alternative materials for flow batteries include organic molecules, which are far more available, more environmentally friendly and less expensive than vanadium,” the US group stated. “But organics haven’t held up well to the demands of flow-battery technology, usually petering out faster than required.”
In order to prevent fast degradation, the fluorenone compound was transformed into a redox reversible, water-soluble compound. Prior to this technical improvement, fluorenone molecules were not water-soluble enough and could not provide redox reversibility in aqueous solutions. The solubility of the compound is crucial in redox flow batteries and the academics claimed to have been able to increase that of fluorenone in water from almost 0 with pristine fluorenone up to 1.5 moles per liter.

The research team found that the ability of fluorenone to carry out reversible reactions is dependent on its concentration. “This is a great demonstration of using molecular engineering to change a material from one widely considered impossible for use into something useful for energy storage,” said research co-author Wei Wang. “This opens up important new chemical space that we can explore.”
The battery has a size of 10 cm2 and a power output of 500 milliwatts. Despite its small dimensions, its energy density is more than twice that of the vanadium batteries in use today, the scientists claim. “In laboratory testing that mimicked real-world conditions, the PNNL battery operated continuously for 120 days, ending only when other equipment unrelated to the battery itself wore out,” they further explained. “The battery went through 1,111 full cycles of charging and discharging — the equivalent of several years of operation under normal circumstances — and lost less than 3 percent of its energy capacity.”
The battery was presented in the paper “Reversible ketone hydrogenation and dehydrogenation for aqueous organic redox flow batteries”, published in Science.

Electricity distributor Endeavour Energy and smart metering company Intellihub have partnered with ten energy retailers to launch the Off Peak Plus program now in operation on the state’s south coast.
The program, which so far includes 2,500 homes across Albion Park, essentially allows installed smart meters to dynamically control homes’ hot water systems, meaning they can be switched on during the day when there is cheap surplus energy in the grid.
In other words, the program makes the hot water system work much like a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) or energy storage system, but doesn’t have the additional hardware and software requirements. This is helpful not only for customers, who get their water heated at the most cost-effective rate, but it also means this surplus can be soaked up without any additional infrastructure.
While the program focuses on electric hot water systems, it could also be applicable for electric vehicle charging, batteries or other forms of load control or demand response services.
The program has attracted the attention of state energy minister, Matt Kean, who was at the launch yesterday. “Nowhere else in Australia are we seeing this level of collaboration and innovation within the electricity sector to produce community wide benefits,” Minister Kean said.
“This state-of-the-art program has found a way to manage peak energy demand, helping to future proof the grid with even more home solar systems.”
 “The smart meters will also detect safety issues with a customer’s installation, and help detect network issues and outages, particularly during storms and incidents.”      
The program is managed by Intellihub, an Australian metering provider specializing in products that enhance grid visibility and data insight.
“It’s an innovative project, not just because of the technology, but how it’s being used to benefit customers, the environment and industry all at once,” Intellihub CEO Adrian Clark said.
The value the program adds to Endeavour Energy, one of Australia’s largest electricity distributors, is that it allows the company to better manage its increasing penetrations of renewables through access to data from the low voltage network via a smart meter.
“Endeavour Energy initiated this program to solve the problem of replacing and upsizing a 50 year old, off-peak control system in its nearby substation,” Endeavour Energy’s CEO Guy Chalkley said.
“By using advanced smart meters, instead of investing in expensive old technology at the substation, Endeavour Energy can save real dollars and cents for our customers by finding ways to help them capture more affordable solar energy.
“We’ll also be able to access energy and power quality data through the smart meter to help us better respond to issues and outages, particularly during storms, giving customers even safer and more reliable energy.”
The plan is to continue rolling the program out of the NSW south coast and parts of Western Sydney.

A homeowner or a business that installs solar power in the United States currently is eligible for an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax credit, which offsets 26% of the cost of a solar power project.
There are two versions of this credit: the Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit for private persons, and the Investment Tax Credit for business.
Residential solar purchasers should follow IRS guidance here, and fill out IRS Form 5695 when submitting annual taxes. Commercial entities will follow this guidance and complete IRS Form 3468.
Now, pv magazine USA is not a tax advisor, so seek professional advice before filling out these forms. The tax implications of solar construction should be part of a well-vetted solar contractor’s field of expertise, but here, too, solar contractors aren’t tax specialists, either.

With those caveats in mind, here are a few of the important aspects of the current version of the federal tax credit.
First, in order to take advantage of a federal tax credit, there must be a federal tax liability to apply the credit against.
There are many reasons that taxes might not be owed in any one year. Perhaps there were a lot of write-offs (more kids), or maybe you are retired and living on nontaxable income. If you don’t have a tax liability, then you can probably stop reading this article right here.
Residential solar power projects cost roughly $3.00 per watt, with a national average size of around 7,000 watts. That gives us an average project price of $21,000. The 26% tax credit in this scenario would provide a $5,460 credit to apply against what’s owed to Uncle Sam.
As you can see, it is very important to look closely at your tax liability to understand how this credit may fit into your finances.
Second, you’ll only get cash back if the taxes you already paid for the year are greater than what you owe.
For example, let’s say you paid $5,460 in federal income taxes over the course of the year. As noted above, a $21,000 solar power project would offer that exact value of tax credit. After verifying that your solar tax credit is worth $5,460 via the tax forms above, you’ll get back exactly that amount after filing your taxes.
However, if you happen to have paid $2,730 this year in federal income tax, and another $2,730 next year – you’ll get $2,730 back each year. The 2020 IRS form above allows taxpayers to carry unused portions of the tax credit into their 2021 return.
Third, the tax credit will fall from 26% to 22% in 2023. After 2023, the residential tax credit ends. For business customers, it continues indefinitely at 10%.
Next, battery systems charged by the solar power system are included in this solar tax credit. Whether batteries make pure financial sense is a different calculation entirely.
One final thought: solar tax credits are not set in stone. Incentives scheduled to vanish at the end of 2023 may soon renew. There’s even a chance that the incentives could increase.
In March, three senators introduced a bill that would temporarily allow businesses to get the tax credit back as cash, regardless of whether they owe the IRS. In May, a second piece of legislation was submitted which would make the cash payback permanent, not only for businesses but also for individuals.
The Biden Jobs Plan would increase the tax credit to 30%, both expanding the credit to those with little or no tax liability, and extending the credit for 10 more years.
If and when the laws do change, pv magazine USA will cover the news, and this author will update our Solar 101 series.
