Universal Hydrogen said it would spend one to two years planning and constructing its New Mexico facilities. It aims to commence full-scale manufacturing by 2024. It anticipates investing more than $254 million into New Mexico.
Norwegian renewables developer Scatec has signed a memorandum of understanding with the General Authority for Suez Canal Economic Zone and another three authorities, to jointly develop a green ammonia facility in Egypt with an annual production capacity of one million tons. Scatec said the facility could expand to three million tonnes per year. The green hydrogen and ammonia facility at the Ain Sokhna Industrial Zone, is the first large scale project for the production of green ammonia in the country. “Scatec intends to implement the project in phases based on Scatec's integrated business model,” the company wrote last week. “Long term offtake agreements will be secured to enable non-recourse project financing for the green ammonia. The green ammonia will mainly be exported to European and Asian markets, where demand for clean ammonia is increasing rapidly.” Scatec this month announced it had joined a large scale green ammonia plant planned in Oman by Indian peer Acme Group.
Abundant fuel cell raw materials and renewables potential could add up to a green hydrogen economy in the Philippines, according to Jose Mari Angelo Abeleda Jr and Richard Espiritu, two professors at the University of the Philippines Diliman. In a paper published in this month's Energy Policy, they explained the country is a latecomer to the sector and should develop basic and applied knowledge for training and research. The country should also establish stronger links between industry and academia, the report's authors suggested. “The establishment of the Philippine Energy Research and Policy Institute (Perpi) is a move towards the right direction as it will be instrumental in crafting policies and pushing for activities that will usher for more private-academ[ic] partnerships for the development of fuel cell technology in the Philippines,” the scholars wrote. “However, through enabling legislation, a separate and dedicated Hydrogen Research and Development Center (HRDC) will be pivotal in ensuring that sufficient government and private funding are provided.” The authors reported progress in the production of fuel cell membranes but few developments towards large scale production, transport, and storage facilities. “The consolidation of existing renewable energy sources for hydrogen production can also be explored in order to ensure reliable and sustainable hydrogen fuel supply,” they wrote. “This is because the country will gain more benefit if it focuses more on the application of fuel cell technology on rural electrification via renewa[ble] energy-based distributed power generation, rather than on transportation such as fuel cell vehicles.”
Paris-based energy engineering company Technip Energies and Indian energy business Greenko ZeroC Private have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to explore green hydrogen project development opportunities in the refining, petrochemicals, fertilizer, chemical, and power plant sectors in India. “The MOU aims to facilitate active engagement between the teams of Technip Energies in India and Greenko to step up collaborative opportunities on a build-own-operate (BOO) model – in which Greenko will be the BOO operator and owner of the asset and Technip Energies will support with engineering services, integration and EP/EPC [engineering and procurement/engineering, procurement and constructrion] – for pilot and commercial scale green hydrogen and related projects in India in order to offer economically feasible technology solutions to clients,” the French company wrote today.
Aberdeen City Council and British energy company BP have signed an agreement to form the Aberdeen Hydrogen Energy joint venture for a three-phase project to deliver a scalable green hydrogen production, storage, and distribution facility in the city powered by renewables. “Phase one, which involves delivery of a green hydrogen production and transport refueling facility powered by a solar farm, is targeting first production from 2024, delivering over 800kg of green hydrogen per day – enough to fuel 25 buses and a similar number of other fleet vehicles,” BP said last week, adding the joint venture should invest £3 million ($3.9 million) for initial design work. The final investment decision for the phase one facility is expected in early 2023. Meanwhile, the British government will hold a networking event March 24 for prospective applicants to explore partnerships within the framework of the proposed Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator Programme, which would provide funding for innovation projects that can demonstrate end-to-end industrial fuel switching to hydrogen.
Growing Mid Wales, a regional public-private sector partnership body, has commissioned consultant Radical Innovations Group to undertake a feasibility study to explore the area's hydrogen potential. The decision was supported by local projects, action groups, and county councils. “Mid Wales' abundance of natural resources, expertise and environment means we are well placed to play a leading role in the transition to net zero as part of a whole-Wales approach,” said Ellen ap Gwynn, leader of Ceredigion County Council.
A hydrogen refueling station has been inaugurated in Rotterdam as part of the Mehrlin project, funded by EU body the Connecting Europe Facility for Transport. “This project aims to demonstrate a new demand-led commercial model for the deployment of hydrogen refueling stations by carrying out a test of the economies and practicalities of operating large hydrogen refueling stations,” wrote the European Commission on Friday, adding the project has deployed seven large hydrogen refueling stations, at Hürth, Wermelskirchen-Koln, and Wuppertal, in Germany; Bolzano, in Italy; Rotterdam; and in London and Birmingham in the UK. “Daily operations are currently being monitored to gather technical and economic feedback to improve operations and financing options in light of a further roll-out across Europe of zero emission buses,” added the statement from the EU executive.

German solar module manufacturer Solarwatt if offering its customers in Germany the possibility of buying CO2 certificates together with its glass-glass modules.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

“In addition to the desire for lower electricity prices and more independence, buyers of a PV system are often also interested in reducing their own CO2 emissions and protecting the climate,” the company said in a statement. “We now offer our customers solar modules that are immediately CO2 neutral with no payback period,” says Solarwatt CEO Detlef Neuhaus. According to him, the Dresden-based company is the first photovoltaic manufacturer in the world to offer this CO2 compensation for its solar modules.
The proceeds from the certificates will go to unspecified climate protection projects around the world.
“The additional costs for the CO2 certificates are €10 and €11, depending on the product,” a Solarwatt spokesperson told pv magazine.
The manufacturer has determined the actual emissions during production in an elaborate procedure but didn't indicated the specific value of the emissions of its glass modules, due to the lack of standards.
Customers can purchase CO2 certificates directly from installation partners when purchasing the solar modules, with the paperwork coming exclusively from the Gold Standard non-profit certification organization.
According to Germany's Federal Environment Agency, only projects that “demonstrably lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases and at the same time are good for the local environment and the social concerns of the community” are eligible for certification. Solarwatt CEO Neuhaus sees the new offering as “one more piece of the puzzle in the effort to be completely sustainable.”
At its production site in Dresden, Solarwatt already uses 100% green electricity.

A strongly worded statement issued by the Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy (UARE) on Thursday added, 35% of the country's roof and facade-mounted solar capacity was also installed in region's with hostilities taking place, with another 19% of such systems nearby.
The UARE reported “registered cases of destruction” of solar panels and claimed Russian forces “steal all the equipment from the stations, everything that can be stolen and taken away.”
With the trade body stating troops had also destroyed electricity transmission lines since Russia invaded 20 days ago, the association said 6.37GW of the country's 9.5GW of clean power generation capacity – including wind farms and biomass, biogas, and small hydro facilities – is either in or next to regions affected by the fighting.
That translates into $9.2 billion worth of the $12 billion the UARE estimated has been invested into Ukrainian clean power facilities in the last decade.
The trade body added: “Given the cost of capital investment; the cost of restoring generation capacity, transmission lines [and] equipment; compensation for health and [the] lives of renewable energy workers in Ukraine, [the] Ukrainian renewable energy sector will demand compensation from Russian invaders in international courts.”

The expansion plan approved by the board of TBEA today envisages the construction of a new factory in Changji county, in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. The plan is expected to be implemented in two 100,000-ton-annual-capacity phases and to be completed within 24 months after the start of construction, which is scheduled this year. TBEA said around RMB8.8 billion will come from the initial public offering of Xinte Energy on China's stock market while the remaining amount will come from bank loans. According to TBEA’s calculations, taking into account poly prices of RMB70-100/kg (US$11-16), the new factory should generate annual income of around RMB14-20 billion (US$2.2-3.1 billion).
Module manufacturer Longi yesterday announced it has reached an agreement with the government of Erdos City, Inner Mongolia, for the construction of a new factory. The manufacturing facility will have a capacity of 20GW for ingots and wafers, of 30GW for solar cells, and 5GW for modules. Around RMB7.6 billion (US$1.19 billion) will be invested in ingot and wafer production and RMB10.3 billion (US$1.62 billion) into cell manufacturing. Longi added, RMB1.6 billion (US$252 million) will be invested into module output. The manufacturer said the cell capacity will be achieved within 24 months of the start of construction while capacities for the other three sections will depend on local government support.
Heterojunction (HJT) solar cell production equipment supplier Maxwell Technology said on Sunday its orders last year grew 330% from 2020, to 8.1GW. The company warned, however, HJT cell production costs have recently increased due to factors including higher steel and aluminum prices and a supply bottleneck in the semiconductor market.
Battery company Ganfeng Lithium has reported impressive numbers for 2021 on the back of rising demand for “new energy vehicles” and the energy storage industry. Ganfeng yesterday said raised production and sales volumes and higher selling prices contributed to, unaudited revenue of RMB11.2 billion (US$1.76 billion), up 102% from the 2020 figure. That resulted in a net-profits-attributable-to-shareholders number 405% higher, year on year, at RMB5.17 billion (US$813 million), of which RMB2.81 billion (US$442 million) was not down to exceptional gains such as the change in fair value of business assets such as Australian lithium and tantalite miner Pilbara Minerals Ltd. Ganfeng told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange it had also gained RMB2.45 billion (US$385 million) from a rise in share prices in stock it holds as non-current assets. The first two months of this year had been even better, Ganfeng added minutes later, with revenue of RMB3.6 billion (US$566 million) for net profits for shareholders of RMB1.4 billion (US$220 million), rising to RMB1.8 billion (US$283 million) once non-recurring losses are stripped out.

French agrivoltaics specialist Sun’Agri is developing a pilot project combined with the cultivation of peaches, apricots, and cherries in the Rhone Valley, in the French southern department of Drôme, where these products are traditional crops.
The Rhône Valley, on the other hand, suffered for several years from the increasing effects of climate change, such as high temperatures and droughts in summer, spring frosts, and violent hailstorms, among others. These phenomena threaten the local agricultural ecosystem, forcing producers to find effective and accessible adaptation solutions in the short term.
The aim of the demonstrator is to find solutions to protect crops from climatic hazards, optimize production and agricultural quality, as well as to establish references for technical and economic aspects of arboriculture. “For the first time in our department, the Chamber of Agriculture of the Drome is supporting an experimental project in agrivoltaics in order to obtain scientific references for the arboriculture sector,” said the organization's president, Pierre Royannez. “The objective is to validate whether or not it is possible to reconcile agriculture and energy production without distorting agricultural production.”
The €2.5 million project includes a demonstrator plant and an experimental array for a total area of nearly four hectares.
The first project, with an area of 2.6 hectares, will have a capacity of 1.9MW and will be based on agrivoltaic shades. It will be equipped with anti-hail nets that deploy automatically in the event of a hail storm and will be aimed at growing seven types of apricots, cherries and nectarines.
The experimental array will be deployed on an area of 1,850m² and will be combined with the cultivation of Kinoléa peaches. The Chamber of Agriculture of the Drôme will carry out the agronomic monitoring of the fruit crops protected by the installation. “With this installation in Etoile-sur-Rhône, we will be able to determine very precisely how fruit crops in the region react to climate change and, above all, how our technology can protect them from the various potentially dramatic hazards for farmers,” said Cécile Magherini, deputy CEO of Sun'Agri.
The electricity generated by the agrivoltaic installations will benefit local businesses and communities through a power purchase agreement.

The new product is part of the company's HiKu6 series based on 182mm wafers.
The 54-cell PERC module has a power output of up to 420W and a power conversion efficiency of 21.5%. “The CS6R-MS module is especially suitable for rooftop solar applications given its small module size (1.95 m² ˣ 30 mm), light weight (21.3 kg), and outstanding aesthetic design for homogenous appearance,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The module measures 1722x1134x30mm and its temperature coefficient is 0.34%. It comes with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty.
Canadian Solar said the electrical characteristics of the CS6R-MS panel are compatible with the most common photovoltaic inverters thanks to current values below 14A. According to the product sheet, the short-circuit current of the module ranges from 13.55 to 13.93A and the open-circuit voltage is between 36.0 and 37.0V. The maximum system voltage is 1,500V.
The panel also features an IP68 enclosure rating, 3.2mm tempered glass with anti-reflection technology, and an anodized aluminum frame.
“I am excited to announce that we have started mass production and delivered the first batch of the 54-cell modules of up to 420 W based on 182 mm PERC cells,” said Canadian Solar CEO, Shwan Qu, adding that the company will begin production of new CS6R-MS heterojunction solar modules with an efficiency of up to 22.5% and power output up to 440 W in April.

“The parties have signed a memorandum of understanding and will now commence negotiations towards a power purchase agreement,” SPM said in a statement. “Sturdee Energy will act as a joint developer and independent power producer in these projects.”
The planned capacity is split into a 40MW wind-solar project aimed at powering two separate sites, one in Limpopo and one in the Western Cape; and a 35MW solar park to power operations of the Pilanesberg Platinum Mine, which is situated about 60km northwest of Rustenburg, in South Africa's North West province.
The first of the two projects is scheduled to start commercial operations in 2024 and the second in 2026.
“When President Ramaphosa announced that companies would be able to generate their own renewable power up to 100MW, he unleashed tremendous opportunities which are impacting positively on the environment, on business, and on the economy, while also taking
pressure off the grid,” said Sedibelo chief environmental, social, and governance officer Lael Bethlehem, referring to the South African government's recent decision of raising the threshold for distributed generation to 100 MW.
Through these provisions, renewable energy developers are exempted from applying for a license but they will be required to register with the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa). The measure is aimed to reduce dependence on its state-owned utility, Eskom, for power supply. The troubled utility, which is currently unable to meet the country's power demand due to financial and operational issues, recently began considering renewables for its plant portfolio.

Solar, wind, and clean heat project developer Beijing Enterprises Clean Energy yesterday revealed the major transaction which prompted trading in its shares to be suspended from Monday last week until this morning.
With the renewables developer facing a HK$3 billion (US$383 million) loan repayment in June, an attempt by China Shandong Hi-Speed Financial Group Ltd (CSFG) in November to purchase almost a quarter of the company's stock for HK$1.27 billion (US$162 million) fell through this year due to concerns Beijing Enterprises would not be able to secure sufficient shareholder, investment fund, and financial authority approvals.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
CSFG, which has the Shandong Gaosu Group owned by the government of Shandong province as its controlling shareholder, has instead returned with an offer to purchase 48.8 billion new shares in the clean energy developer for HK$0.096 (US$0.012) per share.
The new stock would be the equivalent of around 77% of the currently issued shares in Beijing Enterprises and would enable CSFG, via its Profit Plan Global Investment Ltd subsidiary, to hold 43% of the enlarged company while generating a net HK$4.68 billion (US$598 million) for the developer.
Beijing Enterprises yesterday told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange it would use some of that windfall to finance 80MW of new, conventional solar park generation capacity; a 100MW agrivoltaic pilot project; a 50MW fishery-PV pilot; and 505MW of other agri and aquaculture-linked photovoltaic generation facilities.
The developer, which has the stock code Be Clean Energy, will have to settle debts of HK$469 million (US$59.9 million) in the second half of the year, on top of the HK$3 billion due to an, unnamed bank. Be Clean said it is still attempting to refinance the larger of those two commitments. If the developer fails in that effort, it will have to devote around 64% of the money from CSFG's shares subscription to settling the debt, plus around 10% of the windfall for those other, second-half commitments.
If Be Clean manages to keep its creditors at bay, it said yesterday, it would instead spend HK$1.82 billion (US$232 million) of the shares cash on debts due after June and HK$1.7 billion (US$217 million) repurchasing stock in its Tianjin Beiqing Electric Smart Energy solar and wind development unit. Be Clean last month walked away from a plan to spin off the Beiqing Smart unit on the Shanghai exchange via a complex asset swap with third party SEC Electric Machinery Co Ltd, which would have become a Beijing Enterprises subsidiary.
The proposed bail-out will need to be approved by independent shareholders in Be Clean, who will also be asked to approve a waiver to the requirement that CSFG also make an offer to buy the rest of the stock in the developer. Independent investors in CSFG will also have to approve the proposed subscription to the Be Clean Energy shares.
Although CSFG would only own 43% of the enlarged Be Clean, in the event of the plan winning approval, it would nominate eight members of a new 12-person board, according to the announcement made yesterday.

The funds were taken from the country's National Recovery Plan in an effort to reduce energy dependence on Russia, the government said in a statement.
A call to select eligible projects will be launched on March 22 and applications may be sent by June 30. Solar-plus-storage projects will also be entitled to participate.
The rebate for a solar installation will not exceed 35% and that for a storage system may not be higher than 50%.
In 2021, the Czech authorities allocated CZK4.5 billion for the rebate scheme. In December, however, the State Environmental Fund of Czechia postponed the deadline to submit applications. ”The deadline for projects up to 1MWp has been extended because, currently, the allocation was not filled, meaning the interest for ground-mounted projects up to 1MWp was lower than the ministry expected,” Jan Krčmář, chairman of the Czech Solar Association, told pv magazine.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Czechia had 2,073MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020, 13MW less than it had at the end of 2019. The nation has also provided incentives for rooftop PV through a Green Savings Program and to solar-plus-storage projects through a separate, dedicated scheme.

The full chlorine device has a membrane-free design and is based on an aqueous electrolyte made of sodium chloride (NaCl) which uses chlorine (Cl2/Cl−) redox couple as the active material for the positive electrode. “The Cl2/Cl− has a theoretical capacity of 755 mAh/g, more than two times that of vanadium oxides (VO2+/VO2+, 226 mAh/g) used in current redox flow batteries,” the researchers explained. “In addition, sodium chloride is one of the cheapest commodities available due to the abundant source in seawater and large-scale production.”
One of the major costs in vanadium redox flow batteries is the ion-permeable membrane used to minimize so-called “crossover.” This phenomenon, which can cause capacity losses that can reach up to 50%, occurs during charging and recharging, when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell and the redoxmers – which are redox-active molecules that can store energy in the batteries' electrolytes – migrate to the wrong side of the device. In the battery configuration proposed by the US-Chinese group, the chlorine is immiscible to the electrolyte, which means that no membrane to prevent crossover is needed, thus further reducing costs.
The Cl2/Cl− redox reaction in the aqueous NaCl electrolyte was evaluated in a concentric cell with a porous carbon coated with ruthenium(IV) oxide and titanium oxide (RuO2-TiO2), which is intended at promoting the oxidation kinetics of chloride. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was also added through the working electrode and the electrolyte. A graphene composite that is known as NaTi2(PO4)3 was used as the negative electrode.
The battery cell was found to have a high voltage efficiency, which the scientists attributed not only to the fast reaction kinetics but also the membrane-free configuration. “At the highest flow rate examined, the voltage efficiency could be postulated to over 93% at 20 mA/cm2,” they emphasized.
The battery showed a round-trip energy efficiency of 91% at 10 mA/cm2 and an energy density of 125.7 Wh/L. The values, according to the academics, represent the best performance for a flow battery system in the past ten 10 years.
The battery was presented in the study High-energy and low-cost membrane-free chlorine flow battery, published in nature communications. “The chlorine flow battery can meet the stringent price and reliability target for stationary energy storage with the inherently low-cost active materials (around $5/kWh) and the highly reversible Cl2/Cl− redox reaction,” the research team concluded.

Milestones may be arbitrary, but the morale boost they provide is not. The world has very recently installed enough solar panels to generate 1TW of electricity directly from the sun.
The expectation that our species would hit 1,000GW of solar was first based on estimations that we installed at least 183 GW in 2021, and that we had 788 GW of capacity in place at the end of 2020. These two values total 971GW of installed solar.
To estimate our capacity at this exact moment, let’s assume that humans will install 210GW in 2022. Today marks the 73rd day of the year, which is exactly 20% of 2022. These numbers suggest that Earth’s solar capacity has breached 1,010GW, and that we can officially start measuring solar capacity in terawatts.
Let’s add two caveats to show the difficulty in obtaining a precise estimate: Overestimation can result from the small percentage of capacity that has been uninstalled, since roofs do sometimes get replaced, and severe weather events do occasionally destroy installations. Additionally, capacity numbers have been regularly underestimated because the installation data that researchers seek is constantly changing, and obtained from a number of manufacturers spread all over the planet.
The largest contributor to this capacity is China, who broke through – and blew past – 100GW in late 2016, or early 2017. The European Union hit 100GW in 2015, just before China. In the United States, the 100GW number was hit in the first quarter of 2021. These three regions represent more than half of the world’s installed solar capacity.
From a generation perspective, 2021 was also a milestone year. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2021, the world generated 26,823 terawatt hours of electricity in 2020. 855 of those terawatt-hours – 3.1% – came from solar. Since solar grew 23% in 2021, it is likely that next year’s BP Statistical Review will show that solar generation broke 1 petawatt hour of generation in 2021.
Going forward, models predict that dozens of terawatts of solar capacity will be needed to decarbonize the earth’s electricity, transportation, heating, and industrial systems.

India’s solar module production capacity will almost double to 36GW in two years, from 18GW as of December 2021. Cell production capacity will rise to 18GW by the end of 2023 from just 4GW at present, according to JMK Research analysts.
The analysts estimated the two-year capacity additions based on the announcements of industry leaders and new entrants exploring the market. The Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for solar PV manufacturing is a major catalyst for the whole Indian solar industry, according to JMK Research analysts.
 
“New entrants in solar manufacturing in India are targeting GW-scale installation capacities as well as upstream integration, in line with what the government of India is trying to achieve with its PLI scheme for solar modules,” said JMK Research. “In the meantime, the relevant industry stakeholders also need to focus on upskilling the workforce, boosting R&D infrastructure, and most crucially, adopting uniform, long-term policies for the Indian solar sector.”

While the capacity has not been revealed, Octopus Australia said it “will be a multibillion project and will deploy various technologies at utility scale.” The project will be designed to replace the capacity that will be lost when EnergyAustralia’s nearby Yallourn coal power station closes in 2028.
Hostplus will invest in the project’s development via an Octopus Australia-managed platform. The superfund has not revealed how much it will invest in the project, but its investment will sit alongside state-owned Clean Energy Finance Corp.’s (CEFC) contribution of up to AUD 8.5 million ($6.1 million).
As pv magazine Australia reported in August, Octopus Australia and CEFC formed a joint venture with what seems to have a particular focus on renewable energy projects in Victoria's Gippsland region. Under the partnership, the pair bought the rights to develop projects from Melbourne-based management team Solis Renewable Energy, along with Gippsland-based Marathon Electrical and construction firm WK & MA Ferguson.
The two projects included the proposed 44MW Perry Bridge Solar Farm and the nearby 80MW Fulham Solar Farm. It is unclear whether the rights to the Gippsland Renewable Energy Park were also purchased at the time or at a later date, but they are now definitively owned by Octopus and CFEC.
Octopus Australia estimates the construction and development of the Gippsland Renewable Energy Park will generate several hundred jobs in the region, which has been hit by bushfires and the decline of both the local timber and coal industries.
