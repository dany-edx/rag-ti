According to a joint press release, the financing facility with banks BTG Pactual and Itaú BBA, will fund “up to 70% of Canadian Solar's equity contributions in a subset of its Brazilian project portfolio.”
Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar said: “We are grateful and pleased to collaborate again with BTG Pactual and Itaú BBA to finance the development and construction of more solar assets in Brazil. With this facility, we can further leverage our equity contribution to build projects in Brazil and monetize them post-COD [commercial operations date] at attractive valuation[s], while maintaining the option to retain meaningful long-term ownership. We look forward to executing on our large backlog and pipeline of solar projects in Brazil and supporting the country's renewable power and energy security goals.”
Canadian Solar set up an office in Brazil in 2013 and has won a string of private auctions and projects since then. Its backlog and pipeline of solar projects in Brazil amounts to close to 3 GWp, with 480 MWp in operation and sold to third parties. A further 483 MWp are under construction and an additional 2 GWp are under development with power purchase agreement contracts. Canadian Solar has developed and built more than 5.7 GWp in more than 20 countries.
The solar manufacturer and project developer said, in its press release, the funding may support a plan to establish a publicly listed vehicle in Brazil, known as a Fundos de Investimento em Participações-Infraestrutura, or FIP-IE, “depending on market conditions.”
Brazil’s PV module demand reached almost 5 GW in 2020, with domestic module makers accounting for just a 3.8% market share by shipping around 190 MW of modules. Canadian Solar has a PV module factory near Sao Paulo with an annual production capacity of 380 MW.

A disclaimer to the public statement, however, indicated the agreement is a statement of intent at this stage.
Manufacturers Trina Solar and Longi Solar have scooped a tender to supply 1 GW of solar modules in a procurement exercise held by the Qinghai branch of the China Energy Investment Corporation for 2021-22. Trina landed a 600 MW section of the tender by offering panels for RMB1.725 per watt (US$0.266) and Longi secured the balance for RMB1.805/W (US$0.278). Half of the panels to be supplied will be bifacial and 70% of the products will have a power output of more than 530 W, with the rest having a rated output of 440-460 W per module.
Cell manufacturer Aikosolar has blamed escalating polysilicon prices, and the knock-on effect on solar wafer costs, as it warned investors on Friday it expected to announce a RMB20-30 million (US$3.08-4.63 million) loss from the first half of the year. Aikosolar, which recorded a net profit of RMB137 million (US$21.1 million) this time last year, said its performance had been further hampered by the need to reduce the volume of its production capacity in use.
State-owned photovoltaic glass maker Irico Group on Friday announced the successful ignition of its new furnace at the production base of the company’s Hefei Photovoltaic unit. The production project, which will have an annual capacity of 38.6 million square meters of photovoltaic glass, has also secured new funding of RMB550 million (US$84.8 million), Hong Kong-listed Irico said.

The German business is planning initial hydrogen-based e-fuels plants in Canada, France, Germany, and Norway.
Paris-based industrial gas business Air Liquide today signaled its willingness to invest across the supply chain for hydrogen in South Korea. The nation is “one of the most active countries in the world for hydrogen activities, backed up with a strong national ambition,” said Air Liquide Group executive committee member Matthieu Giard.
U.S, industrial gas and chemical company Air Products has signed an agreement with heavy equipment compatriot Cummins for the former's distribution trucks to be powered by hydrogen fuel cells in the Americas, Europe and Asia. A statement issued yesterday said: “Cummins will provide hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrains integrated into selected OEM partners’ heavy-duty trucks for Air Products, as Air Products begins the process of converting its global fleet of distribution vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.”
The partners expect a demonstration phase for the fuel cell trucks to start next year.
Circular manufacturing has been the focus of one of our UP Initiative quarterly themes. We looked at whether adopting circular approaches can create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry.

The government of Western Australia has become a founding member of industry body the Smart Energy Council's zero carbon certification scheme, which aims to certify the origins of renewable hydrogen, green ammonia and ‘green metals' such as renewables-powered steel and zinc.
Not to be outdone, the government of Victoria has offered up AU$7.2 million (€4.5 million) to help business switch to green hydrogen use by funding pilot programs, trials and feasibility studies. State minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said AU$6.2 million would be allocated to a ‘renewable hydrogen commercialization pathways fund' with a further AU$1 million to finance related business plans, in the form of a ‘renewable hydrogen business-ready fund.'
London-based development lender the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine have agreed to promote the use of hydrogen in the latter nation through a “first-of-its-kind accord.” EBRD managing director Harry Boyd-Carpenter said: “Ukraine relies heavily on fossil fuels across all sectors of its economy and hydrogen can represent a good alternative for decarbonization, and reduce reliance on fossil fuel.”
EU peer the European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed an advisory agreement with the Polish Cluster of Hydrogen Technologies to promote use of the energy storage medium in Poland. The deal was signed under the InnovFin – EU Finance for Innovators initiative of the EIB and European Commission, which itself is part of the bloc's Horizon 2020 research program.
Dublin-based clean energy company SSE Renewables and wind power engineer Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy have signed a memorandum of understanding to produce green hydrogen powered by two onshore wind farms in Scotland and Ireland, “to be announced in due course.”
North America PowerTap Hydrogen has acquired 49% of the AES-100 business which owns the intellectual property for the Advanced Electrolyzer System (AES), an electrochemical technology that recovers high purity hydrogen from dilute syngas. There is crossover between the two businesses thanks to PowerTap's Steam Methane Reformer (SMR) technology, with a statement about the equity investment today saying “This will essentially broaden the pool of feedstock required to produce hydrogen to include biomass, in addition to natural gas and renewable natural gas.”
The press release said the AES system “enables lower cost production of hydrogen with no incremental greenhouse gas emissions. AES is the only technology capable of economically recovering high purity hydrogen at highly competitive costs.” AES-100 is reportedly aiming for hydrogen production costs of less than US$5/kg (€4.24), versus current prices of US$10-15/kg.

The CrossBoundary Energy Access (CBEA) project finance facility for African mini-grids will buy the completed networks, with their construction to be funded by three entities which will hold equity stakes in the projects during their construction phase, to be recouped by the CBEA purchase.
Dutch microfinance lender Oikocredit; compatriot impact investor Triodos Investment Management, which is owned by sustainable bank Triodos; and EU development finance entity ElectriFI will provide $9 million of construction finance between them, with U.S.-owned installer PowerGen paying any remaining project costs.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry, looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The Nigeria Electrification Project run by government body the Rural Electrification Agency of Nigeria will award the project $350 grants for each electricity consumer who is connected to the networks, with that money being supplied by the World Bank.
With seven mini grids already live, PowerGen aims to install 28 systems with a total generation capacity of 2.1 MW and an average figure of around 70 kW per set-up, and with around 4.5 MWh of total battery storage at a typical mini-network volume of around 160 kWh. At each site, customers will pay in advance for solar electricity and be able to top-up credit using their mobile phones or by visiting a local PowerGen agent.
Alastair Smith, co-founder and country director for PowerGen in Nigeria, told pv magazine: “We have a plan to deploy 21 sites between now and mid-year next year. Our current, active seven sites, at the moment cover about 11,000 connections. The size of the community can vary depending on the final build and final system design. We have completed the first phase of the project but we still have the remainder of the project which we will be building for the remainder of this year and the beginning of next year. Upon completion, PowerGen will continue operating all the projects, and CBEA will be the owner.”
The seven sites already in place have a total generation capacity of 460 kWp and storage volume of 1,157 kWh. Referring to PowerGen parent company WindGen Power USA, Smith said: “The parent company of PowerGen is an American company but, in Nigeria, the goal is to have 100% Nigerians running and operating our PowerGen Nigeria company and the sites. As we grow, we are not bringing in additional expatriates. We are hiring local individuals that can help mini-grids thrive and flourish.”
CrossBoundary associate principal Humphrey Wireko told pv magazine: “We're excited to work with such strong partners to reach an agreement to finance and own this portfolio of mini-grids in Nigeria. We continue to believe that mini-grids are a key tool for bringing power to over 200 million people in Africa, and this project finance structure is the best way to attract the $187 billion of investment that these assets need. This transaction is a testament to the fantastic work being done by many stakeholders to help facilitate off-grid investment in Nigeria. We see this as the first of many such financings that CBEA plans to do in Nigeria.”
Estefanía Matesanz, senior investment manager for private equity at Triodos said: “This equity investment in PowerGen's mini-grids project can be considered a landmark investment with major strategic importance both for Triodos IM [Investment Management] and the African mini-grids sector development.”
CrossBoundary Energy Access was set up by by Nairobi-based financial services entity CrossBoundary and backed by the Shell and Rockefeller foundations, Anglo-American impact investor Ceniarth, and lottery-funded Netherlands investor Stochting Doen, with Massachusetts impact investor Blue Haven Initiative also having come on board since.

Melbourne-based energy retailer Simply Energy, which is 100% owned by Engie, has paid penalties totaling $2.5 million after two external door-to-door sales agents allegedly impersonated customers consenting to the switches in phone calls.
Simply Energy, which has more than 700,000 accounts across Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, with sales totaling 12% of the Australian market, was issued with 125 penalty notices after the agents allegedly impersonated customers consenting to the switch in phone calls to the company.
Victoria’s Essential Services Commission said the two sales agents had, between July 2019 and April 2020 transferred 525 electricity and gas accounts at 264 properties without obtaining their consent.
Commission chair Kate Symons said it is the most blatant case of fraudulent sales contractors the commission has dealt with to date.
“This behavior from rogue sales contractors undermines customer trust in the market,” she said.
“This is the strongest action we have taken against an energy company and shows just how seriously we view customers being transferred by fraudulent means,” she said.
Symons said it is the third time Simply Energy, which contracted the agents, has been issued penalty notices for not obtaining explicit informed consent before transferring customers.
“That factored into our calculation of the appropriate number of penalties to be paid and our discussions with the company which have centered on gaining assurance this won’t happen again,” she said.
“This action should send a strong message to Simply Energy and other retailers we will not tolerate behavior that undermines customer trust.”
A Simply Energy spokesperson told 9News on Monday that the company apologized to the customers caught up in the fraudulent activity.
“The two field sales agents involved in these matters led deliberate and sophisticated criminal frauds, circumventing our policies and controls, and are the subject of criminal proceedings,” they said.
“We have apologized to all affected customers, reversed and refunded any payments for fraudulent account transfers.”

Netherlands-based off-grid solar body GOGLA – formerly the Global Off-grid Lighting Association – surveyed the suppliers of products such as solar lanterns, water pumps, TVs and fridges, as well as complete solar home systems (SHS'), last month, to ask about the impact of global chip shortages and other material-related issues.
Of the 24 companies which responded to a question about how long issues such as price rises, delayed deliveries, reduced product performance and stock shortfalls could continue, nine businesses said a year, eight said 18 months, and two respondents said two years. Five companies were more upbeat and predicted the turbulence would clear after the end of this year.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
Although a well-publicized global shortage of chipsets and controllers – which feature in inverters – dominated manufacturer concerns, respondents to the GOGLA survey also mentioned rising polysilicon prices affecting solar panel production costs and an escalating copper price driving up the cost of cabling.
As a result, a dozen manufacturers said the performance of their products would be affected by material shortages, versus 15 respondents who said there would be no such impact. Changes to performance could include a need to “provide slightly less power [from] each [solar] module” as well as removing a dimmer feature for solar lights; replacing information displays showing remaining electricity credit with LEDs; and reducing cabling and mounting flexibility.
Manufacturers voiced concern about whether such changes to their products would affect the quality assurance guarantees issued by testing agency Verasol, given that can be a key requirement in the suitability of such items to receive donor funding.
With African installers having already told pv magazine about the rising project costs they are having to pass on to clients as a result of soaring shipping costs, respondents to the GOGLA questions predicted product price rises ranging from 9% for solar lanterns up to 52% for solar-powered TVs. An expected 14% price rise in the cost of full-service SHS', and of 15% for water pumps, will cause further concern to NGOs aiming to get the world back on track with the fading UN ambition of universal access to electricity this decade.
Manufacturers also expect an 18% rise in the price of solar-powered fridges, a 16% hike in the cost of fans, and an 11% uplift in solar-powered multi-light systems, according to GOGLA, which announced the results of the survey this month.
In terms of supply disruption, manufacturers expected stock to be at its tightest for the rest of this year for SHS', TVs and multi-light systems, although they predicted shortfalls will continue into next year. Solar water pumps are likely to be in short supply in the second half of next year, the respondents predicted. At present, manufacturers say, it is taking 2.5 weeks longer than usual to receive solar panels, there is a one-month delay in battery deliveries, and a 21-week hold-up for chipsets and controllers.

The PV project is part of the first phase of Westlands Solar Park (WSP) in California’s San Joaquin Valley.
Waaree has provided 385Wp and 390Wp mono PERC solar PV modules for the installation at WSP.
The solar modules supplied by Waaree have undergone quality testing at Waaree’s module manufacturing facility, which houses IEC-CB-CTF laboratory for reliability testing and certification.
Waaree has already supplied over 3 GW solar panels globally and commissioned solar EPC projects in India and Southeast Asia.
Sunil Rathi, director, Sales and Marketing, Waaree Energies, said, “This order is in line with the Government of India’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat (making India a self-reliant nation) and shows the capabilities of Indian manufacturers to compete in the global market. This order for Westlands Solar Park has brought US$105 million of foreign exchange into our country and created good employment opportunities.”
Emboldened by its sales, Waaree plans to strengthen its base in the USA by opening a local office in California shortly.
WSP is one of the largest permitted solar parks globally, with a 2.7 GW capacity of renewable power. The 250 MW Aquamarine, part of its first phase, is expected to start power generation in late 2021. The solar arrays are being installed on steel posts at the height of 8 to 10 feet above the ground with a maximum tilt angle. Waaree solar panels supplied for this project are made of dark non-reflective materials to reduce glint and glare potential.
Waaree Energies Ltd, the flagship company of Waaree Group, has a solar PV module manufacturing capacity of 2 GW. It provides EPC services too. The company has its presence in over 375+ locations nationally and 68 countries globally.

The survey took place in late 2020, and involved 4,336 respondents across the state – with data separated according to gender, age, location and home ownership. Queensland’s Minister for Energy, Mick de Brenni, described the survey as an illustration of goodwill towards clean energy, calling on renewables industries to “leverage” the surge in interest. “Building on this positive sentiment right now is the key to future of success,” de Brenni said at the virtual Queensland Smart Energy Summit last week, where he teased some of the survey’s findings.
The number of Queensland households with battery storage systems has doubled from 3% to 6% in the last 24 months, with the most significant growth seen in regional Queensland.
Although the total percentage of households with batteries remains small, a third of Queenslanders said they intend to purchase an energy storage system, with 10% planning to do so in the next three years. The number of respondents disinterested in batteries continued to fall.

Of those intending to install a battery storage system, 37% are only willing to pay a maximum of $5000, while 32% would pay up to $10,000 and 29% would pay $15,000 or more.
Regional Queenslanders, the group which saw the most growth in battery interest, reported that they see the technology not so much as a means to lower their bills, but rather a way to increase self-sufficiency and to be less reliant on the grid.
As for the barriers, 29% said the technology doesn’t make financial sense yet and a further 24% cited a lack of knowledge.
Just 23% of respondents knew about community batteries, but of those 22% are interested in them.
Almost a quarter (24%) of Queenslanders said they would like to go off-grid, particularly Queenslanders between 18 to 34. 56% said they would like to do so to save money, while 37% said the intention was to help save the environment.

Queensland has among the highest penetration of rooftop solar in the world, and it shows no signs of slowing. A massive 37% of Queensland households have solar, up from 33% in 2019. A further 22% of respondents said they are either looking to install solar or upgrade their solar system in the next three years. 
The average quarterly bill for households with solar PV was $231, compared to $383 for households without solar – saving solar households an average of $600 less per year.

Of the households interested in or already installed with solar, 60% said they did so to save on their bills and 30% wanted to do their bit for the environment – a sentiment most prevalent among younger generations of Queenslanders.
Satisfaction with solar’s benefits appears high, with 93% of solar owners saying they would replace their solar system if it were to fail with a system of the same size or bigger.

Just 3% of Queenslanders have an electric vehicle (EV), though a growing percentage of the population is looking to purchase. That is, 54% of respondents said they’d consider buying an EV compared to 40% two years ago. Of those, 35% are looking to buy within the next three years.

Although respondents’ range requirements differ by region, most of those considering an EV would require a range of at least 500km. The price points most are willing to consider for an EV sit around the $30,000 to $50,000 mark, dropping off considerably above that.

The growing interest in cleaner technology actually comes as fewer Queenslanders reported feeling concerned about electricity bills. Of those polled, 51% said their level of concern about electricity bills was low while only 29% said it was high. This coincides with a decrease in average bills.
While the rooftop solar boom in Australia is often linked with a spike in electricity prices, which peaked around 2016, it seems the decline in costs is not causing disinterest in renewable alternatives.
You can read the full report on the survey’s findings here.

Responding to the survey, Queensland community group Solar Citizens called on the government to do more to bridge the technology price barriers through incentive schemes.
“This survey shows that there’s a real appetite in Queensland for battery storage and cleaner electric vehicles but cost remains a barrier to accessing these technologies,” said Stephanie Gray, Energy Strategist at Solar Citizens.
“This is where the state and federal governments can play a constructive role. By incentivizing the rollout of battery storage and electric transport they can bring down the cost of clean technology to make it easier for more Australians to save money and do their bit for the environment.
“Governments played a key role in bringing down the cost of rooftop solar by incentivizing uptake and now Australian homes and businesses are leading the world. It’s our great energy success story and we can do that again.”
Earlier this month, Solar Citizens released the findings of a survey it had commissioned – revealing areas that have traditionally been Queensland’s conservative strongholds are now showing clear support for clean energy. Its regional-only poll found more than half of regional Queenslanders believe clean energy industries will be major employers by 2030, while just shy of half support transitioning to a renewables-dominated grid in the next 15 years or sooner.

The government department said it had drawn upon technology deployed as part of DEWA's Space-D program, including satellite camera imaging, to tighten the performance of forecasting associated with the nation's mammoth Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park, which is set to have a 5 GW solar generation capacity at the end of the decade.
An announcement on DEWA's website on Thursday said the utility had worked with Stanford as part of the U.S. university's ‘Energy 3.0' clean power program to improve predictions related to irradiance, dust and cloud movements and drawing upon a network of meteorological stations as well as artificial intelligence and deep learning technology.
Referring to staff based at DEWA's research and development center at the solar park site, the authority's vice-president for research and development, Saif Saeed Almheiri, said: “The R&D Centre supports DEWA’s efforts to overcome challenges in the energy sector when generating electricity from solar, and clean energy. This supports the center’s goals to become a global platform for promising solutions that enrich the scientific community in the UAE and the world. It also helps us strengthen the skills and knowledge of Emirati researchers to maintain DEWA’s position at the forefront of utilities worldwide.”
DEWA's space program aims to use space technology to enhance its electricity and water networks.

And with perovskite tandem devices acknowledged by many to represent the future of high efficiency PV, the development could represent a significant disruption to the commercialization of the technology in Europe.
Oxford PV announced an end to the co-operation on Friday, with Meyer Burger yesterday stating it was “exploring its legal options” in response to the development.
The winding up of the “exclusive cooperation” was not widely expected as the partnership appearing to have been on a sound footing – not least by virtue of Meyer Burger’s considerable investment in Oxford PV.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: We have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
“It somewhat surprises me,” said Alex Barrows, director of research at PV manufacturing consultancy Exawatt. “From the perspective of someone looking in from the outside, the cooperation seemed like a good fit: Oxford PV seems focused on doing perovskite on HJT rather than, for example, using a cheaper and lower efficiency bottom cell, and Meyer Burger is undoubtedly one of the leaders when it comes to HJT manufacturing.”
Oxford PV has attributed the strategic decision behind the separation to Meyer Burger’s pivot to manufacturing – which occurred after the companies had entered into the collaboration, in March 2019. The initial cooperation agreement was supposed to establish a 200 MW HJT/perovskite tandem line and involved Meyer Burger taking an 18.8% stake in Oxford PV. The deal also included an option for Meyer Burger to double that investment by the end of 2020 – an option that appears to not have been taken up.
The announcement of the “exclusive cooperation” signed in 2019 included the statement: “Meyer Burger will, additionally, develop equipment to industrialize the mass production of the perovskite layers deposited on top of the silicon heterojunction bottom cells.” While the companies have not made more specific details about the cooperation available to pv magazine, it does appear that this is perhaps where the collaboration came unstuck.
Meyer Burger’s HJT production line is based on PECVD (plasma-enabled chemical vapor deposition) processes for the production of the double-junction crystalline silicon (a-Si)/amorphous silicon (a-Si) cells. It supplied such lines to Singapore-based REC before taking the decision to pursue the manufacture of HJT modules itself – a pivot announced in June 2020. However, PECVD processes are not commonly used for perovskite deposition.
“You can put the perovskite down in lots of different ways. You can evaporate it or you can do some form of printing, spraying or coating followed by annealing,” said Exawatt’s Barrows – who completed his PhD in novel PV materials and deposition methods. “But if Oxford PV is sputtering [the perovskite semiconductor], it could make a lot of sense to work with an expert in that area, like Von Ardenne or another supplier that is established in the thin-film world. Oxford PV could simply work directly with a sputtering or thin film deposition expert [rather than Meyer Burger].”
While both Meyer Burger and Oxford PV confirm the former is supplying the “turnkey manufacturing line” for the latter’s production in Brandenburg, Germany, it is unlikely Meyer Burger is building the perovskite deposition tooling itself. Rather, it is likely working with a third-party equipment supplier – a arrangement common in turnkey PV production line supply. Oxford PV told pv magazine last week its perovskite production process is based on sputtering.
There is some level of contention as to the readiness of the Oxford PV German facility, in terms of the perovskite processes. Oxford PV told pv magazine last week, all but one of the required tools are in place. Meyer Burger says production is still some distance away.
The Swiss PV technology company’s statement today read: “Meyer Burger's assessment was, and is, that the perovskite tandem technology will only reach the required technology and process maturity, product reliability and cost structure for competitive mass production, in a few years.”
The companies are also in dispute as to how Oxford PV’s decision to terminate the agreement was communicated – with Meyer Burger claiming it was only made aware of the move through public disclosures.
What is clearer, is that the move by Oxford PV could leave Meyer Burger with a speed bump in its technology roadmap.
“From a strategic standpoint, it seems like this could create a bit of a headache for Meyer Burger, at least assuming that the company keeps perovskite/HJT tandems as a key pillar of its technology roadmap,” said Barrows. “Previously, it appeared that a lot of the perovskite-specific development for this would effectively be outsourced to Oxford PV. Now, Meyer Burger will presumably have to do more of this in-house. Without all the details of who owns what IP [intellectual property] it’s hard to say how much of a setback this could be, but I could imagine that it might delay Meyer Burger’s moves into this area.”
