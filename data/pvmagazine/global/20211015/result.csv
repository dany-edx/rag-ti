The organic elements are thought to be essential in limiting formation of defects in the material, and in allowing for the simple, low-temperature manufacturing processes that make perovskites so attractive to the PV industry. These molecules also, however, are at the root of many of the challenges keeping perovskites from large-scale use, and can break up entirely resulting in serious performance loss.
And just as environmental concerns have led scientists to trial replacing lead with other materials, investigating alternatives to the organic molecules could be one way to solve the problem. Cesium has proven to have strong potential as a replacement, although a large part of the research community continues to focus on organic-inorganic perovskite materials.
Scientists led by the University of California Santa Barbara developed a method to compare the potential of different perovskite compositions, and found that all-inorganic materials have the potential for better solar cell performance than those using the organic material.
“To compare the materials, we performed comprehensive simulations of the recombination mechanisms,” explained UC Santa Barbara scientist Xie Zhang. “When light shines on a solar-cell material, the photo-generated carriers generate a current; recombination at defects destroys some of those carriers and hence lowers the efficiency. Defects thus act as efficiency killers.”
The group’s calculations are described in full in the paper All inorganic halide perovskites as candidates for efficient solar cells, published in Cell Reports Physical Science. They compared a cesium-based perovskite with one containing methylammonium, and concluded that the presence of organic materials actually increases the chance of defects appearing in the material, and introduces challenges that disappear when it is replaced with cesium. “We believe that the prospects of using CsPbI3 for efficient solar cells may have been significantly underrated; its optoelectronic performance actually surpasses that of the hybrid perovskites from a nonradiative recombination point of view.”
One of the reasons inorganic perovskites have so far taken a backseat is that actually fabricating them is more challenging. The UCSB scientists, however, note that other recent research suggests that this could be overcome, and with the knowledge that better efficiencies can be achieved this way, scientists could increase their efforts working on processes for all-inorganic perovskite fabrication.
“We hope our results will inspire further experimental work on developing effective strategies to stabilize CsPbI3 in the perovskite structure, thus enabling a new pathway to making highly efficient perovskite solar cells,” the group concludes.

The planned yearly purchases will be 200 million for 2022, 500 million for 2023, and 600 million for 2024. The price will be negotiated monthly. According to the latest wafer prices published by PV Infolink on September 29, the total contract value for this long-term agreement is around RMB 8.3 billion (USD$1.29 billion). Shuangliang used to focus its business on ingot furnace systems; however, it began manufacturing PV wafers in 2021. This September, the company announced two strategic purchasing contracts with Jiangsu Zhongneng and TBEA, respectively, to secure at least 135,000 MT of polysilicon supply over the next four years. Shuangliang is also constructing a 20 GW wafer production base in Inner Mongolia.
On Thursday, PV wafer producer Zhonghuan announced its Q3 financial forecast. The manufacturer said its revenue for the first three quarters of 2021 will reach RMB 28 billion to RMB 30 billion, YoY growing by 109% to 124%. The estimated net profit will be RMB 2.7 billion to RMB 2.8 billion, with a YoY growth of 219% to 231%. Zhonghuan said the growth is due to several reasons, including the successful marketing of its 210 mm sized PV modules, and technical improvements that helped to achieve thinner wafers, and thus, save on polysilicon costs. Its yield of 210 mm wafers also increased, while sales grew due to new capacity expansions.
UtmoLight Technology, a Wuxi-based perovskite start-up announced on Wednesday that the company has won a Pre-A round investment of RMB 220 million from several private equity funds. According to Utmolight, it has achieved respective efficiencies of 22.7% on 1cm² and 19.41% on 10cm² for its perovskite solar cells and modules.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/15/new-tracker-design-for-agrivoltaics/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,FRANCE,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"OCTOBER 15, 2021",New tracker design for agrivoltaics,"Axial Structural, a racking systems manufacturer based in Spain, has announced the launch of the Agritracker, a solar tracker designed specifically for agrivoltaics installations. The product allows for easy optimization of periods of light and shade to balance optimal growth for different crop types with maximum energy generation.
“The Agritracker adapts to the specific needs of each crop: it protects from inclement weather and optimizes the periods of light and shade,” the company told pv magazine, adding that the tracker has been certified by TÜV Rheinland, and is already available for sale.
Axial’s agrivoltaics solution can adapt to sloping terrains, and accommodate crops with different light requirements being planted beneath one installation (grapevine, fruit trees and vegetables, for example). The system can adapt to very steep slopes and land dimensions. Modules can be installed at a height of up to 6.8 meters, allowing heavy farming machinery to pass underneath. The tracker supports up to 96 modules per motor, and independent rows of up to 32 modules, split into four groups of eight panels each.
“Thanks to the Agritracker Shadow Programming App, we can define the hours of tracking the sun or allowing light to pass through for the whole system, and guarantee minimal shading of the crop when sunlight is needed for agricultural purposes,” explained an Axial representative. “With the Dynamic Control system we can also control specific positions at specific times, or manage the position of individual trackers through ModBus Live Control”.
The company specifies that the mechanical elements comprising the Agritracker are subject to the same load calculations, wind tunnel testing and other standards used in all Axial Tracker products. “In this way it is possible to size and secure the products against climate conditions of any area or region,” the company adds.
Axial has already installed the tracker at a project spread across three hectares of farmland in the south of France, the first project in a 100 MW pipeline for the technology that is set to be implemented in the region over the next two years. “In addition to France, the Agritracker is generating serious interest in Italy, Spain and Israel. Our immediate goal is to implement the tracker in European markets,” the company representative told pv magazine. The company also offers the tracker as a turnkey system solution.

The signing in Greece’s capital city Athens comes just a few months after Greece, Cyprus, and Israel joined forces to connect their power grids via the so-called EuroAsia Interconnector.
Both electricity interconnections could provide the European Union block with access to solar power generated in the sunny regions of the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA).
Greece’s prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted about the project, stating that it “secures the flow of green energy and enhances Europe’s energy security.”
The Greek ministry’s press release goes a step further adding that electricity imports from Egypt would spark competition in the Greek market, while access to Egyptian electricity loads would mean less need to run fossil fuel plants in Greece.
Both developments, argues the Greek ministry, would reduce electricity prices, and allow Greece to focus on renewable power, which is cheaper to run than fossil power plants.
The Greek government has set a policy to phase coal out by 2028, although this time window has now been reduced to 2025. Furthermore, according to the country’s national energy plan, renewable energies will provide 61% of Greece’s electricity by 2030. Ministry sources have told pv magazine this figure is also set to increase.
This means Greece needs both energy storage facilities and new interconnections with neighboring countries.
On the contrary, Egypt is far from decarbonizing its electricity system, which predominantly runs on gas and oil power plants. Indeed, of the country’s 193.55 TWh of electricity generation in 2019, solar and wind power accounted for just 3.68 TWh and 2.79 TWh respectively, while gas provided a staggering 149.75 TWh.
Nevertheless, Egypt’s 2035 Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy emphasizes the need to turn to renewable energies. Specifically, the country aims to increase the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources to 20% by 2022 and 42% by 2035, with solar PV accounting for 22%, wind 14%, concentrating solar power (CSP) 3%, and hydro power 2%, by that time.
Egypt’s solar PV powerhouse is the so-called Benban complex in Aswan province, Southern Egypt. The complex comprises 39 PV installations totaling 1.86 GW of capacity. Around 1.5 GW of it is currently operational.
The country has an immense solar power resource with 2,000 to 3,000 kWh/m2 per year of direct solar radiation. The sun shines 9-11 hours a day from north to south, with just a few cloudy days. However, in 2015 Egypt also discovered the Zohr gas field, which it claims is the largest in the Mediterranean region.
The emerging questions are: Will Egypt develop its green energies sector or focus on gas? And whatever Egypt’s politicians decide, will they transport energy in Europe or use it at home to satisfy their booming demand?
The answer to these is going to be dictated by economics alone, mainly by the price of electricity in Egypt and abroad, as well as the price of developing and running power stations.
One might only hope that politicians will also think of climate change. The United Nations COP is set to start in Glasgow, Scotland in a few days and politicians will talk their usual talk; but more than even action is needed too.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/15/on-the-trail-of-a-cause-for-solar-cell-lid/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 15, 2021",On the trail of a cause for solar cell LID,"Light-induced degradation (LID) has long been a problem for the PV industry, slowly eroding solar module performance, adding up to significant performance loss over years in the field.
Plenty of solutions have been suggested. Additional treatments during cell production have shown to be effective in mitigating LID. More recently, cell makers have begun to switch boron for gallium as a p-type doping material, since boron is known to be active in the LID mechanism. The switch to n-type technologies, which several manufacturers are currently in the early stages of making, should also mean modules are less susceptible to LID.
These solutions, however, rely on relieving the symptoms of LID rather than fully understanding the cause. And research is ongoing to fully understand the mechanisms at work within the cell that cause and cut them out without the need for additional processing in cell manufacturing.
Scientists led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the U.S. and the Colorado School of Mines sought to contribute to this research, applying the latest microscope imaging techniques to boron-doped silicon cells. Using a technique called electron paramagnetic resonance, the group was able to identify a distinct defect signature that occurred as the cell performance was degraded by light. This signature disappeared when the group applied the widely used treatment for LID adopted by cell manufacturers.
The work is described in full in the paper Atomic structure of light-induced efficiency-degrading defects in boron-doped Czochralski silicon solar cells, published in Energy and Environmental Science. The group further identified another signature affected by light exposure, which did not match up with the number of defects in the material – suggesting other atomic changes may be occurring that don’t directly contribute to LID.
The group says the techniques it has developed to study LID could be applied to other degradation mechanisms affecting silicon cells, and could even work with cadmium telluride, perovskites, and other cell materials.

Air Products said it plans to build a $4.5 billion blue hydrogen at a complex in Louisiana.
The company will build, own, and operate the project, which is planned to produce over 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, south of Baton Rouge.
Blue hydrogen is produced using hydrocarbons as a feedstock, with the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the production process captured for permanent sequestration. The project is expected to create 170 permanent jobs and represents Air Products’ largest-ever investment in the U.S. The project is expected to be operational in 2026.
Part of the blue hydrogen will be compressed and supplied to customers by Air Products’ U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline network. The pipeline stretches more than 700 miles from Galveston Bay in Texas to New Orleans. Today, this pipeline network can supply customers with more than 1.6 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day from approximately 25 production facilities, including blue hydrogen from Air Products’ Port Arthur, Texas facility. The Port Arthur facility has captured approximately one million tons of CO2 annually since 2013, with the CO2 transported via pipeline and used for enhanced oil recovery operations.
The balance of the blue hydrogen from the new Ascension Parish facility will be used to make blue ammonia for export and converted back to blue hydrogen for transportation and other markets.
Around 95% of the CO2 generated at the facility will be captured, compressed, and transported by pipeline to multiple inland sequestration sites located along a pipeline corridor extending up to 35 miles to the east of the new production facility. Over five million metric tons per year (MTPY) of CO2 will be sequestered in geologic pore space secured from the State of Louisiana approximately one mile beneath the surface. Air Products said it has already received approval from the State Mineral and Energy Board, which is part of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, for the permanent sequestration of the CO2.
The news follows Air Products’ announcement in June of a multi-billion-dollar net-zero hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
In April, Koch Engineered Solutions said that two of its companies, Optimized Process Designs and Koch Project Solutions, would partner with Fidelis Infrastructure to develop the Grön Fuels renewable energy complex in Louisiana.
The $9.2 billion multi-year program would produce green hydrogen, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuels, and bio-plastic feedstocks. The project also would include biogenic carbon capture and sequestration.
The Koch-backed project is expected to produce the equivalent of 1,000 MW of green hydrogen produced by electrolysis, with a pathway to net negative CO2 carbon footprint through the use of biogenic carbon capture and sequestration.
An investment decision is expected to be made later in 2021.
