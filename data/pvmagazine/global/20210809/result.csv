The transaction, if finalized, would allow the Korean group to continue its expansion in Europe. Currently, it has a portfolio of renewable energy projects totaling nearly 10 GW worldwide, including around 5 GW in Europe, mainly concentrated in Spain. Considering that RES France owns projects with a combined capacity of more than 5 GW, the company's European pipeline has more than doubled.
“This acquisition shows that Q Cells is ready to establish itself in the French renewable energy market and to make a significant contribution to the French energy transition while accelerating its transformation towards global, clean and sustainable energy solutions”, explained the group's CEO, Hee Cheul Kim.
Q Cells said in a statement that France is one of the most attractive markets for renewable energy, due to its abundance of sun and wind, but also to a well-established tendering system. Moreover, it stated the transaction offers Q Cells the opportunity to expand into markets other than solar and to diversify its offering into onshore and offshore wind power.
The completion of the operation is planned for October.

Underwriters Laboratories, a U.S. standards development organization, and Koren car manufacturer Hyundai Motor Co. signed a memorandum of understanding to help further the safe deployment and use of second-life battery energy storage systems (SLBESS). 
The two said they will collaborate on SLBESS initiatives, including safety testing and assessment, a North America product demonstration project, and evaluation process development. They said they intend to use their worldwide presence to further SLBESS market adoption.
Second-life batteries often consist of electric vehicle batteries that no longer meet the requirements of automotive applications, but are still worthwhile additions as grid-connected energy storage devices.
As the EV market grows, attention is focusing on battery reuse. In 2018, UL participated in developing UL 1974, the Standard for Evaluation for Repurposing Batteries, a bi-national standard of the United States and Canada. In 2019, 4R Energy Corp., a joint venture of Nissan Motors and Sumitomo Corp., became the first organization certified to that standard.
Improvements in lithium extraction, battery efficiency upgrades, lithium battery recycling, and battery reuse all present market opportunities as the world shifts the way it uses energy.
The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow from $40.5 billion in 2020 to $91.9 billion by 2026, as demand for electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and electronics continue to ramp up.
Lithium battery growth is a part of national plans to evolve and decarbonize the energy and transportation sectors, as evidenced by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) making $200 million in funding available to support the full value chain of batteries, from raw materials to end-user products such as EVs and battery storage systems.
DOE and the Biden administration have identified the need to establish a secure end-to-end battery materials and technology supply chain that supports economic competitiveness, job creation, and national security.

Asahi India Glass has partnered with Ahmedabad-based Vishakha Group to set up India’s largest solar glass plant in Mundra, in the Indian state of Gujarat. The greenfield project will initially produce up to 3 GW of solar glass per year. 
The plant is expected to be commissioned within the next 18 to 24 months. Asahi India Glass will take a minority stake in the venture. 
Vishakha Group is one of the largest manufacturers of flexible polymer packaging in India. It also manufactures other key components for the solar panel value chain, including solar backsheets, EVA encapsulant sheets, and aluminum frames for solar modules.
Asahi India Glass has become the second company after New Delhi-based Gold Plus Glass to launch solar glass manufacturing operations this year. Borosil Renewables is currently the only operational solar glass manufacturer in the country. It runs a factory in Bharuch, Gujarat, and supplies about 40% of India’s solar glass needs. Imports meet the balance of demand.
Due to rising sales, Borosil Renewables plans to expand its capacity from 450 tons per day to 950 tons per day by adding a third solar glass line of 500 tons per day, along with processing facilities. The announcements for capacity additions come as a surge in solar installations in India drive demand for solar panels and solar glass.
As part of its commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, India has now embarked on an ambitious target of generating 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. 
“India has been one of the few nations that have accelerated its global commitment towards climate change and we intend to do our part to achieve the renewable energy target,” said Jigish Doshi, the chairman of Vishakha Group.

They have developed a new agrivoltaic concept that purportedly results in a 69.3% reduction in CO2 emissions and an 82.9% reduction in fossil fuel consumption, compared to non-integrated production.
The academics analyzed and compared three different configurations: an agrivoltaic project based on pasture-fed rabbits, solar PV generation combined with conventional rabbit farming, and a conventional electricity generation business combined with rabbit farming.
“Each system has been designed to achieve 1.57 MW energy generation, with potential rabbit meat production constrained to the productive capacity of 2 hectares (5 acres) of pasture,” they explained. “All scenarios are designed to achieve the same multiple-output functional unit of 412,596 MWh (1.57 MW installed peak power) and 7,200 rabbits (approximately 19,440 kg of rabbit meat) as allowed by the capacity of the baseline scenario over its lifetime of 30 years.”
Under the terms of their proposal, the agrivoltaic system would be situated at an unspecified location in Texas, and would be divided into five 314 kW units. It would require the use of internal fencing for the rabbits.
“All relevant balance of system components are included, as well as electric installation and fencing,” the scientists said. “Unlike a conventional solar array, an agrivoltaic system designed to host pasture-fed rabbits requires additional internal fencing to prevent escape.”
They compared three system with fossil energy demand and cumulative energy demand methods. The latter calculates energy consumption in megajoules (MJ) for every stage of the life cycle under study, including both direct and indirect uses of energy. Fossil energy demand is used to quantify the emissions and energy usage associated with each modeled scenario.
Compared to the non-integrated production of solar PV electricity and rabbit meat, the proposed agrivoltaic approach would produce the least amount of CO2, at 3,880,000 kg. It would also require the least amount of fossil energy, at 46,000,000 MJ. The second project proposal would produce 12,667,000 kg of emissions and require 269,234,000 MJ of energy, while the third system would produce 264,771,000 kg of emissions and use 3,793,064,000 MJ.
The researchers said that the pasture-fed rabbits in the first scenario would depend on an external feeding system.
“The findings of this (life-cycle assessment) further validate the viability of combined solar energy and agriculture production techniques and provide empirical support for increased agrivoltaic system deployment as a pathway to sustainable development,” the researchers concluded.
They presented their findings in “Life cycle assessment of pasture-based agrivoltaic systems: Emissions and energy use of integrated rabbit production,” which was recently published in Cleaner and Responsible Consumption.

The Moron Solar PV project is planned for the homonymous municipality, in the Khövsgöl Aimag region in northern Mongolia, and is part of the Upscaling Renewable Energy Sector Project, which is being co-managed by the Government of Mongolia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The goal is to deploy 40.5 MW of solar and wind capacity in the country’s western and Altai-Uliastai regions.
The US$66.2 million initiative also includes another 10 MW worth of solar plants in Altai City, a 500 kW solar-wind hybrid project with storage in Altai County, a 10 MW wind project in Umunogovi, and a 5 MW wind farm in Telmen. Interested EPC companies have until October 20, 2021, to submit their proposals.
Overall, Mongolia had an installed PV capacity of around 100 MW at the end of August, Myagmardorj Enhkmend, the Secretary General of the Mongolian Renewables Industries Association, told pv magazine. However, most of this capacity – around 90 MW – was installed between 2016 and 2018, as a result of auctions held in previous years. “The government is still not announcing any auction for new renewable projects and it's becoming a big challenge to increase the capacity of renewable energy in the country,” he said.
The nation’s total theoretical power generation capacity, according to the ADB, is 1,158 MW. Of that power fleet, however, only 969 MW appears to be online due to aging, coal-based conventional power plants. The country imports a large portion of its power from neighboring countries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/09/novel-design-for-east-west-solar-parks-reduces-soil-deterioration/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 9, 2021",Novel design for east-west solar parks reduces soil deterioration,"The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has designed a new approach for building east-west-oriented solar parks which it claims can prevent soil deterioration and offer the same yield as south-oriented PV plants.
In a dedicated study, the Dutch scientists explained that, although east-west solar parks are becoming increasingly popular in the Netherlands where land constraints and high land costs are pushing developers to build solar plants with a highly packed panel density, these installations present a challenge for the soil, because they are placed so closely together and cover almost all the ground beneath, thus reducing the light reaching it over a 25-year period or more.
According to the researchers, industry-standard east-west solar parks built in the country have a ground coverage ratio of over 90%, which is highly detrimental for the soil beneath the panels. “It will then take a great deal of time and effort to restore the soil quality that existed before the solar farm was constructed,” the TNO scientists said.
To combat this, the researchers have developed two variants of their novel design. The first sees module arrays built in portrait orientation that are eight meters long, feature a large gap between the arrays, and have a ground coverage ratio of around 77%. “Clearly the irradiance below the bottom gap between an east– and a west–facing module is very high but it also allows more light in the immediate region below those modules,” the academics said. “Also the larger top gap allows more light and distributes that light over a fairly large region.”
In the second variant, which has the same ground coverage ratio as the first, the scientists halved the height of the module arrays and the size of the gaps and, at the same time, utilized semi-transparent bifacial modules. “A 77% coverage design with semi-transparent, bifacial panels scores better in terms of the effect on soil quality than south-facing standard panels with 53% coverage. As a result, almost 100% of the soil receives sufficient sunlight at a higher degree of coverage,” they further explained.
The TNO said this new research is in line with another study published earlier this year by the Netherlands' Wageningen University & Research, on the effects of solar parks on biodiversity. “The ‘educated guess’ of the project partners is that well-designed, operated, and maintained solar parks can have a positive impact compared to well-defined reference situations, and especially compared to intensive agricultural monoculture use,” Wim Sinke, principal scientist for solar energy at the energy transition unit of TNO, told pv magazine in May 2021.

Nuclear power delivers almost 20% of all electricity in the United States, and about 50% of all low-emission electricity. Moreover, the United States has almost 100 nuclear power units operating more than 90% of the time, providing a steady base of power generation.
But moving forward, it seems nuclear has lost its swagger. Price increases, project delays, and cancellations have caused what may prove to be generational damage to nuclear power’s reputation. pv magazine USA has previously reported on industry pricing models, showing nuclear’s lagging pricing.
Now, Georgia Power’s Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4 – the nation’s only nuclear generating units currently under construction – have announced further delays and price increases. Conservative cost estimates suggest the two 1.117 GW facilities will require at least $30 billion to complete, including $3 billion in finance costs and $27 billion in construction costs.
Solar+storage costs
As solar and energy storage professionals, we must be conscious of the limitations of the sun, and the cost of energy storage. As we all know, the sun also sets. And while research suggests we can power 80% of the U.S. with wind, solar, and 12 hours of energy storage, being able to replace a nuclear power plant that runs 24/7/365 in wind, rain, snow, and sleet simply hasn’t been financially viable.
But is it today?
The chart above shows the price of solar panels from 1976 through the end of 2019. Here, we see prices fall by more than 99.8% from over $100 per watt down to nearly $0.20 per watt. Below, we see the price of battery packs starting in 2010 and ending in 2020, based on data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Here, we see costs fall from $1,191/kWh to $137/kWh – a price decrease of greater than 88%.

In both cases, we can expect prices to continue trending downward in both the middle and long term. And so, what can we expect to pay when we replace a nuclear power plant with solar power plus batteries?
Cash to spend
The new Vogtle reactors are rated at 1.117 GW each. Roughly, they’ll run at a 90% capacity factor. On an annual basis, the two units will generate 17.6 billion carbon-free kilowatt-hours of electricity. Already on site are two earlier nuclear units which have been running since 1987 and 1989.
To generate that volume of electricity from solar power on an annual basis, Georgia would need about 7.3 GWdc of solar panels running at a 26% capacity factor. That would be equivalent to roughly 7% of the current U.S. installed solar capacity, which currently sits at just over 100 GW.
The resulting total capacity is now 10.55 GWdc of solar power. However, this 7.3 GWdc figure does not take into account battery charging losses or reduced sunlight in winter. So let’s offset battery charging losses by upsizing two-thirds of the solar (the amount to be stored) by 20%. Next, let’s account for reduced winter sunlight by increasing the total system capacity by another 20%.
In order to replace the two nuclear plants while the sun is down, the batteries would need to replicate two 1.117 GW power sources for 16 hours. The total energy storage capacity would be 39.3 GWh, after we add an extra 10% for safe measure.
Roughly speaking, the total cost of these solar+storage facilities would be:
So, Georgia, pv magazine USA just saved you more than $13 billion (as of today, anyway).
Some caveats
It’s almost certain that a solar facility of this magnitude – roughly 27,000 acres, or around 0.07% of Georgia’s land – would be split among many landowners in the state. If land lease rates in Georgia are comparable to what  might be earned in Pennsylvania, the project could provide as much as $27 million per year in income to Georgia landowners for decades to come.
Furthermore, the solar power plants would start generating electricity and revenue within about three years of the first signature, and two years after groundbreaking. The new Vogtle reactors began construction in 2013 (planning began much earlier), and are projected to complete in 2022-23.
With these considerations in mind, the repowering costs to get a solar+storage facility to a 40 to 80-year lifetime would likely be offset by the fact that the solar facility will enter service at least eight years earlier than the equivalent nuclear site. Additionally, during the solar plant’s operating lifetime, it saves massive amounts of regular operations and maintenance costs, as well as specialist engineer labor costs. The nuclear facility will easily last 40 years, and potentially as long as 80. However, the ongoing operations and maintenance costs are significant, as well as upgrades and equipment replacements that start to become necessary after 40 years. And sometimes, those $1 billion dollar upgrades go wrong, and a nuclear power plant gets trashed.
When we do repower the batteries and solar panels, they almost certainly will be cheaper, and operate at a higher efficiency, likely stretching the life of the solar facility to 50+ years. Again, this solar+storage facility would generate 20% more juice in the summer (when the power is needed most in Georgia) because we oversized it for the winter.
In the end, it would be best if we had a healthy ecosystem of clean energy generation systems that include nuclear. However, if we’re going to debate the costs of nukes vs. solar, then it is no longer a discussion.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/09/synchronous-condensers-to-lift-constraints-on-renewables-in-south-australia/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 9, 2021",Synchronous condensers to lift constraints on renewables in South Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Over the past couple of years, “synchronous condenser” has become a dirty word, as it has denoted a last-minute requirement for renewable energy projects seeking to connect to sections of the Australian grid that suffer from system strength issues. The big spinning machines could add unbudgeted millions of dollars to projects already in development. But strategically placed synchronous condensers, installed by network providers to enable greater penetration of renewables into the National Electricity Market, are a whole other matter.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) gave notice last week that two synchronous condensers, installed by South Australian transmission provider ElectraNet, have been commissioned and completed. Two more syncons at Robertstown, South Australia, will be commissioned later this month.
ElectraNet determined that synchronous condensers are the lowest-cost option for addressing system strength, which is typically related to the management of minor fluctuations in supply and demand on the network. They can also be used to resolve problems related to inertia – the maintenance of stable system frequency, despite such minor fluctuations – in the presence of growing renewable energy generation in the Australian state.
That is, they replace the need to call on gas generators to manage gaps in asynchronous generation, delivering an estimated “net saving to customers equivalent to AUD 3 ($2.20) to AUD 5 a year on a typical South Australian residential electricity bill,” while also reducing fossil-fuel emissions from gas in the national account, says ElectraNet.
The implication for solar and wind farms in South Australia, which are generally restricted in their combined output to a maximum of around 1.3 GW to keep the current system in balance, is bottom-line changing. The AEMO has said that the four syncons will enable the limit on renewables – also known as asynchronous, inverter-based generation – to be raised to a maximum of 2.5 GW, which should enable the state’s existing solar and wind farms to generate at capacity.
These completed projects, along with renewable generation rippling down the pipeline – such as Iberdrola’s Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park with 107 MW of solar, partnered with 210 MW of wind – will also find greater purchase when Project Energy Connect, a AUD 2.3 billion, 800 MW capacity transmission link to New South Wales and Victoria, is completed in 2025. Their generation will also be able to access interstate demand.
System strength-boosting syncons, batteries to super-soak up peak variable renewable generation, and judicious network upgrades are also being combined in Victoria as a more flexible alternative to massive investment in transmission and distribution networks. In May, Victorian distribution provider Powercor announced a plan to position 16 syncons, 20 batteries adjacent to substations in its network, and selected network augmentation to support the state government’s push to a 45% to 50% decrease in emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.
The combined effect of Powercor's investment will unlock more than 1.3 GW of large-scale renewable generation and enable greater distributed rooftop penetration, the company said. It claimed that it will also improve the reliability of the regional network by an average of 22%.
The promise of the Robertstown and Davenport syncons to enable more renewable generation to feed into the grid will be realized in stages, said the AEMO. The first stage of plant commissioning and testing is currently underway.
In the second stage, the AEMO will monitor the syncons’ interaction with the grid. At two weeks of smooth operations, it will progressively lift constraints currently binding asynchronous generators in South Australia. The third stage will involve an extended monitoring period from six to 12 weeks after the first stage, during which time AEMO will seek to transition the state system to running “a minimum” of two synchronous, gas-fired generators.
Although the renewables industry and investors might be excited about the unleashing of previously curtailed renewable energy capacity, the AEMO has warned that during monitoring, if it is “not satisfied with the performance of the synchronous condensers,” it might “extend this monitoring period and [continue to] limit asynchronous generation” in South Australia.
The research and modeling of the effects of the syncons are expected to be borne out, however. This will allow old-tech synchronous condensers to take a respected, if not “heroic” place in the energy-transition landscape.
