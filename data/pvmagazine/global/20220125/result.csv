https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/25/nickel-zinc-batteries-for-large-scale-backup-power/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 25, 2022",Nickel-zinc batteries for large scale backup power,"Oregon-based battery manufacturer ZincFive will provide its nickel-zinc batteries to data center developer Wyoming Hyperscale White Box to equip its upcoming facility in Aspen, Wyoming. The data center will be the first of its kind to utilize nickel-zinc battery-based uninterruptible power supply (UPS) as its sole source of backup energy storage, complementing its commitment to minimizing its environmental footprint.
In the first phase of the Aspen project, Wyoming Hyperscale is looking to deliver up to 30MW of capacity, with energy supplied by nearby wind farms. It hopes to commission ZincFive’s BC Series UPS Battery Cabinets later this year.
An alternative to lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries typically used in data centers, the nickel-zinc batteries are touted as superior in terms of environmental footprint, while offering further benefits in terms of performance, reliability, and safety.
ZincFive BC Series cabinets come in the range of 37kWh to 39kWh capacity and are compatible with megawatt-class UPS inverters. According to ZincFive, its NiZn battery’s high-power density makes it capable of providing immediate power in applications requiring high discharge rates. Its lifespan can be up to 15 years, while its roundtrip efficiency stands at 85%.
ZincFive says its batteries have twice the power density of lead-acid batteries at approximately 50% the weight of their counterparts. Its other technical advantages include safety, reliability, and sustainability. The company's patented nickel-zinc technology is said to come with a smaller footprint, minimal maintenance requirements, no thermal runaway, and the higher reliability demanded for data centers.
Unlike lead-acid and lithium-ion chemistries, a weak or depleted NiZn cell remains conductive, allowing the string to continue operating, the company claims. ZincFive batteries were tested at the cell level to UL 9540A and did not exhibit thermal runaway in any of the five tests. A third-party life cycle analysis has validated that ZincFive's nickel-zinc batteries have a significantly lower climate impact than lead-acid and lithium-ion chemistries.
Nickel-zinc cells have been around for more than a century – originally invented by Thomas Edison – but fell out of favor to newer designs due to their limitations such as a low number of charge cycles – an issue ZincFive claims to have solved. The company started out in 2016 by making NiZn batteries for traffic control systems and has been awarded more than 90 patents to date.
Today, ZincFive provides high-power NiZn-based battery solutions for uninterruptible power supply, industrial starter, grid storage, and EV charging applications. Its suite of solutions includes generator starter systems as well as >300kW battery cabinets. Its systems are designed as drop-in replacements compatible with starters, inverters and UPS developed for use with lead-acid batteries.
ZincFive’s BC Series UPS Battery Cabinets are not the only innovation implemented by Wyoming Hyperscale. Its Aspen facility will seek to further reduce its energy consumption with the help of liquid cooling with zero water use in addition to using renewable power and heat to lower its environmental footprint. “This project will showcase to the world cutting-edge technologies that can take data center sustainability to new heights,” said Wyoming Hyperscale founder Trenton Thornock.

China will account for 62-66% of total demand, driven by state-owned enterprises keen to show compliance with national decarbonization goals,” wrote BloombergNEF. BloombergNEF predicts that the US will be the second-largest electrolyzer market this year. “U.S. developers will rush to announce projects in 2022, as the government readies a multi-billion-dollar investment in hydrogen as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. But with actual funding spread over the next five years, construction is likely to lag.” BloombergNEF also expects at least four hydrogen companies to go public in 2022, the number of countries with a hydrogen strategy to jump from 26 to 48, and the industry’s focus on green ammonia and alkaline electrolyzers.
Spain’s State Research Agency has awarded a grant to a three-year hydrogen project led by University of Cantabria (UC) researchers. The so-called S2H project, financed with funds from the European Union, aims to obtain hydrogen by a photocatalysis process using sunlight and seawater as a raw material. “This change of raw material is accompanied by a change of technology and, instead of electrolysis, we are going to develop a photocatalytic process,” commented Inmaculada Ortiz, head of the research group on Advanced Separation Processes (PAS), of the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department.
Non-recyclable waste plastics to hydrogen technology company Hydrogen Utopia International signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Mitsubishi will review the technology and explore the commercial opportunities for developing waste plastic to hydrogen facilities. “Mitsubishi will have a period of one year to review the technology under the LOI, unless extended by mutual consent. Any decision to deploy the technology would be subject to further detailed agreement(s) between the parties,” the London-based company wrote last week, adding that the deal could open the doors for the technology in Japan. Earlier this year, Japanese financial paper Nikkei wrote that three Japanese companies (Toyota, industrial gases company Iwatani, and engineer JGC) are working to use plastic waste to produce hydrogen by 2025.
General Motors announced new commercial applications for its fuel cell technology from heavy-duty trucks to aerospace and locomotives. “These fuel cell generators could ultimately replace gas- and diesel-burning generators with fewer emissions at worksites, buildings, movie sets, data centers, outdoor concerts and festivals. They could also back up or temporarily replace grid-sourced electricity for residential and small commercial enterprises at times of power disruption,” wrote GM last week.
The US Department of Energy announced a US$420 million funding opportunity for DOE’s Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) and launched its H2 Matchmaker, an online information resource to assist hydrogen suppliers and users. The funding will advance climate solutions through early-stage research on clean energy technology, including carbon capture technology. The H2 Matchmaker aims to identify opportunities to expand development toward realizing regional hydrogen hubs. Last December, Nebraska-based hydrogen company Monolith received conditional approval for a $1.04 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy.
The German government asked the European Commission to reconsider its support for gas and nuclear, saying that crucial to the classification as a transition technology is that gas-fired power plants support the rapid transition to renewables, and convert their operations to hydrogen. The focus is on hydrogen-ready facilities. “To make rapid progress here, the necessary investments to upgrade the energy system must be initiated today,” the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action wrote last week. The ministry led by Robert Habeck, together with environment minister Steffi Lemke, asked the European executive body to remove the intermediate targets for hydrogen in the EU rules for sustainable investment.”The intermediate steps required for the fuel switch, with blending rates of decarbonized gases of 30% by 2026 and 55% by 2030, cannot be realistically achieved. In the market ramp-up phase with scarce availabilities, the intermediate steps may hinder the switch to renewable hydrogen in other sectors,” the German government wrote on Friday.

The company was followed by Trina Solar, JA Solar, and JinkoSolar, with the latter losing the first position reached a year earlier. Canadian Solar and Risen reached the fifth and sixth positions, respectively, followed by two non-Chinese producers, Hanwha Q Cells and First Solar. Another two Chinese providers, Suntech and Chint, ranked number nine and 10, respectively. According to PVInfolink,  the top 10 manufacturers accounted for over 160GW of shipments for a global market share of 90% in 2021.
Soaring demand for polysilicon last year is expected to see manufacturer GCL-Poly complete a stunning 12-month turnaround, the company announced yesterday. GCL expects the RMB5.7 billion (US$900 million) net loss it posted in 2020 to have become an RMB5 billion (US$789 million) net profit by the end of December, with the annual figures expected to be confirmed at the end of March. That remarkable figure came on the back of demand which outstripped supply of the solar panel raw material, which fetched higher prices as a result. GCL said 18% of last year’s polysilicon output was based on the company’s less energy-intensive granular material and added, 20,000 of the 30,000 tons of annual granular production capacity it constructed last year is already operational with the balance due online next month. The poly maker said its solar materials division is expected to have recorded an RMB5.4 billion (US$853 million) profit last year, following a loss of RMB4.9 billion (US$774 million) a year earlier. The company’s figures were dragged by the performance of its GCL New Energy solar project development business, which sold off 4GW of its 5GW solar project generation capacity in 2021. Those sales, though, also reduced debt repayments. With no repeat of 2020’s one-off impairment costs, GCL said losses at its New Energy business unit last year would be around half the RMB1.22 billion (US$193 million) shed in 2020.
Energy company Tian Lun Gas has announced a strategic co-operation agreement with state-owned utility PowerChina to develop renewable generation, including photovoltaics. PV sites will be identified and developed by the partners, along with energy storage, wind, and biogas facilities, and PowerChina’s gas vehicle filling stations will have solar installed as part of a transformation into smart charging stations, Tian Lun Gas said on Friday. The partners will also establish industrial parks for the energy-intensive industry to maximize industrial heat networks and the reuse of waste gas and liquids. The partnership will encompass the development of smart cities, Tian Lun Gas said, in part drawing upon its “rich natural gas market advantages.”
Solar manufacturer JinkoSolar has announced its main operating unit will make its debut on the Sci-Tech innovation board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange tomorrow.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/25/huge-aluminum-demand-expected-in-solar-industry-concerns-arise-on-emissions/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 25, 2022","Huge aluminum demand expected in solar industry, concerns arise on emissions","Owing to its high conductivity, low weight and excellent corrosion resistance, aluminium is one of the key raw materials in the solar industry used in cells, module frames, mountings and inverters. While abundant and cheap, the primary production of aluminium comes at a high cost in terms of energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions, which will need to be taken into consideration if we are  to rapidly reduce emissions to ‘net zero’ and limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius.
A group of researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have sounded the alarm bell about the climate pressure aluminium could create if we were to solely rely on primary production by 2050. They found that the growth to 60TW of PV, envisaged by the broad electrification scenarios of recent photovoltaic roadmaps, could require up to 486 MT of aluminium by 2050. This enormous manufacturing task could in turn undermine PV's green credentials due to its large global warming potential.
“If the emissions intensity of the primary production process is not reduced, then more than 3000 Mt CO2e could be released in the atmosphere,” researcher Alison Lennon, told pv magazine. “However, if we can decarbonise the electricity used to smelt aluminium, utilize as much secondary aluminium as possible and collect and re-use aluminium from old modules, then we can significantly curtail this global warming.”
Namely, to have more than 60TW of PV installed by 2050, up from just over 700GWp at the end of 2020, we would need to produce up to 4.5TW of additional capacity each year. The researchers modelled different primary production emissions reduction scenarios to 2050 targets of 1.5 (base scenario), 3.5, 5.5 and 7.5 t CO2e t aluminium and compared this to the worst case scenario in which the emissions intensity is unchanged from the 2020 levels with a primary production emissions intensity of 14.5 tones of carbon dioxide for each tone of aluminium produced.
They considered process improvements directed at reducing direct emissions, potential alternatives to aluminium and the use of recycled content in the aluminium as the most efficient way to reducing the material's global warming potential. They reminded that aluminium is attractive to recycle because its secondary production requires only around 5% of the energy required for primary production and generates just 3–5% of the emissions from primary production. In their analysis, the percentage of recycled content in the aluminium used for the added capacity was assumed to linearly increase from 34% in 2020 to 75% in 2050.
Finally, the researchers underlined that efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of aluminium production need to happen within the next 10 years to provide the best opportunity of keeping emissions to below 1,000 Mt of CO2 equivalent by 2050. Their research was published in the journal Nature Sustainability.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/25/enel-mulls-building-3gw-heterojunction-solar-module-factory-in-the-us/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 25, 2022",Enel mulls building heterojunction solar module factory in the US,"In a press briefing held on Tuesday, new CEO of Enel Green Power (EGP), Salvatore Bernabei, discussed the developments EGP is undertaking in its renewable energy business and revealed its current strategy for its solar module manufacturing business.
“The capacity of our factory in Catania is currently only 200MW per year and, in order to achieve the best possible price, we need to increase the scale,” he told pv magazine, referring to the funding that the company recently received from the European Commission to scale up the manufacturing facility. “We are planning to start the works for the enlargement of the factory soon. We will add a new building close to the existing one.”
The factory is expected to begin manufacturing activities by the end of 2023 and to reach full capacity by mid-2024.
“Taking into that 3GW is a relatively small size compared to the huge development of PV in the world, we may consider building another factory with a ‘copy and paste' approach out of Italy, like for instance in the United States,” Bernabei said. “Once we will have the first factory working, I think it will be a good idea to replicate this facility in other geographies.”

The CEO also revealed that EGP is currently developing its next-generation solar module technology based on tandem cells relying on perovskites. “In five years from now, we will see this technology achieve efficiencies over 30%, which means 50% more compared to the current efficiencies,” he said. “The funds awarded by the EU will not be used only to scale up the factory in southern Italy, but also for further developing our heterojunction technology and the tandem modules. Our competitive advantage here is the technical know-how for these two technologies.”
Bernabei further explained that EGP is betting on other innovations for its solar modules. “We will also work to launch a new technology to replace glass with cheaper plastic,” he stated. “It will enable us to produce lighter panels that will be easier to install.”
EGP deployed around 2.24GW of new solar capacity in 2021, according to data released during the press briefing, and this year it is expected to add another 6.1GW of renewable energy capacity. In the 2022-2024 period, the company should install 21.2GW. “The proportion should be 60% of solar and 40% of wind power,” Bernabei said.
In 2021, EGP deployed 220MW of battery capacity for the first time. “The growth in the pipeline of projects under development was also notable, reaching approximately 370GW, which includes renewables, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and capacity already in execution,” the company said in a statement.

The IEC61215 and IEC61730-certified panel features 108 half-cells based on M10 wafers and a 10-busbar design. It has overall dimensions of 1,722×1,134×3.5mm and weighs in at 21.8kg.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. It comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.341% per degree Celsius and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, the manufacturer claims.
“The new modules are suitable for short frame side clamping, and are designed for residential, small–scale commercial and industrial rooftop installations,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The low weight and dimension make these modules easy and comfortable for transport, handling and installation.”
The module is fabricated with a white backsheet and anti-reflective, highly-transmissive, low iron tempered glass, and a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy and silver. The Japanese manufacturer said that its half-cut modules feature three small junction boxes, instead of one; all with bypass diodes. These enclosures transfer less heat to the upper cells, which helps to extend the lifetime of panels while improving overall system performance, it claimed.

“The application of active balancing will ensure that the battery system always is in the best performance condition, hence improving the service life of the battery. Also, it can make the battery system adapt to diverse load conditions, meanwhile greatly reducing the cost of maintenance and increasing system reliability, stability and load adaptability,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “It is currently being sold in all markets and is also suitable for utility scale projects.
The battery module is sold with a capacity ranging from 100 to 200Ah and a storage capacity of 7.68kWh. The voltage range spans from 67.2-87.6V to 33.6-43.8V, and the voltage from 76.8V to 38.4V.
The product measures 360x280x660mm and has a weight ranging from 76 to 76.5kg. Up to 19 battery modules can be stacked together in a battery cabinet to reach a storage capacity of 145.92kWh, with a rated voltage of 729.6V. The battery also features IP20 protection and a battery management system.
The product with the active balancing technology is offered with a 10-year product warranty, and the battery without the new feature maintains a five-year warranty. The performance of both devices is guaranteed for up to 6,000 cycles.
“Lithium batteries in the running process are affected by a variety of features, such as over-voltage, under-voltage, overcharge, discharge, thermal runaway and voltage imbalance between batteries,” the manufacturer said in a statement, noting that the most important factor among those cited is voltage imbalance, as it reduces the capacity of each battery module in a battery cabinet.
The company explained that the weakest battery module determines the performance of the overall battery pack and that, in order to ensure the overall performance of the battery pack, each cell in the battery pack should be balanced to lower the voltage difference between the cells as much as possible.
The manufacturer also emphasized that its dissipative balancing technology equalizes the state of charge (SOC) of each cell by dissipating the energy from the higher SOC cell, stating: “Our balancing technology transfers energy from a cell with a higher SOC to a cell with a lower SOC, so that the SOC of each cell is equal.”

The London-based business, which bills itself as a “next-generation utility,” said the fact the KES1.6 billion (€12.3 million) loan is denominated in local currency will encourage other commercial lenders in Africa to fund solar projects.
Announcing the finance package today, Bboxx said the cash would pay for equipment including 89,600 solar home systems plus appliances such as solar-powered telephones and fridges, with all of the gear destined for Kenya and some 80% of the anticipated 470,000 people to benefit living in rural areas. The company added, the finance will also lead to the creation of 100 new long-term jobs in the country.
The loan was secured from Mauritian-owned SBM Bank Kenya and three-quarters of the sum has been guaranteed by London-based financial services entity GuarantCo. The latter body is funded by the governments of the U.K., Switzerland, Australia, and Sweden, via the Private Infrastructure Development Group trust; and by the Netherlands through its international development bank the FMO (Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden). French public funds supply a standby facility, if needed, to back GuarantCo, and government department Global Affairs Canada has financed the organization with a loan.
Quoted in a press release issued this morning by Bboxx to announce the loan, chief executive Mansoor Hamayun said: “We are very pleased to partner with GuarantCo and SBM Bank to accelerate access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy to hundreds of thousands of Kenyans. This fund marks a big milestone in our industry’s history. This transaction shows what is possible to achieve when forging partnerships between different stakeholders to mobilize private capital to the energy sector.”

They claim that this eliminates the need for a spin coater or other large-area techniques such as slot-die coating or blade coating.
“This method enables the deposition of the perovskite film incredibly cheaply as well as effectively,” researcher Nazila Zarabinia told pv magazine. “The trick to achieving good solar cell efficiency is to soak the piece of paper in an anti-solvent before drawing the applicator over the precursor liquid.”
They said the novel applicator has better porosity and smoothness than other soft applicators for the deposition of high-quality perovskite films. They described the “deposition via an antisolvent soaked applicator (DASSA)” technique as an easily scalable process to produce uniform, pinhole-free perovskite films.
“We think this simple method will appeal to all those labs setting up a line in perovskite research who have not been able, for money or time, to buy expensive deposition equipment since it enables the deposition of the perovskite film incredibly cheaply,” researcher Thomas Brown explained. “It can also be of particular interest to groups developing automated printing techniques by applying the anti-solvent, not on the perovskite film as usual, but on the applicator instead.”

The research group tested the process on a solar cell based on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.7%.
“When the paper applicator was soaked in the green antisolvent, ethyl acetate, the maximum PCE jumped to 11.1%,” the scientists said. “By soaking the applicator with antisolvent, double cation perovskite films with increased uniformity, crystallinity, and better-interconnection were obtained as evidenced by analysis of the PL, SEM, and XRD measurements.”
For comparison, a similar device developed with spin coating and an antisolvent method achieved an efficiency of 14.9 %. The researchers said that this shows there is scope for further improvement.
“Setting up an automated system that would carry out the application more precisely compared to the manual deposition we implemented here would improve macroscopic and microscopic film uniformity as well as performance and reproducibility,” they said.
The researchers described the new manufacturing process in “Simple and effective deposition method for solar cell perovskite films using a sheet of paper,” which was recently published in iScience.

The Renewable Energy Market Analysis: Africa and its Regions study highlights the strong progress made in deploying solar equipment in East Africa, notably in Kenya, and also spells out how far behind the Central Africa region is lagging.
Between 2016 and 2019, around 8.5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa gained access to some form of solar equipment, ranging from solar lights to mini-grid connections, according to the report, with the East Africa region leading the way.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
With 1,500 clean energy mini-grids operating across the continent today, according to the authors of the study, and plans laid for a further 4,000, almost 700,000 people have access to electricity connections from such systems.
The AfDB-IRENA document noted 17 million Kenyans have been provided with access to some form of solar equipment since 2010, in an East Africa region which, according to IRENA, boasts 1.06TW of Africa's total technical solar generation capacity potential of 7.9TW.
And with four times more people in East Africa than in Southern Africa using some form of decentralized energy system at the end of 2019, Kenya accounted for 42% of such regional equipment, well clear of Ethiopia, which accounted for the second largest proportion, with 21%.
The contrast with Central Africa was clear, according to the report, with a relatively few 3.5 million people in that region using solar lanterns and only 294,000 or so enjoying access to mini-grid connections in a region in which only 32% of people have access to electricity and only 17% benefit from clean cooking facilities.
In populous West Africa, the report noted, around 10 million people had access to some form of solar in 2019.
The continent may have accounted for 70% of global spending on off-grid renewables from 2010 to 2020 – securing $1.7 billion – but clean energy investment has fallen back dramatically since peaking at $10.3 billion in 2018, with almost half of that year's figure – $5.2 billion – invested in photovoltaics and solar thermal equipment. That bumper year saw the installation of 2.9GW of the 10.4GW of solar generation capacity – including concentrating solar plants – which arrived between 2010 and 2020 in Africa.
Since then, though, IRENA and the AfDB noted, investment has fallen back to average $1.3 billion per year in 2019 and 2020, ensuring the dream of providing universal access to electricity this decade appears as far away as ever.

It claims the K100D00 bracket can reduce installation times by up to 80%, while avoiding holes and rooftop leakage risks. It is printed on galvanized sheet metal and is shaped like a classic roof tile. The company is now making the brackets at its facility in Marostica, in the northern Italian region of Veneto.
“This shape allows for the best arrangement of the bracket inside all the roofing membranes developed with tiles, allowing a quick installation while keeping the characteristics intact aesthetics and physics of the structure,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The stainless steel bracket can be deployed by quickly cleaning the cover surface and removing undesired material underneath. It can then be fixed onto the surface with dowels or glue.
“This methodology allows not to drill the roof, guaranteeing the tightness of the atmospheric agents of the waterproofing layer,” the spokesperson said, noting that the bracket weighs just 1.19 kg.

Sun Age said the bracket can be used in combination with mounting structures from any manufacturer and with all types of PV modules, including larger, high-power solar panels.  “The larger is the panel the bigger is the number of brackets that needs to be installed,” the spokesperson said.
The solar modules can be fixed directly on the bracket with special pins.
“Developing a system in this way leads to having the maximum possibility of customizing the brackets, allowing perfect adherence to customer requirements,” the spokesperson said.
Sun Age has the capacity to produce around 3,000 brackets per month. It is available in Italy and various European markets.
“It costs around €11 ($12.40) per piece and significantly reduces the installation time,” the spokesperson said.

Spanish battery provider Enercraft has launched a portable battery for multiple uses.
The Energy Mobile Assistant (EMA) storage system is offered in three different models, called the EMA 104, EMA 110, and EMA 112. All of them have the same storage capacity, of 1kWh, but provide the user with different outputs, from 400-600W for the EMA 104; 1-1.5kW for the EMA 110; and from 1.2-1.8kW for the EMA 112.
Each EMA system contains a configuration of high-quality lithium batteries, a charger and an inverter, all fully integrated in a hermetic and protective case which facilitates transport and the freedom users demand.
According to the manufacturer, the battery does not emit noise, odor, or harmful gases, and is a clean energy alternative for use in multiple activities. “Our product is sold as [a] portable energy [source] for common and daily tasks that must be carried out at home,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
“The ability to recharge EMA batteries with 100% clean energy from renewable energy sources, such as a PV system, will give … users total freedom to store and transport their energy wherever it is needed, to be, finally, managed and used without [condition] or limitations of any kind,” the spokesperson went on to say.
All the battery models are equipped with a protective, waterproof and impact-proof case. “Providing energy with a pure sine wave allows [the] powering [of] sensitive electrical or electronic equipment such as LEDs, televisions, electro-medical devices or sound equipment, among [other devices], something that is not advisable to do with common generator sets,” the spokesperson concluded.

Indian solar manufacturer RenewSys has revealed that its annual solar cell encapsulant manufacturing output has reached 3GW with the recent commissioning of a new encapsulant line at its facility in Bengaluru, India. The new line is capable of manufacturing ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyolefin elastomer (POE) sheets.
The company aims to significantly expand its encapsulant output to 11 GW by adding another 8 GW in phases. It has already started working on the addition of another gigawatt of encapsulant production capacity, which will ramp up its total capacity to 4 GW.
“It is an exciting time to be in the solar manufacturing industry in India,” said Avinash Hiranandani, global chief executive officer and managing director at RenewSys. “More organizations and homeowners are looking to switch to solar now, than ever before.”
RenewSys recently unveiled a new EVA encapsulant, CONSERV Ultra plus (U+). The thermo-efficient encapsulant reduces the curing time per PV module cycle by two to three minutes, increasing the efficiency of the module manufacturing line by 10% to 20%.
Mumbai-based RenewSys is an integrated manufacturer of solar PV modules. Its key components include encapsulants (3 GW), backsheets (4 GW), and PV cells (130 MW). Since its inception in 2011, the company has supplied more than 15 GW of PV encapsulant and backsheet materials throughout the world.

KPS Power Generation, a Pacific Energy subsidiary, said it has delivered a “world first” hybrid power station incorporating a 3.5 MW solar PV array and electric turbo compounding (ETC) tech fitted to an existing 10 MW diesel generator at Iluka Resources’ Jacinth-Ambrosia mine site in remote northwestern South Australia.
Pacific Energy Chief Executive Jamie Cullen said the combination of solar PV with ETC technology, which improves the efficiency of diesel generators by recovering waste energy from the exhaust, is like nothing seen before.
“This is an exciting development for both Pacific Energy and Iluka Resources in what we believe is a world first – integrating solar and ETC technology with an existing fossil-fuel facility,” he said.
Juwi Renewable Energy, the Brisbane-based subsidiary of Germany's Juwi, built the renewable energy/diesel hybrid power solution. It incorporates solar PV generation with ETC technology and an upgraded control system. The ETC technology allows the diesel generators to maintain the same power output while using less fuel and producing lower CO2 emissions, The technology has been fitted to each of the existing 10 1 MW generators.
Cullen said the conversion to a hybrid power solution would go a long way to reducing the mine’s electricity demand. The power plant is expected to deliver almost 21% of the mine site’s annual electricity needs.
“The reduction in diesel consumption and improvement in fuel efficiency is expected to save over 2 million litres of diesel and over 5,500 tons of CO2 per year, every year, for at least the next seven years,” he said.
Shane Tilka, general manager for Australian at Iluka Resources, said the shift to a hybrid solution at the Jacinth-Ambrosia operation is exactly what the company needed to do.
“The move from diesel to hybrid energy at Jacinth Ambrosia marks an important evolution in Iluka’s Australian operations. With the large solar resources available to us, the conversion is aligned with Iluka’s purpose to deliver sustainable value,” he said. “The mineral sands and rare earths produced by Iluka are used in a range of sustainable development and renewable energy applications, including solar panels and wind turbines. It is exciting to see our first site powered by the same technology for which the products we mine and process are essential to manufacture.”
KPS, which has operated the 10 MW diesel facility at the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine site since it opened in 2009, will own and operate the hybrid project for an initial term of seven years. The Jacinth-Ambrosia project is Juwi's sixth hybrid project in Australia. It said hybrid solutions have become a focus for its Australian unit.
Juwi is also responsible for Western Australia’s Sandfire DeGrussa Hybrid Project, which features 10.6 MW of PV, a 6 MW battery and a diesel generator. It has been operating since 2016.
