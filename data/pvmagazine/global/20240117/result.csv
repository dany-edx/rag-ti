France deployed around 921 MW of new PV systems in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to new figures released by French grid operator Enedis. For all of 2023, the country added 3,135 MW of new solar capacity.
The results represent a 30% increase from 2022, when around 2.6 GW of solar was installed. In 2021, the nation added 2.8 GW of new PV capacity.
Enedis said the figures for 2023 are provisional, so the total could actually be higher. The grid operator said that one-third of the capacity installed last year, or around 1,122 MW, came from PV systems under the national self-consumption scheme. It noted that self-consumption PV capacity almost doubled to reach 2,256 MW.
“The results of this year must be recognized and supported,” said Daniel Bour, president of Enerplan, the French solar association. “2024 will, logically, amplify these results, following the new regulatory provisions, with an objective that we expect to be well above 4 GW.”

Jinchen plans to issue 22,527,596 A-shares to 13 specific investors, in order to raise CNY 1 billion. The average issuing price per share will be CNY 44.39, or a 17% discount from Jinchen's closing price on Wednesday. The company plans to allocate 41% to its East China smart production project, focusing on module automation lines and cell automation equipment. It will invest 31% of the funds in R&D and PVD equipment production, which will serve as the core technology for its heterojunction production lines. It said the remaining 28% will be used for working capital.
Sungold Solar, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer of flexible solar panels and portable solar panels, has secured SGS IEC TS 63163 certification for its Hi-Power range of products. The line includes the Sungold Solar HP-D2, HP-D, and HP-S series of products.
Shenzhen S.C New Energy Technology has canceled a planned private placement on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The Chinese equipment supplier originally aimed to raise approximately CNY 880 million to expand its perovskite equipment operations. The plan, initially proposed in November 2023, involved the issuance of convertible corporate bonds to undisclosed parties, in order to support its R&D efforts, improve its perovskite equipment production, and shore up its working capital.

In addition, the regulator has updated the regulated tariff for electricity sold to the grid from storage systems during evening peak demand.
“Although the Israeli regulation enables the construction of rooftop plants of up to 630 KW, our analysis showed that the majority of applications are for plants of up to 200 KW,” the Electricity Authority said in a statement. “It seems that the tariff, last updated in 2021, has no longer incentivized the construction of larger plants. Therefore, we decided to update it upwards.”
According to the regulator’s decision paper, the tariff has been changed according to a set of formulas. However, it did offer examples for the change. For 630 kW projects, the tariff will increase by 33%, from ILS 0.2436 ($0.065)/kWh to ILS 0.3248/kWh.
The tariff for 500 kW rooftop PV plants will increase by 30%, from ILS 0.2577/kWh to ILS 0.3353/kWh, while 300 kW projects will get a tariff increases of 22%, from ILS 0.3035/kWh to ILS 0.3693/kWh. Rooftop arrays of 200 kW in size will get an increase of 15%, from ILS 0.3328/kWh to ILS 0.3821/kWh. The tariff for 100 kW projects will remain unchanged at ILS 0.4205/kWh.
For owners of storage systems, the tariff for peak demand will depend on the season and the capacity of the attached rooftop PV. Owners of rooftop PV arrays up to 300 kW in size will be able to sell electricity for ILS 1.3424/kWh during the summer, for ILS 0.932/kWh during the winter, and for 0.3721/kWh during fall and spring. Owners of batteries with PV plants ranging in size from 300 kW to 630 kW will be able to sell power for 1.2011/kWh, 0.8839/kWh, and 0.3329/kWh, respectively.

Findings published in the global agency’s “Science Report 2021” state that Arab countries have increased their global share of academic articles on solar photovoltaics to almost 8% by the end of the last decade.
Join SunRise Arabia Clean Energy Conference in Riyadh on Jan. 31, 2024, to reveal crucial insights and strategies for accessing the market
This was up from a 4.6% share of the world’s academic articles on solar halfway through the last decade and is higher than the region’s share of research in any other area of renewable energy research.
New analysis from UNESCO says this means the Arab region is now “punching above its weight for this topic,” as Arabs account for 5.3% of the global population.

Of the Arab nations, Saudi Arabia has published the most scientific output on solar, followed by Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Iraq.
When comparing the volume of publications to the population of a country, to measure the intensity of scientific output on solar photovoltaics, Qatar ranks highest, followed by Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Jordan.
Despite accelerating output, research expenditure remains well beneath 1% of gross domestic product in most Arab nations.
The two notable exceptions are Egypt, where research expenditure was 0.96% of GDP in 2021, compared to 0.53% in 2011 and the United Arab Emirates, which totaled 1.50% of GDP of research expenditure in 2021, up from 0.49% in 2011.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/17/heat-pumps-could-lift-people-out-of-fuel-poverty-say-uk-researchers/,"GEOPOLITICS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HEAT PUMPS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,UNITED KINGDOM,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 17, 2024","Heat pumps could lift people out of fuel poverty, say UK researchers","Scientists from the United Kingdom have evaluated the impact of heat pumps on fuel poverty in England and Scotland. Their analysis considered pre- and post-energy crisis prices using levels from 2019 and 2022, which were shaped by the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.
“Fuel poverty is a state where households struggle to afford the energy needed to heat their homes comfortably. The far-reaching consequences include physical and mental health issues, increased financial demands on national health systems, and environmental implications due to the energy inefficiency of fuel-poor homes,” the researchers explained. “This study uses the ‘10% definition:’ A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if its necessary fuel cost is more than 10% of the household adjusted net income.”
The researchers based their analysis on housing surveys from Scotland and England and considered net income, energy consumption, and fuel type. They found that, in pre-crises times, the fuel poverty rate in Scotland was 35.55% and 17.38% in England. This value increased in crisis time to 67.26% in Scotland and 47.68% in England.
“The Pearson correlation coefficient between the off-gas proportion and the pre-crisis fuel poverty estimation is 0.81,” the researchers said.
Heat pumps have lower running costs than off-gas, which the scientists believe is enough to lift people above the fuel poverty line. However, users have to face high up-front installation costs, which were reduced in the United Kingdom with policy support of GBP 5,000 ($6,340) during the research period. The researchers said that policy support can lead to fuel poverty reduction in at least 90.2% of regions in normal periods and in 97.6% of regions during crises in England and Scotland . Without government support, the numbers drop to 51.2% in normal times and 65.9% during crises.
The network upgrade cost is another burden to the heat pump adoption, which trickles down to household bills. It is expected that 457 out of 3,891 primary substations in England and Scotland will require upgrades to support the additional heat-pump demand. The total estimated cost of these upgrades is GBP 715.4 million, divided over a lifespan of 45 years.
“Aberdeenshire has the highest average network upgrade cost due to its relatively high proportion of off-gas homes (41.2%),” the academics explained. “In particular, the two archipelagoes in the north (the Orkney and Shetland islands) with almost 100% off-gas homes still see relatively low upgrade costs. This counterintuitive result comes from the fact that more than half of households have used electric heating. Replace these electric heaters with [heat pumps] can be less burdensome on the network due to the high [heat-pump] efficiency.”
The researchers then shifted to a cost-benefit analysis and found that certain regions such as Shetland and the Orkney Islands exhibit low costs and relatively high benefits in pre-crisis periods. In times of crisis, these areas also experience low costs and high benefits.
“In contrast, few regions, such as Aberdeenshire and East of England, see fewer benefits and high associated costs,” the group said. “These results can help policymakers design and prioritize regional [heat-pump] support mechanisms and deployments.”
The researchers presented their analysis in “Evaluating the Social Benefits and Network Costs of Heat-Pumps as an Energy Crisis Intervention,” which was recently published on iScience. The research group included academics from the University of Edinburgh and the University of Oxford.
“Our findings demonstrate that [heat-pump] benefits endure in both normal and crisis periods,” they said. “This means that even if the crisis ends before [heat-pump] adoption reaches a substantial level of impact, adopting [heat pumps] can still yield long-term benefits, particularly considering the possibility of future energy crises.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/17/pv-manufacturing-in-europe-ensuring-resilience-through-industrial-policy/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"JANUARY 17, 2024",PV Manufacturing in Europe: Ensuring resilience through industrial policy,"ETIP PV has just published an update of its White Paper on PV manufacturing originally published in May 2023. The newly updated paper focuses on three core points.
First, it evaluates how policy and regulatory frameworks have evolved for European companies in the PV sector, and compares these frameworks to the PV industrial-policy evolution of key global markets (for instance, China, India, and the USA).
Second, it discusses the resilience of the European PV value chain, and notably the long-term economic impact of the above-mentioned measures on the energy price in Europe.
Finally, it explores the role of innovation in the growing number of industrial policies in Europe, to better understand how to capitalize on Europe’s broad landscape of research institutes and innovative companies.
The European Union and European Member States are building the premises of an industrial strategy for photovoltaics and over the second half of 2023, they have announced in more detail the policies that are to support the re-industrialization of the PV value chain. Some of these policies include, but are not limited to the Net Zero Industry Act, the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, and the Critical Raw Materials Act. Other than these EU-based frameworks, each member state presents its own policy strategies, discussed in more detail in the ETIP PV’s publication.
Beyond the PV industrial policies in the EU, the paper also briefly discusses PV manufacturing policies in India, the USA, and China. India has created a specific framework for domestic manufacturers that mix provisions ranging from barriers to competitors on specific market segments, tariffs, CAPEX and OPEX support. USA has boosted its solar cell and module production capacity via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and significantly decreasing taxes and banning imports of non-ethically manufactured PV products. However, the IRA has so far not been successful across the whole value chain; for instance, no new investments into solar polysilicon have been publicly announced. Finally, China – as the leading global PV manufacturer – has had major policy incentives and manufacturing investments since 2001.  More recently, China has announced two other key programs: the Golden Sun program – to subsidize demand linked to the installation of highly efficient technologies, and the Top Runner program – to incentivize manufacturers to target the most efficient PV technologies.
The Cost of Ownership (CoO) assuming a 10 GW integrated PV manufacturing factory was analyzed for three PV technologies: TOPCon, HJT, or IBC (all of which are rapidly gaining market share because they promise higher efficiency than PERC) for China (low and high scenario), India, EU (low and high scenario), and the USA. China (low) has a 16 (TOPCon and IBC) and 17 (HJT) USDct/Wp, China (high) and India have a 19 – 21 USDct/Wp for all technologies, EU (low) has a 24 – 25 USDct/Wp, EU (high) has around 30 USDct/Wp, and the USA has around 28 – 29 USDct/Wp for all technologies. The cost variations are present due to different material, labor, equipment, and building costs – all of which are higher in the EU and the USA than in China and India.
Next, the paper explored the influence of higher module prices on the LCOE at different locations and with different capital costs. As the European economy is exiting a sustained period of low-interest rates, the impact of interest rates will be felt much more by project developers and poses an additional challenge to the imperatives of resilience. In a context of very high-interest rates (e.g. 11%), a utility scale product in a Northern European climate could be faced with projects whose LCOE is up to 25% higher for ‘resilience’ in the case of modules that are 15 cEUR/Wp more expensive to produce. This could have a significant impact on development rates. However, if the production cost difference is minimized (e.g. 5 cEUR/Wp) and interest rates remain moderate (e.g. 3%), resilience only carries a premium of around 5%.
To solve the resilience challenges, policymakers need to ensure they provide tools to minimize the production cost spread for PV manufacturers. While an important current focus of support policies in Europe lies on CAPEX, it appears clear from the cost structure of PV manufacturing (where electricity is a particularly impactful component for relative competitiveness) and the comparative success of countries opting for another approach (e.g. the US) that dedicated OPEX tools would also be relevant to consolidate the European PV industrial supply chain.
Therefore, to support the transition of European PV manufacturing toward global competitiveness (i.e. narrowing the gap on the cost/Wp differential), various measures can be relevant as it is crucial to address different gaps in the value chain.
To compete globally on introducing innovative technologies to the market, EU industrial actors focus on investing in R&I, while EU manufacturers adopt the relevant strategy of rapid manufacturing growth, which includes accessing imports of significant volumes of affordable equipment from Asia. The industry faces the challenge of the sheer scale of equipment, investments, production and delivery needed in such a short period. One of the key challenges that policymakers must address at the European and national levels is finding a balance between the need for rapid scale-up of manufacturing capacity and reaching sufficient cost-competitiveness for the short-term resilience of the European PV industry, and the need to sustain competitiveness through innovation and high-quality products to reach the market at scale for the long-term resilience of PV European market.
With the lack of multi-GW scale integrated PV manufacturing in Europe and the increasing competition with Asian machine manufacturers, European equipment manufacturers are left with difficult research and development (R&D) investment choices. In worst-case scenarios, these machine manufacturers risk the development of tools that do not penetrate the market and will not generate turnover, despite the high R&D investments.  Thus, a de-risking factor and the commitment of companies to invest in the further development of their products and services are necessary to enhance the position of European machine manufacturers and in turn the entire PV manufacturing industry.
Moreover, a supportive European R&I strategy opens new possibilities leading to the diversification of cutting-edge technologies. Topics of specific importance for machinery and equipment R&I, to name a few, include data-driven machine learning approaches, the carbon footprint of the equipment, lower consumables use, and high-quality results on the product level.
Finally, upscaling manufacturing is an important step in the short term, but providing the tools to bring new technologies to the market is also imperative since performance and technological leadership are a major component of competitiveness.
Therefore, a crucial challenge of the current industrial policy is to ensure the European PV sector will be able to ride the upcoming wave of innovative technologies, most notably with the emergence of new processes for emerging materials such as perovskites.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/17/improving-perovskite-solar-cell-performance-with-silver-nanoparticles/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 17, 2024",Improving perovskite solar cell performance with silver nanoparticles,"A group of researchers led by the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom has proposed to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by integrating silver (Ag) particles into a cell's electron transport layer (ETL).
Their work considered the utilization of an ETL based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), which they claim is the most efficient transport material used in perovskite PV devices. “Ag nanoparticles are synthesized and used to form a SnO2:Ag nanoparticle composite transport layer for the first time,” they added, referring to the novelty of their approach. “Ag is a very suitable material for nanoparticles due to its facile growth in nanostructured forms, its high conductivity at room temperature, its stability, and its plasmonic effect in the visible region of the spectrum.”
They used an approach that is commonly adopted for the development of organic and dye-sensitized PV cells, for which scientists create composite transport layers with metal nanoparticles. In these devices, the nanoparticles act as a sort of antennae that trap the light in their proximity and contribute to exciting electrons into the conduction band in a more efficient way.
The academics tested their approach in a perovskite solar cell constructed with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, an ETL based on SnO2, a perovskite absorber, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA), and an Ag metal contact, with all the cell layers being deposited in an air process.
The research team deposited Ag nanoparticles with thicknesses of 110 nm on the ETL via chemical synthesis and explained that an alternative process could be depositing thermally evaporated Ag nanoparticles between the ITO substrate and the SnO2 layer. It found, however, that only the first process can increase cell efficiency.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell built with Ag particles deposited via the chemical synthesis process achieved a power conversion efficiency of 14.3%. By way of comparison, a reference cell without Ag nanoparticles reached an efficiency of 13.4%. “These devices are one of the first examples of, and exhibit the highest reported efficiency for, perovskite solar cells fabricated completely in air with nanocomposite oxide layers,” the scientists noted.
The group also found the nanoparticles enhanced charge transfer and extraction from the perovskite layer into the electrode, and that this result can be achieved only by defining an “optimal” concentration of nanoparticles. They warned that too high concentrations of Ag could have a negative effect on the cell's recombination rate and short-circuit current.
The details of the manufacturing process are available in the paper “Using Ag nanoparticles in the electron transport layer of perovskite solar cells to improve efficiency,” published in Solar Energy.
“The protocols established here for the synthesis, comparison and integration of composite transport layers have a general validity, and can be applied to perovskite solar cells with different compositions, or to other fields,” the researchers said.

“With a deteriorating market environment in Europe, continuing with full-scale European solar manufacturing is not sustainable for the time being,” the company said in a statement. “Part of the plan would unfortunately be the closure of one of Europe’s largest operational solar module production sites in Freiberg, Germany, as early as beginning of April 2024, affecting approximately 500 people.”
The company said that it will make a final decision by the end of February, leaving the door open to rethink its plan if “sufficient measures to create a level playing field in Europe, such as a resilience-reward scheme,” are put into place.
Meyer Burger said that cell production at its factory in Talheim, Germany, will support module production at its 2 GW factory currently under construction in the United States.
“The R&D sites in Switzerland and Germany would not be affected by these measures and continue to develop and produce technology and equipment to support Meyer Burger’s business outside Europe,” it said.
“In the US, we can take full advantage of our leading technology position, resulting in substantial interest by partners and supported by favorable industry policies,” said Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt. “The expansion of the U.S. business is currently proceeding as planned with the ramp-up of our solar module production site in Goodyear, expected to start in the second quarter of 2024.”
By combining US module and cell manufacturing, Meyer Burger will benefit from the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit 45X system, which is a component of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Prior to this announcement, Meyer Burger was targeting around 3 GW of new annual production capacity in Germany by the end of 2024, including 1.4 GW of module production capacity in Freiberg. It also currently plans to build a 3.5 GW solar cell and module factory at an unspecified location in Spain.

The scientists conducted their analysis with the System Advisor Model (SAM), which is a performance and financial model designed to estimate the cost of energy for grid-connected power projects. They also used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm based on machine learning to assess global horizontal irradiation (GHI), wind speed, as well as other weather parameters at different locations throughout the country.
Join SunRise Arabia Clean Energy Conference in Riyadh on Jan. 31, 2024, and find out more about the Saudi PV market
They also used the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method, which is a decision rule to derive composite maps using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), in addition to conducting a land suitability analysis. They said this facilitated the identification of four “optimal” locations for large-scale solar farms in Tabuk, Al Madinah, Makkah, and Riyadh provinces, as well as other suitable locations for wind power in Al Madinah, Makkah, Riyadh, and Eastern provinces.
“The analysis also identified one location in Al Jouf province suitable for hybrid systems combining solar PV and wind energy,” they said.
The researchers added that their assessment considered land use, topography, proximity to existing infrastructure, environmental constraints, capital costs, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, energy production potential, grid integration considerations, and tilt angle optimization.
After completing their land suitability assessment, the researchers proceeded with a techno-economic analysis of the potential project considering annual energy output, capacity factor, energy yield, performance ratio, and levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
Their analysis included information from two existing facilities in Saudi Arabia – the 300 MW Sakaka solar plant and the 400 MW Dumat Al Jandal wind farm.
“The Sakaka solar PV plant operates under a 25-year PPA with an electricity price of $23.40/MWh, while the Dumat Al Jandal wind farm has a 20-year PPA with an electricity price of $21.30/MWh,” the researchers said, acknowledging that technical and financial details for the plants are not fully available.
The simulations showed that these PPA prices now allow the owners of the Sakaka and Dumat Al Jandal plants to achieve a positive net present value (NPV).
“The negative NPV results indicate that the projects are not economically viable at the current PPA prices,” the researchers said. “Increasing the PPA price could potentially enhance the profitability of these projects.”
They said that to achieve zero NPV values, the other identified sites for solar deployment should host projects requiring PPA prices ranging from $26.10/MWh to $29.30/MWh.
“Sensitivity analysis of PPA rates indicated that solar PV, wind energy, and hybrid solar PV-wind technologies are economically feasible in SA at PPA rates above $32.8/MWh, $26.1/MWh, and $50.6/MWh, respectively,” they concluded.
They introduced their findings in “Potentials and opportunities of solar PV and wind energy sources in Saudi Arabia: Land suitability, techno-socio-economic feasibility, and future variability,” which was recently published in Results in Engineering.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates that homeowners spend $25,000 installing residential solar systems, so it makes sense that more buyers are looking to purchase properties with solar panels already retrofitted. However, according to findings published in MarketWatch, even these homes can come at a premium.
To find out which regions of the United States have the highest number of solar-powered homes for sale per 100,000 people and how much prospective buyers are paying for solar-powered residences across the country, MarketWatch searched Zillow. Using the keyword “solar,” it assessed how many relevant home listings popped up in specific states and cities relative to the local population.
MarketWatch used each listing’s page views and price details to calculate the average interest in the property and determine how much more a buyer needs to pay for a solar-powered home:
MarketWatch attributes the high number of solar homes on the market in Las Vegas to the rapid growth rate of solar-powered developments in that area. Goodyear, Arizona, ranked high due to receiving 300 days of sunshine, making it ideal for solar, said MarketWatch.
California had the highest number of solar-powered homes for sale at 6,014 listings, which MarketWatch also attributes to its regular exposure to the sun. Hawaii boasted the highest number of solar-powered homes on the market relative to the people at 23 listings per 100,000. The report authors state this is because its electricity costs are the highest in the nation.
The top nine US cities that had the most interest in purchasing a solar-powered home were in California. These include properties in Irvine, California, which had 2,188 views per day, followed by Corona, California, at 2,160 views and San Diego, California, at 2,151 views. MarketWatch said this is partly because of the rising costs of utilities in rapidly growing cities.
According to the study, buyers in Arkansas had the highest premium (91.5%) when purchasing a solar-powered home. Buyers in California pay an average 4.13% price premium on their solar-powered home, the lowest in the country.
