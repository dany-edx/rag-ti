We have a terrific gas base in Jafurah, we will use it to generate blue hydrogen.” According to Reuters, the country wants to export around 4 million tons of hydrogen by 2030.
Eleven companies have launched the GreenHyScale project in Denmark. The plan, which includes a 100 MW electrolysis plant, aims at accelerating pressurized alkaline electrolysis to enable the large scale production of green hydrogen. “Our focus is to create a replicable solution for stakeholders in both Denmark and the rest of Europe – replicability is key to the dissemination of green hydrogen,” said Anders Bøje Larsen, chief technology officer of Danish green industrial park GreenLab today. “That makes GreenHyScale an important project with the potential to contribute greatly to the positive development of a hydrogen infrastructure in and outside of the EU.” The partner companies also want to lower the leveled cost of hydrogen towards cost parity with fossil fuels. The project is backed by €30 million of EU funding.
Japanese automaker Toyota, Italian gas transmission system operator Snam and Portuguese bus and coach manufacturer CaetanoBus have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote hydrogen-based mobility. “With this agreement, we aim to build an alliance between operators in the energy and transport sectors to offer end users competitive sustainable hydrogen mobility solutions,” said Snam chief mobility officer Alessio Torelli. The agreement may lead to “end-to-end” hydrogen mobility projects in Italy and other European countries, including along the entire value chain. “The presence of an adequate hydrogen refueling infrastructure is a necessary condition for developing its full potential for mobility,” said Luigi Ksawery Lucà, CEO of Toyota Motor Italia.
Australian energy company Woodside Petroleum has unveiled plans to establish an export-oriented hydrogen and ammonia production facility in southern metropolitan Perth. “Local refuelling stations can be built independently of the export project timelines and could operate as early as 2023, subject to approvals and customer demand,” the company wrote yesterday. In collaboration with the government of Western Australia, the company wants to build the project on around 130 hectares of vacant industrial land, near gas, power, water and port infrastructure. “‘H2Perth' will also facilitate substantial growth of renewables in Western Australia by providing to the grid a flexible and stabilizing load that benefits uptake of intermittent renewable electricity by households and local industry,” said Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill.
South Korea-based Doosan Fuel Cell has signed a memorandum of understanding Korea Western Power and Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) in Seoul. The companies will develop a project to directly inject pure biogas – removed from unused biogas – into hydrogen fuel cells. “Doosan Fuel Cell plans to develop hydrogen fuel cell technology exclusively for pure biogas and supply main equipment, while Korea Western Power and KEPCO E&C are in charge of overall business, and design and construction of pre-treatment facilities, respectively,” the partners wrote. Doosan Fuel Cell has hydrogen fuel cell models that use energy sources such as clean and by-product hydrogen, LNG, and LPG. The agreement signed by the companies was not the only recent hydrogen development in South Korea. According to several reports, steelmaker POSCO and Korean Southern Power have also announced significant investments in hydrogen.
Aberdeen City Council has announced U.K.-based energy major BP as its preferred bidder for a commercial partnership to accelerate the city’s ambitions to become a world-class hydrogen hub. “Phase 1, which involves the delivery of a green hydrogen facility, is targeting first operations from 2024,” said a statement released by the local authority yesterday. “As a result, options could include using power drawn from a new photovoltaic solar farm, green power purchase agreements, and a private-wire grid connection to generate hydrogen for buses, heavy goods vehicles and large vans.” BP vice president Louise Kingham OBE said: “These new business opportunities are underpinned by our 50-plus years of operations in the North Sea where, based out of Aberdeen, we have built up vast skills and experience that are directly transferable to emerging energy industries.”

GCL was making the announcements as it tried to draw a line under a pair of incidents which have seen trading in its stock suspended on the Hong Kong exchange since April 1.
The company had originally opened up in May about a deal it signed in August 2018 which involved pledging 865 million shares in its GCL New Energy solar project development business as security in return for a promised US$60 million loan from Bentley Rothschild Capital 5 Ltd, of which GCL said only US$2.2 million ever arrived, in February last year.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about raw material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
GCL discovered in May the stock, which had been held by a third-party broker under the terms of the arrangement, had been transferred to Bentley Rothschild after the latter claimed the terms of the loan agreement had been breached. Earlier this month, GCL said a key individual associated with Bentley Rothschild had been accused of fraudulent activity by other companies which had received similar treatment.
The solar manufacturer's bid to resume trading in its stock involved appointing an independent investigation into its internal policies and Crowe (HK) Risk Advisory Ltd, the business selected by GCL to examine its practices, found the solar company could produce no evidence of having carried out any due diligence on Bentley Rothschild or the unnamed broker involved in the loss of stock which, pv magazine has previously reported, left the parent with only a 49.24% holding in its New Energy business.
The findings of the internal report, published by GCL in an update to the Hong Kong exchange yesterday, recommended any future such deals not involve any pledge of company shares and that such financing deals be approved by both the GCL-Poly board and external legal counsel.
In a series of updates yesterday – which included full-year figures for last year and an update from the first half of this year – GCL named Jiang Wenwu as the man responsible for a controversial RMB510 million pre-payment to state-owned energy construction business Sinomec Refinery & Chemical Corp as part of an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract related to a planned RMB1.9 billion (US$297 million) polysilicon fab in Jiangsu Xuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone, which is yet to begin.
Jiang was a former executive director of GCL and was general manager of the business' Jiangsu Zhongneng Polysilicon Technology Development Co Ltd subsidiary, and signed off the pre-payment despite only having authorization, under GCL internal policy, to approve up to RMB100 million (US$15.7 million) of capital spending.
The emergence of the pre-payment in relation to an EPC contract which was dissolved in April this year – with Sinomec refunding RMB495.28 million (US$77.55 million), minus its project planning expenses – prompted GCL auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to refuse to sign off the company's 2020 accounts and to walk away from the business. The lack of full-year figures, until yesterday, prompted the suspension of trading in GCL stock.
Yesterday's updates named Sinomec as lead contractor on the planned poly fab for the first time, along with sub-contractor Shanghai Chuanghong Technology Co Ltd. GCL reiterated it had decided to end the deal with the two entities to instead tender multiple EPC businesses to construct different parts of the planned 54,000-ton annual capacity poly factory, in order to protect the confidentiality of its granular silicon production technology. The manufacturer said it was still searching for replacement EPCs and would update shareholders on the contract this year.
The signing of the former EPC deal, and payment of the contentious RMB510 million, was not reported by the company as a major transaction at the time, in September 2019, as required by the Hong Kong exchange, and the investigation by Crowe Risk Advisory found Wenwu had only informed GCL chairman, Zhu Gongshan, and CEO, Zhu Zhanjun, about the contract “some time around the end of November 2019 or the beginning of December 2019.”
In a report which flagged up four internal control deficiencies of a “high-risk nature” – two associated with “procurement and construction projects and [the] handling of trade payables”; and two concerned with “funding, cash and financing management,” Crowe found GCL had permitted deals to be signed off solely on paper in cases where urgency was required. The investigator, who said yesterday the GCL board had remedied all of the 19 deficiencies it identified, recommended all such deals be required to go through the company's electronic systems in future.

In a notification sent to all provincial governments, the State Council confirmed figures which were initially published by the Chinese government in December. According to the document, non-fossil-fuel energy will account for 20% of consumption by the end of 2025, and a quarter of the total by 2030. Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be cut by 65% compared to the 2005 levels, as part of the policy. In terms of renewables, the document calls for at least 1.2 TW of solar and wind generation capacity. According to National Energy Administration statistics, China currently had around 253 GW of solar at the end of 2020. The policy also calls for 120 GW of pumped hydro energy storage capacity and more than 30 GW of chemical storage and mandates solar on around half of the nation's new public-sector and industrial buildings.
Solar cell maker Aikosolar has announced two major three-year wafer purchasing agreements, with waste heat company Shuangliang and solar manufacturer Shangji. Aikosolar will buy 2.1 billion pieces from Shuangliang and 780 million pieces from Shangji, with prices set monthly, the company announced yesterday.
Solar manufacturer Zhonghuan Semiconductor posted revenue of RMB11.4 billion (US$1.78 billion) in the third quarter, for a 117.46% rise on the same period a year earlier. The net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB1.28 billion (US$200 million), for year-on-year growth of 226.3%. According to Zhonghuan's financial update, market penetration of its ‘G12', 210mm wafers rose to 20%, from only 6% at the beginning of the year. Zhonghuan said its annual wafer manufacturing capacity rose to 73.5 GW by the end of September, 59% of which is G12-compatible. The company's 50 GW G12 factory in Ningxia, which Zhonghuan has said will be the largest wafer fab in the world, is due to start commissioning in December and enter full operation by 2023.

U.S.-based energy company AES, which in May changed the name of its unit in Latin America from AES Gener to AES Andes, has inaugurated and put into operation, on Friday, the San Fernando Solar Park, the largest photovoltaic project in Colombia.
AES built the plant for Colombian oil company Ecopetrol, which entered the solar energy business in August 2018.
Located in the municipality of Castilla La Nueva, in the department of Meta, the new solar complex has 61 MW of installed capacity and is the largest PV plant built in the country to date. It will supply part of the energy needed for the company's operations in the region. Ecopetrol awarded the plant construction contract to AES last year.
The park was built on 57 hectares with 114,000, 530 W monocrystalline bifacial solar panels mounted on trackers. AES said in a statement that the sun-tracking technology with bifacial panels is the first installed in the country, “which makes San Fernando Solar the most innovative solar plant in Colombia.”
As part of AES Colombia's commitment to its sustainable operation, the construction of the San Fernando Solar Park involved more than 700 people, of which 88% were local and regional employees. In addition, 38% of the park's workforce were women, which is the equivalent of more than 270 employees who were part of the different construction areas of the project.
For the CEO of AES Andes, Ricardo Falú, “this initiative is a faithful reflection of the progress of our Greentegra transformational strategy, which seeks to reduce the carbon intensity of our portfolio, make the supply of our clients more sustainable, and strengthen the investment grade of the company.”

The mine consists of six deep sites that could potentially host the storage solution developed by Gravitricity, which uses clean power to raise a mass in a 150-1,500m shaft and discharges the electricity thus ‘stored’ by releasing the mass to rotate an electric generator.
Specialists from the U.K. company and Diamo, which is a state-owned entity that manages decommissioned mining sites across Czechia, investigated the location features down to a depth of over 1km.
An investment decision is expected to be made early next year and more mining sites in the country may be considered for further plans, Gravitricity said in a statement. “We are ready to cooperate in [the] preparation of this project and have provided Gravitricity with all the information to allow them to make a fully qualified decision on the Staříč mine,” stated Diamo CEO Ludvík Kašpar. “We are convinced that closed mines have the potential for further use and an energy storage project could be attractive and useful for the region.”
Experts from the VSB Technical University of Ostrava were also active in the project assessment. The project is part of a plan to commence a full-scale, 4-8 MW prototype scheme in a disused mine next year.
The storage system developed by Gravitricity has so far been built as a 250 kW demonstrator project on an industrial site at Port of Leith, Scotland’s largest enclosed deepwater port. That facility was built with a 15m high lattice tower, two 25-ton weights suspended by steel cables and two grid-connected generator units. The technology is claimed to have a faster response time than lithium-ion storage technology and to be able to help stabilize electricity networks at 50Hz by responding to full power demand in less than a second.
Gravity storage has begun to raise interest in the renewable energy industry in recent years. U.S. company Energy Vault unveiled, in 2019, gravity-based storage technology relying on a crane and 35-ton concrete blocks. Austrian research organization the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) recently suggested gravitational energy storage for low-energy-demand locations.

Abdu Bello Mohammed, chief of staff at regulator the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, told a webinar held by German development ministry entity Green People's Energy and Brussels-based membership body the Alliance for Rural Electrification, his nation's 11 electric distribution companies are franchising portions of their network to private providers in a move which could foster mini-grid provision.
Mohammed and power sector peers from Ethiopia, Namibia and Ghana were responding to concerns voiced by German former politician Bärbel Höhn, who listed some of the obstacles to renewables roll-out she had witnessed in her unpaid role as commissioner for energy reform in Africa for development ministry the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit.
Solar PV could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. This year, pv magazine’s UP initiative has shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
Stressing the need to win hearts and minds to the clean energy cause, and referring to the successes achieved in her homeland, Alliance '90/Green Party member Höhn said subsidies for fossil fuel-fired power were a problem, with consumers in some African nations paying as little as US$0.05/kWh for conventional electricity.
Clean power developers would not be willing to invest for such low returns, said the former Bundestag MP and minister for agriculture in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, who added, bureaucracy and lack of support for private companies was also a hurdle to renewables in some African states. Höhn also called for high-quality equipment and comprehensive training, to sell the efficiency and job creation benefits of clean power.
Mohammed said Nigeria has mini-grid regulation in place that ensures installers of solar systems with a generation capacity of up to 100 kW need only complete a basic registration process and, for systems between 100 kW and 1 MW, a simple online permit was all that was required. The regulator representative said licences would be required only for systems bigger than 1 MW and added, Nigeria offers a feed-in tariff for solar facilities with generation capacities of up to 5 MW.
The country, said Mohammed, is aiming for 8 GW of renewables generation capacity this decade.
Bahru Oljira Debel, from the Ethiopian Energy Authority, said his nation also had mini-grid regulation in place, under an Energy Mini-grid Directive. The government of prime minister Abiy Ahmed, sworn in for a new five-year term at the start of the month, is considering further moves to foster private-sector involvement in off-grid generation and renewables plants, Debel told the webinar.
With a population density of just 2.9 people per square kilometer, according to worldatlas.com, household solar is the most effective way to provide electricity to the people of Namibia, said Pinehas Mutota, from the nation's Electricity Control Board.
Mutota said his country is making strides in renewables, with around 60 MW of generation capacity operating under a net-metering regime which has been in place since 2017, and with consumers able to shop around for their power provider.
Whilst Ghanaian electricity customers pay no more than US$0.10/kWh for consumption of up to 50 kWh per month – thanks to the kind of fossil fuel subsidies highlighted by Germany's Höhn – Wisdom Ahiataku Togobo, from state-owned hydro and solar company Bui Power Authority, pointed to the fact greenhouse gas emitters in Ghana are taxed on their CO2 output, with the money raised ring-fenced for off-grid electrification and renewables, following an amendment to the 2011 Renewable Energy Act.

The manufacturer said the off-grid PV array has a power output of 1.2 kW and is able to provide power for almost all of a vehicle's onboard appliances – depending on usage patterns – while also providing external shading.
The solar power generator can be deployed automatically by pushing a button. “With the Xpanse Solar Awning, we are enabling RV owners to generate substantial power on the go so that they can go off-grid more often,” said the company's founder, Rohini Raghunathan, noting that the awning offers more space for the solar panels than the roof of vehicles.
The awning is slightly longer than 4.5m and extends to about 2.1m when fully expanded.
Xponent Power also explained that the awning is compatible with the electrical components used in conventional mobile PV installations, including charge controllers, batteries, and inverters. “The product, which can mount on either side of the vehicle, provides flexibility to RV owners who would like additional power but are not looking to replace an existing awning,” the company stated. “It can also integrate with existing rooftop installations, extending the solar power generation capabilities beyond the roof of an RV.”
The system is equipped with an, unspecified technology that makes it retract automatically in the event of adverse weather conditions. The array, however, is claimed to be intrinsically wind tolerant as it has small gaps between the solar panels that allow the wind to pass through.
The patented technology, according to the company, may enable a wide range of additional applications such as by the military, for emergency relief, and residential power. Xponent Power specified it is currently in talks with automotive and RV manufacturers to provide the system as a pre-installed option on their new vehicles.
On its website, the company also specifies that the installation of the system can be done by installers who have been thoroughly trained and vetted by Xponent Power, and that first deliveries will be made during the second half of 2022.

The Indian government’s INR4500-crore ($599 million) production-linked incentive scheme, to support the gigawatt-scale manufacturing of high-efficiency solar modules, has concluded, with at least four players emerging as beneficiaries.
Jindal India Solar Energy, owned by Jindal Polyfilms, made the most competitive bid by seeking the lowest production-linked incentive support for 4 GW of fully integrated module manufacturing capacity. Data from trade body the National Solar Federation of India, seen by pv magazine, indicated Jindal has applied for INR1390 crore ($185 million) of support.
Transformer manufacturer and installer Shirdi Sai Electricals (with a bid for INR1875 crore [$250 million] of incentives), the Reliance New Energy Solar business of conglomerate Reliance Industries (INR1917 crore [$255 million]), and the infrastructure unit of fellow multinational Adani (INR3600 crore [$479 million]) were the other successful bidders. The auction took into account the level of assistance sought, planned solar manufacturing capacity and whether manufacturers planned to produce polysilicon and solar ingots, wafers and cells, as well as assembling modules.
All four successful bidders sought incentives for the maximum eligible annual manufacturing capacity of 4 GW and pledged the full extent of integrated manufacturing, from poly to panels.
Under the manufacturing-linked tender rules, however, bidders will only receive support for half of the production capacity they are planning, capped at 2 GW. That would imply the four successful bidders will each receive half of the financial support they have applied for, for a total public spend of INR4391 crore ($585 million).

The solar field is expected to generate 35.5 GWh, enough to power 3,000 rural houses, the local government estimated. The RUB2.8 billion ($40 million) plant is slated to become operational on December 10.
Russko-Polyanskaya, not far from the border with Kazakhstan, will become the third solar plant in the Omsk Oblast, a warm part of Siberia with around 300 sunny days per year. The area is sparsely populated and is lacking infrastructure and power generation facilities. Most of the electricity in that part of Russia is generated by thermal power plants.
Pick up your copy of the latest edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
“The [solar] plant's designed power generation capacity is equivalent to [the] burning of more than 1,800 tons of coal, and it would … avoid more than 5,000 tons of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere from the operation of coal-fired power plants,” said Oleg Shutkin, director of the engineering and generation department at Hevel.
In addition to avoiding emissions, the new solar plant will improve the Omsk region's self-sufficiency in power generation, added regional energy minister Anton Gaak. “Thanks to the solar plant, the efficiency of the power grid economy is rising,” said the politician. “With new power generation, we can adjust this [system] and, ultimately, reduce the price for electricity for customers in [the] Omsk region.”
The Russko-Polyanskaya plant is set to almost double Omsk's solar power generation capacity, to 61 MW. Solar plants will account for 3.8% of regional electricity output, Gaak said, adding that figure is projected to rise sharply in the coming years.
“We have achieved an agreement to launch new solar power plants with [a] combined production capacity close to 100 MW in the industrial zone of … Neftyanikov town and the southern districts of the Omsk region,” Gaak said, without elaborating further.
The Omsk government had already promised to build six solar plants in the region within the next three years.
In addition, the local authorities are mulling new incentives for investors willing to develop solar in the region. Proposals include a possible reduction of property tax for companies running renewable energy projects.
The development of solar generation is part of the national Clean Air program, under which the Omsk region wants to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by 2024. The investment cost of the program has been estimated at RUB116 billion ($1.66 billion).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/26/whats-next-for-polysilicon/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 26, 2021",What’s next for polysilicon?,"From pv magazine 10/2021
The result of this surge in demand was a spike in poly prices. The contract price of solar-grade poly soared, from $40/kg in 2004 to more than $200/kg by 2008 – and the poly spot price at moments during that year went beyond $400. But while polysilicon manufacturing capacity wasn’t keeping up with demand, the ultimate raw material (quartz) was abundant, and the gap between the spot price of polysilicon and its manufacturing cost was unsustainably high.
Drawn by the high profit margins and lack of capacity, a host of Chinese manufacturers swept into the market, aggresively ramping capacity and optimizing manufacturing processes to reduce electricity usage. In addition, many of these manufacturers sprang up in coal-rich parts of northwest China, allowing access to electricity at lower prices than before.
By the end of 2013, the manufacturing cost of polysilicon had tumbled to below $20/kg among industry leaders. Meanwhile, capacity had grown from less than 50,000 MT per year in 2007 to over 350,000 MT per year by 2013. Overcapacity had taken hold, and many manufacturers were forced to sell at cash cost to remain in business.
Both polysilicon manufacturing costs and prices then followed a relatively steady downward trend – prices fell to around $15/kg by 2018, with only minor bumps along the way. Following the May 2018 announcements of changes to the Chinese government’s policies on support for PV projects, prices fell below $10/kg and remained there for over two years. In mid-2020, Covid-related uncertainty then pushed even mono-quality polysilicon spot prices down to record lows of just over $7/kg.
Uncompetitive producers
Against the backdrop of these relentlessly low prices, some polysilicon manufacturers chose to exit the market or scale back production. Nowhere was this more apparent than with South Korean manufacturers, where the problems caused by low selling prices were exacerbated by the struggles of the non-Chinese ingot manufacturers that had previously formed part of their customer base.
Hanwha Chemical closed down its polysilicon manufacturing in 2020. Hankook Silicon’s production, which had been dwindling for a number of years, finally came to an end. And OCI – previously a giant in the polysilicon world – made a strategic move to cease production of solar-grade polysilicon in Korea, bringing its total global capacity down from 79,000 MT/year to 36,500 MT/year. As well as this reduction in capacity outside of China, some smaller Chinese manufacturers have also exited the polysilicon market in recent years. And if that weren’t enough, in the first half of 2020, GCL-Poly reduced the capacity of its Jiangsu production base to transition some production to Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) technology.

New decade
Set against the reduction in manufacturing capacity has been an increasing demand for polysilicon, with strong growth in end demand for PV modules more than offsetting the decline in silicon usage per watt that has been driven by reduced wafer thickness, reduced kerf loss, and increased cell efficiencies.
In the middle of 2020, a series of unexpected incidents at polysilicon manufacturing facilities (including a fire, a flood, and an explosion) caused a decline in Chinese polysilicon production and a rise in polysilicon prices. Chinese polysilicon production rapidly bounced back and has since set a number of records for monthly production volumes (see chart, p. 53), but the reduction in global capacity has left the market with little room for maneuver in times of high demand.
The reduction in supply has also left some ingot manufacturers with little confidence that sufficient polysilicon (and especially polysilicon of the right quality) can be relied upon to be available when they require it. This has been exacerbated by the fact that ingot and wafer capacities have increased vastly out of proportion to polysilicon, with multiple new entrants to the market vying for wafer sales and scrambling for polysilicon supply. And while polysilicon production in the first half of 2020 appears to have been enough to satisfy end demand from module purchasers, there has been overproduction from ingot to module, with manufacturers building up inventory in expectation of very strong demand in the second half of the year.
Lean times
So, when can the industry expect to see relief from the current high prices? Several polysilicon capacity expansions from industry cost-leaders are due to ramp up production in early 2022, which should bring some balance back to the market. These include 40,000 MT/year of capacity from Daqo, due to ramp to full production in the first quarter of 2022, and 100,000 MT from Tongwei, notionally due online in late 2021, but not ramping to full output until the first two quarters of 2022. It also includes 30,000 MT from Asia Silicon, due to ramp in the first quarter of 2022, and expansions from East Hope and GCL-Poly in early 2022.
Beyond this, just how much prices fall later in 2022 will depend on the exact timings of other new capacity expansions, and how quickly they can ramp to full production of mono-quality material. Although there is some uncertainty around the exact timeframes for some of these expansions, not to mention whether planned timeframes will be met, it’s clear that through 2022 and 2023 there is a very significant volume of new capacity due online from the leading manufacturers.
Besides the established suppliers, the high polysilicon prices seen over the past 12 months have driven interest from new entrants to the industry. Of course, some of these plans may not come to fruition, and some may take longer than hoped to reach the quality requirements of the ingot manufacturers, which will only get more stringent as n-type cell manufacturing expands.
Still, with so much capacity in the pipeline, even if a significant proportion of the pipeline falls away, a major shift in the supply-demand balance in favor of polysilicon purchasers seems inevitable. With overcapacity looming and manufacturing costs at industry leaders such as Daqo and Tongwei being below $6/kg in 2020, we believe that the long-term outlook is for low polysilicon prices, much to the relief of those further downstream in the PV industry.

The manufacturer said the result was confirmed by Germany's Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH). “The new record follows the previous benchmark of 25.26% in June, also established by Longi,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The two world records set within five months of each other underline the company’s leading position in innovative high-efficiency solar cell technology and its vision to drive forward the sustainable and rapid development of the global PV industry.”
More technical details on the cell technology were not provided.
Longi had announced in July a 25.19% efficiency for p-type TOPCon solar cell and a month earlier a 25.21% efficiency for n-type TOPCon device.
In January 2019, Longi announced an efficiency rating of 24.06% for a monocrystalline p-type PERC cell on the front side.

A team of researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Electric Power Research Institute are testing solar panels by blasting sound waves at them. 
The team said it is working to understand the effect of small cracks in a solar module, and how they may cause power losses over time. On windy days, modules can bend and flex, which can help to wear down cracked modules.  
Prevailing reliability tests were evaluated by computer modeling, and it was found that current methods for simulating wind-related bending were too aggressive to match real-world scenarios. The researchers needed a new model for testing wind-related bend, and turned to subwoofers as a research tool. 
The team strapped panels into wooden frames and blasted loud bass rhythms at the modules. This caused them to bend and flex as if they were being pushed by high winds. The bass was played at infrasonic levels, which are frequencies that the human ear is not able to detect. As a result, years of vibration and flexing may be tested in a few hours or days. 
 
 
The test was supported by DuraMAT, short for Durable Module Materials, a consortium that seeks to develop, de-risk, and enable the commercialization of new materials and designs for PV modules.
A group of researchers led by the University of Utah (UU) in the United States presented this year a technique to isolate individual sources of electrical ‘noise’ within a solar cell. Comparing the technique to being able to pick out a single voice within a 200-person choir, they say the technique will help to improve understanding of where efficiency losses occur within a cell, and effective ways to mitigate them.
The group applied its technique to silicon heterojunction cells, and was able to identify several key areas within the cell where noise was generated and further research could lead to better efficiencies.

Three manufacturers, Merlin Solar, Solarge, and LG, are making a move away from the standard aluminum and glass solar panel in a bid to lower weight, emissions, and cost.
The product from Merlin Solar has been found recently on yachts in pv magazine USA. Its value is that, first, it isn’t a standard framed product and so can be attached directly to a flat surface. Second, due to its unique busbar technology, the product is able to be walked on without damage.
Merlin Solar’s main goal, however, is to place its product on top of commercial structures whose limited available collateral load — the amount of weight that can be added to a structure’s roof and meet local building code regulations — doesn’t allow for the pounds per square foot (3-7 psf) that a standard solar installation requires.
The company recently installed 550 kWdc of its product on an oil storage tank in Rensselaer, New York. Merlin Solar said this site could neither take on the additional weight, nor gain owner approval for an attachment technique that might puncture the structure’s outer roofing layer.
Merlin Solar also markets its product in a framed format where a stronger structural attachment is required, or where a more rigid solar panel is desired. Even so, the product weighs considerably less than a standard solar panel because it does not use a glass front shield.
Solarge has released a product that replaces the glass of a solar panel with a plastic product. Currently, the company is manufacturing the panel on a pilot line which it said it hopes to scale up by the end of 2022. The company’s panel can be bought on its own, or as part of their custom designed east-west facing rooftop racking product.
The solar panel weighs just under 32 pounds (14.5 kg). For comparison’s sake, a Q Cell product made in Georgia weighs 43.8 pounds (19.9 kg). In the east-west configuration and including the racking hardware, the Solarge DUO will weigh 1.35 psf (6.6 kg/m2). And keep in mind that the lowest allowable collateral load often is around 3 psf.
 One point emphasized by the manufacturer is the product’s apparent strong emissions and recyclability credibility:
The product will have a CO2 footprint which is 80% lower than conventional solar panels and the panel is completely circular in design and uses no Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) materials, unlike all other solar panels that use a polymeric film instead of glass.
LG Chem — part of the conglomerate that also sells the successful LG solar panel line with a manufacturing facility in Alabama — has announced that it is exploring turning the frames of solar panels from aluminum into plastics.
LG Chem said the product is as strong as aluminum, but cheaper and, of course, lightweight. Although no specific numbers were available, an LG Chem press release said its product can be manufactured with post-consumer recycled polycarbonate which will lower the emissions of the frame.

The compound, called LUPOY EU5201, is an engineering plastic composed of ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) resins with polycarbonate as a base, and reinforced with glass fibers. High rooftop temperatures are well tolerated by the compound, which incorporates a flame retardant. It can maintain its shape across a range of temperatures due to its low coefficient of thermal expansion. And LG Chem claimed the new compound is highly resistant to corrosion, resistant to impacts, and extremely resistant to UV.
The company said it began selling products in the third quarter, indicating that it could already be headed toward solar panel factories for final manufacturing.
A shift to more plastics in solar panels will gain the attention of those who are considering the environmental credibility of solar power. While aluminum and glass manufacturing use an immense amount of energy, plastics are a major contributor to global trash pollution. They also are manufactured from hydrocarbons (oil).
However, the actual manufacturing of plastics from hydrocarbons — a process called cracking — doesn’t release emissions. It is the energy used to generate the heat — usually from fossil gas — that results in greenhouse gas emissions.
From this author’s experience building rooftop solar power, access to products that would lower the psf by greater than 50% of what is often our lowest allowable collateral load of 3 psf would open up a large amount of rooftop space for development.
