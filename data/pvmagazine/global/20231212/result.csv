The US automaker said hydrogen could fuel Autocar’s class 8 trucks, refuse trucks, and terminal tractors. GM’s Hydrotec power cubes, its fuel cell propulsion system for commercial vehicles, are compact, easy to package, and scalable. Each power cube contains more than 300 hydrogen fuel cells, providing 77 kW of capacity. The first vehicles are scheduled to go into production in 2026 at the Autocar Truck Plant in Birmingham, Alabama. They will initially build cement mixers, roll-off vehicles, and dump trucks, followed by refuse trucks and terminal tractors.
The Council of the European Union and the European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on a regulation that establishes common internal market rules for renewable gases, natural gases, and hydrogen. The legislation aims to facilitate the penetration of renewable and low-carbon gases, like hydrogen and biomethane, into the energy system. The provisional agreement aims to create a separate new entity in the hydrogen sector, the Hydrogen Network Operators (ENNOH), while also detailing access to hydrogen infrastructure and unbundling measures to separate hydrogen production from transport.
Lhyfe and AREC Occitanie inaugurated the Lhyfe Occitanie hydrogen production site in France, owned 80% by Lhyfe and 20% by AREC Occitanie. The second large-scale green hydrogen production site in Occitanie will begin operating commercially in the first half of 2024. Lhyfe said power purchase agreements with renewable electricity producers, including VSB Energies Nouvelles and Kallista Energy, will ensure power supplies.
Nel has agreed to sell all its shares in Everfuel for aNOK 116.6 million ($10.7 million) to Itochu and Osaka Gas. “Nel is in a build-up phase streamlining the company and focusing all resources on our own growth. We are therefore divesting non-strategic financial positions,” said Nel CFO Kjell Christian Bjørnsen. “With this sale we no longer own any equity listed instruments.”
Andritz and Suomen Säätöenergia have revealed plans to jointly develop a biofuel production plant at a site in Nurmes, Finland. The “Hybrid Refinery Nurmes” project will produce renewable methanol using gasification syngas from biomass and green hydrogen. Austria-based Andritz is now carrying out the first concept study for the project. Production is scheduled to commence by the end of 2026. The two companies said the project will benefit the surrounding community by using excess heat from the plant in a district heating scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/12/turkey-could-generate-120-gw-through-better-solar-rooftop-rollout/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MIDDLE EAST,TURKEY",ANGELA SKUJINS,"DECEMBER 12, 2023",Turkey could generate 120 GW through better solar rooftop rollout,"Turkey is “lagging” in its solar power capacity but could generate 120 GW – 45% of the country’s total electricity needs – through better solar rooftop utilization, said UK environmental think tank Ember in a recently published report.
The report, penned by Ufuk Alparslan and Azem Yildirim, shows that $3.6 billion worth of subsidies, which paid for fossil fuel imports from September 2022 to August 2023, could be eliminated through better rooftop PV policies.
Introducing rooftop solar “obligations” for new buildings and public buildings, as well as tendering suitable apartment building roofs by municipalities, could help the government of Turkey achieve better residential solar take-up, Alparslan said in the report.
The authors analyzed the rooftops of 70 provinces via satellite imagery and discovered up to 772 million square meters – 27.6% of the surveyed area – was suitable for rooftop solar. Certain southern regions damaged by the February 2023 earthquakes were discounted from analysis.
Roughly 148 TWh of electricity per annum could be generated if suitable rooftops across Turkey were fitted with low-efficiency panels, according to the report. But, as this calculation excludes regions damaged by this year’s natural disaster, “it is likely that the true technical potential across the country even exceeds 120 GW,” the authors state in the study.
Turkey’s western flank is more ideal for solar generation than the east due to population, rooftop tilt, dwelling type and other factors. Istanbul's roofs are poised to generate the most PV with 10.4 GW, followed by the country’s capital Ankara with 10.1 GW and the western city of Izmir with 9.3 GW.
It takes 27 weeks for homeowners, comprising 60% of tenants in Turkey, to be granted necessary permits to install rooftop solar systems, according to the report’s authors. Other obstacles, such as the government’s energy subsidies, are “discouraging” consumers from self-producing energy with PV.
The report said that “policies that promote the widespread use of rooftop solar power plants” in Turkey, particularly in homes, could “reduce the real cost of electricity in the country by reducing its dependence on imported fossil-fuel resources.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said that 57% of Turkey’s total energy supply in 2020 was derived from oil and gas, with renewables coming in at 15%. Only 5% of the country’s renewable energy generation that year was derived from solar power, said IRENA, noting that it had 9.4 GW of installed PV capacity at the end of last year.

The deployment of geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) at mass scale could decarbonize heating and cooling and save energy in US buildings, according to a report conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and NREL, with funding from the US Department of Energy (DOE’s) Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO),
By retrofitting approximately 70% of US buildings with GHPs, electricity demand could be reduced by as much as 13%  by 2050 versus decarbonizing without GHPs. According to the report, this would avoid as much as 24,500 miles of new grid transmission lines by 2050.
GHPs are help lower building energy costs because of their high efficiency and ability to supply heat without fuel purchases. Also called ground source heat pumps, the way GHPs work is they transfer heat to and from the ground by circulating water (or antifreeze solution in regions with cold climates) through underground piping. As a result, GHPs have no emissions.
GTO funding this study in order to investigate the impacts on the electric grid of the large-scale deployment of GHPs. For the purpose of analysis, the researchers simulated the energy use impacts of deploying GHPs into 68% of existing and new buildings in the United States (78% residential, 43% commercial) in 14 climate zones across the contiguous United States by 2050.
The study found significant savings in grid costs, CO2 emissions, and building energy consumption. Specifically, the research concluded that if all applicable buildings in the contiguous United States were retrofitted with GHPs at once, electricity use would be reduced by 401 TWh, which is an 18% reduction from the baseline EULP each year. Furthermore, the study found that such widespread use would eliminate use of 5,138 billion MJ of fossil fuels annually.
“Geothermal heat pumps offer enormous value for the nation’s energy future,” said Alejandro Moreno, associate principal deputy assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy. “This report confirms that geothermal heat pumps are a ready-made strategy for decarbonizing our buildings while reducing the need for new electricity generation and transmission, and bringing energy savings to Americans nationwide – all while creating U.S. jobs.”
In addition to saving energy and cutting carbon, another advantage would be using domestically produced GHPs, as most are made in America. Increased use would stimulate a domestic industry, create local jobs to install and maintain the systems.

Its high-density TES system is based on its Guinness World Record achievement for high temperature in its patented liquid metal heat transfer system, which allows for operation at almost half the sun's temperature.
“Until this innovation, I don’t think there has been an innovation in thermal fluid infrastructure in almost 100 years,” Fourth Power CTO Asegun Henry told pv magazine. “Utilizing PVC, steel, or nickel-alloy pipes has been around for a very long time, and that’s what everyone is doing.”
He said Fourth Power’s approach is based on knowledge of the struggles that other TES companies have faced in trying to scale the technology.
“The key is our liquid metal handling infrastructure, which allows us to transfer heat at fluxes more than an order of magnitude higher than traditional thermofluid systems,” Henry said. “This leads to higher power density and lower cost.”
Fourth Power’s system converts renewable energy to heat, or thermal energy in a fully enclosed system roughly the size of half of a football field. The thermal battery heats liquid tin and moves it through a closed-loop piping system to heat stacks of carbon blocks until they glow white hot.
The system then exposes TPV cells to the light and converts it into electricity. This is similar to traditional solar generation but uses light from very hot — up to 2,400 C — graphite rather than light from the sun to produce electricity. The battery is sealed in a warehouse of argon gas to maximize system lifetime and ensure safety.
“We’re primarily focused on electricity and industrial heat,” Henry said. “To be more specific, we aspire for our technology to replace peaker plants in combination with renewable electricity generation.”
For power generation alone, Fourth Power’s roundtrip efficiency target is 50%.
“Our TPV cells have already set a world record at 41% – and we have designs to reach 50%,” Henry said. “For co-generation, the efficiency is near 100%.”
Finally, by using readily available and less expensive materials, the overall system cost is lower, enabling energy storage that is 10 times cheaper than lithium-ion batteries ($25/kWh-e vs. $330/kWh-e), according to the company.
On Tuesday, Fourth Power announced that it had received $19 million in Series A funding to scale its TES technology. The investment round was led by the venture capital firm DCVC, with participation from Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Black Venture Capital Consortium.
“After more than 10 years of research and development, we are grateful to reach this crucial milestone in our journey thanks to our funding partners who recognized the innovation and potential of Fourth Power’s thermal battery technology,” said Henry, who developed Fourth Power’s thermal battery technology when he was a professor at Georgia Tech.
The funds will also support the construction of a 1 MWh-e prototype facility outside of Boston, with a targeted completion date in 2026. In addition, it will facilitate rigorous durability tests and expand the company's engineering team.
“Following the 1 MWH-e prototype facility's successful completion, we plan to partner with utilities to conduct pilot projects designed for commercialization throughout 2026 and 2027,” Henry said. “We anticipate achieving our goal of installing full-scale, 100 MWh-e systems by 2028.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/12/competition-heats-up/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,BRAZIL,CHINA,EUROPE,INDIA,MIDDLE EAST,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 12, 2023",Competition heats up,"From pv magazine 12/23-01/24
Falling solar module prices have spurred demand in 2023. Projects postponed or canceled in 2022 have resumed construction and new projects have taken shape smoothly. Module demand in 2023 is expected to hit 412 GW to 455 GW, up 53% year on year.
While module shipments increased, Europe and Brazil were hit by inventory pileups in 2023. Falling prices benefit project internal rates of return but labor shortages, policy changes, and project scheduling drove a mismatch between production and installation. With excessive inventory, some manufacturers are cutting prices or moving modules elsewhere, causing huge losses. Installation demand is likely to grow further in 2024 but will still lag production capacity. Oversupply will continue and will limit new production capacity. Overstocked manufacturers will be more cautious about production, shipping, and sales in 2024.

Solar growth is also subject to grid capacity. The solar boom has seen Brazil and some European countries delay or cancel small-scale projects due to grid constraints. Rapid rooftop installation growth in China has prompted local governments to address grid capacity but suspending small array connections and mandating energy storage is a stopgap measure. Upgrading grids requires investment and regulation.
Although solar growth will slow from 2023 onwards, due to a higher baseline, grid issues, and localization trends, the market outlook remains positive as module prices have plummeted, with module demand projected to see an increase of 15% to 20% in 2024.
With solar production capacity expansion plans across the supply chain materializing in 2023, the polysilicon supply bottleneck eased but rapidly expanded solar production facilities led to a serious surplus. Prices across the supply chain plunged in 2023. Polysilicon prices retreated from CNY 300 ($41.40)/kg year’s end 2022, to around CNY 69/kg currently, while module prices fell from last year’s $0.245/W to $0.135/W. Short-term price movements may occur in the future, when supply and demand changes, but as supply will still outstrip installation demand, prices are not likely to bounce back significantly, leaving more bargaining power to end users.

Rising solar production capacity helps industry development but it also leads to increasingly fierce competition between manufacturers. Having observed rapid market growth, better profits, and high prices across the supply chain in 2022, existing and new PV players announced expansion plans one after another, escalating competition and driving down prices.
Now that prices have plummeted, many manufacturers have little room left for profits, forcing them to adjust utilization rates in accordance with demand. Consequently, some older production lines were phased out at a faster pace and some new capacity plans have been cancelled as they are no longer profitable. More expansion plans are expected to be cancelled in 2024. Companies with poor cost control and insufficient sales channels may be forced out of the market.
Some countries have recently introduced protectionist measures for solar products and tried to build domestic capacity in pursuit of energy independence. Existing policies include the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and an anti-circumvention investigation into Southeast Asian solar products. Other schemes include India’s basic customs duty on imported modules, its approved list of models and manufacturers, and the production-linked incentive scheme. Europe is evaluating the necessity of limiting solar imports as the market grapples with an influx of low-priced Chinese modules.
The solar supply chain remains concentrated in China, with Chinese polysilicon, wafer, cell, and module production capacity amounting to 93%, 97%, 90%, and 82%, respectively, of the global totals. Capacity outside China is unable to fulfil demand. If the European Union restricts solar imports before securing supply, installation volumes will fall. The United States experienced a 16% fall last year after the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act restricted the import of modules featuring Xinjiang polysilicon.

Driven by policy, 2023 brought overseas production capacity, especially in the United States and India, where facilities will come online in 2024. InfoLink’s statistics show annual module production capacity outside China will have increased at least 78%, to 270 GW over the early 2023 to late 2024 period. Some manufacturers are considering expanding capacity in Europe and the Middle East, which would change an industry landscape dominated by Chinese modules.
It is worth noting that these overseas expansion projects are mostly for modules, given entry barriers such as capital expenditure and technical difficulty for other links in the PV supply chain. There are a few cell expansion plans and scattered polysilicon and wafer projects. New cell and module players are unlikely to wean themselves off Chinese supply completely within two to three years.
Overall, the solar industry will continue to grow in 2024 despite the impact of grid capacity constraints and labor shortages on installations. Production capacity expansion and declining prices will drive demand effectively, providing bright prospects for solar developers.
Meanwhile, soaring manufacturing capacity, an intense price war, and technological shifts will challenge the supply side’s capability to control costs and invest in R&D and sales. The supply and demand landscape will become more complex and the industry will change more quickly as production capacities overseas come online.

Heliocity, a spinoff of France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES), has developed a series of algorithms to remotely conduct diagnostic assessments of rooftop PV systems.
“For 10 years, we looked for ways to bring together solar installations and buildings,” Heliocity CEO Émeric Eyraud told pv magazine France. “The building environment is quite demanding for PV systems, particularly in terms of its thermal interaction with the building itself. If we simplify, two more degrees of temperature in a module means 1% less production.”
Heliocity claims to have “cracked” this issue – which can also affect large ground-based power plants, despite the use of sensors – with its HelioFlash solution. The patented algorithms combine multi-physics and multi-scale modeling of buildings, solar systems, and the environment with complex data analysis methods adapted to data monitoring. The company said that approximately 30 solar park operators, including most of France's top 10, have already deployed it.
The algorithms compare expected PV system output with actual production, detecting and pinpointing underperformance issues such as shading, dirt, and incorrect layout, while offering recommendations for remediation.
Heliocity's solution conducts comprehensive PV system assessments within 48 hours, leveraging existing data delivered through automated ad hoc gateways.
“We are like a little extra brain, which will give the operators or owners of PV systems an understanding of the performance of the installation. And above all, tell them what to do to make it work better, for example, when to clean the panels or when to replace them if they do not perform in accordance with the manufacturer's guarantees,” Eyraud said. “To my knowledge, we are the only ones to date who can say, just with tracking data. Here you have shading, there you have dirt, there you have a problem of this nature, with this module, in this place.”
Remote data collection eliminates the need for on-site visits, but two details are needed for algorithmic exploitation. Descriptive information on approximately 15 variables is used to create a “digital twin,” complemented by monitoring data, including voltage, current, temperature, wind, and irradiation probes.
The solution is aimed at PV systems above 35 kW in size and can be used on an ad hoc basis for a few hundred euros, depending on the size of the installation, or as a subscription package. Clients access detailed diagnostic analysis results through an online platform using access codes.

The scientists explained that their modeling framework couples MCRT with a detailed electrical model of high-efficiency bifacial PV modules, which they said tackles the typical limitations associated with traditional view factor (VF) modeling.
“Specifically, the approach resolves the complexities of real-world factors, including mismatch phenomena at both the cell-to-cell and array levels arising from non-uniform illumination effects and edge effects,” they said. “Moreover, it meticulously accounts for non-uniform illumination effects stemming from module frames and mounting components, an aspect often overlooked in previous models.”
The proposed approach works in four steps: Optical modeling; thermal modeling; electrical modeling; and integration. The MCRT model assesses direct and diffuse light separately and combines the results based on measured direct and diffuse irradiance values at each timestep.
The research group utilized the MCRT framework for analyzing the performance of two rows of eight solar modules each with a constant row-to-row distance of 5 m. The modules are tilt-rack mounted at different angles at over 20 cm above the surface of the roof. “It's important to note that our exploration of system design does not extend to considerations of module spacing or other design factors that influence optimal system performance,” it said, referring to the limitations of their technique.
The analysis showed that rooftop reflectivity is a key factor in increasing a bifacial rooftop PV system performance. The academics found that bifacial arrays can provide energy gains that are up to 22.6% higher than those of monofacial counterparts. “Additionally, the investigation revealed that rooftop reflectivity also influences the optimal tilt angle for bifacial modules,”  they emphasized. “Compared to monofacial modules, bifacial modules exhibit higher optimal tilt angles for maximum energy generation.”
Moreover, the analysis demonstrated that system and module design also play a decisive role in increasing power yield, with parallel interconnections of top and bottom substrings being particularly beneficial. “Without parallel substrings, bifacial gain was reduced by 0.9 % for a system with mounting components at a 75 % reflective rooftop,” the scientists noted.
Their findings were introduced in the study “Accurate modeling of the bifacial gain potential of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.

The system is based on parallel water pipes that are attached to the backside of the solar panels and reduce their operating temperatures. “Our study introduces a simple and practical cooling approach that enhances the electrical efficiency of PV panels while simultaneously offering a sustainable solution to residential hot water needs,” the scientists said.
The experimental system relies on a south-oriented 250 W polycrystalline PV panel with a temperature coefficient of -0.45%/C and a tilt angle of 30 degrees. The copper cooling pipes are connected via upstream and downstream headers and are covered by an aluminum cover to secure them to the backside of the PV panel.
The experimental setup includes a hot water storage tank and an 11 W centrifugal pump that maintains a constant flow rate of 3 L/min.

“The water flow rate is monitored using a flowmeter,” the scientists explained. “To gather accurate data, a set of thermocouples is strategically placed to simultaneously measure various temperatures, including the inlet and outlet water temperatures of the PV/T system, the PV panel’s surface temperature, and the ambient air temperature.”
The system also uses a multimeter to measure the PV module's output power and a pyranometer to assess solar radiation.
The academics compared the performance of the cooled PV panel to a reference panel without cooling during May at the Notre Dame University-Louaize campus, located in Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon.

Their analysis showed that the PVT panel can generate 4% more power than the PV module, thanks to the cooling effect of the copper pipes. They also warned, however, that a saturation effect related to the hot water stored in the tank not being effectively utilized, may limit the ability to optimally cool the PV modules at a certain stage.
“This reduction is likely due to the absence of residential water demand in the waste heat recovery system,” the researchers further explained. “This absence causes the cooling water temperature in the hot water reservoir to gradually increase, reducing thus the rate of heat removal from the PVT system.”
The tests also showed that the PVT panel achieved an average electric efficiency of 11.5% while the PV panel without cooling reached an average efficiency of 10%. The scientists also revealed that the PVT system's total efficiency reached around 75% and that of the reference PV system was only about 10%.
“The average thermal efficiency, representing the ratio of recovered waste heat to the solar energy absorbed by the PV panel, was approximately 60% in the cooled PV/T system,” they also stated. “The cooled PV/T system not only generated a higher fraction of electric power but also exhibited an approximately 40% higher rate of heat loss from the back side of the PV module, indicating the efficient waste heat recovery.”
The system was presented in the paper “An experimental analysis of a hybrid photovoltaic thermal system through parallel water pipe integration,” published in the International Journal of Thermofluids.

The Queensland government has announced changes to legislation that will allow for the creation of the Battery Booster Rebate Scheme that will pay up to AUD 4,000 to homeowners who want to install batteries alongside new or existing rooftop solar systems with a capacity of 5 kW or more.
The explanatory notes that accompany the new regulation estimates that the up-front cost of a battery system in Queensland is more than AUD 9,000, which can be considered “uneconomic for most consumers.”
“While solar costs have come down considerably over the past decade, access to capital to purchase a solar battery remains a barrier for lower-income households,” the regulation reads. “The purpose of assistance under the scheme is to give individual owners of residential premises a rebate to offset the cost of having an approved battery system suitably installed at the premises.”
While the government is yet to announce when the Battery Booster Rebate Scheme will commence, Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni told the ABC that it is due to begin next year.
“Part of our revolutionary Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan is the development of a new household program, including support for batteries, to further support Queenslanders manage their electricity bills and usage,” he said. “Our Battery Booster Rebate Scheme is designed to do that.”
The new household battery rebate scheme is targeted at households with a combined taxable income of less than AUD 180,000 a year. Households with an income less than AUD 66,667 per annum can access a rebate of AUD 4,000, while those that earn above that threshold will be eligible for a AUD 3,000 payment.
Up to 4,000 households are projected to benefit from the program with the explanatory notes indicating the Queensland and federal governments have each allocated AUD 12 million to the scheme over two years.
The move has been welcomed by Queensland Conservation Council campaigner Stephanie Gray, who said supporting the greater uptake of household battery storage is a forward-looking initiative that will play a pivotal role in the deployment of renewables.
“We’ve seen Queensland’s coal-fired power stations become less and less reliable as they get older,” she said. “Increasing the uptake of batteries, including household, community and network batteries, increases the resilience of our energy system and will help keep the lights on. Batteries can react with lightning speed to plug gaps in our electricity supply.”

Solar energy production dropped in most of the main European electricity markets in the week of Dec. 4 with declines ranging from 23% in Portugal to 3.9% in Spain. But solar energy production saw some bright spots, as noticed by the 15% increase in the German market.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s solar energy production forecasts, solar energy production will increase in Germany and Spain in the week of Dec. 11 but decrease in Italy.
 


 
During the week of Dec. 4, wind energy production increased in most major European electricity markets compared to the previous week. In the French market, production using wind doubled that of the previous week, reaching 344 GWh on Dec. 10 – the highest value since the end of March. In Germany, there was an increase of 88%, and in Portugal, 34%. At the same time, the Italian and Spanish markets registered a decrease in wind energy generation of 49% and 3.3% respectively.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts for the week of Dec. 11, it will decrease in most of the analyzed markets, except in Spain and Italy.
 

 
Electricity demand
In the week of Dec. 4, most of the major European electricity markets registered a decrease in electricity demand compared to the previous week. Demand declines ranged from 4.7% in Great Britain to 1.0% in Germany. The Portuguese market was the exception to this trend, with an increase in demand of 6.4%.
The drop in demand was related to less cold average temperatures in central and northern Europe compared to the previous week. Average temperature increases ranged from 1.6 °C in Germany to 3.9 °C in Belgium and Great Britain. In southern Europe, however, average temperatures were cooler than the previous week, with variations ranging from ‑3.5 °C in Italy to ‑0.7 °C in Portugal.
In addition, on Dec. 8, Italy, Portugal and Spain celebrated the Immaculate Conception Day. For Spain, it was the second public holiday of the week, following the Constitution Day celebrated on Dec. 6.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts, electricity demand will continue to decline in most of the analyzed markets in the week of Dec. 11. Only the Iberian Peninsula and Italian markets will register an increase in demand as working hours recover after the holidays of the week of Dec. 4.
 

 
European electricity markets
In the week of Dec. 4, prices in major European electricity markets decreased compared to the previous week. The exception was the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries, with an increase of 3.6%. On the other hand, the MIBEL market of Spain and Portugal registered the largest price drop, 27%, while the IPEX market of Italy had the smallest decline, 8.1%. In the rest of the markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices fell between 23% in the EPEX SPOT market of Germany and 26% in the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium and France.
Weekly averages were below €110/MWh in almost all analyzed European electricity markets in the first week of December. The exception was the Italian market, with an average of €123.21/MWh. In contrast, the Portuguese and Spanish markets registered the lowest weekly averages, €68.15/MWh and €68.21/MWh, respectively. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €97.53/MWh in the French market to €106.24/MWh in the N2EX market of the United Kingdom.
On the other hand, the Spanish and Portuguese markets reached the lowest hourly prices in the first week of December. In fact, since November 29, the MIBEL market has registered every day the lowest daily prices among the main European electricity markets. This market registered the minimum hourly price of the week of Dec. 4, €4.30/MWh, on Dec. 8 from 3:00 to 7:00 and from 11:00 to 16:00. In contrast, the Nordic market registered the highest price, €214.53/MWh, on Dec. 5, from 8:00 to 9:00. This price was the highest in this market since the second half of Dec. 2022.
During the week of Dec. 4, the drop in the average price of gas and CO2 emission rights and the fall in electricity demand in most markets led to lower prices in the European electricity markets. The increase in wind energy production in countries such as Germany, France and Portugal also had a downward influence on prices.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the second week of December, prices might continue to fall in most major European electricity markets. Declining demand in some markets and increased solar energy production in markets such as Germany and Spain, as well as increased wind energy production in Italy, might contribute to this behavior.
 

 
Brent, fuels and CO2
Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market began the last week of November with a slight price decline from the previous week. Despite this, on Monday, Dec. 4, these futures registered their weekly maximum settlement price, $78.03/bbl. The downward trend continued until reaching the weekly minimum settlement price, $74.05/bbl, on Thursday, Dec. 7. This price was the lowest since the end of June. In contrast, on Friday, Dec. 8, prices increased by 2.4% to $75.84/bbl.
High production levels in the United States and data on declining crude oil imports in China led to Brent oil futures price declines. However, at the end of the first week of Dec., the announcement of the US government’s plans to refill its strategic reserves exerted its upward influence on prices. The call by Saudi Arabia and Russia for more OPEC+ countries to make production cuts also contributed to the turnaround.
As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, on Monday, Dec. 4, they reached the weekly maximum settlement price, €40.10/MWh. This price was already 7.8% lower than the last session of the previous week. After falling another 4.9%, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €38.13/MWh, on Tuesday, Dec. 5.
According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was the lowest since early October. In the last three sessions of the first week of December, prices were slightly higher but remained below €40/MWh. On Friday, Dec. 8, the settlement price was €38.60/MWh.
In the first week of December, abundant supply and high levels of European stocks led to TTF gas futures settlement prices below €40/MWh. Milder temperatures, following the cold snap, also had a downward influence on prices.
As for CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, they reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €70.37/t, on Monday, December 4. This price was 2.9% lower than that of the last session of the previous week. In the rest of the sessions of the first week of December, settlement prices were below €70/t. On Friday, December 8, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €68.63/t. This price was the lowest since October 2022 for the December 2022 reference contract.

IEA-PVPS Task 19, aiming to start in summer 2024 and succeeding Task 14 which focussed on principles of PV integration, will endeavor to tackle key issues hindering sustainable PV grid integration in practice. To address the multifaceted challenges of PV grid integration, Task 19 will rely on experts worldwide, contributing diverse perspectives, experiences, and insights.
The Journey of IEA-PVPS Task 14
Task 14, established over a decade ago, aimed to promote grid-connected PV as a vital source in power systems with high renewable energy penetration. The primary goal was to overcome technical barriers associated with integrating dispersed generators, particularly in scenarios with elevated levels of renewable energy sources (RES). Task 14 collaborated with utilities, industry players, and stakeholders to develop technologies and methods for the widespread deployment of distributed, grid-connected PV technologies.
In the last years, the landscape changed significantly as PV adoption surged, and millions of systems are now in place, by far the most in terms of numbers connected to low-voltage networks. The global proliferation of feed-in laws in around 150 countries further complicated the situation for DSOs. The advent of electrical storage altered the paradigm, influencing investment decisions for grid operators and reshaping the way energy flows within the network.
The landscape continued to transform with the introduction of electric cars and heat pumps, thrusting DSOs into a multidimensional consideration of PV, e-mobility, and heating. In response, the concept of smart grids emerged as a solution, but not without its set of challenges, including visibility into connected systems, understanding network states, and the ability to react promptly to potential issues.
The current solutions and regulations, while functional, stem from a centralized mindset. The rise of decentralized electricity systems, coupled with the proliferation of photovoltaic storage, demands a transformative approach. Task 19 aims to identify barriers and lead a paradigm shift in how smart grids are conceptualized and executed by DSOs. The lessons learned from Task 14 lay the groundwork for the next phase, Task 19.
Task 19's Ambitious Goals and the Call for Global Expertise
Task 19's inception comes at a crucial juncture in the energy transition. With a heightened focus on grid integration, the new task aims to explore innovative solutions to propel PV into a dominant position within power systems. However, the success of Task 19 hinges on the active participation of experts from around the globe.
Strategic Topics with a Global Perspective
One of the primary challenges in PV integration lies in the lack of standardized grid planning structures, especially for medium and low voltage, which is why Task 19 envisions active participation from the PV community in grid planning. Conflicts during approval and commissioning processes will be scrutinized, with a focus on international interconnection standards and potential improvements through digitalization. The aim is to create an overview of international grid connection standards and best practices for approval procedures. A centralized, standardized, and digital registration system for PV systems should be developed, inspired by successful models in California and Australia.
The goal for Task 19 is to create a tool that facilitates international cooperation, setting standards and regulations for seamless integration.
Smart grids emerge as a critical component in dealing with the integration of PV, electromobility, and heat pumps. Currently, DSOs implement different strategies to host decentralized energy systems in their networks aiming at visibility and controllability within their networks down to low voltage and the final customer. Task 19 will delve into leveraging smart meter data, integrating smart inverters, exploring artificial intelligence applications, and addressing cybersecurity.
As synchronous generation declines, grid-forming inverters become crucial. The plan is to study demonstrative projects, review grid codes and standards, and identify best practices. Task 19 aims to offer an overview of solutions and recommendations for research, standardization organizations, and inverter manufacturers.
Power management strategies and curtailment become focal points for PV integration in the market. Drawing lessons from success stories, such as Australia's flexible export limit, Task 19 aims to develop effective measures that allow PV systems to participate optimally in energy markets without compromising network stability.
Task 19 recognizes the pivotal role of electronic development in ensuring that inverters support the network effectively. By bringing together expertise from various countries, the Task aims to foster innovation in network services, addressing the evolving needs of the decentralized energy landscape.
In the journey towards redefining photovoltaic grid integration, IEA-PVPS Task 19 emphasizes the need for a global collaboration of diverse expertise. As we navigate the challenges of an evolving energy landscape, Task 19 invites professionals worldwide to contribute to practical solutions.
