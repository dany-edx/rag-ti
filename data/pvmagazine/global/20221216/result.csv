The new measures are part of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 from 2000 levels.
The authorities first announced plans for mandatory solar requirements in early September. The new provisions apply to new homes with rooftop spaces of more than 20 square meters and buildings with total rooftop spaces of less than 2,000 square meters.
They will also require businesses to install solar arrays on 30% of their rooftop surfaces. Some parts of the city could face requirements for 85% of all rooftops to be covered by PV.
The new rules will require developers and installers to use solar panels from manufacturers that respect human rights, according to a previous statement from the city government.

The South Australian government has released an international request for proposals (RFP) from industry partners to help deliver a 250 MW green hydrogen production facility, a 200 MW hydrogen power plant, and storage infrastructure capable of holding 3,600 tons of hydrogen.
The government said the green hydrogen power plant, which will provide firming capacity to the state grid, will be operational by December 2025. The call focuses on the supply, construction and operation of the hydrogen plant and equipment, in addition to seeking interest in purchasing hydrogen produced at the facility.
State Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said South Australia is already a leader in clean energy production, with renewables accounting for 69% of its energy generation in 2022. He noted that it now wants to become a global leader in green hydrogen. The hydrogen power plant will play a major role in the state as a significant global player in green hydrogen production, Koutsantonis added, claiming that this will give it an early advantage in attracting associated supply chain jobs, ongoing maintenance, and potentially manufacturing.
“As the world looks to decarbonize, South Australia is making a once-in-a-generation investment in green hydrogen, an investment that places the Upper Spencer Gulf region at the epicentre of a renewable energy revolution,” he said. “Local power, local jobs, global exports, global leadership – we will seize this opportunity to transform not just the energy sector but potentially the state’s economic future.”
The government has already secured land options near Whyalla for the power plant and associated green hydrogen production and storage facilities. It said that by securing exclusivity over land options, it “can expedite the design process and de-risk the project by ensuring that appropriate land is available on time.”
The sites are within a 15-km radius to the northeast of the city and close to critical infrastructure, transport links and existing and planned economic development. They include a 238-hectare parcel of land in the Whyalla industrial estate and 8.7 hectares in the Cultana Industrial Estate, which are the preferred locations for the hydrogen production facility and hydrogen power station. A third site adjacent to the Cultana industrial estate provides the opportunity for power generation and other infrastructure for the project.
The government said the scale of the sites allow for future expansion of the scope and size of operations. The request for proposal will remain open until Feb. 21, 2023, with contracts expected to be awarded in July 2023.
The state government’s hydrogen power plant underpins an estimated $12 billion worth of hydrogen processing investments planned for Whyalla.
Others planning to establish renewable hydrogen facilities in the industrial city include Fortescue Future Industries, Origin Energy, H2U – the Hydrogen Utility, Neoen, Chiyoda Corp., ENEOS Australia, Mitsubishi Australia, and AMP Energy, while GFG Alliance has plans for green steel production.

The vote was 407 in favor and 34 against, with 181 abstentions.
MEPs said the maximum period for the approval of new installations will be shortened from 12 months to nine if projects are located in renewable acceleration areas. Outside of such areas, procedures should not take more than 18 months, according to the MEPs. They also said that permits should be granted within six months for capacity upgrades to existing plants. The provisions are expected to go into force in 2023.
When designating renewable acceleration zones, member states should try to avoid or reduce negative environmental impacts. Parks and nature reserves, as well as migratory routes for birds and marine mammals, cannot be classified as renewable acceleration zones. MEPs have also established provisions to ensure public consultations before choosing project sites.
In addition, the new rules include an obligation for EU countries to ensure that permits to install solar on buildings are issued within three months. For renewable energy installations below 50 kW, notification should suffice. The amendments also state that permitting procedures for storage projects that are co-located with solar should also be expedited, without stating a specific time period.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/16/cooling-down-photovoltaic-panels-with-concrete/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY,WESTERN EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",Cooling down photovoltaic panels with concrete,"Researchers at the Politecnico di Torino in Italy have designed a cooling system for photovoltaic panels that uses radiative coolers based on cementitious materials. These coolers are often used for thermal management in buildings and have strong potential due to the low costs of the concrete materials they are made with.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“Our work was intended at determining the thermodynamic limit of the radiative coolers,” researcher Matteo Cagnoni told pv magazine. “In order to establish this limit, we considered the various terms of energy exchange between the solar cell, the cement-based cooler, the atmosphere, and the sun, which enables us to determine the maximum temperature reduction induced by the thermal coupling between the cell and the concrete substrate.”
The experimental simulated system consists of a stack made by a reflector, a cement-based radiative cooler, and a bifacial solar cell.
“This structure could be realized, for example, by building a thin film solar cell onto a cement-based substrate by sputtering, evaporation or solution deposition techniques,” the scientists explained, noting that the solar cell and the radiative cooler are thermally coupled and mutually transparent.
The academics found that the cooling technique could reduce the operating temperature of silicon-based solar cells by up to 20 kelvin (K), which could eventually result in efficiency improvements of about 9% and an increase in module lifetime of around 400%.
“We expect this solution to be very attractive for the market, especially if one considers building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV),” Cagnoni said. “For example, one could try to implement the theoretical system as a solar cell coupled to a roof tile. The cost of this solution may be only slightly higher than the cost of the photovoltaic panel itself, as cementitious materials are very cheap, highly scalable and robust.”
He said the additional complexity of the system involves the fabrication of the solar cell on a cement-based substrate by thin-film methods, or by thermally coupling a bulk solar cell with a cement-based slab. This additional cost is expected to be largely compensated by the gains in solar cell efficiency and system lifetime that a reduced operating temperature would induce.
“For example, a 20 C temperature reduction could lead to efficiency gains up to 9% in silicon solar cells, and up to a four-fold lifetime extension,” Cagnoni stated. “Of course, these are theoretical upper limits, but they suggest that significant gains are achievable also in the real physical devices.”
The Italian group described the new cooling technique in “Cementitious materials as promising radiative coolers for solar cells,” which was recently published in iScience.
“These works can provide a starting point for the practical implementation of our attractive concept and pave the way toward more efficient photovoltaic systems,” the group concluded.

The company said it will build the facility at an altitude between 700 meters and 1,000 meters above sea level, with slopes as steep as 18 degrees.
“The lower temperatures caused by the high altitude contribute to the generation of additional power,” it said in a statement. “However, this also means that we have to adapt the machinery as well as the sequence of implementation to the challenging topography of the site.”
Sunotec said will use 220,230 PV modules, 4,305 tons of steel, and 1,125.5 kilometers of cabling for the project. It did not provide any additional technical or financial details, but it said that it expects to complete construction on the plant by the end of the first half of 2023.
Bulgaria‘s electricity system operator (ESO) said it has accepted applications to build more than 24 GW of new renewable energy projects. The nation could become one of the most dynamic solar markets in Europe by 2024, according to a recent report by SolarPower Europe. It said the country reached 1.1 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of 2020 and will hit 3.8 GW by 2024. Market uptake will mainly be supported by unsubsidized large-scale solar projects built under power purchase agreements.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/16/australian-researchers-reveal-new-pathways-for-perovskite-cells/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,UNITED KINGDOM",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",Australian researchers reveal new pathways for perovskite cells,"From pv magazine Australia
Researchers from the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science, based at Melbourne’s Monash University, say they have demonstrated a new way to create stable perovskite solar cells that last much longer than their predecessors, to help make the technology commercially relevant.
The production of perovskite cells generally relies on the use of lead halides and requires the inclusion of strong solvents to control the crystallization process, a process that can lead to defects in the thin films, which causes the resulting device to rapidly lose efficiency. It’s also hard to control.
The researchers, together with colleagues from Wuhan University of Technology in China, said the chemical compound lead acetate has emerged as a promising alternative precursor, because it can create ultra-smooth thin films with fewer defects.
Until now, lead acetate had only been used to make methylammonium or cesium-based perovskites, which are relatively unstable and not suitable for real-world applications. The research team said a better candidate for commercial use can be found in perovskites made using formamidinium and caesium, thanks to their superior stability.
Previous attempts to synthesize them using lead acetate as the precursor failed but Dr Sebastian Fürer from Monash University said to solve this issue, the researchers had used ammonium as a volatile cation (positively charged ion) at a critical stage.
“The presence of ammonium served to drive away the residual acetate during annealing, without forming unwanted side products,” he said.
The researchers said the cells recorded a conversion efficiency of 21%, the best results yet recorded for a device made from a non-halide lead source. A mini prototype solar panel featuring the cells achieved 18.8% efficiency.
Monash University PhD student Jie Zhao said the test devices also showed strong thermal stability, continuing to function with no efficiency loss after 3,300 hours running at 65°C.
“We’ve been able to use lead acetate in a one-step, spin-coating process to get the perfect, high-quality formamidinium-caesium perovskite thin film,” he said. “And because we don’t need an anti-solvent agent, we can do this via large-scale techniques, such as blade coating, which means it’s viable at industrial scale.”
The results have been published in Energy and Environmental Science.
Another team of researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science have demonstrated a new way to improve the stability of perovskite cells, leading to thin films which they said are of greater quality, with reduced defects and enhanced stability.
The researchers said that by removing the solvent dimethyl-sulfoxide and introducing dimethylammonium chloride as a crystallization agent, they were able to better control the intermediate phases of the perovskite crystallization process.
The researchers, working with scientists from Oxford University in the United Kingdom, said groups of up to 138 sample devices were subjected to an accelerated ageing and testing process at high temperatures and in real-world conditions. The formamidinium-caesium perovskite cells created using the new synthesis process significantly outperformed the control group and demonstrated resistance to thermal, humidity and light degradation.
During testing, the best device operated above the T80 threshold for more than 1,400 hours under simulated sunlight at 65 C. T80 is the time it takes for a solar cell to reduce to 80% of its initial efficiency.
Beyond 1,600 hours, the control device fabricated using the conventional dimethyl-sulfoxide approach stopped functioning, while devices fabricated with the new, improved design retained 70% of their original efficiency.
The same degradation study was performed on a group of devices at 85 C, with the new cells again outperforming the control group.
The researchers calculated that the new cells age by a factor of 1.7 for each 10 C increase in the temperature they are exposed to, which is close to the two-fold increase expected of commercial silicon devices.
Oxford University PhD student Philippe Holzhey said the work, published in Nature Materials, is a strong step forward to matching commercial silicon’s stability and makes perovskite-silicon tandem devices a much more realistic candidate for becoming the dominant next-generation solar cell.
“It's really important that people start shifting to realise there is no value in performance if it's not a stable performance,” he said. “If the device lasts for a day or a week or something, there's not so much value in it. It has to last for years.”

They said this will reduce costs for grid operators and remove a barrier to integrating renewable energy in loosely connected power networks.
The use of PV inverters instead of compensators might provide additional sources of revenue for PV plant owners, although the supply of voltage support from a utility-scale PV plant would require the addition of an augmented voltage controller to the facility, which would also have to be replaced within the lifetime of an asset.
“There is a good case to be made that PV plant operators should be paid for providing voltage support at night,” researcher Jay Apt told pv magazine. “Without additional compensation, it would not be a good business decision for  PV plant operators to take on the additional costs.”
He said local ancillary services for reactive power could be created, with generators bidding on reactive power capability on an hourly basis – much like regulation ancillary services. An ancillary service would thus create an efficient market for reactive power prices and provide the revenue needed for PV plant operators to recoup their costs.
“With adequate incentives, PV plant operators can add a revenue stream by providing reactive power support at night,” said researcher Yamit Lavi. “PV plant operators already accept approximately a one-year lifetime reduction of their inverters for currently-mandatory reactive power requirements. Providing reactive power at night will reduce their lifetime by only one additional year and increase benefits to the grid, potentially furthering the adoption of PV.”
Voltage compensators are commonly known as static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) or flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS). They cost between $30 million and $100 million, depending on the size and location. PV inverters are also expensive assets, but they remain unused for about 50% of their lifetimes and the usual voltage support such devices provide during the day is not available at night.
“PV providing reactive power at night has been successfully field-tested in East Sussex UK by National Grid and Lightsource BP argue that using a group of PV inverters for voltage support is about 50 times less costly than installing a FACTS device,” the researchers explained, noting that their work involves quantifying the cost of reactive power from a solar PV power plant. “We make the first comparison of the total cost of utilizing a PV inverter as a substitute for a STATCOM to that of a STATCOM, including wear and tear on the inverter and necessary equipment.”
The academics used a model developed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to determine whether PV inverters can prevent night-time voltage excursions. They also compared costs based on a discounted cash flow model.
They found that PV inverters have an average cost of $20.20 per kilovolt-amperes reactive (kVAR), which they said is between $56/kVAR and $269/kVAR less expensive than STATCOMs.
“This difference has a large range due to the large range in STATCOM costs, which are due the STATCOM size, environmental conditions of the location, and the equipment necessary for installation and interconnection,” they said.
The researchers presented their findings in “Using PV inverters for voltage support at night can lower grid costs,” which was recently published in Energy Reports.
“Our analysis showed that operating PV inverters at night is 4 to 14 times less costly,” the scientists concluded. “The cost difference is due to a shorter lifespan of PV inverters as well as a more detailed discounted cash flow model that accounts for controller replacements.”

CubicPV has announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain, while also creating 1,500 new direct jobs.
“The IRA represents a titanic shift in the global solar landscape, and the U.S. is poised to become the world’s most competitive location to manufacture solar,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO of CubicPV. “We’re excited to have a role in the U.S. manufacturing renaissance while accelerating our business plan and supporting the development of our next generation tandem module technology.”
CubicPV was formed last year from the merger of 1366 Technologies and Hunt Perovskite Technologies. 1366 Technologies was known for its direct wafer technology, which forms wafers directly with molten silicon. The advantage is that kerfless wafer production does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers – a time-consuming process that wastes materials such as silicon dust. Instead, the company’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon.
Texas-based Hunt Perovskite Technologies, which was founded in 2013, specializes in metal halide perovskite in single-junction solar panels for the utility-scale market. The merger has therefore resulted in a new production process that combines 1366’s direct wafer process and Hunt’s printed perovskite solar photovoltaic technology.
While CubicPV reports that its new factory will produce conventional silicon wafers, it said it will continue research and development of its tandem modules, which reportedly offer more than 30% greater efficiency than the highest-efficiency conventional modules. The design stacks two solar cells, with silicon on the bottom, powered by CubicPV’s Direct Wafer technology and perovskite on the top, to “dramatically increase the power of every acre of solar deployed,” according to the company.
CubicPV has not yet chosen a site for its US facility, but it says the design has begun. It expects to finalize the site choice in the first quarter of 2023. Construction is anticipated to be completed in 2024, with the factory fully ramped up in 2025.
“The Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition applauds CubicPV for bringing the first global-scale wafer manufacturing facility to the United States,” said Mike Carr, the executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition. “Their planned 10 GW facility to manufacture conventional mono wafers will serve as a major catalyst in our efforts to create a fully American solar supply chain.”

EIL said it has secured a contract from Adani's Mundra Solar Technology unit to serve as owner’s engineer for the group's new polysilicon and monosilane (SiH4) project in the Indian state of Gujarat.
Polysilicon is the primary component to make photovoltaic panels. Globally, polysilicon production is concentrated in China and the United States. Monosilane is a gaseous compound used to produce polysilicon.
India’s ambitious solar power generation target implies that the country will need significant capacity to make PV components, in order to meet demand. However, the nation still lacks polysilicon manufacturing capacity and is dependent on imports.
As part of its strategic plan, Adani aims to have 10 GW of polysilicon-to-solar module manufacturing capacity up and running by 2025. The group, which already manufactures cells and modules, recently unveiled its India-made silicon ingots.
“[Polysilicon production] would be a step toward realizing the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” said EIL. “This would also contribute towards nation’s target of net zero by 2070.”

Grid-scale storage has set another record quarter for deployment, with 4.7 GWh of installations in the third quarter, building on the previous record of 4.6 GWh set in the first quarter of 2021, according to Wood Mackenzie. This is enough battery storage to power 150,000 homes a day.
“Demand in the grid-scale and residential storage segments continues to increase, despite rising costs and lingering supply chain challenges,” said Vanessa Witte, a senior analyst on Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team.
The market is highly consolidated for grid-scale storage, with 96% of total capacity this quarter installed in California and Texas, which are also the largest markets for utility-scale solar. Front-of-the-meter grid-scale storage is more highly concentrated in these markets than behind-the-meter residential energy storage.
“California’s reliance on energy storage to meet record peak demand this September shows why it’s absolutely critical that policymakers and grid operators remove barriers to supply to ensure reliability,” said Jason Burwen, vice president of energy storage for the American Clean Power Association.
Forecasts for 2022 to 2026 increased by 109% quarter over quarter, with the US market expecting nearly 65 GW over this period. Grid-scale installations are expected to account for 84% of that capacity.
“Installed capacity is expected to more than double next year, driven by new grid-scale project announcements and increased residential and non-residential volumes in CA due to the introduction of a community solar program and NEM 3.0,” said Witte.
Residential energy storage enjoyed a record quarter as well, with 400 MWh installed, surpassing the previous record of 375 MWh from the second quarter of 2022. California, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Texas led the market. Wood Mackenzie expects^ this segment to grow to 2.2 GW in 2026.
Meanwhile, community, commercial, and industrial storage had another quarter below expectations, with 56.6 MWh installed in the third quarter. Wood Mackenzie said it expects this segment to grow as well, benefiting from demand in the residential and grid-scale segments.
The trend of project delays due to supply chain constraints continues to hamper development in the near term, but 2022-28 interconnection queues have increased 120% quarter over quarter.
“Some developers have considered delaying projects into 2023 to receive tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, but this only applies to a very niche segment of projects,” said Witte.
Witte said supply chain issues and interconnection queue backlogs may push project installations ahead in the forecast. Due to this, Wood Mackenzie has bumped up 2024-2026 projections by 9% to 13% per year.
