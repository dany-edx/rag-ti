The book for the offering, the largest ever held in South Korea, will close tomorrow with deal pricing set for Friday.
The reported IPO could take the company’s value to as much as KRW70.2 trillion ($58.8 billion), which would make it South Korea's third-biggest listed company, after Samsung Electronics and semiconductor business SK Hynix. According to a previous report from Bloomberg, the price range was set at KRW257,000-300,000 per share.
Demand for the stock was reportedly around 13 times bigger than the $6 billion on offer to institutions, according to the company's regulatory filings for the IPO.
LGES had announced at a press conference this week it would use the proceeds from its IPO – on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index – to expand its manufacturing capacity in Europe, the Americas and Asia. The company also forecast its market share would overtake that of rival Chinese battery maker CATL thanks to a wider range of customers, and said it was aiming for a double-digit operating margin.

Shell’s final investment decision to build the Holland Hydrogen I [green hydrogen production project] is expected in 2022, after which the intended start of production will be in 2024.” Holland Hydrogen I will cover two hectares and produce green hydrogen for industry and transport sector, using electricity from offshore wind farm Hollandse Kust (Noord). “The hydrogen can be transported through a pipeline with a length of about 40km that will run from the plant to Shell’s Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam,” added Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers.
French renewable hydrogen startup Lhyfe is building and operating an electrolyzer in Luckau Brandenburg, in Germany. “For the production of the green hydrogen, the company [will co-operate] with the Hamburg-based company Enerparc,” wrote Lhyfe yesterday, adding the two companies are coupling the electrolyzer with a 20MW photovoltaic plant in the Spreewald area of Germany. “The electrolyzer, with an output of 5MW, thus enables the production of up to 1,200kg of green hydrogen daily,” reads a press release which stated the energy carrier will be used in industrial processes and transport in the region. The first green hydrogen is set to be produced at the end of next year. “In France and Denmark, we are already involved in a large number of projects,” said Luc Graré, head of international business at Lhyfe. “Now we are setting up broadly in Germany as well.”
Los Angeles-based Southern California Gas has teamed up with South Korean hydrogen fuel cell business Doosan Mobility Innovation (DMI) and U.S. non-profit research body the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to launch DMI's first-of-its-kind hydrogen drone tech to monitor the LA power company's gas grid. With the support of SoCalGas and GTI, DMI will be demonstrating its DS30 drone. The device offers up to 120 minutes of flight time and up to 11lb maximum payload. “SoCalGas plans to use the DS30 drone to assist with natural gas pipeline inspections,” read a press release issued last week. “Drone usage provides unparalleled imagery and aerial mapping services to further improve pipeline system maintenance. The DS30 demonstration will provide close-up digital photography for locations that are difficult or hazardous to access and [will also] provide imagery for aerial mapping and three-dimensional topographic models, which [allow] for deeper insight on [terrain] surrounding the utility's operations.” Doosan Mobility was one of the stars of the recent CES tech event in Las Vegas, one of the most high-profile in the world.
Canada-based Hydrogen Optimized says it has signed a letter of intent with an unnamed large industrial company to provide more than 40MW of RuggedCell water electrolyzer capacity for hydrogen production. The commitment indicates the installed systems could be scaled up as demand for hydrogen grows. “More and more potential clients tell us they are looking for a water electrolysis system that can be economically deployed in the tens of megawatts [capacity range] and can be expanded at a relatively low incremental cost as the megawatt rating of [a] project grows,” said Hydrogen Optimized CEO Andrew Stuart.
Missouri-based electricals and tech manufacturer Emerson is developing software and systems to enable operations at the Poshydon project which is being planned in Dutch North Sea waters and has been described as “the world’s first offshore green hydrogen production process on an operational gas platform.” Poshydon will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating wind power, natural gas, and hydrogen production at sea. The Q13a-A oil production platform operated by London-based energy company Neptune Energy will host the project, which will provide insights into electrolyzer efficiency from a variable power supply. “Green electricity will be used to simulate the fluctuating supply from wind turbines and power the production process, which will convert sea water into de-mineralized water and then safely produce hydrogen via electrolysis,” Emerson wrote today. “The hydrogen is then blended with the natural gas and transported to the coast via the existing gas pipeline and fed into the national gas grid. The 1MW electrolyzer is expected to produce up to three tons of hydrogen per week.”
Hydrogen fuel cells were the first products mentioned by the British government when it announced the U.K. registered a 9% year-on-year increase in exports to South Korea in the year to June. The government cited a deal between Horsham-based next-generation fuel cell tech business Ceres Power and Korean conglomerate Doosan to build a 50MW factory to produce the former's cells. London is also betting on hydrogen mobility in its export strategy. For instance, U.K. fuel cell manufacturer Intelligent Energy has partnered with South Korean electric bus maker Edison Motors. Loughborough-based Intelligent Energy will reportedly “also work with [South Korea's] Hogreen Air to test its fuel cell technology for [the latter company's] drones.”
Namibia’s president, Hage Geingob, has said his country wants to become a global decarbonization champion by betting on hydrogen. That was the conclusion he drew after the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow in November and it appears the strategy will involving selling off the rights to create hydrogen in the Southern African nation. “In 2022, we shall secure the first NAD100 million (€5.64 million) in concession fees from the preferred bidder … translating the vision of a synthetic fuels industry into immediate foreign direct investment flows,” said Geingob in his new year speech. “We shall deliver Namibia’s green hydrogen strategy, outlining a clear pathway to unlocking even greater investments.”
Danish tech company Haldor Topsøe has signed a €45 million loan agreement with the European Investment Bank to support its research into “innovative green hydrogen technologies.” The company intends to invest in the development of new catalysts and catalytic technologies.

The RMB16 billion (US$2.51 billion) project comprises the Mangkang Angdo and Gongju Lator solar plants. The power company said the site will be integrated with agriculture and pastoral cultivation. The project is one of nine clean energy projects listed in China’s 14th five-year plan. Those renewables projects will have a combined generation capacity of 300GW and will cost around RMB300 billion (US$47 billion), according to the National Energy Administration.
Solar module manufacturer Longi and energy company China Petrochemical Corp have announced plans to deploy photovoltaics on 147 of the latter's gasoline stations. The arrays will feature the Longi Roof product, a new building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panel which replaces conventional building tilt roofs.

Spanish inverter manufacturer and storage system provider Ingeteam has connected to the grid a 40MW solar plant coupled to 3MW/9MWh of storage in Spain.
Located in the department of Almaraz, in the southern region of Extremadura, the Arañuelo III facility was developed and built by Spanish energy company Iberdrola and is part of a photovoltaic complex with a combined capacity of 143MW.
The plant is the first large scale solar plant to incorporate batteries in Spain and the storage system is the first of its kind being installed within the photovoltaic plant in a distributed manner, following a DC-coupling configuration.
According to the manufacturer, the batteries are installed within the solar array and the battery converters share the DC connection with the PV inverters, offering several key technical advantages such as the so-called clipping recapture, which offers the possibility of utilizing the extra power from the solar panels that is not used in the peak production hours, and a more efficient discharge, due to the fact that no power transformer is required.
“This novel technique to create a hybrid PV generation system with battery energy storage, was made possible thanks to the development by Ingeteam of a new battery converter: the DC-DC series of the Ingecon Sun Storage Power family,” Ingeteam said in a statement. “This converter is coupled to the DC input of a PV inverter, thereby obtaining, in practice, a hybrid central inverter with a direct coupling to the solar panels and batteries alike and with a single AC output that is coupled to the LV/MV transformer.”

Its application in PV devices, however, has been limited to a few research works to date, due to the lack of proper manufacturing processes.
According to a group of scientists from China, rapid thermal evaporation (RTE), which is a process that is commonly used for evaporating and depositing a material on a substrate located within 10mm of the source, could fill this gap and help produce solar cells based on high crystal quality with large grain size.
“One of the technical challenges is how to obtain highly crystallized CdSe films with low defect density,” they explained in the study Rapid thermal evaporation for cadmium selenide thin-film solar cells, published in Higher Education Press. “Furthermore, as an n-type semiconductor, finding a suitable p-type candidate is important to build a high-quality PN junction with CdSe thin film.”
The cell was built with a CdSe thin film with a direct bandgap of 1.72eV that was prepared via chemical bath deposition for 16 minutes on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO2:F, FTO) transparent glass substrate. RTE was used for depositing the CdSe films by evaporating CdSe powder with 99.995% purity. The electron transport layer (ETL) was made with zinc oxide and cadmium sulfide (ZnO/CdS) and the hole transport layer (HTL) with the PEDOT polymer and copper iodide (CuI). Gold contacts with a size of 0.09cm2 were deposited using a resistance evaporation thin-film deposition system.
The scientists produced a solar cell with a thickness of 500nm that achieved a power conversion efficiency of 1.88%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.501V, a short-circuit current of 6.45mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 58.1%.
“This is a preliminary exploration and demonstration of the feasibility of CdSe thin-film solar cells. Further effort is required to focus on solving the problem of carrier transport at the ETL/CdSe interface, to improve short-circuit current, which will enhance the efficiency of CdSe solar cells to a new level”, the scientists concluded, noting that this kind of solar cell may be potentially used as a top subcell in tandem crystalline silicon-based devices.

A note issued yesterday by the U.S.-owned data company, which highlighted how such issues drove up the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) across the Asia-Pacific region in 2021, saw senior analyst Rishab Shrestha state: “Renewables’ supply chain bottlenecks are expected to ease in 2022 and beyond, and the respective LCOE will return to a declining trend.”
With Chinese polysilicon companies ramping up production facilities, WoodMac said an easing in supply problems, and related cost rises, would reverse a 9% year-on-year rise in the average cost of solar projects across the region recorded last year, to US$0.086/kWh – the first such rise in the history of the region's solar industry.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
The only market not to experience more expensive PV electricity last year was solar superpower China, in part thanks to the zero-tolerance Covid policy which has attracted so much attention in western nations of late. Rampant rises in the cost of fossil fuels in China, domestic solar manufacturing, and the nation's climate change commitments were also factors, according to Verisk-owned WoodMac.
Steepling rises in fossil fuel costs last year ensured that even with their unusual price premiums, Asia-Pacific solar and onshore wind projects – the latter rising in cost 2%, to US$0.103/kWh – gained ground in their economic business case against gas-fired power projects, which became 46% more costly in the region in 2021, and coal plants, which cost 19% more than in 2020.
While solar and onshore wind facilities are 12-29% cheaper over their project lifetime than fossil fuel equivalents in India, China and Australia, “a significant renewables premium” across the other Asia-Pacific countries ensures such clean power plants are 16% more costly over their operating life than gas and coal generation sites, across the region as a whole.
That situation will be reversed by the end of the decade, according to WoodMac, which predicted solar projects, and to a lesser extent onshore wind sites, will together be 28% cheaper than coal across the Asia-Pacific market in 2030 and will achieve at least cost parity with gas. By that stage, solar and onshore wind will be 50-55% cheaper than coal in India, China and Australia, casting into doubt the efficacy of the successful push by the former two nations to water down a desired global commitment to phase out coal use, at the COP26 climate change talks in Glasgow in November.
With gas-fired generation costs potentially set to be driven up 70-100% by the costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology this decade, according to the analyst, the current 50% price premium of renewables with energy storage against the fossil fuel could be removed by 2030.
With around 70% of Asia-Pacific power generation based on fossil fuels, WoodMac research director Alex Whitworth hit out at what he said were plans by the Japanese government to base its future electricity generation on a mix of 20% green or blue ammonia – the latter produced from nitrogen plus hydrogen powered by CCS-equipped gas facilities – and 80% coal.
“A fuel mix of 20% green or blue ammonia plus 80% coal, as proposed, will cost around US$150/MWh even by 2030,” said Whitworth in the WoodMac note. “This is more expensive than gas power while still emitting almost twice as much carbon. A combination of offshore wind and distributed solar backed up by storage and gas units would have a similar price tag. Is Japan ready for a potential doubling of the average power generation costs in 2030 compared to recent years?”

Lithium and other metal-air batteries are favored in research for their potential for high energy densities, but low efficiency and poor cycle lifetimes have proven to be tough obstacles to overcome in developing such technologies.
With this in mind, scientists from Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science and Softbank have developed a rechargeable lithium-air battery. They claim it has an energy density that greatly exceeds that of conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Like other LABs built at the research level, the Japanese consortium's battery relies on lithium for the negative electrode and oxygen for the positive porous carbon electrode. The 10-cell stacked device has a size of 4 cm x 5 cm and single-layered cells with a 2 cm x 2 cm electrode.
“In the stacked cell configuration, oxygen needs to be transported in the horizontal direction in the gas diffusion layer,” the scientists explained. “Then, oxygen needs to be further transported to the vertical direction to go through the whole part of the positive electrode.”
When operated at room temperature, the champion battery exhibited a weight energy density of 500 Wh/kg, which is about twice that of current lithium-ion batteries. The performance has been described as the highest in the world in terms of energy density and number of cycles.
“Although there are many reports that demonstrate the successful operation of a LAB with prolonged discharge/charge processes for more than 100 cycles, their energy density at the practical cell level was lower than 50 W h kg−1. In contrast, for the LABs with an energy density over 300 W h kg−1, the cycle number was less than 20 cycles,” the researchers said.
They claim that the storage device has potential applications in residential power storage systems, electric vehicles, drones, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. They described it in “Criteria for evaluating lithium-air batteries in academia to correctly predict their practical performance in industry,” which was recently published in Materials Horizons.

“Conventional CAES has relatively low cost compared to all kinds of batteries and we would imagine that this technology should only improve that advantage,” the research's corresponding author, Nicholas AuYeung, told pv magazine. “Cost analysis has not been performed yet, but we are interested in doing a thorough techno-economic analysis.”
Described in the paper “Thermochemical heat recuperation for compressed air energy storage,” published in Energy Conversion and Management, the novel approach consists of applying a thermochemical energy storage (TCES) technique that stores energy in chemical bonds to recover the heat produced during air compression operations. “TCES systems based upon metal oxide redox reactions which can release oxygen under high partial pressures of oxygen are especially of interest, although any chemistry that can operate under high pressures could be considered,” the study reads. “These schemes typically take on the form of solid-gas reactions.”
The scientists proposed to use, in particular, resistance heating to decompose barium oxides in the charging step of CAES through three different strategies: Utilizing direct heat transfer through a reactive bed of TCES materials in a solid-gas reaction; indirect heat transfer between hot air and the TCES system; and a combination of direct and indirect heat transfer.
“We looked at TCES with packed beds filled with rocks and barium oxides,” AuYeung stated. “Our results showed a similar round-trip efficiency between beds with TCES and beds without because of the relatively low heat capacity and heat of reaction for the barium oxides.”
According to him, the proposed system configuration can ensure a 60% round-trip efficiency with a 20-hour storage time after charge. This compares to a round-trip efficiency of only between 40% and 50% in conventional CAES. “To better illustrate the potential of the concept, we came up with a hypothetical material with the same heat capacity as rocks but a thermochemical storage capacity three times that of barium oxides, and we looked at that hypothetical material in our model,” AuYeung further explained. “Results showed that a potential round-trip efficiency improvement of more than 5% can be obtained, as well as longer storage duration. Also, 45% less filler volume would be needed to achieve storage capacity similar to rock-filled beds.”
Looking forward, the research team is planning to investigate more materials. “There are non-oxygen chemistries such as hydrates and carbonates that have the hypothetical properties – high heat capacity, high heat of reaction – we looked at, but right now we haven’t identified one for a redox material that operates on oxygen swing,” AuYeung concluded.

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has announced up to AUD 40 million ($28.7 million) in funding to support research and development toward the federal government’s “ultra low-cost solar stretch goal.” That target, announced as part of the government’s net-zero 2050 commitment prior to COP26 in Glasgow last year, seeks to bring solar generation down to AUD 15/MWh as the foundation for Australia’s energy future. 
ARENA already has previous R&D investment for solar in place through its Solar 30 30 30 target of 30% module efficiency and AUD 0.30 per installed watt at the utility scale by 2030. But now that the federal government’s latest Low Emissions Technology Statement (LETS) makes “ultra low-cost solar” a priority technology, ARENA is inviting applications for the newly available funding through two streams: 
In a statement, ARENA said it would split the AUD 40 million of additional funding equally between the two streams. ARENA CEO Darren Miller noted that Australia’s pioneering solar researchers will be key to driving further cost reductions and improving solar cell efficiency. 
“Australia’s solar researchers have been leading the world for decades,” said Miller. “Thirty years ago, UNSW researchers invented the PERC silicon solar cell, technology which today is the foundation of more than 80% of the world’s solar panels … That great work continues through ACAP, our universities and CSIRO as well as clean energy startups. Just a few months ago, SunDrive – a startup founded by former UNSW students and now based in Sydney – created the world’s most efficient solar cell.”
Indeed, SunDrive managed to achieve the most effective commercial-sized silicon solar cell in the world with a figure of 25.54% in testing carried out by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Germany last September. 
Even more recently, SunDrive gave itself an early Christmas present with the successful fabrication of its first full-size solar panel. SunDrive’s innovative solution, achieved through hundreds of experiments in trial and error, amounts to a major technological shakeup of the solar industry’s Chinese cell manufacturing supremacy by finding a way to replace traditional and expensive silver in solar cells with the much more abundant and cheap copper. Copper is not as conductive as silver, nor as adhesive to the solar cell, but Allen’s solution rectifies this disparity as evidenced by its 25.54% world efficiency record.
Since the company was started in 2015, SunDrive has received AUD 2 million in grants from ARENA. It’s innovation like this, Miller continued, that ARENA aims to support.
“This AUD 40 million R&D funding round will support Australia’s solar researchers and industry to get behind the target of Solar 30 30 30 and drive innovation that will deliver ultra low cost solar … a vital component in helping Australia move towards a lower cost, largely renewable electricity system and achieve the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.” 
Part of the federal government’s ultra low-cost solar ambition is to drive the scaling up of production of low cost green hydrogen to achieve the LETS hydrogen goal of “H2 under $2”. Although the government remains technologically neutral when it comes to hydrogen, green hydrogen generated through solar electrolysis has the greatest potential for cost reductions. 
Expressions of interest for the Ultra Low Cost Solar R&D Funding Round are set to open in February 2022, with applications due on Monday, April 11, 2022.

Lighthouse bp’s 520 MWp Goulburn River Solar Farm with its 296 MWp battery energy storage system, proposed by for a site in Merriwa, approximately halfway between Newcastle and Dubbo, has progressed to the next stages of planning.
Last week, the Australian government posted the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) referral for the project, inviting the public to comment until January 18. Formal planning applications following on from the company’s now-complete preliminary assessments, site design and community consultation are expected to be lodged mid-year.
The Goulburn River Solar Farm proposal currently involves a 520 MW (DC) solar farm (peaking at 588 MW) and a 296 MW/588 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). Few details of the battery are included in the public referral, so the potential chemistry remains unclear, though the document does detail the system will be “housed in a series of outdoor containers”.
In total, the solar farm will include around 950,000 bifacial solar panels expected to generate 992,000 MWh of electricity annually, enough to supply approximately 4% of the state’s electricity demand, according to lightsource bp.
The Goulburn River Solar Farm is to be built on more than 1000 hectares of cleared freehold land previously used for grazing livestock. The site will be returned to this purpose once the solar panels, sitting about five meters above ground level, have been installed. This will see around 1000 sheep grazing on the property, “managing” the grass, weeds and plant life below the sprawling agrivoltaic project.
Lightsource bp expects construction to begin by mid-2023.
The company has already been in discussions with a number of state government authorities, as well as community stakeholders, holding a series of web events toward the end of last year. In the referral the company says it will continue to consult with residents and local community, holding in-person community sessions (hopefully) in March and April this year. “Following this engagement, we will conclude a range of detailed assessments, before undertaking the statutory pre submission consultation,” lightsource bp’s website reads.
Lightsource bp is seeking to significantly ramp up its global solar portfolio, taking it from 4 GW to 25 GW in the next four years. The company owns a number of projects in Australia, mostly in NSW. Those include the 400 MW (DC) Wellington North solar farm on which construction is soon to begin, the 200 MW (DC) Wellington solar farm which is currently in construction, the 107 MW (DC) West Wyalong solar farm also in construction, as well as the 840 MW (DC) Sandy Creek solar farm, though this project is, like Goulburn River Solar Farm, still in early planning stages. Lightsource bp is also currently constructing the 210 MW (DC) Woolooga solar farm in Queensland.

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects 46.1 GW of new utility-scale electric generating capacity to be added to the US power grid in 2022. Around 46% of that capacity will be solar, followed by natural gas and wind.
The information has been assembled by the EIA in a series of monthly and annual electric generator surveys, which ask developers to share their planned activation dates for projects in a five-year horizon.
Utility-scale solar Is projected to grow by 21.5 GW this year. The planned capacity marks significant growth from 15.5 GW of capacity additions in 2021. Scheduled additions for the last two months of 2021 hit 6.9 GW.
Texas is expected to lead all US states in utility-scale PV development this year, with 6.1 GW on the way, representing 28% of the national total. California is expected to add roughly 4 GW of generating capacity this year.
California’s development could speed up, as the California Public Utilities Commission has issued a mandate to connect an additional 11.5 GW of renewable energy to the grid by 2025. Community choice aggregators in the state are actively requesting proposals for projects containing solar and long-duration energy storage of eight hours or more.
The EIA expects a sharp, 84% increase in battery energy storage this year, with 5.1 GW of capacity expected to come online. Declining costs, co-deployment with renewable generation, and added value through regional transmission organization markets are driving growth in the technology, said the EIA.
