Enel North America announced it has identified Oklahoma as the leading candidate for its new solar cell and manufacturing facility. The facility, first announced in November 2022, will be operated through the company’s affiliate, 3Sun USA. 
Initial capacity of the major cell and panel factory is expected to be 3 GW, and Enel stated plans of doubling that capacity to 6 GW at the site. The facility is expected to bring millions of dollars of investment in the state and create more than 1,500 jobs, with production anticipated by late 2024.
“We are currently finalizing our evaluation of prospective sites for the facility, considering factors such as land availability, the presence of a skilled workforce, connections to transportation networks, and tax and incentive structures in making our siting decision,” a spokesperson for Enel told pv magazine.
The U.S. has become increasingly attractive to solar component manufacturers as the $370 billion Inflation Reduction Act is rich with manufacturing incentives, including tax credits for the production of solar cells and panels.
Enel currently holds a $3 billion portfolio of wind power assets in the state and an office in Oklahoma City. “We are excited about the possibility to expand our presence in the state,” Enel said.
The factory would join the Qcells 3.3 GW vertically integrated solar manufacturing site in Georgia as one of the largest U.S. solar manufacturing announcements to date.

“[Oklahoma is] on the one-yard line to land one of the largest economic development deals in our state’s history with Enel, a company that has been invested in our state for over a decade,” said Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt.
Enel said it is considering the Tulsa area for its new facility. 
This article was amended on 4/27/2023 to indicate that Oklahoma is the leading candidate, rather than the final choice.

Recom supplied 1,760 bifacial heterojunction modules for the project, with each module outputting 470 W. The array has a total capacity of 850 kW and generates 877 W per m. Sinn Power designed and provided the aluminum mounting structure for the project.
The aluminum structure can be used with conveyor belts up to 2.5 m high and is supported by concrete basements. Each mounting structure is 5.5 m long and can host up to 10 solar modules. It features a wind load of 27.5 m/s (99 km/h) (WLZ3) and a snow load of 2.06 kN/m2. The mounting structure can be attached to the existing conveyor belt structure via a clamping system.
Recom stated that the conveyor belt photovoltaic system is designed according to Eurocode 1DIN1991-1-3 and Eurocode DIN1991-1, and that the verification of the system's structural stability is performed by Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis.
According to the companies, this innovative solution maximizes profitability by directly feeding electricity to the conveyor belt where it is required, without any loss of performance. The aluminum structure is robust and can withstand environmental forces, while being easy to transport and install.

French solar developer Reden Solar has announced that it will invest €4 million ($4.4 million) to deploy a new solar module production line at its headquarters in Roquefort, France.
Reden plans to start manufacturing activities at a new line by the end of the year. It will have an annual capacity of 200 MW. The company currently operates a 65 MW line in Roquefort, which has been producing modules since its inception in 2009. According to Thierry Carcel, CEO of Reden, the old line will remain active for small panel series and after-sales service.
Carcel stated that producing their own panels brings several advantages, including ensuring independence and avoiding dependence on large manufacturers for small series of 30 or 40 MW. Reden's expertise in the downstream business is also an advantage for the solar module production itself, as it helps in designing profitability plans for their projects eligible for the French tenders for PV or projects linked to PPAs.
Although the new modules produced by the company may be up to 8% more expensive than their Asian counterparts, Carcel believes that customers are ready to pay more for “Made in France”, reduced carbon content, and excellent performance. He cited a recent power purchase agreement (PPA) that Reden secured from French railway operator SNCF, where the SNCF agreed to pay a little more for panels produced in France.
A consortium led by Australian financial group Macquarie Asset Management has agreed to acquire French solar developer Reden Solar from French infrastructure companies Infravia and Eurazeo.

The transaction will see Carrier acquire Viessmann's heat pump business, which is currently valued at $5 billion and expected to triple in size to $15 billion by 2027.
Carrier aims to establish itself as the leading residential and commercial heat pump manufacturer in North America and Europe through the acquisition. Carrier's Chairman and CEO, David Gitlin, said that “Viessmann Climate Solutions is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity with its premier brand, highly differentiated distribution channel, and innovative product offerings.” The deal is expected to close by the end of 2023.
Viessmann's Climate Solutions segment, which will be acquired by Carrier, consists of over 70% heat pumps and related accessories, as well as solar PV, energy storage, and associated services. Carrier expects that the combination of the two companies will create a business with a combined sales revenue of over $17 billion and approximately 45,000 employees.
Under the terms of the agreement, Carrier will acquire Viessmann Climate Solutions for €12 billion, with 80% in cash and 20% in Carrier common stock delivered to Viessmann Family Holdings. Carrier expects to fund the cash portion of the consideration through a combination of cash on hand and newly committed financing. Viessmann CEO Max Viessmann will also join Carrier's Board of Directors.
The companies agreed on long-term guarantees, with operational redundancies ruled out for the next three years. The Viessmann Group will also remain the owner of its traditional brand, and most of the proceeds from the transaction are to be reinvested in the company.
Germany's Federal Economics Minister Robert Habeck reacted to the announcement, stating that “the planned sale of Viessmann's division shows that climate protection technologies are the technologies of the future … It is important that the advantages of our energy policy and the profits that are generated from it continue to benefit Germany as a business location. We will pay attention to that.”

A grass fire broke out on April 24 at the Beryl Solar Farm in New South Wales, Australia, causing damage to the grass between the solar panels. Fire crews were able to bring the fire under control, but the cause of the blaze is currently under investigation.
The 87 MW (AC)/110 MW Beryl Solar Farm went into commercial operations in June 2019. It is wholly owned by Banpu Energy Australia, managed by RES, and operated by Novasource.
New South Wales Rural Fire Service crews were able to contain the fire. But in a Facebook post, it said the fact the fire was burning under solar panels, which made access more difficult for firefighters.
Ground conditions in central New South Wales have been affected by an extended period of wet weather. Together with recent high temperatures, this resulted in the extension of the bushfire season to April 30, 2023, a Beryl Solar Farm (BSF) spokesperson said.
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
“BSF continuously monitors and maintains vegetation levels in line with NSW Rural Fire Service guidelines to mitigate fire risk,” said the spokesperson. “This is the first incident of its kind at BSF and a thorough investigation is underway to investigate the root cause, while all the equipment remains isolated for safety reasons. All plant personnel are safe and accounted for, the site has been secured, and there were no injuries.”

The panels can be combined in small solar array configurations to increase power generation and shorten charging time. They are detachable and can be piled up together for easy displacement.
The panels can be used with a controller that includes a DC/DC converter module and USB-A and C ports. Users can purchase other controllers with various functions such as battery, wireless charging, Bluetooth, or charging status display. In outdoor environments, the solar panels can be assembled flat on their tin packaging box.
The manufacturer said four solar modules require about 5 hours of charging time to fully charge a smartphone, while nine panels are needed to fully charge a smartphone in around 2.5 hours. The modules measure 88 mm x 88 mm x 5 mm, weigh 50 g, and are built with interdigitated back-contact (IBC) solar cells provided by US manufacturer Maxeon.
Each panel has a power output of 1.2 W, an open-circuit voltage of up to 6.2 V, and a short-circuit current of up to 0.2 A. The controller measures 88 mm x 24 mm x 14 mm and has a weight of 30 g, while the tin packaging box has dimensions of 200 mm x 100 mm x 25 mm and weighs 150 grams.

SunPower has partnered with OhmConnect to provide its customers with the opportunity to join virtual power plant (VPP) programs.
Homeowners in select California markets who have the mySunPower app can participate and earn rewards for managing their electricity use, especially during times of peak demand on the grid, when utility bill rates are the highest. The service helps balance the electricity grid while offering solar and energy storage customers an opportunity to derive value from their system.
SunVault battery owners can manage their stored electricity with OhmConnect, which tracks prices and demand in real-time, helping customers reduce energy use during these peak times. The SunVault system is set to automatically dispatch power from the homeowner's battery during times of peak grid demand, while retaining a fixed amount of energy to meet their home's energy needs.
“With the rise of virtual power plants, it is much easier for residential customers to get rewarded for helping us make the grid more resilient. With our SunPower partnership, OhmConnect can expand the ecosystem of homes that leverage the energy they generate to help stabilize the increasingly vulnerable grid,” said Cisco Devries, the CEO of OhmConnect.
“The companies plan to expand to other markets this summer,” said Ellen Kinney, vice president of digital at SunPower. “VPPs are primed to go mainstream as battery storage becomes more accessible, energy prices continue to soar, and the grid is continuously overtaxed by fires, heatwaves, and even rain.”
OhmConnect is a no-cost service available to residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) utilities. California residents can enroll through the mySunPower app, available for download on Apple App Store or Google Play.
The US Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office (LPO) has focused on VPPs as the availability of debt financing for unfamiliar technologies has been a bottleneck for adoption. According to Jigar Shah, Director of the US Department of Energy Loan Programs Office,
“A VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) like PV, energy storage, EV chargers, and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances),” said Shah. “VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives.”
Recently, the LPO awarded a $3 billion conditional loan for Sunnova to provide loans to low- to moderate-income customers nationwide for VPP services.
“By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants,” Shah said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/26/solar-can-promote-biocrust-formation-in-deserts/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 26, 2023",Solar can promote biocrust formation in deserts,"From pv magazine USA
Soil is more than just dirt; it contains many nutrients and microorganisms that maintain the foundation of an ecosystem. In arid and semi-arid climes, soils have biocrusts, which are communities of living organisms that perform important functions in ecosystem management.
Cyanobacteria, green algae, fungi, lichens, and mosses form biocrusts, which create a thin layer on the surface of soils in deserts and other dry biomes. Drylands cover about 40% of the continental Earth.
Human activity, including agriculture, urbanization, and off-road vehicle use, degrades dryland biocrusts, harming these fragile environments. Biocrusts are also pressured by climate change, as increased heat makes it difficult for the microorganisms to survive.
Arizona State University (ASU) professor Ferran Garcia-Pichel and his research team propose using solar arrays as a solution to excess heat and light, creating a shaded nursery to promote biocrust growth. A report on the subject was published in Nature Sustainability.
Garcia-Pichel said that beneath the panels, biocrust development can be encouraged, and organic materials can be moved to areas where damage has occurred. The ASU team calls the practice “crustivoltaics.”
“This technology can be a game-changer for arid soil restoration,” said Garcia-Pichel. “Crustivoltaics represents a win-win approach for the conservation of arid lands and for the energy industry alike.”
The researchers performed a proof-of-concept experiment in the Sonoran Desert, studying biocrust growth for three years. During the study, the PV array promoted biocrust formation, doubling biocrust total biomass and tripling its coverage area compared to open areas with similar soil characteristics. Natural recovery of harvested biocrusts can take six to eight years to recuperate without intervention, but re-inoculated areas under the solar panels almost fully recovered within one year.
The study estimated that adding crustivoltaics to the three largest solar facilities in Maricopa County, Arizona, could aid the rejuvenation of all idle agricultural lands within the county, spanning more than 70,000 hectares. The research group said a small enterprise could accomplish this within five years.
Among the many ecosystem and agricultural benefits, the restoration project could significantly decrease airborne dust that impacts the Phoenix Metropolitan area. The practice could also benefit solar asset owner and operators by reducing soiling on panels and increasing the value of carbon mitigation credits generated by the site.
Garcia-Pichel is a Regents’ Professor in the School of Life Science and the founding director of the Biodesign Center for Fundamental & Applied Microbiomics. Biocrusts offer many ecosystem services, such as stabilizing soil by binding particles together, mitigating topsoil loss from wind and water, and increasing the soil’s water retention, reducing runoff, which can be a problem for some PV plants in arid climates.
Biocrusts also aid nutrient cycling by converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia for use by plants. They also perform photosynthetic activities, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They also contribute to overall ecosystem biodiversity and resilience.
While biocrust development can be done more rapidly in a greenhouse, the technique requires fewer resources, minimal management, and no upfront investment. The team modeled that the crustivoltaics method is less expensive by four orders of magnitude than conventional greenhouse methods.
The next step for Garcia-Pichel and his team is to implement the practice at regional scales through the coordination of scientists, collaborative agencies, land users, and managers.
“For the first time reaching regional scales at our fingertips, and we could not be more excited,” said Garcia-Pichel.

They shared their findings in “Comparison of PVT – heat pump systems with reference systems for the energy supply of a single-family house,” recently published in Solar Energy Advances.
The scientists compared six reference systems to two PVT-heat pump systems using seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) and carbon emissions as metrics.
The first PVT-heat pump system utilizes an uncovered PVT collector with fins on the rear side to increase energy from the sun and ambient air. This system outputs 340 W with an electric efficiency of 17.5%. Its open circuit voltage is 48.0 V, and it has a short circuit voltage of 9.45 A. The second PVT-heat pump system uses a standard uncovered PVT collector with a power output of 300 W, electric efficiency of 18.3%, open circuit voltage of 39.9 V, and a short circuit voltage of 9.77 A.
For the heat pump side, the simulated systems use either a brine-water heat pump with the PVT collector as the single heat source, or a borehole heat exchanger (BHE) as an additional source. The brine-to-water heat pump has a thermal capacity of 9.1 kW with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.13 at a source temperature of 0 C and an output water temperature of 35 C (B0/W35). Both systems feature a 560-liter buffer domestic hot water storage tank, and the simulated ground-source heat pump uses a 70-meter-deep BHE.
The reference systems are powered by PV panels or the grid and include air-source and ground-source heat pumps, as well as gas condensing boilers, standalone or paired with solar thermal collectors. The PV modules in the reference systems have similar performance data to the PVT collector with fins. The air-source heat pump has a thermal heating capacity of 7.4 kW with a COP of 3.5 at A2/W35. The depth of the BHE for the reference ground-source heat pump is 110 meters, and the gas boiler has a nominal heating power of 15 kW, a water capacity of 7.3 liters, and an efficiency of 96.59%. The solar thermal system has an area of 15 square meters.
The study demonstrates that using PVT with fins as the sole heat source for heat pumps yields a SCOP of 3.49 with 20 square meters of PVT collectors and 3.80 with 30 square meters. In contrast, standard PVT systems have 8% to 14% lower performance and require larger areas to achieve comparable results. The researchers note that combining PVT-heat pump systems with a 70-meter-deep BHE produces SCOPs above 4.0, regardless of the specific PVT collector technology.
By comparison, an air-source heat pump generates a SCOP of 3.29 when paired with a 20 square meter PV system and a SCOP of 3.82 with a 30 m2 PV installation. The academics assert that the direct comparison of PVT-heat pump systems with air-source heat pumps indicates that PVT-heat pump systems are a competitive alternative to these reference systems.
The ground-source heat pump, when paired with a 110-meter-deep BHE, delivers a SCOP of 4.24, which increases to 4.87 when combined with a 30 m2 PV system. Therefore, the researchers emphasize that the PVT combination with BHE opens up the possibility of reducing BHE length by around 35% without affecting system efficiency.
Finally, the study finds that using PVT as the sole source of heat pump systems can reduce carbon emissions by up to 57% compared to gas condensing boilers. Combining PVT with smaller BHE heat pump systems could cut carbon emissions by up to 63%. Air-source heat pumps combined with PV can reduce emissions by 52%, and ground-source heat pumps with a 110-meter BHE could lower emissions by 63%, compared to the reference gas boiler.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/26/tin-oxide-based-organic-solar-cell-hits-17-26-efficiency-79-fill-factor/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 26, 2023","Tin oxide-based organic solar cell hits 17.26% efficiency, 79% fill factor","A group of scientists at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands has fabricated an organic solar cell based on an electron transport layer (ETL) made of tin oxide (SnO2) that reportedly enables the device to achieve a remarkable fill factor of 79%.
Currently, organic solar cells are lagging behind their inorganic competitors as they achieve less current production, have higher open-circuit voltage losses, and feature a lower fill factor, which in these PV devices usually does not exceed 80%.
The researchers explained that SnO2 is a promising alternative to zinc oxide (ZnO) for ETLs used in organic PV, as its energy levels are suitable for an efficient collection of electrons. “When compared with ZnO, SnO2 offers higher electron mobilities and a superior transparency to the visible and UV light,” they stated, noting that ZnO, however, is more photoreactive than SnO2.
The Dutch group utilized atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit the SnO2 thin film, which it said avoids adjusting its surface via additional fabrication steps.
“Furthermore, compact layers can be deposited at relatively low temperature (below 100 C), with the possibility of fine-tuning both the electrical and optical properties of the material,” it further explained, adding that the deposition process shows a tradeoff between the transparency of the material, which is higher at lower temperatures, and the electrical conductivity, which is improved when the deposition temperature is raised.
The academics built the cell with a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), the ETL based on SnO2, an organic active layer, a molybdenum oxide (MoOx) layer, and an aluminum (Al) metal contact. The organic absorber was made of two different donor–acceptor blends acting as active layers. The first is composed of two polymers known as TPD-3F and IT-4F, and the other of two polymers known as PM6 and L8-BO.
The solar cell built with PM6 and L8-BO achieved the best performance among all tested devices by reaching a power conversion efficiency of 17.26%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.872 V, a short-circuit current of 25.55 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 79.0%. For comparison, a reference cell built with an ETL based on ZnO reached an efficiency of 16.03%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.878 V, a short-circuit current of 25.10 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 74.0%.
“Both these values are currently the highest values reported for OSCs with inverted structure and SnO2 as ETL,” the scientists said referring to the cell efficiency and fill factor, respectively.
They introduced the cell in the paper “Outstanding Fill Factor in Inverted Organic Solar Cells with SnO2 by Atomic Layer Deposition,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials.
“Our aim was to make organic solar cells more efficient and to use methods that are scalable,’ says Garcia Romero. The efficiency is close to the current record for organic solar cells, which stands around 19%,” the research team concluded.
