According to IRENA, Latvia only recorded 54 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2023, which is a sliver of Estonia’s solar gains (535 MW) and Lithuania’s (568 MW).
But Aboltins, a seasoned energy expert residing in the country’s capital, Riga, said that solar – alongside wind – could be a “king” of the country’s energy market. According to a European Parliament briefing document of Latvia, there is “untapped” potential for solar to power  “large-capacity” electricity generation in the Member State.
Aboltins said increasing investor confidence, which is already happening, is the key to achieving this success.
“The most most important thing is LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) and for solar PV and for onshore wind it has dropped so low that they have been absolutely competitive in comparison with such conventional technologies as natural gas,” he said. Aboltins estimated the country’s PV LCOE is €35/MWh ($38.06/MWh).
He said the renewable energy makeup of the country – which derives one-third of its energy from renewables – “could be better”. In 2021 Latvia's largest electricity producers were gas combined heat and power plants in Riga followed by the hydropower plants on the Daugava River, according to a research paper. The authors of the paper later described the deployment of wind and solar projects as “very low” up until 2022.
Latvia has fallen behind in the solar renewable race due to historical and “controversial” incentives and support schemes, Aboltins said. These have left a lasting impression on the sector. “There are real people, real names and real companies, real legal entities behind those processes, and also real legislators and decision-makers and politicians, whose names have been associated with these vested interests,” Aboltins said.
He said this isn't helped as there are currently no support schemes for renewable energy projects in the country.
But the former energy consultant believes that Latvian investors and businesses recently have turned their attention to solar energy “on a mass scale, industrial scale” due to the country's appetite for cheaper energy prices. These opportunities are amplified by the Latvian government’s renewable energy targets, set out in “Latvia's National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030”. Some of these goals include slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 65% by 2030 and sourcing half of its energy from renewables by the end of the decade.
In May, Latvian renewable energy developer PurpleGreen Energy P announced its plans to build a 400 MW solar power plant in Balvi, in the northern Latgale region near the Russian border. The news follows Danish energy company European Energy announcing it was currently developing a 155 MW solar power plant in Brocēni, located in the Saldus region in the country’s west.
Thorvald Spanggaard, Executive Vice President of European Energy, said the shortage of local energy production – especially renewable energy – means that the Latvian energy market holds some of the highest prices in the region. Spanggaard said that European Energy is currently considering power purchase agreements for the 155 MW solar power plant, but in general, Latvia needed “more experience” structuring PPAs and power trading risk hedging as it is currently not “that advanced.”
“Latvian power market regulations are undergoing some restructuring considering the expected power system synchronization with continental Europe,” he said. “Also, regulatory restructuring is required due to unexpectedly high demand for new renewable energy generation projects grid connection.”
Aboltins said there are some major solar PV projects in the pipeline for Latvia, and if all goes according to plan, the country should have over 200 MW installed capacity by 2025. But this hinges on whether the projects are finalized. “We'll see how many of those projects get connected to the grid, but I believe there's going to be quite significant interest and growing interest in the coming years,” he said.
“There's going to be this bright future ahead of us. It's a pity that it's not here already, but quite clearly, the Baltic States could be net positive rather than negative.”

Singapore-based PV manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies is suing its Chinese competitor Aiko Solar Energy, as well as wholesaler Memedo GmbH, for alleged patent infringement regarding a specific design related to the architecture of back contact solar cells.
According to a press release from Maxeon, Maxeon's subsidiaries filed the patent infringement lawsuit against Aiko Solar and its subsidiaries yesterday in Mannheim District Court, Germany.
Maxeon said in the press release that Aiko and Memodo have allegedly breached Maxeon's European Patent No. EP2297788B1. The patent relates to proprietary and fundamental solar cell architectures for back contact solar cells, also known as all-back contact (ABC) solar cells or interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells. Maxeon produces and sells modules with IBC solar cells.
“The lawsuit against Aiko and Memodo is necessary to protect our intellectual property, significant R&D and other investments, as well as our reputation and deep heritage and culture of innovation,” Maxeon's CEO Bill Mulligan said.
Maxeon's Chief Legal and Sustainability Officer, Lindsey Wiedman, said, “We believe that Aiko uses Maxeon's technology.”
Aiko Solar has rejected the allegations.
“AIKO’s ABC products are fundamentally different from the technology protected by the asserted patent, as has been confirmed by our intellectual property team and our European outside counsel, a renowned IP firm,” the company said in a statement sent to pv magazine.
“We intend to robustly defend our position with our partners while jointly and actively seeking a resolution to defend our legitimate rights and interests, retaining the right to pursue further proceedings.”
Aiko said it had 1061 patents – including 325 patents for ABC technology – as of Oct. 31, 2023.
In June, Maxeon filed a lawsuit against Tongwei for patent infringement of his Shingled-Hypercell technology.

Ultrasonic bonding has long been the method of choice for connecting photovoltaic cells, tabs, and busbars in arrays and modules. This technology produces high-quality connections and manufacturers haven’t met its limitations at current production volumes.
The approach, however, cannot keep up with higher production rates. Major electric-vehicle battery makers have already switched from ultrasonic bonding to laser welding to scale up production. As solar power is becoming increasingly important for sustainable energy solutions, PV module manufacturers also need to start thinking about solutions to scale up production in the near future.
Laser welding is a high-speed, non-contact process that uses the energy of a laser beam to create welds between surfaces. It can be used to optimize how solar cells, tabs, and busbars are interconnected in photovoltaic arrays and modules. Here are the reasons why laser welding is up to 10 times faster than ultrasonic bonding.
With ultrasonic bonding, a single weld is done within a few hundred milliseconds. Mechanical movements between each weld add time to the process. The bonding tool moves in the X, Y, and Z axes to position itself precisely above each target.
With laser welding, the laser system does not need to move for every single weld. Ultra-fast mirrors located in the laser head rotate as needed to precisely position the laser beam. This allows the laser to perform all welds within its field of view (typically 40 cm by 40 cm) from a single location. It only needs to be moved if there are cells beyond its field of view. Even in these cases, the part itself could be moved instead.
With all aspects considered, the average speed of ultrasonic bonding is about 500 milliseconds per weld. Laser welding cuts that time down to an average of 50 milliseconds per weld. This means that if you have 192 connections to make, in a 96-cell PV module, you can go from over a minute per module to just a few seconds. Ultrasonic bonding at 500 milliseconds per weld will take 96 seconds to make all the connections in a 96-cell module. Laser welding, at 50 milliseconds per weld, will require only 9.6 seconds.
Laser welding uses the power of light to melt and create a strong connection between materials. By focusing the laser beam on the welding area, it generates controlled heat that causes material to melt and form a bond.
When the laser beam hits the material surface, a portion of its energy is absorbed by the surface and the rest is reflected. A wide range of parameters can be optimized to control the welding process and adapt it to each application: the wavelength, spot size, intensity, and beam quality are just a few of the examples.
A clamping tool is needed to ensure there is no gap between the joined components. The surfaces to be welded can be clamped either by design or by an additional clamping tool to ensure good zero-gap welds. Global clamping with a fixture or a robotic clamping tip can be used to keep up with the laser welding speed. This precise control allows for consistent and high-quality welds in various materials and applications.
As clean energy becomes increasingly important to meet growing energy demand, the photovoltaic industry is approaching a critical point. The need for scalability will put pressure on production operations and cycle times. Laser welding technology offers a remarkable solution to meet this challenge head on, enabling faster and more cost-effective production and ultimately contributing to a greener and more sustainable world.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/16/spectral-splitting-concentrator-agrivoltaic-sytem-with-9-9-efficiency-promises-lcoe-of-0-033-kwh/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 16, 2023","Agrivoltaic system achieves 9.9% efficiency, LCOE of $0.033/kWh","Scientists led by the University of Science and Technology of China have developed a spectral-splitting concentrator agrivoltaic (SCAPV) system that can reportedly increase the crop productivity of multiple plant species.
The SCAPV system is based on the spectral separation of sunlight based on the difference in the spectral response of photovoltaics and photosynthesis. According to this principle, red and blue wavelengths are used for photosynthesis as they match the absorption peaks of plant chlorophyll, while all other wavelengths are used for concentrated power generation.
The research group described their findings in “Spectral-splitting concentrator agrivoltaics for higher hybrid solar energy conversion efficiency” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management. They highlighted the system's key components: multilayer polymer films (MPFs) enabling spectral separation, parabolic trough concentrators (PTCs), and crystalline silicon solar cells.
They used commercially available MPFs with high transmittance manufactured by US-based industrial conglomerate 3M. The PTCs are used as a substrate for the flexible MPFs and as reflectors to direct the reflected bands toward focal-point interdigitated back contact (IBC) PV cells, which were provided by US-based manufacturer Sunpower.
“Although multijunction III-V cells hold potential for higher efficiency, silicon cells are cost competitive for a scalable solution, and can maintain performance under high incident radiation within a concentration ratio of 3–100,” they further explained, noting that each PV module includes a front cover made of low-iron glass, a backsheet made of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and a back aluminum substrate.
The researchers said the PV cells and MPFs had a cost of $0.10/W and $0.02/W, respectively, while the hardware including the concentrators and the trackers cost $0.57/W.
The group tested the performance of the system through a prototype deployed in Fuyang, in China's Anhui province. This system occupies a surface of 422.4 square meters and relies on a dual-axis solar tracking system.
The system was found to have a PV efficiency of 9.9% and a hybrid light use efficiency of 9.05%, which the academics said is higher than the maximal theoretical photosynthetic efficiency of around 6%.
“The economic analysis shows that the LCOE of SCAPV is 0.033 $/kWh, indicating its economic feasibility,” they said, adding that the plants grown under partial sunlight showed the potential for increased biomass. “Although these tunable PVs are usually not cost competitive for now, agrivoltaics provide a niche market where they can provide advantages over conventional silicon photovoltaics and hence have the opportunity to be commercialized and improved.”
The research group unveiled its basic SCAPV system design in October. That system was tested in outdoor conditions in Anhui, and was found able to produce 107 MWh of electricity per hectare. Its overall system efficiency reached 11.6%, which the scientists said is the highest efficiency ever recorded for the spectral separation technology.

The new approach uses a multi-string PV system with a converter control strategy that utilizes a direct duty cycle to track the maximum power point (MPP) under shade.
“This study proposes a reconfiguration of the PV system to suppress the negative impact of partial shading on the PV-system performance by dividing the PV system into multiple parallel strings,” the scientists explained. “In this work, the proposed system comprises four strings, with each string comprising three paralleled sub-strings.”
The proposed multi-maximum power point tracking (MMPPT) approach involves connecting each string to a DC-DC converter, optimizing power extraction from individual strings of PV solar panels. This differs from the tested single-MPPT (SMPPT) arrangement in a PV system, where a single converter is connected to parallel strings of solar panels.
The MMPPT approach uses a direct duty‑cycle control strategy to find the duty cycles of desired converters. Then, using direct duty-cycle control (DDCC), it adapts the duty-cycle of the DC-DC converter to the calculated results, regulating the produced power.

Calculating the desired duty cycle involves using the PV system's existing sensors to estimate radiation, derived from changes in PV cell current and voltage.
“The proposed technique minimizes the overall system cost by reducing the number of the required sensors by utilizing a radiation estimation strategy,” the researchers said. “The DDCC technique boosts the overall system efficiency by the steady-state oscillations elimination, hardware simplification, and ease of implementation. Additionally, the DDCC has a fast-tracking speed for global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) extraction during partial shading conditions.”
The researchers presented the results of the comparison between the MMPPT and the SMPPT system in “Investigation of single and multiple MPPT structures of solar PV‑system under partial shading conditions considering direct duty‑cycle controller,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. The systems were simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK software, under three shade conditions.
All four PV strings were subjected to uniform irradiance of 1,000 W/m2 in the first shading pattern. In the second pattern, however, the first two strings had a constant irradiation profile of 1,000 W/m2, while the other two had a uniform irradiance profile of 1,000 W/m2 for half a second, and then stepped down to 500 W/m2 for another half a second.
In the third pattern, the first two strings were again under a uniform irradiance profile of 1,000 W/m2, while the remaining two started with 1000 W/m2 for 0.3 seconds, changed to 500 W/m2 for another 0.3 seconds and decreased to 250 w/m2 for 0.4 seconds.
“Under these conditions, the average efficiency of the SMPPT system is found to be 98.98%, while the MMPPT system achieves an efficiency of 99.81%. These findings validate the proposed approach,” the researchers concluded. “A real radiation dataset from Benban, a location in southern Egypt, is used in MMPPT configuration. The results demonstrate that the proposed control system enhances overall system effectiveness while reducing installation costs.”

Australian modular solar manufacturer 5B has announced that renewable energy industry veteran David Griffin has been appointed chief executive officer to lead the Sydney-headquartered clean technology company through the next phase of its development.
Griffin succeeds current 5B CEO and co-founder Chris McGrath, who will assume a new role developing strategic partnerships and new market opportunities.
“There is no better person than David to lead 5B through this time of transformation,” McGrath said. “He is a veteran of the renewable energy industry in Australia and around the world, with in-depth working knowledge of the complexity of the clean energy transition. David is the right leader at the right time for 5B.”
Griffin, who has been a member of 5B’s board since early in the company’s journey and became a seed investor in 2015, will oversee the next stage of the company’s development which is expected to include an increased focus on meeting high demand in the Australian market.
Griffin said the opportunity ahead is vast for 5B which has developed its prefabricated and modular Maverick solar system, which allows pre-mounted solar panels to be installed quickly.
“We will concentrate on profitable segments in our home market and abroad, where our customers have a deep understanding of the unique benefits of 5B’s Maverick technology and related services, and servicing our strategic partners,” he said. “5B is truly revolutionising the renewable energy sector with its 5B Maverick prefabricated solar array technology and I couldn’t be more honoured to have been chosen to lead the company.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/16/residential-photovoltaics-for-urban-loads-as-an-antidote-to-pv-curtailment/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 16, 2023",Residential PV for urban loads as an antidote to solar curtailment,"A group of researchers at the Netherlands' Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) has proposed the use of power generated by residential PV systems for traction substations and nearby residential loads, in an effort to reduce curtailment.
Residential PV curtailment is on the rise in the Netherlands, due to increasing grid capacity issues, as recently reported by Dutch power and gas supplier Liander. The company said there was an increase in curtailment events from 1,074 in the first half of 2022 to 3,476 in the same period this year, with Gelderland and Noord-Holland being the most affected regions. Liander said it also expects curtailment to rise further as more PV systems are installed, particularly with the phase-out of the net-metering scheme in 2025.
The scientists said the integration of PV systems in urban traction grids such as trams or trolleybuses poses a series of challenges. One major issue is represented by the fact that these loads are stochastic and unpredictable due to the movement of the vehicle. Then, when a vehicle moves from one substation to another, the load disappears abruptly from the first substation.
“Traction grids are particular grids with no base loads and with high, unpredictable power peaks caused by vehicle acceleration,” they explained.
In residential loads, by contrast, a base load is present, although there are no load peaks during peak PV power generation periods.
“Therefore, there is an expected synergy in coupling traction substations and nearby residential loads in increasing the overall matching between load and generation,” the academics stated. “Furthermore, rooftop PV systems can offer physical installation space otherwise, which is otherwise scarcely available in urban environments for the transport grids.”
In the proposed system configuration, traction substations and nearby households form a single load entity via the low-voltage AC grid. The residential PV systems of a given area supply first the closest residential loads and then send surplus power through the low-voltage connection to the nearby traction loads.
Through a series of simulations, the research group found that the system has a positive effect on both low and high-traffic substations when sharing a PV system with any number of households.
“This means that a shared, multi-stakeholder system offers less of a need for storage, curtailment, and grid exchange, as well as a net benefit in the direct load coverage per installed capacity,” the researchers said. “This meant that the return on the investment in a share of a combined system brings more load coverage than having installed a dedicated PV system to one stakeholder of the size of that share.”
Looking forward, the scientists said they have to identify an optimal sizing method to the number of connected households and PV system size at a traction substation. They presented their findings in “A shared PV system for transportation and residential loads to reduce curtailment and the need for storage systems,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
In 2019, UK-based climate change charity 10:10 developed a demonstrator solar array in partnership with Community Energy South and national rail infrastructure operator Network Rail. According to its developers, a solar plant can theoretically be connected to any traction substation and supply from five to 10 km of the track in either direction.
In March 2022, the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) unveiled a plan to deploy photovoltaic power solutions for the Gautrain system – an 80 km rail system in Gauteng linking Johannesburg, Pretoria, Ekurhuleni, and the O.R. Tambo International Airport.
In related solar train news, the Swiss South Eastern Railway AG (SOB) commissioned a feasibility study from Swiss CMT AG a few years ago, with the aim of reducing its energy requirements and operating costs. It found that solar PV is “well-suited” for installation on the roofs of train stations, halls, and the soundproofed walls along railway lines.
Another recent study by Indian NGO Climate Trends and UK green-tech startup Riding Sunbeams suggested self-generated solar power would be an optimal way of helping Indian Railways meet its 2030 net-zero target, given the rapid cut in carbon emissions and cost advantages it would offer.

The power conversion efficiency target is 25% in commercial production, which would take CIGS a step beyond the record efficiency for CIGS research cells, which is 23.6%, held by Evolar, a Swedish company that was recently acquired by First Solar.
The project prototypes aim to showcase higher CIGS efficiency, scale up from lab-sized bifacial devices to mini-modules, reduce raw material consumption, establish shorter manufacturing processes, and enhance module technologies.
The “High efficiency bifacial thin film chalcogenide solar cells” (Hi-BITS) initiative is a collaboration of eight research institutes and universities, plus six companies. The research institutes include International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL), Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA), Sweden’s Uppsala University, Germany’s Zentrum für Sonnenenergie- und Wasserstoff-Forschung (ZSW) and Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. Other participants include France’s Centre national de la recherche scientifique and Institut Photovoltaïque d'Ile-de-France (IPVF),  the University of Luxembourg, and Spain’s Catalonia Institue for Energy Research (IREC).
The group of six companies includes Avancis, based in Germany, which recently achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.3% in a completely encapsulated CIGS module with an integrated series connection measuring 30 cm × 30 cm, and Midsummer, based in Sweden, which is currently operating a CIGS module factory in southern Italy. Other members are Sunplugged, based in Austria, along with French building materials supplier Saint-Gobain, Berlin-based GreenDelta GmbH and Poland’s Roltec, which is a module manufacturer.
The November edition of pv magazine is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
“We will develop prototype modules for the listed application cases,” Sascha Sadewasser, principal investigator for the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory, told pv magazine. “[The] core work is on bifacial aspects and how to exploit them in highly relevant applications”.
Other aspects of the project include life cycle analysis and costing, as well as establishing practices in line with circular economy concepts.
