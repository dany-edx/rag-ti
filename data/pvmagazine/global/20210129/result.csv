This is the main conclusion of a recent report published by Dutch electricity transmission system operator (TSO) Tennet, in which its experts analyzed how the use of heat pumps and smarter heat networks may contribute to the creation of more flexible electricity demand, which would, in turn, have the twofold advantage of reducing fossil fuel consumption and not wasting surplus renewable energy generation during peak hours.
The Dutch high-voltage grid operator said that in hours with poor renewable energy production, part of the heating systems could be idled temporarily, and in hours with a lot of electricity from the sun and wind, the heat systems could be powered by these two sources to provide extra heating. “In 2030, this concept could already provide between 0.5 and 1 GW of temporary flexibility and, in order to achieve this, the heat pumps must be intelligently controlled,” Tennet explained.
The flexible demand created by this approach would help to level off peak loads during strong generation of wind and solar if the capacity of the electricity grid is in danger of being exceeded. “This flexibility is needed to make maximum use of variable solar and wind generation in hours of abundance, and to reduce electricity demand in hours without solar and wind electricity,” the authors of the report affirmed.
Flexible heat pumps would be key in this scenario as they can switch back temporarily, while a well-insulated building can remain sufficiently heated for a certain time. Furthermore, hybrid heat pumps that can be powered by both gas and renewables would also represent an optimal solution, as they can temporarily rely on the fuel in the event of electricity shortages. “This reduces the peak demand for electricity and keeps homes warm,” the report notes, adding that on days with abundant solar and wind power production, heating systems with heat storage may also save some sustainable heat to power the building the following day.
According to Tennet experts, this flexible electricity demand for heat would not only contribute to CO2 reduction by using the electricity as much as possible in hours with abundant wind and sun but also by utilizing it as little as possible in the hours with largely gas-fired electricity. “This helps to keep consumers' energy bills from being higher than necessary in the future,” they further explained. “This advantage can be achieved through a contract with flexible prices with the supplier or a discount when flexibility is made available.”
The report states that these benefits will be negligible in the near future, although they may become bigger by 2030 and will continue to grow when more and more electricity from solar and wind is produced.
Tennet and Viessmann, a German manufacturer of heating, industrial and refrigeration systems, are currently working on a joint pilot project to use the potential flexibility of heat pumps for congestion management in power grids. The ViFlex project is aimed at combining a three-digit number of heat pumps and electricity storage systems to form a virtual power plant. With this approach, the heat pumps are bundled in virtual power plants to absorb surplus electricity from renewables and relieve the power grid.
The project relies on Viessmann heat pumps that can be operated with 100 percent renewable electricity. “These heat pumps can work and fill the heat storage system when a lot of solar power comes from the roof or the wind is blowing strongly in Germany and there is a lot of wind power available in the grid,” Tennet explained.

Under the terms of the agreement, Risen and some of its subsidiaries will purchase around 34 GW (234 million square metres) of PV glass from FGG from 2021 to 2023 based on a monthly bargaining price. The estimated value of the supply contract is around RMB 8.9 billion (US$1.39 billion).
Taiwanese market research company PV InfoLink published the top five solar cell manufacturer ranking for 2020. Tongwei was the largest cell maker last year, followed by Aikosolar, Runergy, Shanxi Lu'an, and Jiangsu Zhongyu (Solarspace). Total annual solar cell shipments of these five providers for last year totaled 55 GW, which is 60% more than in 2019 and shows that concentration in the sector is increasing.
Solar panel producer Trina Solar said on Tuesday it expects its net profit for 2020 to increase by between 87% and 107% compared to a year earlier. The main reasons for this positive performance, the company stated, are the overall growth of the PV market, the company's long-term global brand strategy, leading innovation capabilities and product advantages, and global sales and service advantages.
Shanghai-listed leading inverter manufacturer Goodwe forecasts its net profit will increase by between 123% to 168% year-on-year compared to 2019. Goodwe explained that the main reason for the change in performance was good PV industry development during the reporting period, its continuous R&D investment and technological innovation, which resulted in continually expanding domestic and overseas markets.
State-owned manufacturer Luoyang Glass yesterday announced it expects demand for solar glass to have driven up its 2020 net profit to between RMB 246 and RMB 286 million (US$38 and US$44.2 million) from the RMB 54 million recorded in 2019.
Polysilicon maker Daqo New Energy has estimated the Xinjiang Daqo New Energy business, which constitutes the lion’s share of its operations and which it plans to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, will bank a net profit of RMB 950 million to RMB 1.05 billion (US$147 to US$162 million) from last year. The figure, based on audited nine-month returns plus a fourth-quarter estimate, was supplied as part of the application for a Shanghai listing by Xinjiang Daqo. The business is expecting revenue of between RMB 4.5 and 4.7 billion for the year, Daqo said yesterday, with estimated production volumes of 20,500 to 21,000 metric tons (MT) contributing to a full-year figure of between 76,700 and 77,200 MT. Daqo expects fourth-quarter sales of 23,000-23,200 MT of polysilicon for a full-year return of 74,700 to 74,900 MT.
Shareholders in PV project developer Xinyi Energy will vote on February 11 on whether to acquire 520 MW more generation capacity from the Xinyi Solar holding company that it is being spun out of. Having acquired 230 MW of Chinese projects installed by PV glassmaker Xinyi Solar in September, Xinyi Energy is set to acquire additional capacity for around RMB 512 million (US$79.59 million).
Solar manufacturer Solargiga yesterday completed a 180-million-share issuance, albeit at a hefty 50.8% discount on Wednesday’s closing share price as the stock was placed at HK$0.29 (US$0.04) per share. The new shares constitute 5.42% of the enlarged company.
NYSE-listed Renesola also completed a placement of 10 million American depositary shares at US$25 per ADS to raise US$250 million for the expansion of its solar and energy storage portfolio and funding possible acquisitions. Each ADS comprised 10 ordinary shares in the business

Isigenere, a Spanish engineering company and provider of floating PV structures, and PV system integrator MarEtec have recently completed the installation of a new floating solar plant for Limagrain Nederland BV, a Dutch seed supplier for agricultural industries.
The floating array, which has a capacity of 338 kW, is located in two adjacent ponds, one for irrigation and the other a water reservoir against fires, in the municipality of Rilland in the province of Zeeland. Isigenere installed 1,692 floating structures for Isifloating 4.0, which the company says is specially designed to optimize energy generation in all types of water bodies. Furthermore, 846 solar panels with a power output of 400 Wp were deployed. 
An Isigenere spokesperson told pv magazine that the installation relies on a special system of anchors and moorings that allows the vertical fluctuation of the structure, but maintains the PV system stable in the horizontal plane, thus avoiding collision with the pond's sides.
This floating solar plant will also help reduce water evaporation and algal blooms that are very relevant to the activities of Limagrain Netherlands. Thanks to this plant and those already existing on the roofs of its buildings, Limagrain is capable of self-generating 30% of the energy it consumes annually.
Isigenere claims the current version of the Isifloating 4.0 system is the longest lasting, safest, easy to transport, simple to install, weather proof and the lowest O&M system on the market.

The researchers used MXenes, which is a new family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides. These compounds, which take their name from their graphene-like morphology, are made via selective etching of certain atomic layers from a bulk crystal known as MAX.
“The addition of a small amount of titanium carbide-based MXenes to light-absorbing perovskite layers improves the electronic transport process and optimizes the performance of the solar cell,” the researchers said.
The scientists applied the technique to a perovskite cell with an inverted configuration (p–i–n), based on a nickel(II) oxide (NiO) hole transporting layer. The reference cell initially had a power conversion efficiency of around 17%.
The addition of MXenes as a doping agent allowed the scientists to tune the energy level alignment at the interfaces between the perovskite layer and the charge transporting layer. At the same time, this helped to passivate trap states within the cell structure, resulting in improved charge extraction and collection at the electrodes.
“We demonstrate a useful role of MXenes doping both for the photoactive layer (perovskite) and for the electron transport layer (fullerenes) in the structure of solar cells based on nickel oxide,” said researcher Anastasia Yakusheva. “On the one hand, the addition of MXenes helps to align the energy levels at the perovskite/fullerene interface, and, on the other hand, it helps to control the concentration of defects in the thin-film device, and improves the collection of photocurrent.”
The cell doped with the compound showed an improved efficiency of 19.2%, the Russian-Italian group said.  They described the doping technique in “Transition metal carbides (MXenes) for efficient NiO-based inverted perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Nano Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/29/solar-powered-hydrogen-for-masdar-city/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 29, 2021",Solar-powered hydrogen for Masdar City,"Masdar is developing a pilot green hydrogen project with the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy, Etihad Airways, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Siemens Energy, Marubeni, and the Lufthansa Group.
The solar-powered electrolyzer will be built in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, with the aim of producing green hydrogen and sustainable fuels for road transport, aviation and shipping. Masdar City is currently under construction in Abu Dhabi and is expected to become one of the world's most sustainable urban communities.
“Masdar has been actively evaluating opportunities to develop green hydrogen projects over the past year and now we have decided to take our first step, in a phase in which the market is not developed yet,” Faye Al Hersh, Technology Specialist at Strategy, Masdar, told pv magazine. “The demonstrator will be in the megawatt range and should be operational within two or three years.”

The first phase of the demonstration project will focus on the production of green hydrogen for passenger cars and buses in the Masdar City area. The companies will also build a kerosene synthesis plant to convert green hydrogen into sustainable aviation fuel. In the second phase, they will explore the production of decarbonized fuels for the maritime sector.
Masdar aims to create initial domestic demand for hydrogen and build a local green hydrogen economy.
“We would also like to create a green hydrogen knowledge base in Abu Dhabi with links and partnerships to international hydrogen programs, enable off-takers to significantly reduce their carbon footprint, and ultimately position Abu Dhabi to become a key player in the hydrogen economy” Al Hersh said. “The UAE has the relevant domestic off-takers and is a politically stable, reliable partner to many offtake countries and companies around the world, allowing it to potentially export sustainable fuels. It is also geographically located at the mid-point of trade routes that serve major clean energy offtake markets.”
The demonstration project represents the first concrete step under a strategic partnership between Mubadala Investment, the sole shareholder of Masdar, and Siemens Energy. They plan to jointly accelerate green hydrogen capabilities in Abu Dhabi.
The ultimate goal is to scale up clean hydrogen production, including green hydrogen production via large-scale solar plants, in order to accelerate the adoption and use of hydrogen in major sectors in the United Arab Emirates, while positioning Abu Dhabi as a reliable global supplier of hydrogen.
“Currently it is difficult to provide a precise timeframe,” Al Hersh said. “But I believe it will happen very soon.”
Projects planned for the desert offer considerable advantages over other locations. In the desert, there is plentiful sunshine, no clouds, and lots of available space, which means solar parks can be easily and cheaply built.
“We would like to capitalize on this advantage,” Alexander Ritschel, Masdar's head of technology, told pv magazine.

Ritschel said that economies of scale will play a crucial role in future green hydrogen production, regardless of the location.
“The question is how quickly can we ramp up the roll-out of some renewable energy-powered hydrogen plants,” he said. “And this will depend on how we will respond to a market demand which right now is mainly driven by policies.”
Several governments throughout the world are already introducing incentives and obligations for hydrogen consumption.
“I think that there is no doubt that there is a willingness to pay an additional premium for a fuel that comes without CO2 emissions,” Ritschel said.
Price reductions for green energy technologies and the creation of industrial demand will have to be achieved simultaneously.
“We can't put all the burden on the technology development, improving electrolysis or PV power generation will not be sufficient alone,” Ritschel said. “We need to have policies that stimulate demand and future investments will result in improved system efficiency and lower prices.”
Masdar is evaluating different hydrogen generation technologies, as the costs of different approaches are falling as system performance continues to improve.
“We are tying ourselves with no particular technology at the moment, which corresponds to Masdar's overall approach consisting of selecting the most suitable option depending on the characteristics of each specific project,” Ritschel said. “Currently you can produce viable green hydrogen in only a few  locations in the world, and the Emirates is one of them.”
Masdar will focus on domestic hydrogen projects over the next few years, after which it may consider expanding its activities in overseas markets.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/29/solar-for-self-consumption-keeps-growing-in-spain/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,EUROPE,SPAIN,WESTERN EUROPE",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JANUARY 29, 2021",Solar for self-consumption keeps growing in Spain,"From pv magazine Spain
According to new statistics released by Spanish photovoltaic association UNEF, about 596 MW of new PV systems for self-consumption were deployed in Spain last year. This figure represents an increase of 30% compared to 2019, when 459 MW was installed.
Of this 596 MW, around 2% corresponds to self-consumption facilities that are not connected to the grid. Regarding the distribution by sectors, most of this new power, 56%, has been installed in the industrial sector, 23% in the commercial sector and 19% in the residential segment, which is where self-consumption has experienced unprecedented growth. In 2019, residential self-consumption accounted for 10%.
These figures also show that, despite being a very complicated year in which the Covid pandemic resulted in a large decrease in energy demand in general terms, families have been able to opt for this cheaper and cleaner form of energy. On the one hand, those who have not lost their jobs or were not affected by Spain's temporary unemployment scheme (ERTE) have been able to save and think about how to invest their money. In fact, the savings rate of families has gone from 8% to more than 31%, according to statistics from the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
Incentives being granted at national and regional level, as well as the elimination of administrative barriers combined with strong outreach campaigns by solar companies are two factors contributing to last year's growth. “In the case of single-family homes in a sunny area, an installation without batteries is an investment that can be recovered in nine or 10 years,” explained José Donoso, general eirector of UNEF. “In addition, there are deductions in the  Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles (IBI), which is a tax that applies to both residents and non-residents, and the banks prefer to put their money on the roof of the house.”
One of UNEF's priorities is administrative simplification for self-consumption projects. “This year there are already eight Autonomous Communities that have eliminated the building license for rooftop installations and we hope that others will join very soon,” Donoso said. 
He also emphasized that the industrial sector stabilized its growth trajectory, reaching 56% of the photovoltaic megawatts installed in 2020, compared to 70% in 2019, while the commercial segment saw its share decrease from 30% in 2019 to 23% last year. The particular development of self-consumption facilities in these sectors has depended on how they have been affected in each case by the health crisis.

Telsa is intensifying its focus on solar, CEO Elon Musk said during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call on Jan. 27.
“There were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building … But now we [have] a little more bandwidth. We’re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly. So, I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar,” Musk said.
For Tesla, industry-leading pricing is central to its solar strategy. “[Getting the cost structure where it needs to be] is something that we’ve accomplished over the last year,” said CFO Zach Kirkhorn, without providing specifics.
Achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall, the Tesla Retrofit Solar, and the Tesla Roof is also an integral part of Telsa’s solar plans, Musk said. He added that the company is focused on reducing the amount of time and the “complexity of the install, and we’re making great progress in that regard.”
Improvements to Tesla’s solar retrofit strategy – including simplification, cost reduction, and improved pricing – drove an 18% increase that lifted solar deployments to 205 MW in 2020. Even though Tesla missed analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates, the company reported that total year-on-year quarterly revenue rose 46% to $10.74 billion, largely driven by growth in vehicle deliveries.
During the fourth quarter, Tesla said that storage and solar deployments came in at 1.584 MWh and 86 MW, respectively. On a year-on-year basis, storage deployment ballooned by 199%. Solar deployment increased by 59% compared with 2019.
On the storage side, 2020 was the first year in which total battery deployments surpassed 3 GWh in a single year, Tesla said. That was  an 83% increase against 2019. The company attributed much of this growth to the popularity of its utility-scale storage product, Megapack.

Plans continue to gather steam to develop a 10 GW solar farm and a 30 GW storage facility near Tennant Creek, in Australia's Northern Territory, in order to export solar power to Singapore via a submarine transmission link. On Thursday, the Northern Territory government and Sun Cable signed a project development agreement (PDA).
The Northern Territory government said the PDA provides a roadmap that will allow it to work in partnership with Sun Cable to finalize land tenure and commercial arrangements for the AAPL, ahead of the project’s financial close. Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the PDA is a big step forward.
“This project will put the (Northern Territory) on the international map when it comes to renewables,” he said. “This project will transform the territory into a renewable energy powerhouse.”
The solar farm and battery storage facility will be built across 12,000 hectares at Powell Creek station, about 70 km southwest of Elliott, in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region. As well as the region’s climatic advantages, the facility will capitalize on close access to road and rail infrastructure.
Once operational, power from what will be Australia’s largest renewable energy infrastructure project will be exported via a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission link connecting the precinct to the Darwin-Katherine Interconnected System (DKIS). Power will then be transported via a 3,800-km HVDC submarine cable to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
“Through the Australia-ASEAN Power Link, Sun Cable seeks to generate and transmit dispatchable, competitively-priced, renewable energy at scale,” Sun Cable Managing Director David Griffin said. “This will provide affordable, reliable energy to support industrial growth in Darwin, as well as supplying up to 20% of Singapore’s electricity needs.”
Economic boost
It is estimated the project will inject up to AUD 8 billion ($6.1 billion) into the regional economy, with about 1,500 jobs to be created during construction and 350 ongoing positions once operations begin. The AAPL will export AUD 1 billion worth of solar electricity per year upon completion.
Northern Territory Minister for Renewables and Energy Eva Lawler said that the AAPL is a major success story for the territory.
“This agreement shows strong confidence for investing in the Northern Territory and investing in renewable energy, which is not only good for the environment, but good for the economy,” she said. “Locals can look forward to affordable energy that’s reliable and renewable by the end of the decade. We look forward to the next steps of this exciting project.”
Sun Cable has said construction for the project will begin immediately after financial close in October 2023, with commercial operations to commence in 2027. It has confirmed that Sydney-based solar module manufacturer 5B will supply prefabricated, redeployable modules for the project.
