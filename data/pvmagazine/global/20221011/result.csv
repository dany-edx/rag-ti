General Motors isn’t just focused on car manufacturing, as the company has announced that its new GM Energy unit will offer energy storage and management services to the residential and commercial markets.
GM Energy plans to bundle the existing Ultium Charge 360 public charging service with two new units, Ultium Home and Ultium Commercial, which will offer stationary storage batteries, as well as solar panels and hydrogen fuel cells. GM Energy reports that several large-scale companies across the United States have already agreed to work with GM Energy to provide energy solutions to customers and receive product or service offerings.
“The reliability of the US electrical power grid has never been more important,” said Travis Hester, vice president of GM EV growth operations. “GM Energy has the opportunity to help deliver sustainable energy products and services that can help mitigate the effect of power outages and provide customers with resilient and cost-effective energy management.”
GM Energy has announced an agreement with SunPower to provide solar panels to its customers, thus becoming a one-stop green energy shop. SunPower will be a preferred installer for the home energy system and offer customers the opportunity to add solar to their home. The Ultium Home service will offer stationary wall boxes, going head to head with Tesla’s Powerwalls, and its release will be timed with the retail release of the Silverado EV.
The new EV truck will have bi-directional charging like the Ford F-150 Lightning, which means it will be able to feed electricity back into the home during a power outage. The F-150 was announced in February of this year. Its Intelligent Backup Power and the Home Integration Systems were developed in collaboration with Sunrun, enabling the F-150 Lightning’s battery to automatically kicks in to power the home if the grid goes down.
“GM Energy’s mission is to offer customers access to a full suite of energy products and services, including solutions beyond the vehicle, accelerating the seamless transition to an all-electric future,” said Hester. “With the expansion of our enterprise business through GM Energy and one of the most comprehensive portfolios of energy management products and services available, we will help to reduce the barriers of entry for sustainable power and further accelerate the mass adoption of EVs.”
As part of GM Energy, Ultium Charge 360 will continue to expand its existing portfolio of integrated public charging networks, integrated mobile apps, and additional product and service offerings over time.
“The massive scale of GM Energy’s solutions will allow us to better address current challenges with grid infrastructure, energy storage and energy management head on,” says Mark Bole, vice president and head of V2X Battery Solutions at GM. “By leveraging GM’s flexible technology platforms and the power of Ultium, we’re able to provide resilient and accessible energy solutions for all customers and the grid, helping to further advance the all-electric future.”
GM’s commercial service will offer larger stationary storage units, similar to Tesla’s Megapack, which was announced in 2019. And GM is also developing hydrogen fuel cell technology.
And the final piece is the Energy Services Cloud, which is a hub that manages energy for residential, commercial and EV fleet owners. The central interface will house data and energy management tools, so that customers will be able to manage their energy consumption through GM’s energy software applications. GM has already enrolled EV customers in managed charging programs through the Energy Services Cloud, with multiple utilities across four U.S. states and growing.
GM Energy has launched a V2H pilot project between GM Energy and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), similar to the Tesla virtual power plant in Texas and California markets. The GM Energy project will enable residential customers to use their compatible EVs along with a bi-directional charger, as backup power for essential home needs during short-term power outages.
After initial lab tests, the two companies anticipate expanding the V2H offer to a subset of residential customers within PG&E’s service area, expected to begin in 2023. GM Energy is also working with other companies such as Con Edison, Graniterock and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative to help deliver energy solutions to customers, while also helping to inform and advance future GM Energy offerings.

Hy24, which aims to mobilize up to €20 billion of investment capacity over the next six years, is a joint venture between FiveT Hydrogen and Ardian. The Paris-based's launch last year was supported by Air Liquide, VINCI Concessions, TotalEnergies, Plug Power, Chart Industries, and Baker Hughes. It has since attracted more than 50 investors from 13 countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. It is now deploying capital at projects in Germany and Spain. 
Toshiba has developed large-scale production technology that deposits an iridium oxide nanosheet laminated catalyst over a maximum area of 5 square meters at one time. It said the catalyst, developed in 2017, has “reduced the iridium requirement to 1/10 in 2017.” It is aiming for commercialization by the 2023 Japanese fiscal year or thereafter. The company is betting on PEM electrolysis with a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) that integrates the electrolyte membrane and electrode. “Toshiba's multilayer catalyst uses a new sputtering technology to deposit alternate layers of iridium oxide nanosheet films and void layers,” said the Tokyo-based group. “In sputtering, ions, such as argon, bombard a deposition material, the target, in a vacuum, and deposit the ejected particles on a substrate. In Toshiba's process, iridium is the target, and a thin film of iridium oxide is formed by injecting oxygen as the target is deposited on the substrate.”
UCLA researchers have developed a way to predict the potency and stability platinum alloys, to determine how they will perform as catalysts in hydrogen fuel cells. “Based on the binary experimental descriptor, we further designed an oxygen reduction reaction catalyst wherein high activity and stability are simultaneously achieved,” the team said in a recent report in Nature Catalysis. They created catalysts by combining platinum, nickel, and cobalt. They said that the study defines an approach based on a combination of experiments, complex computations, and X-ray spectroscopy, to “identify the right catalysts much faster.”
Hyundai Heavy Industries has launched a demonstration project to apply fuel cells to large vessels in cooperation with Shell, Doosan Fuel Cell, HyAxiom, and DNV. It will use a 600 kW high-efficiency Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) for power generation on a 174,000 cubic-meter LNG carrier to be run by Shell from 2025. The LNG carrier will use fuel cells as an auxiliary power unit (APU) and perform a demonstration for one year on an actual trade route. The group will build the ship, design and install SOFC placements, and integrate the ship system.
Air Products has announced plans to invest approximately $500 million to build, own and operate a facility to produce 35 metric tons per day of green liquid hydrogen at a greenfield site in Massena, New York. The plans also includes liquid hydrogen distribution and dispensing operations. The commercial operation of the facility is set to begin in the 2026-27 period. Air Products is also investigating the feasibility of establishing a hydrogen fueling station network in the northeastern United States.
Atura Power has selected Cummins to design and manufacture an electrolyzer system for its Niagara Hydrogen Centre in Niagara Falls, Canada. It will be the first 20 MW green hydrogen facility in the province of Ontario, said the US company, noting that it will manufacture the proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis system at its facility in Mississauga.
Gaussin and Lhyfe have signed a memorandum of understanding to accelerate the development of hydrogen mobility at ports, airports, and logistics sites. They said they will study the possibility of developing a comprehensive renewable mobility solution by combining Gaussin's hydrogen vehicles and Lhyfe's renewable hydrogen.
Cepsa and the Port of Rotterdam have signed an agreement to establish the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe. “Cepsa plans to export hydrogen produced at its San Roque Energy Park near the Bay of Algeciras, through hydrogen carriers such as ammonia or methanol, to the Port of Rotterdam,” said the Spanish energy group. It is targeting 2 GW of production capacity in Spain and Portugal by 2030.
Symbio, a Faurecia and Michelin venture, said it will invest €1 billion over seven years in France through its HyMotive project. “In its first phase, Hymotive will accelerate the industrialization and mass-production of its current-generation fuel cell systems in its gigafactory under construction in Saint-Fons,” said the joint venture. 
Wintershall Dea said it will invest in technology to store and transport hydrogen developed by German startup Ambartec. “The HyCS technology is based on a process of loading and unloading hydrogen into a storage unit containing iron. The loading process involves reducing the iron by introducing hydrogen, which releases steam,” said the German gas and oil producer. “To unload the hydrogen, steam is reintroduced into the storage unit, which oxidizes the iron.”
The Victorian Hydrogen Hub and the Aerostructures Innovation Research Hub are developing hydrogen storage tanks for aerospace in Australia, in cooperation with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Institut für Flugzeugbau at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. The project will model the chemical aspects of hydrogen storage in new materials by using density functional theory and related methods. “Essentially, we're creating a metal-organic framework-based hydrogen storage tank that can be used for aviation,” said Madeline Van Dongen, hydrogen storage technologies research fellow.

India's Livguard Solar has unveiled new single-phase, wall-mountable inverters for residential PV applications. These grid-interactive inverters are available in rated power outputs of 3 kW and 5 kW, and efficiencies of 97.7% and 98%, respectively.
The MPPT efficiency is up to 99.9%. The inverters feature a wide operating voltage range of 180 V to 276 V AC (which is suitable for Indian grids), low self-consumption (less than 1 W) at night, and wide MPPT voltage range, said Livguard.
The 3 kW inverter measures 321 mm × 260 mm × 131.5 mm and weighs 6.3 kg. The 5 kW inverter measures 405 mm × 315 mm × 135 mm and weighs 11.5 kg.
The recommended maximum PV input power is 4,100 Wp for the 3 kW inverter, and 6,650 Wp for the 5 kW inverter. The maximum input voltage is 550 V and 600 V, respectively. The MPPT operating voltage range is 50 V to 550 V and 90 V to 580 V, respectively.
The inverters feature IP65-rated protection, WiFi communication mode, and cooling based on natural convection. These come with an eight-year warranty.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/11/pakistani-regulator-to-raise-payments-for-net-metered-households/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,PAKISTAN",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",Pakistani regulator to raise payments for net-metered households,"During public consultations on Sept. 27, NEPRA said it wants to replace the current national average power purchase price of PKR 19.32/kWh with the national average energy purchase price of PKR 9/kWh for net-metered households that inject excess electricity into the grid.
The draft amendment initially triggered concerns that the changes could jeopardize the nation’s clean energy ambitions. But Nepra later said that “the amendment in the regulations only applies to the excess units sold by net metering consumers,” or 20,700 households across Pakistan. Nepra has yet to publicly discuss the conclusions of the consultation.
“The hearing remained inconclusive, [the] Nepra chairman closed the hearing after two hours, and several participants were left unheard,” Afia Malik, a senior research economist for the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), told pv magazine. “Nepra’s chairman asked [participants] to share their arguments in writing within a week,” she added.
Malik said a quantified explanation of the steep increase in price for net-metered households was expected during the hearing, but Nepra has argued that 20,700 solar system owners should see an increase of PKR 10.32/kWh for the extra units they send to the grid, as a show of solidarity with the around 36 million electricity consumers who do not have the resources to install rooftop solar.
The capacity installed under self-consumption and net metering for these 20,700 consumers is no more than 476 MW, according to Malik. Assuming a capacity factor of 19%, and given that 25% of self-generated electricity is exported to the grid, Malik expects that only 23 MW of excess capacity is exported to the grid by the consumers affected by the amendment.
Pakistan currently has more than 40,00 MW of installed power capacity, according to Nepra’s 2021-22 report. The excess 23 MW from net-metered households represent just 0.06% of the country’s total generating capacity, so it will probably not have an impact on the electricity bills of the remaining 36 million consumers.
The amendment to Pakistan’s net-metering rules is expected to discourage consumers from installing rooftop PV systems.
“The majority of consumers have a small rooftop solar system (5 kW),” said Malik. “In summer, for example, their consumption exceeds the units they produce. The rates in these hours [used to] exceed PKR 40/kWh. After the amendment and reduction in rates, the bills of consumers will increase substantially.”

Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) has confirmed the results. As of September 2021, the cell had an efficiency of 21.4%.
The device was fabricated through a low-temperature co-evaporation method for the growth of the light-absorbing CIGS semiconductor thin film. EMPA scientist Shiro Nishiwaki optimized the composition of the layer and alkaline dopants to achieve improved performance.
“The current increase in efficiency is due to the alloying of the light-absorbing semiconductor layer to improve its electronic properties,” the research group said. 
The solar cell has been developed by the research team over the past 23 years. Their “record streak” started in 1999 with an efficiency of 12.8%, then went on to 14.1% (2005), 17.6% (2010), 18.7% (2011) and 20.4%( 2013) and finally reached 20.8% in 2019 and 21.4% last yer.
“The flexible and lightweight solar modules resulting from this technology are particularly suitable for applications on roofs and facades of buildings, greenhouses, transport vehicles, airships and portable electronic devices,” the head of the laboratory for thin films and photovoltaics, Ayodhya Tiwari, told pv magazine in a recent interview on the future of CIGS technology. “EMPA collaborates with the Swiss company Flisom for the manufacture of flexible and lightweight solar modules by roll-to-roll processes for such applications.”
Japan's Solar Frontier has achieved the highest efficiency for a CIGS solar cell to date, at 23.35%. German thin-film module maker Avancis has reached the highest efficiency for a solar panel, at 19.64%.

The regulator said the two companies have also agreed to donate funds to different sustainable causes to compensate for their unclear and insufficiently substantiated sustainability claims and avoid sanctions.
“We are glad that the companies recognize that they should have communicated more clearly about sustainability,” said ACM board member Hijmans van den Bergh.
The ACM approached the two energy suppliers to scrutinize their claims in spring 2021. It said Vattenfall and Greenchoice presented sustainability claims by using comparisons.
“However, it was not clear on what basis the comparison was made and with whom or what was being compared,” the ACM said.
Its guidelines for sustainability claims rely on several rules of thumb. Companies must say what sustainability benefits their products offer, and they must substantiate their sustainability claims with facts, for example.
“We must adhere to certain rules,” a Vattenfall spokesperson told pv magazine. “We therefore appreciate the ACM's attention and comments and have amended the relevant information. We will also be even sharper in the future to prevent errors or ambiguities.”

Fraport AG, the company operating the Frankfurt Airport, has deployed another PV system to increase its share of green electricity.
The demonstration array features 20 solar modules with a combined capacity of 8.4 kW. In contrast to the existing PV systems at the airport, this is a “fence system,” with the double-glass panels installed vertically.
According to Fraport, the main reason for the vertical arrangement is to protect biodiversity. Due to the minimal shading of the ground and the unimpeded distribution of precipitation, the impact on vegetation is minimal. At the same time, the system ensures high electricity yields, despite the small amount of space it takes up, as sunlight can hit the panels optimally all day long. In addition, the vertical arrangement means that glare is physically impossible, Fraport said. The company Outarky installed the system, the frame system is from Next2Sun.
“In the first demonstration section, we would like to gain experience with the construction and maintenance of the system as well as with the green care all around,” said Marcus Keimling, head of network services at Fraport. “Our own staff will be responsible for this in the future. The test fields provide us with the necessary expertise. However, we will soon move on to realizing the additional photovoltaic area along the runway and will complete this as quickly as possible.”
In the final stage of expansion, the system will extend parallel to the runway over a length of 2,600 meters, covering almost 26 hectares, with a total output of up to 13 MW. Completion is scheduled for the first quarter of 2024.
Solar power from own generation has been included in the power mix of the airport operator Fraport since March 2021. Since then, a PV system with 1.5 MW has been producing solar power on an area of 13,000 square meters on the roof of a freight hall in CargoCity South. Three more PV systems are to be added to new buildings such as the multi-level car park for the terminal.
According to a recent German study, vertical installations could have a beneficial effect in stabilizing the national grid, while allowing greater integration with agricultural activities than with conventional ground-mounted PV plants. The scientists found that vertical PV systems could shift solar yield into hours of higher electricity demand and more electricity supply in the winter months, reducing solar curtailment.

According to the “Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report 2022: State of The Sector” report – published by the World Bank’s Lighting Global, International Finance Corp. (IFC), GOGLA, Efficiency for Access Coalition, and Open Capital Advisors – the number of people who use solar energy kits had grown by 70 million by the end of 2021, up from 420 million in 2019.
The report attributes this result to continued sales, the longer lifespan of larger products, and current customers beginning to move up the “clean energy staircase.” This is where they have paid off or made savings from their initial solar energy kit and are able to purchase a new, often larger product and additional services. For instance, 3.8 million customers have gained access to solar TVs in 2020 and 2021.
The adverse effects of the pandemic were most pronounced in 2020, translating into a 22% decline in solar energy kit sales. However, in 2021, the off-grid solar sector bounced back with a 10% increase in sales, the report finds.
In pursuit of universal energy access by 2030, off-grid solar technologies are expected to play a critical role as population growth, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the report, off-grid solar represents the cheapest solution for 41% of new household connections between 2020 and 2030.
But for many homes and businesses, the price of solar energy kits remains prohibitive. The pandemic has also exacerbated the affordability challenge in the form of declining income levels and job losses. Therefore, the availability of consumer financing options, such as PAYGo, has never been more important.
Assuming consumer finance is readily available, between 177 million to 277 million currently unconnected people are still unable to afford a Tier 1 solar energy kit, the report shows. In the absence of consumer finance, affordability levels drop even further. That is to say, of 733 million unconnected people around the world, only between 3 million and 167 million could afford to buy a Tier 1 multi-light and charging system upfront.
“This indicates that end-user financing is essential to provide the poorest population with Tier 1 energy access, but that PAYGo is not sufficient to close the affordability gap,” the report said.
Meanwhile, investments into the industry continued to grow, surpassing $2.3 billion since 2012. However, most of the finance went to seven companies operating at scale, while those in their seed and start-up phase have found attracting financing more difficult.
From 2016 to 2020, the industry saw yearly investment volumes plateauing between $300 million and $350 million, before reaching $457 million in 2021. This year is set to be another record-breaking year, the report states.
In other findings, the report found that solar water pumps and solar cooling seen as “emerging” technologies two years ago, have rapidly matured and are now classified as “near-to-market” – and are already improving food production and storage. Furthermore, the PAYGo technology that unlocked consumer financing for solar energy is now being leveraged on a variety of electronic devices, and to offer digital financial services.
Finally, the report highlights the need for end-user subsidies, noting that “there is growing recognition that more public funding will be needed to reach remote and lower-income customers, and to bridge affordability gaps.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/11/australian-company-targets-solar-panel-industry-with-high-grade-silica/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",Australian company targets solar panel industry with high-grade silica,"From pv magazine Australia
Allup Silica said a series of samples taken at the company’s Sparkler exploration project site in Western Australia have produced a consistent high-grade, low-iron silica sands product that exceeds the premium specifications required for solar PV applications.
It said bulk samples from four drill holes at the Sparkler project site, located about 200 kilometers from the port of Albany, Western Australia, had been tested at the Nagrom mineral processing facility in Perth. The results were reviewed by Battery Limits Metallurgical Consultants, which published its findings in an independent metallurgical report.
“Some of the early indications are encouraging, and the company’s plan is to work towards achieving a commercial product within industry specifications of the sector we are striving for,” Allup Silica said in a statement. “High-grade silica sand of this specification with a low-iron content will be in high demand for use in the manufacture of premium ultra-clear cover glass production, particularly for the burgeoning solar PV panel manufacturing industry.”
The announcement came after the Perth-based company adjusted its process circuit to improve overall silica recovery and decrease iron oxide impurities, which can lower the quality and value of silica sand materials. The renewed process averaged 84 parts per million (ppm) iron oxide across all test results – well below the <100 ppm impurities benchmark for products hitting the solar panel market premium specification used for PV applications.
Combined with a silicon dioxide grade of 99.8%, Allup Chair Andrew Haythorpe said the company is now primed to generate silica sands for PV applications – one of the company’s primary target markets.
“The results from the improvements we are making to the process circuit are very encouraging and indicate that we do have the right projects and the high-purity silica sands to start with,” he said. “Being able to achieve the high-purity specs required for the manufacture of PV cells means we are on track, and we look forward to being able to supply samples to potential customers as we progress to development on our Sparkler project.”
Silica sand is used in the production of optical fibre, ceramics and glassmaking, including the specialty glass required for solar PV panels and other high-tech product applications like tablet and mobile telephone glass.
Recent technology advances have also demonstrated that the addition of high-grade silica has the potential to replace graphite as the primary metal used in lithium-ion battery anodes, offering greater energy density and efficiency.
The Sparkler project is one of four silica sands projects Allup Silica is exploring in Western Australia. The company said its initial priority is to grow the existing 73 million ton silica resource base at the Sparkler site toward a potential for commercialization.
Allup Silica plans to spend approximately two years building its resource base and conducting pre-feasibility study works with the aim of developing its assets into mining operations shortly thereafter.

Carbon Brief has run the numbers and said an additional 10 GW of solar could have been expected between 2016 and 2021 if installations had continued at the same rate as in the first year of that period. The Dutch think tank said it used the 2016 installation rate, rather than the peak year for new solar in the United Kingdom, which occurred in 2017 as developers rushed to beat the closure of the Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) fixed tariff.
The GBP 1.54 billion figure was based on an average price for UK gas imports of GBP 77/MWh recorded by Carbon Brief in the year to date. The lobby group said a move made by former UK Prime Minister David Cameron in 2013 to “cut the green crap” of clean energy subsidies, home energy efficiency measures, and greener building codes had cost the nation the opportunity of reducing its imported gas demand by 65 TWh this year, for around GBP 5.01 billion of savings.
Cameron's government introduced a contracts-for-difference (CFD) incentive regime to replace ROCs in 2013, with the latter program wound down. Under CFDs, renewable energy generators bid a maximum tariff “strike price” they will accept from the government.
Generators receive the strike price – minus the day-ahead hourly wholesale price of electricity – as a bonus on top of any payments they receive separately from the commercial sale of the power they generate. When the wholesale price is higher than the agreed strike price, the generators refund the difference back to the government.
The CFD system excluded solar plants from national generation capacity auctions until last year, when they were readmitted under Boris Johnson's government.
