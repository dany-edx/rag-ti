The calculator is a joint project between the Irish Solar Energy Association and AirPV, an online solar platform.
“This calculator was years in the making,” Scott McKechnie, an AirPV spokesperson, told pv magazine. “It is the result of extensive work that focused on providing a tool that is simple to use, informative and realistic. Crucially, it can act as a transparent industry reference.”
Homeowners and businesses can now use a new calculator that – based on their postal code and adjustable settings such as PV system size, rooftop characteristics, and electricity usage details – provides estimates of their solar PV potential, including payback times, annual savings, and emission reductions.
“The accuracy of the calculator ultimately depends on the key models and assumptions, along with the user making appropriate choices that best match the situation at their home,” McKechnie said. “We chose the most accurate models. They provide a tradeoff between simulation complexity and accessibility for the user.”

The project pipeline includes some floating solar capacity and is part of a public-private partnership (PPP), Masdar said in a statement, without providing further details.
“By 2030, the installed capacity of generating stations using solar and wind energy should be 700 MW,” said Tajikistani Minister of Energy and Water Resources Daler Jum’a. “Today, 450 MW of this is being developed by a feasibility study with the participation of international consulting companies with the financial support of international financial institutions. This is a relatively new direction for us, but nevertheless concrete work has already begun.”
Masdar has worked on a number of projects in Central Asia. It has achieved financial closure on three solar projects in Uzbekistan, located in Jizzakh, Samarkand, and Sherabad, with a total capacity of approximately 900 MW.
In addition, Masdar's 100 MW Nur Navoi Solar Power Project in Uzbekistan has been operational since 2021, and it has plans for the 250 MW Nur Bukhara Solar Power Project with a 63 MW/126MWh battery energy storage system.

In their 2023 report on global PV O&M service provider dynamics, Wood Mackenzie said that the leading 15 companies in the sector collectively added 13 GW to their global portfolios in 2022. However, the market experienced a slight contraction of 2.8%, resulting in a 56% market share for these suppliers by the end of 2022, down from 58% in 2021, indicating fragmentation within the solar O&M industry.
The top three suppliers remained unchanged from the previous year, with NovaSource leading, followed by SOLV Energy, and Spain's Solarig in third place. Across the portfolios analyzed by Wood Mackenzie, O&M suppliers expanded their capacity under contract by 18% in 2022, reaching a total of 207 GW.
Regarding O&M contract prices for large-scale projects in the United States, they decreased in 2022, averaging $7.9 (€7.4)/kW/year, representing a 22% decline. While specific details were not provided, the report indicated that Europe, the Middle East and Africa had the highest cost per megawatt for large-scale projects, followed by North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In terms of volume growth, North America led the way, adding 13 GW in 2022 for a total of 86 GW. EMEA expanded by 23% to reach 59 GW, APAC grew its portfolio by 2.6 GW, reaching 40 GW, and Latin America added 4.7 GW, reaching 20 GW.
The dynamic landscape of the O&M market is exemplified by recent developments such as RES Group's acquisition of Ingeteam, which is set to become a significant multi-technology O&M provider. This move could potentially propel RES Group to the fourth position in the global solar O&M ranking once the deal is finalized, according to Leila Garcia da Fonseca, research director for renewables in the Americas at Wood Mackenzie.
While further market consolidation is anticipated to lead to increased price competition, long-term projections suggest rising costs. Factors contributing to this include increasing labor costs, general inflation, and the adoption of digital solutions, which have contributed to the recent decline in prices, as explained by Garcia da Fonseca.

CEB will evaluate whether the firm has completed previous feasibility studies for floating PV solar arrays and if it has designed hybrid solar or wind battery energy storage systems in the past.
The team leader – a degree-accredited registered electrical, mechatronics or electro-mechanical engineer – should also have at least 15 years’ experience and completed a feasibility study for a floating solar PV farm in the past 10 years. The application should also include a civil engineer and an environmental expert involved in completing a previous floating solar PV feasibility study.
The deadline for applications is October 16.
Tender documents claim the country’s hunger for floating PV plants originates from “a view of avoiding land usage” for this kind of energy generation, and that the CEB is “currently contemplating” setting up a 30—40 MW wind farm at Plaine Sophie with power outputs from the wind generator and floating PV farm within a collector substation.
The first floating solar PV project at the reservoir kicked off in 2019 when consultancy firm RINA Consulting was appointed to conduct a feasibility study into implementing a floating solar PV array at the site. After the study, the government approved the implementation of a pilot 2 MW project.
CEB went out with a call for additional applications for the second stage of the pilot project in November 2022 with six bids received. “However, after evaluation of bids, none of the bidders was found to be responsive,” the tender document stated. “Subsequently, the CEB decided to proceed with a rebid exercise for the pilot phase.” It is expected the 2 MW solar farm will be operational by August 2024.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Mauritius recorded 110 MW of installed capacity by the end of 2022. The nation did not install any new capacity last year, according to the agency.
In March 2022, the CEB of Mauritius issued two different tenders for the deployment of 140 MW of solar-plus-storage capacity. The government of Mauritius has also been supporting distributed solar through net metering and rebate schemes.

Octopus Investments Australia has purchased the 500 MW/1 GWh Blackstone big battery project from its initial developer, Firm Power.
The installation has been proposed for a site in Swanbank, about 40 kilometers from Brisbane, Queensland. It is still very much in the development stages and is only expected to reach a final investment decision in the second half of 2025. Octopus Investments Australia still needs to organize connection agreements with Powerlink, in addition to securing offtake, according to the Australian Financial Review.
Octopus Investments Australia acquired the battery project using capital from its OASIS fund, a platform it set up in 2022 for institutional investors. The OASIS investment platform has raised AUD 550 million ($346 million) over the last year, attracting backing from superannuation giants Hostplus and Rest Super, as well as Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC).
Octopus Investments Australia has had a busy year, acquiring the 175 MW Ardandra project, which sits adjacent to its existing 180 MW Dulacca Wind Farm, both of which are in Queensland. In May, Octopus Investments Australia also acquired a 400 MW Hay Plains wind project in southwestern New South Wales.
Earlier this year, Octopus Investments Australia revealed plans to fold two proposed hybrid installations into its OASIS and OREO investment platforms. They are the 80 MW Fulham solar project in southeastern Victoria, featuring a 120 MWh battery, and the 350 MW Blind Creek agrisolar project in New South Wales, with a 300 MW/600 MWh battery.
Desert Springs Octopus, a majority Indigenous-owned company backed by Octopus Investments Australia, also signed a series of agreements with First Nations groups from Darwin and Katherine in August. Octopus Investments Australia will work with the groups to develop a number of renewable projects in the Northern Territory.

India’s 14th National Electricity Plan (NEP14) sets out solar capacity targets of 185.6 GW by fiscal 2026-27, reaching 364.6 GW by fiscal 2031-32.
To achieve these targets, India needs to increase its current annual solar capacity addition by about 36% each year leading up to 2026-27, according to a recent report by Ember.
“The recent addition of 12.9 GW in FY 2023 [bringing the total national solar capacity to 66.7 GW] will be insufficient to reach the FY 2027 NEP solar capacity target of 185.6 GW. As the target year approaches, India would need to achieve a 36% year-on-year increase in solar capacity to remain on track for the 2027 goal,” states Ember. “This means that India would need to commission a minimum of 17.5 GW in FY 2024, with a further ramp-up to 41 GW by FY 2027.”
Ember adds that beyond fiscal 2027, even if India continues to sustain its annual build rate of 41 GW per year, it will surpass its fiscal 2032 target capacity of 365 GW by a comfortable margin. Solar and wind will fuel two-thirds of India’s power generation growth in the 10-year period from fiscal 2022-32, should India meets its renewables targets, as outlined in NEP14.
NEP14, published by India’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA), estimates India’s total annual electricity generation to grow by 1,174 TWh in fiscal 2022-32, reaching a total of 2,666 TWh in fiscal 2032. Solar generation is expected to rise from 73 TWh in fiscal 2022 to 666 TWh in fiscal 2032. Wind power will increase from 69 TWh to 258 TWh over the same time frame.
“Annual solar and wind generation are expected to rise by 593 TWh and 189 TWh, respectively, which combined constitute 66% of India’s power generation growth in this 10-year period,” said Ember. “This marks a significant transition from the preceding decade when coal power accounted for around 80% of generation growth.”
If India successfully meets its solar targets outlined in NEP14, the solar energy's contribution to the nation's power generation is projected to increase significantly. It is expected to grow from 5% in fiscal 2022 to 25% in fiscal 2032. This shift suggests that India's power sector, which has been primarily coal-driven over the past decade, may experience a substantial transition in the coming ten years, with solar and wind energy playing a major role, assuming India stays on course to achieve its NEP14 goals.
As the adoption of solar energy expands in India, there is also growing demand for increased energy storage capacity to effectively manage peak power demands during the evenings and early mornings. This need is highlighted by recent instances of power shortages.
“India’s electricity supply landscape is projected to change quite significantly in the next decade or so, with solar and wind likely to drive the growth in generation,” said Neshwin Rodrigues, Ember’s India electricity policy analyst. “Given their variable nature, a significant increase in storage capacity is crucial to balance generation and demand.”

“This dataset may be used independently or in conjunction with larger, non-satellite imagery datasets to produce robust detection models capable of generalizing across image types,” the scientists explained. “It may better support the use of satellite imagery in rapidly detecting and monitoring residential-scale solar panel installations, allowing researchers and policy-makers to address the needs of various applications.”
The dataset contains 2,542 PV systems located in southern Germany. The researchers explained that they chose this region due to the high concentration of both residential and commercial PV systems. After acquiring imagery of the area, they randomly chose three areas within the selected region and used software to identify the PV arrays.
They annotated individual solar panel objects manually and, in order to verify their identification, they compared the findings to images from Google Earth, which offers higher resolution images. Objects with potentially only one or two solar modules, either adjoined or separated, were considered as non-panel objects such as skylights, ventilation caps, and chimneys.
“In total, 2,487 solar panel objects, or 97.8%, were identified with high confidence,” the academics stated. “Less than 3.0% of the solar panel objects were identified with moderate or low confidence.”
The scientists said the novel dataset can be either used to develop detection models uniquely applicable to satellite imagery or in conjunction with existing solar panel aerial imagery datasets to support generalized detection models.
The dataset was introduced in the study “A solar panel dataset of very high-resolution satellite imagery to support the Sustainable Development Goals,” published in scientific data.
Maxar Technologies made both the image chips and the object labels available online.

“The tender saw several projects submitted for building solar photovoltaics renewable energy installations,” the statement reads. “The total capacity of the projects that applied was 516 MW, which represents an oversubscription for the tender and is a clear sign of strong competition for the available budget. The Commission welcomes the positive results.”
The tender was launched in April and closed in September. It was designed to contribute to the rapid initial development of large-scale PV projects in Finland while also providing Luxembourg access to renewable energy potential beyond its territory. Luxembourg is providing a voluntary payment of €40 million ($41.8 million) and Finland is hosting the projects competing for the subsidies.
The European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) will evaluate the eligibility of the projects and award them contracts “based on price,” the announcement states. “This means that the most competitive bids will be selected first, followed by the next lowest bid until the budget is fully allocated.”

In the week of September 25, solar energy production increased in all analyzed markets compared to the previous week. The Italian market registered the largest increase at 38%. In the rest of the markets, the increase in solar energy production was very homogeneous, ranging from 15% in Spain to 18% in Germany. Furthermore, although solar radiation decreases as winter approaches, the Iberian Peninsula produced 163 GWh of solar energy on Monday, September 25, a volume of solar energy production not seen since September 1.
For the week of October 2, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s solar energy production forecasts, solar energy production is expected to decline in the analyzed markets.


As for wind energy production, there was a decrease in production from the week of September 25 in all markets analyzed by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting. The largest fall, 55%, was registered in the French market and the smallest decrease, 2.4%, in the Italian market. In the remaining markets, the decline in wind energy production ranged from 44% in Germany to 49% in Portugal.
For the week of October 2, AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts indicate that wind energy production will continue to fall in Italy and France, but it will increase in the rest of the analyzed markets.

Electricity demand
In the week of September 25, electricity demand increased in most European markets analyzed compared to the previous week. The largest increase, 5.6%, was observed in the Dutch market, followed by a 2.3% increase in the Spanish market. The smallest increase, 0.5%, was registered in Great Britain. Electricity demand fell in only two of the analyzed markets, by 4.5% in Italy and 3.4% in Belgium.
Over the period, average temperatures increased in most markets, ranging from 0.7 °C in the Netherlands to 3.0 °C in Portugal. However, in Italy and Germany, average temperatures decreased by 1.8 °C and 0.1 °C, respectively.
For the week of October 2, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts, electricity demand is expected to continue to increase in most European markets analyzed, except France, Germany and Italy.

European electricity markets
During the week of September 25, prices in almost all European electricity markets analyzed by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting increased compared to the previous week. While in the week of September 18, daily prices were often below €100/MWh, on several days in the week of September 25, daily prices exceeded this amount and even €120/MWh in some markets, resulting in higher weekly averages in most of the analyzed markets, in many cases above €100/MWh. The exception was the IPEX market of Italy, where the price fell slightly, by 1.7%.
On the other hand, the highest percentage price increase, 46%, was reached in the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries. Although daily prices remained below €10/MWh, they increased compared to the previous week, when a negative daily price was registered.
In the remaining markets, prices increased between 11% in the MIBEL market of Portugal and the N2EX market of the United Kingdom and 35% in the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium and France.
In the fourth week of September, weekly averages were above €90/MWh in most of the European electricity markets analyzed. The exception was the Nordic market, where the lowest average price, €3.82/MWh, was reached. On the other hand, the highest weekly average, €116.21/MWh, was reached in the Italian market. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €91.68/MWh in the British market to €113.67/MWh in the Portuguese market.
In the Nordic market, negative hourly prices were registered on September 25, 26 and 30 and October 1. In the British market, negative prices were registered on September 25 and 28. The lowest hourly price in this market, ‑£19.78/MWh, was reached on Thursday, September 28, between 5:00 and 6:00. This was the lowest price in this market since July 16. In addition, negative prices were registered in the German, Belgian, French and Dutch markets on Sunday, October 1.
However, in the fourth week of September, hourly prices above €200/MWh were also reached in several markets. On Monday, September 25, this amount was exceeded for two hours in the Belgian market. In the German and Dutch markets, in addition to the 25th, prices above €200/MWh were registered on September 26, 27 and 28. The highest price, €379.59/MWh, was registered on Monday, September 25, from 19:00 to 20:00 in Germany and the Netherlands.
During the week of September 25, the increase in the average gas price, the rise in electricity demand in most markets and the general decline in wind energy production led to higher prices in the European electricity markets.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the first week of October prices in most European electricity markets analyzed might decrease, influenced by increased wind energy production in some markets.

Brent, fuels and CO2
Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market registered their weekly minimum settlement price, $93.29/bbl, on Monday, September 25. This price was 1.2% lower than the previous Monday, but $0.02/bbl higher than the previous Friday. Increases continued until reaching the weekly maximum settlement price, $96.55/bbl, on September 27. This price was 3.2% higher than the previous Wednesday and the highest since November 7, 2022. Subsequently, prices declined slightly but remained above $95/bbl. The settlement price on Friday, September 29, was $95.31/bbl, 2.2% higher than the previous Friday.
In the fourth week of September, production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, along with data on declining US crude stockpiles, pushed settlement prices of Brent crude oil futures higher to $96.55/bbl on September 27. However, concerns about economic evolution led to slight price declines in the last sessions of the week. Data released on Saturday, September 30, on the evolution of the Chinese economy might support price increases in the first days of October. The increase in demand associated with aviation due to increased travel during the holiday period in China might also exert an upward influence on prices.
As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, on Monday, September 25, they reached the weekly maximum settlement price, of 44.44 €/MWh. This price was 29% higher than the previous Monday and the highest since early April. In contrast, the weekly minimum settlement price, €39.30/MWh, was registered on September 27. Despite the decline, this price was still 5.4% higher than on the previous Wednesday. In the last sessions of the week, prices increased again. As a result, on Friday, September 29, the settlement price was €41.86/MWh, 5.2% higher than the previous Friday.
In the fourth week of September, expectations of higher demand due to the approaching winter and the decline in renewable energy production led to the highest price in recent months on Monday. However, high levels of European stocks and the prospect of mild temperatures and higher supply levels allowed lower prices to be registered subsequently.
As for CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, the weekly maximum settlement price, €85.27/t, was reached on Monday, September 25. This price was 5.5% higher than on the previous Monday. However, this price was already slightly lower than the previous Friday’s price, €85.48/t. Price declines were registered in most sessions of the fourth week of September. As a result, the weekly minimum settlement price, €81.67/t, was registered on Friday, September 29, and it was 4.5% lower than the previous Friday.

Solar, wind and natural gas made up more than 91% of the capacity added to the US electric grid in 2021, according to the Electric Generator Construction Costs and Annual Electric Generator Report by the EIA.
While total construction cost for solar approached $20 billion, average construction costs for solar systems fell in the United States in 2021, compared to 2020. The EIA figures show that in 2021, solar construction costs fell 6% from 2020, dropping to $1,561/kW. The decrease was driven primarily by a 10% drop in the construction cost for crystalline silicon tracking panels, which fell to $1,423/kW – their lowest average cost since 2014.
The EIA figures show that solar construction costs fell 6% in 2021 over 2020, dropping to $1,561/kW. The decrease was driven primarily by a 10% drop in the construction cost for crystalline silicon tracking panels, which fell to $1,423/kW, their lowest average cost since 2014.
 
The report notes that the average construction cost for crystalline silicon fixed-tilt panels increased by 5% to $2,047/kW. The average cost for cadmium telluride panels remained relatively stable, decreasing only 1% to $1,626/kW in 2021. Fixed-tilt tracking systems automatically move to follow the sun as it moves across the sky. While they are the highest cost, they produce more electricity by continuously following the sun.
It’s worth noting that this follows a time when solar module prices had doubled primarily due to supply shortages during the pandemic. In response to the shortage, many manufacturers increased production while developers stockpiled supply.
Since the pandemic began in 2020, module prices have continued to fall, hitting a global two-year low in April 2023. In the first two months of 2023, average US module prices were $0.36/W (DC), down 11% quarter over quarter. Modules traded at a 57% premium over the global spot price for monofacial monocrystalline silicon modules.
Taking a regional view, the greatest growth in solar addition happened in the southern part of the United States, with Texas leading the way. In 2021, Texas added 100 new plants for a total of 10,155 MW compared to just 2,347 added in Ohio.
While Texas still leads the nation in solar installations, the numbers look vastly different than two years ago. For example, a 36 GW buildout is expected by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) over the next five years, building on the roughly 16 GW that is active to date. Much of today’s investment in solar, which nears $20 billion, is going toward large solar facilities, often exceeding 100 MW in capacity.

“Overall, the findings of this study present a novel way to realize high-performance thin crystalline silicon solar cells using much less silicon—for a 20-μm cell, around one eighth of the amount required for a thick 160-μm cell on a given panel size,” said researcher Leonidas Palilis.
In the paper “Investigation on significant efficiency enhancement of thin crystalline silicon solar cells,” published in the Journal of Photonics for Energy (JPE), the scientists explained that they used the layer transfer (LT) method instead of silicon ingot cutting for the production of the wafer used for the cell. LT is a technique to transfer a layer of a semiconductor material, often of a wafer-scale size, from the original substrate to the target substrate.
With this method, hydrofluoric (HF) acid is first used electrochemically to etch pores into a thick silicon wafer for porous silicon and this wafer is utilized as a substrate to epitaxially grow a monocrystalline silicon layer. The epitaxial thin silicon layer is then lifted off from the porous silicon substrate.
Via this process, the scientists obtained a p-type 20μm-thick thin monocrystalline silicon wafer. They then deposited multiple passivation layers made of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon nitride (NiO2) and silicon monoxide (SiOx) via Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) at the front of the cell.
These contacts have two different configurations – SiO2/SiNx/SiOx and Al2O3/SiNx/SiOx – and reportedly improve light absorption in short wavelengths and longer wavelengths, which in turn enhances the cell short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage.
“Compared with a standard solar cell used as a reference, the current density increased from 34.3 mA/cm2 to 38.2 mA/cm2,” the academics said, adding that the passivation layers also contributed to raising the cell open-circuit voltage from 632 mV to 684 mV.
As a result, the device's fill factor increased from 76.2% to 80.8% and the cell efficiency grew from 16.5% to 21.1%.
”This advance will likely contribute to more widespread cost-effective adoption of silicon solar power technology, due to the reduced cost and the concomitant expansion of the solar panel manufacturing capacity,” said Palilis.
