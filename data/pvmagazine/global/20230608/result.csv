This expansion would be sufficient to meet the agency's annual net zero demand for 2050, which anticipates PV deployment of nearly 650 GW in 2030 and almost 310 GW in 2024. However, the industry is grappling with the challenge of oversupply.
In 2022, global PV manufacturing capacity increased by more than 70% to nearly 450 GW, with China accounting for more than 95% of new additions across the supply chain. In 2023 and 2024, global PV manufacturing capacity is expected to double, with China again accounting for more than 90% of the increase.
Chinese manufacturers are investing in expanding wafer, cell, and module manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Additionally, manufacturing plants are expected to be deployed in India and the United States due to new industrial policies introduced last year.
India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have led to a surge in new solar manufacturing projects. Between November 2022 and May 2023, more than 120% of such projects were announced, potentially creating national supply chains with more than 20 GW of capacity in each region.
In Europe, new manufacturing capacity accounts for just 14% of the announced projects since August 2022. The EU Green Deal Industrial Plan and the Net-Zero Industry Act aim for Europe to produce 40% of its PV targets by 2030, but specific incentives are not currently included. High prices of industrial energy have also increased the cost of manufacturing solar PV equipment in EU countries.
“Without a manufacturing policy or domestic content premiums, solar PV manufacturing in the European Union is less competitive than in India or the United States,” said the IEA.
In Europe, less than 1% of manufacturing capacity is dedicated to new cells, while ingots and wafers account for 9%, and polysilicon production is at only 6%. Integrated manufacturing facilities produce three or more components, but nearly 80% of their announced capacity excludes dedicated polysilicon production. Additionally, the capacity of new module assembly plants, which is almost 30 GW, does not align with the announced capacity for other components, particularly cells and polysilicon. As a result, these new plants will still need to import cells and other components from China.
The combined new solar PV manufacturing announcements in India, the United States, and Europe amount to 30 GW for polysilicon and 100 GW for module assembly.

Luxembourg's Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Energy have chosen 85 projects totaling 43.3 MW in the country's inaugural solar self-consumption tender. The selected projects will receive €16.1 million ($17.2 million) in rebates out of a €30 million budget.
The tender encompassed three project categories: installations ranging from 30 kW to 200 kW, with a subsidy ceiling of €810/kW; arrays with an installed power of 200 kW to 500 kW, with a subsidy ceiling of €610/kW; and PV systems with a capacity between 500 kW and 5 MW, with a subsidy ceiling of €530/kW.
The third category secured the largest portion, with 32.7 MW of assigned capacity and €9.7 million in funds. The second category obtained 8.24 MW and €3.2 million, while the first category was awarded 5.37 MW and €3.0 million.
The chosen developers now have 18 months to finalize their projects. Economy Minister Franz Fayot stated, “We are directing investments towards renewable energies and encouraging more industrial and service companies to invest in energy independence and renewables.”
The ministry plans to launch the second tender of this kind in July. As of the end of 2022, Luxembourg had approximately 319 MW of installed PV capacity, with around 42 MW of new solar additions last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/08/lebanese-households-fight-economic-crisis-with-record-rooftop-pv-additions/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,LEBANON",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JUNE 8, 2023",Lebanese households fight economic crisis with record rooftop PV additions,"By the end of 2020, Lebanon fell short of its national target of 100 MW for solar capacity, reaching a cumulative total of 89.84 MW. This shortfall reflected the bleak state of the solar sector, mirroring the overall economic downturn.
Lebanon's ongoing political and economic deadlock persists, marked by soaring inflation, a failed banking system, currency collapse, and the continued incompetence and reluctance of Lebanese political forces to undertake economic reforms.
By February this year, the Lebanese currency had lost more than 98% of its pre-crisis value. In May, the World Bank said “the systemic failure of Lebanon’s banking system and the collapse of the currency have induced a pervasive dollarized cash economy estimated at almost half of GDP in 2022.” The growing dollarized economy – at about $9.9 billion in 2022, almost half the size of the Lebanese economy – is a major impediment to economic recovery, it added.
Lebanon's severe political and economic turmoil has not only plunged the majority of its population into poverty but has also left its citizens in literal darkness. Prior to the crisis, the state-owned electric utility, Electricité Du Liban (EDL), and private diesel generators combined to provide approximately 24 hours of electricity supply. Currently, they can barely manage 12 to 14 hours per day, leaving citizens in complete blackouts for the rest of the day.
“It was then when people realized the importance of solar energy and its competitive low cost compared to fossil fuels,” Marc Ayoub, energy researcher at the American University of Beirut's Issam Fares Institute and non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told pv magazine.
In May, the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) stated that its projections indicate Lebanon will surpass 1 GW of solar rooftops within the first 10 days of June 2023. By the end of 2022, cumulative solar installations had reached 870 MW, with 2022 alone seeing a total installed capacity of 663 MW. This stands in stark contrast to 2020, when Lebanon added only 14 MW of new solar rooftop capacity, representing a 47-fold increase in yearly rooftop photovoltaic installations. In other words, Lebanon's rooftop PV market is booming.
The growth of rooftop PV in Lebanon cannot be attributed to a remuneration scheme. Ayoub said that although net metering was approved by EDL's board in 2011, various technical and administrative barriers prevented the net metering market from gaining significant traction. One of the main challenges, according to Ayoub, is the insufficient electricity supply and frequent blackouts even prior to the country's economic collapse, which often prevented net metering users from exporting excess power to the grid. Additionally, the bureaucratic process of installing metering at both the utility and customer ends hindered the practical implementation of the net metering scheme.
Due to the economic collapse, net metering in Lebanon was already challenging, and currently, the net metering scheme is non-existent, according to Ayoub. The growth of rooftop PV now primarily relies on off-the-grid solar plus battery systems in residential and small business sectors. The main disadvantage for this, according to Ayoub, is “that a big chunk of the electricity generated from solar is wasted after batteries are charged.”
Institutional financing options for installing such systems are limited. Instead, those who can afford it rely on their own private savings or receive remittances from family and friends abroad, paying in cash with the US dollar, noted Ayoub. Some individuals even resort to selling personal assets, jewelry, and gold to cover the minimum cost of solar systems, which ranges from $4,000 to $7,000.
Having said that, about a year ago Lebanon’s Banque De L’Habitat started rolling out a new scheme to provide loans to help Lebanese households buy and install solar systems. The scheme is running with technical assistance by the LCEC. Ayoub said there are currently discussions initiated by international financing institutions such as the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Union, to channel new financing to the rooftop PV sector, but these “are yet to materialize due to the accompanying risks the macroeconomic context of the country currently entails.”
In 2021, pv magazine reported that Lebanon's Industrial Research Institute (IRI) declared that all used solar panels imported since October 2021 did not meet national standards for such systems. As a result, imports of second-hand PV panels have been effectively blocked. Ayoub noted that despite this ruling, some unregulated providers have emerged during the crisis and continue to offer equipment (panels, inverters, batteries) that does not meet the standards set by the IRI.
The Lebanese rooftop PV boom is a sign that people want to maintain basic living standards and keep their households and businesses running. The country is in dire need of political reform, which also includes the energy sector.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/08/2d-solar-cell-design-based-on-transition-metal-dichalcogenides-promises-12-87-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 8, 2023",2D solar cell design based on transition metal dichalcogenides promises 12.87% efficiency,"A group of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States have designed a 2D solar cell based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a special superlattice structure that reportedly enables higher solar absorption levels.
TMDCs are two-dimensional materials with remarkable semiconducting properties and high optical absorption coefficients, which makes them suitable for the manufacture of semi-transparent and flexible solar cells with potential applications in aerospace, architecture, electric vehicles, and wearable electronics, where light weight, a high power-per-weight ratio, and flexibility are very desirable.
“I think people are slowly coming to the realization that 2D TMDCs are excellent photovoltaic materials, though not for terrestrial applications, but for applications that are mobile—more flexible, like space-based applications,” said lead author Deep Jariwala. “The weight of 2D TMDC solar cells is 100 times less than silicon or gallium arsenide solar cells, so suddenly these cells become a very appealing technology.”
The scientists built the cell with a monolayer absorber made of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a 3 nm insulator based on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) placed on a substrate made of Al2O3 and gold (Au), with the latter serving as a reflector. “The thickness of the Al2O3 layer has been optimized to enhance photocarrier generation,” they explained. “The active layer of the device is intrinsic and is 0.98 μm long, with silver and gold cathode and anode electrodes measuring 0.01 μm in length each.”
According to the researchers, the novelty of this cell consists of its superlattice structure, which they say can separate the layers of 2D TMDCs by a spacer or non-semiconductor layer. “Spacing out the layers allows you to bounce light many, many times within the cell structure, even when the cell structure is extremely thin,” said Jariwala, noting that the cell shows large exciton binding energies.
When tested in a series of simulations, the proposed cell design with separate contacts was able to reach a power conversion efficiency of 12.87%. As a way of comparison, real 2D TMDC solar cells were so far able to reach efficiencies of up to 6%.
“We were not expecting cells that are so thin to see a 12% value. Given that the current efficiencies are less than 5%, my hope is that in the next 4 to 5 years people can actually demonstrate cells that are 10% and upwards in efficiency,” the researchers stated.
They described the new cell technology in the paper “How good can 2D excitonic solar cells be?” published in device. “Our findings indicate that 2D TMDC-based PVs, when optimized for both optical and electronic design, exhibit superior performance compared with other thin-film materials in terms of power density, which is vital for many applications such as aerospace, remote sensing, and wearable technology,” they concluded.

The technology is used in multi-cylinder rotary piston compressors in heat pumps. By optimizing the structure of the “exhaust port” that discharges the compressed refrigerant to the outside of the cylinders, it addresses the issue of overheating, thereby allowing for increased heating capacity, Toshiba-Carrier explained in a statement.
The design minimizes issues commonly seen in high-capacity equipment, including discharge volume loss, pulsed discharge, and distorted rotating axis. The compressor also purportedly shows lower-level noises and higher efficiency.
“The invention is instrumental in high energy efficiency and low-sound level while saving materials used with a smaller number of compressors and simplified piping design,” said Tsutomu Masamoto, chief technology executive at Toshiba Carrier.
The National Invention Awards of Japan was established in 1919 for driving innovations in science and technologies in Japan. It recognizes exceptionable inventions, devices, and designs that have generated or are expected to generate significant achievements.

The patented solution overcomes limitations of conventional atmospheric water generators by generating a constant amount of water, regardless of air humidity, and producing twice as much water with the same energy input.
Solar2Water operates solely on solar energy, with two solar panels and a battery for continuous operation. Its creators emphasize its user-friendly design and robust construction, enabling use in any environment without specialized training.
Muhammad Wakil Shahzad, a professor at Northumbria University, received seed funding from the University to develop Solar2Water. After securing proof-of-concept funding from the Northern Accelerator, Shahzad and his team successfully developed a pilot system capable of producing 15 to 20 liters of drinking water per day.
The goal is to expand the water production capacity to 50 liters per day, aiming to provide enough drinking water for a small community.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/08/growatt-highlights-c-i-hybrid-inverter-at-snec/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",ECKHART GOURAS,"JUNE 8, 2023",Growatt highlights C & I hybrid inverter at SNEC,"Chinese inverter manufacturer Growatt presented a new hybrid inverter solution that readily scales up to 300 kW for both on-grid and off-grid applications. It can be connected with up to 600 kWh of battery capacity with Growatt supplying its APX commercial battery to ensure compatibility and trouble-free O & M.
The combination of this 100 to 300 kW storage system with Growatt’s APX Commercial battery system is ideally suited to provide backup power or peak shaving to reduce user’s electricity costs. In addition, this new C & I inverter comes with grid-support functions to provide optimal integration of this distributed energy resource with the electricity grid.
Growatt’s move into larger-scale energy storage shows that the Shenzhen-based manufacturer is leveraging the technology it has developed for smaller-scale residential systems to also provide a state-of-the-art solution for large corporates and industrial users. For example, Growatt has developed battery soft-switching connection technology, providing each pack with a modular power optimizer, which enables battery packs with different capacities to be mixed in one system. Each pack can contribute power separately as needed and perform automatic balancing. This means that each battery can always be fully charged and discharged without the risk of energy mismatch.
As Zhang points out, Growatt is no longer just a solar inverter company. The company’s ambitions have become much broader to supplying a complete distributed energy ecosystem built on battery storage. This transition is well underway with the company already shipping thousands of storage-ready inverters last year, and the company expects storage-ready inverters to rapidly take up the top spot as energy storage becomes the core of Growatt’s offering, be it to residential or C & I users.
Zhang sees the adoption of e-mobility as supporting this trend. EVs are big consumers of electricity and as households and corporate users buy EVs they will want a more robust ESS to provide power to one or more electric vehicles. Being based in China, Growatt can gain valuable experience from the transition to EVs in its home market, where the electrification of transport is well underway and further than most European countries or the U.S.
Growatt has developed its own smart EV charging solution, which, when integrated in the Growatt distributed energy ecosystem, can optimize self-consumption to minimize grid charges. Zhang revealed that the manufacturer also offers a smart solution when it comes to heat pumps by coupling its GroBoost control unit with the heat pump. GroBoost can intelligently switch the power source to the solar array or APX ESS to boost self-consumption.
On the residential side, smart EV charging and GroBoost-enabled heat pumps form part of the overall GroHome smart home solution. Zhang points to the fact that Growatt already introduced GroHome in 2016 as part of its vision of the evolution of distributed energy ecosystems. Now in its second generation GroHome is also a battery-based ecosystem that can optimize self-consumption and integrate a wide range of electrical appliances with EVs and heat pumps being the most conspicuous ones.
Europe continues to be Growatt’s most important market, at least in terms of revenues. Over fifty percent of 2022 revenues were generated in Europe and the European Union’s ambitious climate goals will continue to make Europe a central market for Growatt. Production is still squarely centered in China with three factories in Huizhou and one in Vietnam. According to Zhang, Growatt can readily ramp up production capacity to meet global demand with less than six months needed to create additional capacity. This contrasts with Chinese cell and module manufacturers, who typically need a lot more time to add production capacity. In Growatt’s case we can be sure that the share of storage-ready inverters will rise and that many of these will be for corporate and industrial use as the manufacturer increasingly targets large energy users across the world.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/08/tse-and-the-agrivoltaic-development-in-france/,"SPONSORED,FRANCE,WORLD",,"JUNE 8, 2023",TSE and the agrivoltaic development in France,"Bertrand Drouot L'Hermine: We are at the end of a first cycle of ground-mounted solar development in France. For the past 15 years, the government has been favoring large-scale solar power plants on degraded land. Now these sites are becoming increasingly rare with more and more challenges, particularly with regard to environmental issues. To accelerate the development of solar energy, several interests must coexist on the same project, whether on ecological or agricultural matters. Agrivoltaics is a very important element for the development of photovoltaic in France, as long as it is well conceived, meaning the PV installation is virtuous for the activity with which it coexists, beyond a simple remuneration.
Bertrand Drouot L'Hermine: The combination of a solar energy source with a cultivated land or a livestock farm provides different benefits. First of all, it offers the crop a protection against climatic hazards such as hail or extreme temperatures by creating a rotating shade on the plot. This allows the regulation of temperature and the shift between moments of water and the heat stress of plants. It also reduces evapotranspiration and, as a result, water consumption. For example, on the first soybean harvest of our project in Amance, we have reported a 75% reduction in water stress under the system compared to the reference plot!
Each developer has a specific set of requirements for the solution they have designed. TSE has developed a range of products that meet specific needs and field constraints to provide agri-PV solutions for crops, livestock sites, fallow land, and so on.
Image: TSE
Bertrand Drouot L'Hermine: The main constraints that we integrate are related to the orientation of the plots, their typology, their topography, and of course, to the traditional requirements of solar power plants. What makes TSE's solutions specific is that they are designed based on the needs of the agricultural activity. The challenge for us is to provide the farmer with a service that adapts to his farming practices, whether in terms of cultivation or mechanization. Our canopy allows the passage of almost all agricultural machinery thanks to an inter-pole space of 27 meters in the direction of cultivation with a low point at 5 meters.
Bertrand Drouot L'Hermine: We are developing large volumes of projects in line with the incredible challenge facing the country. We rely on partners who are both well established locally and capable of industrializing large volumes, like Huawei for our inverters.
Bertrand Drouot L'Hermine: The energy crisis in which France has been immersed for the past two years is more related to a capacity crisis than to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. France needs to develop its electricity production capacity exponentially over the next 10 to 15 years for three reasons: first, we need to decarbonize our energy mix, which is still 61% fossil fuel. This will involve the electrification of uses and the development of decarbonized energy sources such as hydrogen; secondly, we need to replace the huge nuclear capacity that will be phased out between 2030 and 2035 ─ in the hope that these plants will operate until then under acceptable conditions in terms of cost and availability; and finally, because we want to reindustrialize the country, solar energy ─ as the cheapest, quickest to deploy, and most accepted source of energy ─ will be the best possible answer to complement our historic nuclear fleet.
Bertrand Drouot L'Hermine: Although imperfect, this law has a double value. It is the first law dedicated to renewable energies, showing the will to accelerate. It also provides a clear and binding framework for what agrivoltaics is and should be: the coexistence of two activities, with solar energy production providing a benefit to agriculture that is not only financial.
Bertrand Drouot L'Hermine: On a technical level, our innovations are now mature and validated. We are committed to developing more pilot projects with the best technical partners, chambers of agriculture, cooperatives such as Dijon Céréales, INRAE (the National Institute for Agricultural Research), the Purpan agronomy school, or the Institut de l'Elevage, in order to demonstrate the services that our solutions provide. On the other hand, we are developing our solutions more widely throughout the country. TSE is the solar energy producer with the strongest territorial granularity. We develop projects everywhere in France.

Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) Director Guy Debelle said that the sheer scale of the IRA threatens to overwhelm Australia’s renewable energy advantages, drawing investment dollars out of the country and locking up potential export markets.
Debelle, formerly FFI’s chief financial officer and now serving as a director of mining giant Fortescue’s green energy branch, said that Australia is well positioned to take advantage of growing demand for the zero-emissions fuel. However, it needs to act quickly or risk being left behind in the race to grab a share of the global green hydrogen market, he added.
Debelle said Australia’s renewable energy advantages make it an ideal location to generate green hydrogen. He also highlighted that Australia has a long history as a reliable energy exporter to nations such as Japan and South Korea but said the enormity of the IRA threatens to snap up those markets.
“I think it’s a material threat to us in terms of those export markets,” Debelle said. “There’s a real risk that with the US getting their headstart on us through the Inflation Reduction Act they are going to lock up a fair chunk of the Japanese and Korean markets. We have great potential here in Australia and we have great comparative advantage but … if you throw upwards of a trillion dollars at something, that tends to buy a comparative advantage. I think it’s a really serious risk that by the time we get our act together, that market won’t be there for us.”
The Australian government has been overt in its ambitions to establish a green hydrogen sector with Energy Minister Chris Bowen describing it as “the heart” of the government’s vision for the country as a renewable energy superpower.
Bowen’s ideal is backed by the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water which in the latest annual “State of Hydrogen” report, says that Australia has the foundations to become a global leader in green hydrogen.
Australia’s announced pipeline of major announced green hydrogen projects totals more than 100 projects worth an estimated AUD 230 billion ($153 billion) to AUD 300 billion of potential investment. This represents close to 40% of all global clean hydrogen project announcements.
However, the department warns that most of the announcements in this pipeline are yet to reach final investment decisions. It noted that Australia already lags other key global players in the number of large projects that have moved from planning to implementation. Debelle said that these bottlenecks must be addressed quickly or Australia risks getting left further behind green hydrogen.
“The Inflation Reduction Act got legislated last August, the details are going to be put in place this August,” he said. “Once that’s there, then you’re going to see projects hitting the ground in the U.S. pretty much straight away. Those projects are happening and they’re starting this year, not next year, this year.  We need to start soon.”
Debelle said the federal government’s budget announcement of a program to scale up development is “a good start,” but said it must rolled out quickly and must be accompanied by a clear strategy for it to have any chance of success.
“What we’ve got to realize here is that we were starting a long way behind,” he said. “We’ve got to be careful that we don’t sort of take too long to follow through on the announcements. The sooner we can see the details of the Headstart program and move forward with them the better.”
The Hydrogen Headstart program will provide revenue support for investment in renewable hydrogen production through competitive production contracts. The federal government said the funding would “help bridge the commercial gap for early projects” and put the country on track to develop a gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity by 2030 via two to three “flagship projects.” Those supported projects are expected to become operational by 2026-27.
“We can’t match the IRA across the board but I think a more targeted response to it … is achievable particularly if we think about it as an investment in the future,” Debelle said. “It’s not just money out the door, it’s investment.”

Since 2009, NASA has funded parts of DSS’s journey, from conceptualizing ROSA to its development, culminating in successful technology demonstrations, operational mission use, and other cutting-edge potential applications. DSS was acquired by Redwire in 2021, continuing ROSA’s infusion into both NASA and commercial missions.
“You come up with a simple concept, but to get that to space, riding along that controlled explosion is what drives your design,” said Ken Steele, vice president of business development for Redwire.

The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and is home to more than 18 million people.
According to the report, solar development in the six states has, up to now, “largely avoided important wildlife habitat.” In addition, researchers “found strong evidence that solar arrays were built preferentially on previously cultivated lands, rarely replaced natural landcover, and were in areas of average habitat quality relative to available areas.”
While patterns in the Southwest region of the US show solar projects being built near or within protected areas and replacing natural landcover, the science team found that solar array construction in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed area avoided natural landcover, and arrays were built away from protected areas. The report noted the importance of policies and standards that require attention to how solar projects affect biodiversity and the potential to benefit land conservation.
The team used a convolutional neural network to map the footprints of ground-mounted solar arrays present in satellite imagery annually from 2017 to 2021 for the examined states. In addition, researchers quantified the relationship between geospatial covariates and the rate of solar development by fitting a binomial-Weibull model to solar time-series data in a hierarchical, Bayesian framework. In all, a total of 958 solar arrays were mapped in 2021, covering 52.32 km2.
The study’s results identified places where solar buildout was most likely and provided data that could be used to “align current siting patterns with conservation priorities” in the region. The report also noted that “the transition of cultivated areas to solar energy facilities could represent a net benefit to conservation if wildlife-friendly solar practices are implemented.” Researchers identified beneficial practices such as supporting native plants and local wildlife, and “increases in pollinator abundance, diversity, and richness.”
The report ultimately concludes that the avoidance of natural landcover in favor of cultivated cropland presents “an opportunity to synergistically develop renewable energy and improve biodiversity,” and recognizes the great potential for solar energy facilities to be paired with agriculture for the benefit of native species diversity and carbon sequestration.
“From a conservation perspective, we were encouraged to see natural areas being avoided over the past six years. In places where solar is replacing previously degraded land cover, these facilities may also present a unique opportunity to restore biodiversity and ecosystem services in the watershed if native vegetation is maintained in areas under and around arrays,” said Michael Evans, a senior data scientist with Chesapeake Conservancy’s Conservation Innovation Center (CIC).
Their findings are available in the report “Predicting patterns of solar energy buildout to identify opportunities for biodiversity conservation,” published in Biological Conservation.
