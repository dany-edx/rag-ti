The IESR says the current solar ambition–6.5 GW of generation capacity in 2025–is based on an estimate of Indonesia's maximum technical solar potential which is up to 95 times smaller than its own calculations.
Supported by peer the Global Environmental Institute of China, the IESR has used GIS mapping to calculate Indonesian land could host 3.4-19.8 TWp of large scale solar project generation capacity.
The Beyond 207 Gigawatts: Unleashing Indonesia's Solar Potential study claims the national solar potential of 205 GW estimated by the Ministry of the Environment and Mineral Resources is woefully out of date, although the IESR points out the technical maximum it has calculated pays no heed to policy, market or other economic limitations, solely to the availability of suitably sloping land.
Excluding rooftop and floating PV which, the IESR points out, are the subjects of other studies it has prepared, the report calculates Indonesia has 484,000km2 of land which could host 19.8 TWp of large scale PV capacity. If agricultural land and forest plantations are excluded, the figure falls to 188,000km2 and 7.7 TWp; and if populated areas are also left out, the results are 154,000km2 and 6.31 TWp.
In a bid to show how unreliable the government's 207 GW estimate is, the IESR also excluded the most common bare land surface–dry shrub–from the figures, and still identified 82,800km2 of suitable sites nationwide, which could host 3.4 TWp of solar capacity.
The report's authors also stressed their calculation was based on a “rather conservative assumption” of the energy density of the sites identified, with the figure of 410 kWp/hectare based on a 2013 study drawn up by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the U.S. Recent solar projects in Indonesia have had energy densities of 600-800 kWp/hectare, according to the IESR.
The report noted the eastern, western and central provinces of Kalimantan–the Indonesian territory on the island of Borneo– boast the largest technical solar potential, with the provinces of Riau, northern and southern Sumatra, eastern and Central Java and Papua also boasting significant suitable project sites.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/22/integrating-big-solar-into-olive-groves/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 22, 2021",Integrating big solar into olive groves,"Steag Solar Energy Solutions, a unit of Germany-based power company Steag, announced it will build three PV power plants with a combined capacity of 244 MW in the Italian southern region of Apulia for an unspecified investor.
The three unsubsidized projects will be located within a radius of 20 km in the province of Foggia and will integrate the production of olives and energy on the same field in order to save space and generate mutual benefit for both.
“The trackers of the photovoltaic system will be interspersed with rows of olive groves,” Steag's press officer, Daniel Mühlenfeld, told pv magazine. “The distance between the rows of the olive grove and the photovoltaic system has been specifically designed both to avoid shadowing and allow the passage of the automatic machinery necessary for the cultivation of the olive trees.”

The main challenge in building these kinds of agrivoltaic projects, according to Mühlenfeld, will be maintaining the maximum efficiency of both production systems keeping CAPEX and OPEX in mind. “There are additional costs to integrate the PV into olive groves, but there are also additional revenues as the intensive olive plant for itself is a business case,” he further explained.
Except for the trackers that need to be higher than usual, no special components are being used for the plants. “The concept and its design are the main special component,” Mühlenfeld added. The project has been designed “to optimize power yield and agricultural yield, but the power yield only is already enough for the bankability of the projects.”
Final approval for the three plants is expected to be obtained between the third or fourth quarter of this year. Construction is scheduled to start at the end of 2021.
Steag is currently also developing what could become Italy's largest solar plant — a 700 MW facility planned in unspecified areas on the southern island of Sicily. German independent investment and asset manager KGAL is partnering with Steag on the project. “The plant is located in various places in the provinces of Palermo and Trapani,” a Steag spokesperson told pv magazine in February. “The construction will start in the third quarter of 2021 and the plant will be grid-connected during autumn 2022.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/22/ceo-interview-chinas-mibet-on-maintaining-pv-competitiveness/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"MARCH 22, 2021",CEO interview: China’s Mibet on maintaining PV competitiveness,"Chen Xi, founder and president of Mibet Energy: Currently, we have a manufacturing capacity of over 3 GW per year for racking and tracker systems. Our domestic manufacturing base is located in Xiamen, Fujian province, because there is a comprehensive and stable supply chain in this area. We also have a small production base in the ASEAN region, which is mainly focused on the markets that do not have tariffs in place.
Since the establishment of Mibet in 2012, most of our orders have come from abroad. In 2020, around 80% of our revenue came from overseas markets and just 20% from the Chinese market. We have offices in Japan, Germany, and Australia to directly serve the local markets there, and distribution channels in many other markets, including Korea, the Middle East, and South America.
As the second largest single market for solar, the U.S. is important and Mibet began exploring opportunities there very early on. However, because of the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws placed on Chinese PV products in 2014, we failed several times to successfully enter the market. With the change from the previous regime to the new Biden presidency, I believe there will be another chance for Mibet to enter this key market. The current obstacle is the Covid-19 pandemic, which has blocked personal travel and forced us to take our marketing activities online.
Mibet is a well-known PV brand in the Chinese market with 2020 shipments totaling more than 1 GW. Usually, we like to work with landmark or significant projects here. For example, in 2020, two key PV projects we worked on were the Tianjin National Convention and Exhibition Center rooftop PV project, and the Xiong’an Railway station PV rooftop project, which is installed at the largest Asian high-speed railway station. We believe these landmark projects help to improve the value and image of the Mibet brand, because being on the vendor list is an acceptance of our product by key customers.
First of all, we look to continuously innovate our product range. Each year, we spend over 2% of our revenue on R&D, specifically factoring in customer needs and feedback. We also undertake third-party inspections and verifications to improve our credibility.  Secondly, we focus on the quality of our products. We have a strong team in charge of quality guarantees, including purchasing quality inspections, manufacturing process control, shipment inspections, and after-sales service. Finally, we believe we have an advantage when it comes to supply chain management. We have stable long-term suppliers for all required raw materials, components, and equipment. Some of them have worked with us from the very beginning. This not only provides Mibet with the best cost control of our products, but also, according to our figures, we have an at least 5% cost advantage compared to our major competitors. This allows us to respond very quickly to changing customer needs.
pv magazine's UP initiative will spend Q2 2021 looking at what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to supply chain transparency in PV. Follow our coverage.
Mibet foresaw the potential of the floating PV market several years ago and consequently began undertaking R&D and prototype designs for a floating system in 2015. After several generations of product updates, the latest version, the new G4N, has several major features. Firstly, it is comprised of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), which is environmentally friendly and non-corrosive. Secondly, it consists a series of other HDPE components, including support legs, walkway panels, and connection parts like plastic bolts and nuts, clamps, and anchoring block holders, which make the system highly flexibility in terms of deployment. Furthermore, Mibet provides various anchoring solutions for customers.
Due to the UV resistance of the HDPE, which prevents the components from normal aging, we predict that the G4N system will last for as long as 25 years. It has also passed a series of professional tests and certifications, including TÜV’s raw material UV, and wind tunnel tests, the SGS Flame Retardant Test, and has obtained CGC Certification. In the past year, and despite the negative impact from the Covid-19 pandemic, we have shipped over 120 MW of this product to the ASEAN region, including Vietnam.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/22/the-promising-future-of-decentralized-solar-pv-in-the-mena-region/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,MIDDLE EAST,NORTH AMERICA",,"MARCH 22, 2021",The promising future of decentralized solar PV in the MENA region,"The use of decentralized rooftop or ground mounted solar systems to meet this energy demand is fast gaining popularity due to several advantages, including sustainability and electricity prices, over centralized power generation systems. Use of such systems plays a key role in the ability of nations to achieve their sustainability and decarbonization targets along with ensuring energy access and security to their populations.
In the MENA region, which includes the UAE, Oman KSA, Bahrain, Kuwait (GCC), Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, the clear frontrunners in terms of installed capacity are Jordan, UAE, Egypt and Tunisia.
Image: Finergreen
The addressable market for C&I projects in the UAE (Dubai), Jordan and KSA combined amounts to 4+ GW at a minimum, and installed capacity in these three countries has not yet reached 1 GW.
Over the past few years, Finergreen has had the opportunity to collaborate with a large number of players in this industry and has seen the market developing. Despite a difficult year in 2020, it is expected that more and more C&I sector activity will occur in the region soon.
 Several business models exist today in the MENA region that support the growth of solar systems for C&I clients. These include:
These models and regulations have been successful due to the regulatory mechanisms prevalent in the countries with an active C&I market. Self-consumption, for example, directly reduces energy bills by using solar energy produced by a PV plant installed on-site. The solar plant directly supplies a share of the client's electricity demand during sunlight hours and can even be augmented by using battery storage for a longer supply of electricity.
For its part, net metering is a billing mechanism whereby clients can inject excess solar energy into the grid and are compensated through energy credits or via net billing where the exported electricity is credited at a fixed and pre-determined tariff rate (typically lower than imported electricity price).  Usually, the PV plant is installed on rooftops, car ports, nearby ground within premises and are on-site.
Finally, wheeling is the transfer of electrical power via a utility’s transmission or distribution system between different grid or network service areas. For solar PV, the areas with strongest and most consistent solar irradiation are often geographically separate from the urban areas with maximum demand. Through wheeling, clients can benefit from the offset of energy bills by using solar energy produced by a plant off-site, at an additional wheeling fee on top of the solar tariff.
Numerous businesses have been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. With almost no to low revenues due to the lockdown and reduction of business activity, the main focus has been on cutting costs wherever possible. Solar projects give them the opportunity to significantly lower their electricity bills at a minimum cost (in a lease model).
In the current situation, financing a project fully through an EPC/ CAPEX model is challenging due to lack of available surplus cash and a leasing model is welcomed by many to quickly start realizing savings without investing upfront cash.
Projects costs have also been fairly volatile this year. If the costs of solar have been lowered this year thanks to technology progress, the production capabilities have been limited because of lockdown, with the order books of the main suppliers being quite full and high uncertainty regarding shipping conditions and costs.
Regarding timing, despite a few project awards and successful financial closures, for which the majority of the work was done prior to Covid-19 (e.g. Qatar, Abu Dhabi), some of the new programs that were to be tendered in 2020 have been postponed to 2021. For instance, the third round of REPDO in Saudi Arabia has been extended twice, while OPWP in Oman has postponed the tender closing date for Manah 1 and 2 projects by three months.
The energy demand of C&I customers has also been greatly reduced because of lockdown and the reduction of commercial activity. It has been reported that Covid-19 led to a 2% decline in global electricity demand, according to the IEA's 2020 Electricity Market Report. Given the uncertainty of electricity demand, potential clients may be reconsidering their plans to implement renewable energy projects in the short term. Moreover, in some countries, governments have reduced electricity tariffs during the crisis to provide some relief measures (e.g. Egypt) leading to less immediate incentives to invest in such projects at the moment.
In terms of development timelines, project activity has slowed down due to Covid-19 restrictions. Meeting clients, conducting site visits, and negotiating contracts in person has been more challenging. Moreover, during lockdown and subsequent periods, governmental organization and utilities involved in permitting have not been operating at full capacities and working hours, hence leading to delays and a backlog of work.
Finally, MENA countries have been severely impacted by the oil price crash, leading to increased country deficits and negative growth rates in 2020. Many countries have had their ratings and projected GDP growth rates revised downwards. This coupled with the political issues faced last year (demise of rulers in Kuwait and Oman, government change in Tunisia, Lebanon and Jordan), have delayed the renewable energy plans of the countries due to restructuring and re-strategizing of national budgets and plans.
Can we assume 2021 will only be a re-start of missed/postponed business opportunities initially scheduled for 2020? Beyond the economic profile of the region, which has significantly weakened over the last 12 months (downgrade of Oman, Lebanon, Turkey, Sharjah, etc.), we expect a catalyst effect of what has just been presented before. This is the result of an alignment in favor of the C&I: financing, regulations, and bankability.
Though a critical bottleneck in the development process of PV projects, financing sources are becoming more available and easier to process as a result of:
Also, regulations in different countries have evolved significantly, promising faster development of C&I markets. There are still some gaps in some specific countries or Emirates like Abu Dhabi, Oman, and Morocco, where laws are expected to evolve, but the base and framework for solid development already exist.
Finally, bankability is critical, especially with respect to the creditworthiness of off-takers considering contract durations. We expect a “flight to quality” on the development of the projects. This means a slowdown of the race to securing projects below par and more attention paid to:
Except in the utility scale sector where MENA is steadily growing in terms of projects awarded and installed capacity in the world every year, C&I has often been one step behind when compared to SE Asia or LatAm. The market took time to reach maturity and growth, with oil-based economies limiting the development pace of such projects. At a time where it is evident that the use of solar PV should be the trigger to unlock energy transition, MENA is expected to be as fast, innovative, and ambitious as it has always been on many other domains over the last decade.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/22/comtec-solar-subject-to-winding-up-petition-in-january/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,CHINA,HONG KONG",MAX HALL,"MARCH 22, 2021",Comtec Solar subject to winding up petition in January,"With solar developer and lithium-ion energy storage business Comtec Solar preparing for a rapid relocation to Jiangsu province to secure state funding, the company's board has opened up on the reasons which, presumably, explain why it lost its auditor this month.
Paris-based professional-services-company membership body Mazars walked away from Comtec on March 8, citing “professional risk associated with the audit.” Announcing the development the following week, the Comtec board said merely that the “legal proceeding” highlighted by Mazars “was immaterial as it only involved a very insignificant amount of money.”
The board on Sunday admitted it had breached the announcement rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange where it is listed and said the amount referred to was US$525,000 owed in loans and interest to Putana Ltd.
It emerged Putana filed a petition to wind up Comtec in January, at the Court of First Instance of the High Court of Hong Kong, in relation to the loans, half of which are due to mature on April 20 and the balance on July 20.
Comtec said the petition was not spotted until its auditor performed a regular check “a few days before the Chinese New Year holidays,” which began on February 12. The company said it then resolved the matter, with the winding-up petition withdrawn on March 10. The board explained the loans had not been addressed previously “owing to the change of some senior management staff of the company.”
The solar company on Sunday said its failure to report the winding-up petition previously, constituted “an inadvertent oversight of the announcement obligations of the rules,” and pledged to “take positive steps to strengthen its internal control policy to comply with its disclosure obligations under the listing rules.”
The revelation came three days after the company announced its intent to rapidly move its headquarters to Changzhou city, Jiangsu province, in return for RMB50 million (US$7.68 million) of public funds.
The developer will accept RMB10 million to cover its relocation costs, from Jiangsu Changzhou Tianning Economic Development Zone Management Committee and Changzhou Tianning Investment Service Center. The two local government entities will also commit to take at least RMB40 million equity in Comtec and the new subsidiary which will be created as a result: New Energy Intelligent Logistics Changzhou Ltd Co, under the terms of a strategic framework agreement signed between the three partners last week.
As part of the deal, Comtec will relocate by the end of the month.
In a separate announcement, made late in yesterday's session, Comtec said Kang Sun had resigned as independent non-executive director to spend more time on his other personal commitments. Sun sat on the audit, nomination and remuneration committees.
This copy was amended on 23/03/21 to include the update on Kang Sun.

pv magazine: A recent press release by Solarise Africa highlighted your commitment to developing new project pipelines and expediting a green Covid recovery in East Africa. How will expanding the PV footprint in Africa contribute to economic revival?
Patrick Huber: Our recent partnership with Centennial Generating Co will see new operations in Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia. We aim to bridge the financing hurdle and reduce dependability on an unstable power grid, significantly improving up-time and productivity.
As far as how these projects will help with economic revival, we know that economic development starts with modern energy access. Evidence shows that countries that invested the most in green stimulus in 2008 and 2009 successfully created jobs and boosted their economies. Pursuing low-carbon and climate-resilient growth is the best way to unlock lasting economic and social benefits. It has also been proven that companies committed to 100% renewable power have better new-profit margins and earnings than those without this commitment.
As you look to implement more solar projects in the East Africa region, are the conditions suitable for driving green energy adoption and expansion and supporting the call for an economic rebound?
PH: East African countries have made a lot of progress in creating an enabling environment for renewable energy expansion. For example in Rwanda, all PV components are exempt from VAT, and in Uganda and Tanzania PV models are exempt from VAT as well as import duties. East African countries are also committed to improving the ease of doing business, implementing various new reforms, and committing to over 90% electrification by 2030.
How would you summarize the impact of solar as a renewable and reliable energy source in East Africa?
PH: Power shortages cost African businesses 700 business hours every year–that is just under 90 business days. In Uganda, 82% of businesses experience power shortages every year. In Rwanda, it is 39% of companies and in Kenya, 89% of businesses experience power outages every year, and firms lose an average of 5% of the value of … total sales to electrical outages. Some individual firms report losing over 70% of their sales.
Solar power provides reliable energy and drastically decreases downtime, which means that previous time and opportunities lost due to power outages can now be spent doing business, making money, and rebuilding the economy.
How can implementing solar in farms, hospitals, supermarkets, hotels, game reserves, and schools grow the economy?
PH: We have seen tremendous advantages across all industries where our customers have implemented solar.
In agriculture, one of the region’s largest flower exporters secured a 61% reduction in energy costs by integrating solar energy. Apart from freeing up cashflow to be used in other growth areas, [an] organization improves its carbon footprint and increases its standing as [a] responsible corporate [citizen].
In healthcare, there are more than 98,000 healthcare facilities in the sub-Saharan [region], but only 28% of these facilities have access to reliable electricity. One of our solar installations powers an HIV-testing and treatment facility which uses energy-intensive freezers required for storing vaccines. By using solar and battery energy storage, the customer reduced its power costs while also ensuring the operation of the cold storage for vaccines which support the treatment of over 2,200 patients every month.
In the retail sector, we installed solar panels at one of the largest commercial buildings in Rwanda. Sustainable energy now provides reliable electricity that reduced its power costs by over 50%–a critical cost saving in one of the industries hit hardest by lockdowns.
Another industry that’s under tremendous financial strain due to Covid-19 is the tourism industry. We installed solar panels at a leading hotel in Rwanda, offsetting the need for diesel generators; again saving costs and generating reliable electricity.
Lastly, the education sector has also benefited from our solar projects in the region. We installed the first solar carport in Rwanda, at the largest private university in the country. These are just some of our projects, but all our solar installations reduce costs and improve productivity–two things that will be critical for the region to recover from the economic contraction.
As one of the African-continent developers, what do you have to say about managing debt vulnerability, particularly during the pandemic? And do you have some measures or solutions in place to tackle these challenges?
PH: The Covid-19 pandemic amplified debt vulnerabilities in the region. Higher debt levels, weaker debt affordability, and low buffers pose significant challenges. The cost of renewable energy has always been a huge hurdle for Africa to adopt clean energy at scale. This will be more pronounced in the current economic climate.
At Solarise Africa, we have solutions that manage this debt risk so that Africa doesn’t have to sacrifice its green energy expansion, something that we have seen will be fundamental to the continent’s recovery. By addressing this critical value-chain need, we can help keep green energy adoption–specifically solar energy–on track.
Together with our partners, we offer innovative full-service solutions that cover designing, building, financing, and maintaining solar installations. It requires minimal capital expenditure and has short payback periods that help our clients save money. Our innovative financing solutions unlock possibilities and empower our partners to thrive and actively drive Africa’s progress.

The 5 MW / 3.6 MWh power plant will be built in partnership with Mongolian EPC contractor MCS International LLC, Japanese ceramics company and network attached storage (NAS) provider NGK Insulators Ltd, which will provide its large-scale sodium-sulfur-based battery systems for the project. “NGK's NAS batteries are capable of storing electricity even in extremely cold and extremely hot environments and were suitable for the weather conditions in Mongolia,” Yuki Ichihara, of JGC Holdings' Group Development Management Department, told pv magazine.
“NGK believes that the order for this project was won as a result of strong evaluations of NAS batteries’ ability to offer a large capacity and long discharge time, along with NGK’s extensive delivery and long-term operational track records,” the Japanese battery provider said in a separate statement.
The plant will be located in Uliastai, in Mongolia's Zavkhan Province, and will come online in the spring of 2022, the company said.
The project is being financed by the Asian Development Bank and the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), which was established by the Japanese Ministry of Environment at the Asian Development Bank itself.
The tender for the project was launched by the Mongolian authorities in February 2020. It is part of the Upscaling Renewable Energy Sector Project, which aims to deploy 40.5 MW of solar and wind capacity in the country’s western and Altai-Uliastai regions.
Mongolia’s installed PV capacity stood at just 89 MW at the end of 2019, according to statistics published by the International Renewable Energy Agency. In 2017, Mongolia had to import around 20% of its necessary electricity.

“The bid submission closed on 22 December 2020 and attracted a total of 28 bid responses with a potential contracted capacity of approximately 5,117 MW,” the DMRE said in a statement. “The evaluation process has resulted in the selection of eight preferred bids totaling 1,845 MW and a further three eligible bids totaling 150 MW.”
The eight preferred bidders are: ACWA Power Project DAO; Karpowership SA Coega; Karpowership SA Richards Bay; Karpowership SA Saldanha; Mulilo Total Coega; Mulilo Total Hydra Storage; Oya Energy Hybrid Facility; and Umoyilanga Energy. The DoE said these special purpose vehicles submitted projects based on solar PV, wind, liquified natural gas (LNG) and battery storage without specifying the technologies promoted by each of the bidders.
The bidding prices range from ZAR 1,468 ($99.8) per MWh to ZAR 1,885 per MWh, with the average price at ZAR 1,575 per MWh. “These eight projects will inject a total private sector investment amount of R45 billion to the South African economy, with an average local content of 50% during the construction period,” the DMRE explained. “South African entity participation from these projects is 51% with black ownership at 41%.”
According to Chris Ahlfeldt, an energy specialist at Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services, around 60% of the tender capacity was awarded to several floating power plants fueled by LNG. “It’s difficult to understand how these floating power plants can compete on price and local content with clean energy projects,” he told pv magazine. “Hopefully, we’ll learn more about the bid amounts and terms if DMRE releases this information to the public soon.”
It would be helpful to learn how the solar PV, wind and battery projects competed on price with the three LNG projects, he added. “A 20 year PPA is a long contract term for a floating LNG plant, so it will be interesting to see if these projects can actually reach financial close considering the environmental and economic risk they create for the country.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/22/new-manufacturing-tech-for-16-06-efficient-mini-perovskite-solar-moduels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 22, 2021",New manufacturing tech for 16.06%-efficient mini perovskite solar modules,"A group of scientists from the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Taiwan University (NTU) has developed a new manufacturing process for mini perovskite solar modules that is claimed to overcome key bottlenecks in large-scale production.
“The levelized cost of electricity (LOCE) from a solar module includes power conversion efficiency, module lifetime and the production cost,” research co-author, Leeyih Wang, told pv magazine. “We think our study has provided a solution for all three factors, as the high-efficiency demonstration and greatly extended lifetime from our module can contribute to lower the LCOE.”
The manufacturing technique is based on a one-step spin coating method using sulfolane, which is a dipolar aprotic industrial solvent, commonly used in gas production and oil refining. “We introduce sulfolane as an additive in the perovskite precursor to convert the perovskite phase via a new reaction route, providing a large degree of flexibility to process crystalline perovskite layers with high uniformity on a large scale,” the scientists explained.
Adding sulfolane to the perovskite precursor, according to the researchers, extends the processing window from nine seconds to 90 seconds, forming highly crystalline, compact layers over a large area while being less dependent on the processing conditions. “Broadening the processing window in the antisolvent route is essential in transferring the process to industrial production for perovskite module fabrication,” co-author Hsinhan Tsai told pv magazine. “It allows the flexibility in up-scale process development without sacrificing the device performance.” Large-scale production can also benefit from the widened time window, allowing greater tolerance of manufacturing errors and environmental variations, he added.
Through the proposed manufacturing technique, the US-Taiwanese group was able to demonstrate a mini-module with a power conversion efficiency of 16.06% and an active area of 36.6 cm2. “More importantly, this is a method to greatly improve the production yield that can thus support high-rate production, which is an important factor for lowering the fabrication cost,” said researcher Wanyi Nie. The team was also able to fabricate a mini module with an active area of 36.6 cm2 and an efficiency of 17.58%.
The academics said they have also successfully tested their method by blading as well and believe the precursor can be adapted to industrial-scale fabrication tools like a roll-to-roll process.  “We currently only processed at the laboratory level,” said co-aouthor Hsin-Hsiang Huang. “The production line evaluation on perovskite solar cells via this new reaction route is ongoing.” He believes that more reproducible perovskite layers with high uniformities on a large scale can be realized.
The production process is described in the paper “A simple one-step method with wide processing window for high-quality perovskite mini-module fabrication,” published in Joule.

Strandline Resources, an emerging heavy mineral sands (HMS) developer, has inked a 15-year offtake agreement with Contract Power Australia, for energy from a hybrid gas and solar energy power station to be developed close to its proposed mine and mineral separation plant near Shark Bay in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia.
The Coburn Power Station to be built, owned and operated by Contract Power, will comprise 11 MW of solar generation, 4 MW of instantaneous dynamic battery support and 18 MW of low-emissions natural gas generation; its design is capable of supporting some 10 MW of average consumed power, with a maximum demand of 15 MW.
The now contracted power solution “enables Strandline to capture energy supply cost savings relative to the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)” for the mine, published in June 2020, said an ASX announcement by Strandline released in November 2020.
“We get a fair bit of sun in the Shark Bay region, so we’ve maximized our penetration of solar,” Strandline CEO and Managing Director Luke Graham told pv magazine Australia of the cost-optimized energy supply, which he says also “leverages the relatively low-cost LNG gas supply we have in WA”.

Graham says that over the mine’s expected 40-year life (which includes an initial 22.5 years of useable reserve with an extension case of a further 15 to 17 years), both Contract Power and Strandline Resources will be incentivized to further reduce costs by increasing the renewable component of the generation plant with the addition of wind turbines.
“That could take us to about 50% and a maximum of 60% renewable power for our mine site, which is a pretty awesome aspirational target,” says Graham who has been appointed to lead Strandline’s HMS operations in Australia and Tanzania, from exploration to development and production.
Strandline’s Coburn Heavy Mineral Sands Project was last year approved for a loan of up to $150 million by the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, on the basis that it will boost the Federal Government’s critical minerals agenda, and “benefit the local region to the tune of $922 million over 25 years”, the Federal Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia, Keith Pitt, said at the time.
Although Strandline’s main focus is to finalise its investment decision in what is expected to become one of the world’s largest mineral sands projects, being a greenfield project also allows the company to deploy solutions from the outset that “maximize our environmental, corporate and social responsibility”, says Graham.
Large-capacity bulldozers still relying on diesel fuel will be used to extract the ore, which will then be mixed into a slurry and pumped from the mine to processing facilities; once valuable materials have been separated, some 98% of the material will subsequently be pumped back to the mining void preceding progressive rehabilitation of the site.
Pumping accounts for the majority of the mine’s electricity needs, however, Graham says almost all other processes in the proposed mine will be automated and electrified; a mining camp for 200 workers will also draw from the power station — Graham anticipates employing an average of 150 direct workers during the mine’s long operational phase.
Strandline already has offtake agreements for its zircon and titanium product, with 20-25% going to China, and 75-80% earmarked for Europe and the US.
Zircon is used in making ceramics, such as tiles, and is applied in foundry work, castings and 3D printing; while titanium is primarily used in production of pigments used in paint, ink, ceramics, plastics, toothpaste and sunscreen, and is also applied as an extremely strong, light metal in aircraft manufacture – contributing to lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft that can take on longer non-stop routes.
In 24-hour operation of the Strandline Coburn Mineral Sands Project, “gas generation will be reduced daily and follow the required load generation that is not provided by solar”, says Mike Hall, Chief Operating Officer of Contract Power Group, a subsidiary of Pacific Energy, which is in turn owned by QIC (formerly Queensland Investment Corp), on behalf of its managed funds (which include the QIC Global Infrastructure Fund) and clients.
Pacific Energy also recently contracted juwi Renewable Energy Pty Ltd to construct a solar-diesel hybrid solution to help power Iluka’s Jacinth Ambrosia project in South Australia, the world’s largest supplier of zircon.

Contract Power has more than 30 years experience in tailoring power plants to the needs and available energy resources of mines and offgrid townships.
Hall told pv magazine Australia that “upwards of 90% of tenders currently released to the market have a renewables component” and that the past year or so has also seen “an acceleration of Build, Own and Operate (BOO) hybrid power stations”.
Among the other hybrid-energy-for-mining contracts awarded to or commenced by Contract Power over this period are Abra Power Station (10 MW gas, 6 MW solar and a 1 MW battery), powering a new lead-silver mining operation for Abra Mining; and the Tellus hazardous waste-cleaning operation at Sandy Ridge near Kalgoorlie in WA, where a 1.2 MW solar farm and a 350 kWh battery allow the site to operate on 100% renewable energy during daytime hours, integrating with 2 MW of diesel generation to take over at night.
“A further three existing customers with fossil fuel power stations are looking to introduce and integrate renewables,” says Hall. 
Once Strandline Resources reaches its final investment decision on the Coburn Heavy Mineral Sands Project, the mine will enter its estimated 18-month construction phase; and Contract Power will commence the 13- to 14-month-long construction of the power plant. “They’ll be ready well in advance of us needing power,” confirms Graham.
He adds that he sees the mining sector as being at the forefront of renewables integration: “We’re adopting renewable power solutions across the sector, and with Coburn being a greenfield mine, we can really leverage the latest in technology right from day one.”
