The research team created a catalyst using only iron, carbon, and nitrogen – materials that are cheap and readily available – and showed that it can be used to operate a fuel cell at high power. Their findings are published in the paper “High loading of single atomic iron sites in Fe–NC oxygen reduction catalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells,” published in nature catalysis. The scientists stated that around 60% of the cost of a single fuel cell is the platinum for the catalyst. “In lab tests, the team showed that a single-atom iron catalyst has performance approaching that of platinum-based catalysts in a real fuel cell system.” The team used a synthetic method called transmetallation to avoid forming iron clusters during synthesis. The academics are also cooperating with UK fuel cell catalyst manufacturer Johnson Matthey to test the catalyst in appropriate systems and hope to scale up the new tech in commercial production. “Our cheaper catalyst design should make this a reality, and allow deployment of significantly more renewable energy systems that use hydrogen as fuel, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and putting the world on a path to net-zero emissions,” they affirmed.
Ontario-based Hydrofuel Canada, a company delivering green ammonia and hydrogen, has completed an exclusive license agreement with Georgia Institute of Technology for their patent-pending Micro Ammonia Production System (MAPS) system “which enables high-yield, sustainable ammonia synthesis from air and water with unprecedented efficiency using a gas-phase electrochemical process.” The technology uses hollow hybrid plasmonic nanocages to create an electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis from nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O). The technology works under ambient temperatures and pressure in the gas- and liquid-phase system. Hydrofuel will combine MAPS with its Kontak Hydrogen from Ammonia Separation Modules. “Utilizing MAPS technology with renewable energy to produce cost effective green ammonia is a major development. Using that ammonia with Kontak's technology, which Hydrofuel has previously acquired, is a game changer,” wrote Hydrofuel Canada on Monday. Kontak's technology can release hydrogen from a dozen potential carrier molecules. Of the carriers, the highest storage capacity is anhydrous ammonia, with (17.3% hydrogen by weight) stored in liquid form like propane. “Kontak's patented reactor is the most effective method to date for releasing hydrogen.” The hydrogen is filtered and sent directly to a fuel cell or internal combustion engine. According to the company, these technologies produce “green NH3 using $.02/kWh electricity for as low as $220 a tonne, whereas fossil-fuel derived NH3 is currently selling at $1,500 to $2,000 a tonne.” The Canadian company adds that green hydrogen can be separated from this ammonia to sell at about $1.50 a kg. 
Norway's Aker Horizons, through its portfolio company Aker Clean Hydrogen, and Norwegian power company Statkraft have signed collaboration agreements to jointly explore green hydrogen and ammonia production opportunities in India and Brazil, targeting local steel and fertilizer industries. “With considerable renewable energy production and market activities in India and Brazil, Statkraft is well positioned to capture green hydrogen opportunities in these two huge and important energy markets. Developing such opportunities helps us grow our business and reduces greenhouse gas emissions in India and Brazil,” said Jürgen Tzschoppe, Statkraft's executive vice president for international power.
Researchers at the Clemson Nanomaterials Institute (CNI) and their collaborators from the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning (SSSIHL) in India said they discovered a novel way to combine curcumin, a substance in turmeric, and gold nanoparticles instead of platinum to create an electrode that “requires 100 times less energy to efficiently convert ethanol into electricity.” According to CNI, the discovery brings one step closer the replacement of hydrogen as a fuel cell feedstock. The researchers focused on the fuel cell's anode, where the ethanol or other feed source is oxidized. “Curcumin is used to decorate the gold nanoparticles to stabilize them, forming a porous network around the nanoparticles.” Researchers deposited the curcumin gold nanoparticles on the surface of the electrode at 100 times lower electric current than in previous studies.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the European Union and India should increase cooperation in the solar and green hydrogen sectors. Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, a multilateral conference taking place in New Delhi, Amitabh Kant, CEO of the government public policy think tank NITI Aayog, said: “India has the size and scale to become a leader in green technologies. The developed countries have not lived up to their promise of low-cost finance.” Raisina Dialogue attendees also discussed hydrogen. Norway is looking for hydrogen opportunities in the subcontinent. Vegard Frihammer, CEO of Greenstat Norway, told the Statesman on Sunday that the company wanted to explore options in the country's industry and maritime sector.
UAE-government-owned renewable energy company Masdar and Egypt-based investment and development company Hassan Allam Utilities have signed two memorandums of understanding with Egyptian state-backed organizations to develop green hydrogen production plants in the Suez Canal Economic Zone and on the Mediterranean coast. The two companies aspire to take a leading role in developing green hydrogen production plants in the region, targeting an electrolyzer capacity of 4 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and an output of up to 480,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. Last week, AMEA Power, an Emirati renewable project developer, and Egyptian authorities signed an MOU to produce 390,000 tonnes of green ammonia per annum over two phases in Ain Sokhna, Egypt.
Last week, French green hydrogen producer Lhyfe said France's financial markets authority AMF had cleared the way for the company's initial public offering on the Euronext stock market in Paris after approving its registration document, Reuters reported. Lhyfe, which raised €10 million from Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co earlier this month, is developing an offshore hydrogen production facility connected to a floating wind turbine. The project, reportedly the first of this type globally, should enter the test phase by September.
Clear Hydrogen UK announced an expansion of its agreement with Canada's Proton Technologies. “In 2021, CHUK's founders invested CAD 3.7 million in Proton to obtain a 20 tonne per day production license for use in the UK and Ireland. The expansion announced today is 250 times larger, giving an implied total license value as high as CAD 925 million for 5,000 tonnes per day,” wrote the company on Monday.

Shizen Malaysia will conduct the feasibility study for the project and will cooperate directly with the consortium's largest shareholder, Malaysian real estate manager Nusa Baiduri Sdn Bhd. “A feasibility study of floating solar equipment will be conducted from March 15, 2022, for a maximum duration of 12 months, and following a favorable result, the floating solar facility of 150 MW will be constructed in a sequence of Phase 1 and later Phase 2,” Shizen said in a statement.
The facility will sell power under unspecified conditions to the local utility Syarikat Air Melaka Bhd (SAMB).
“Should the feasibility study yield positive results, the completion of the 150 MW floating solar project would mean Malaysia having one of the first and largest floating solar plant in South East Asia. This is an initiative to support the state government towards green technology, and zero carbon by 2030,” said SAMB CEO Abdu Rashid Abdul Rahman. “Floating solar is an exciting opportunity and we can clearly see the benefits of our contribution to the water utility sector across Malaysia,” said Shizen Malaysia CEO Alvin Koh. As such, the company will continue to focus on materializing these projects, he added.
Shizen Malaysia has developed renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 200 MW in Malaysia to date. The country's largest floating PV plant is a 13 MW array deployed in the state of Selangor on the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The plant is selling power to local utility TNB under a 21-year PPA. The project’s levelized cost of energy is MYR 0.21608 ($0.051).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/26/ionic-liquid-based-perovskite-solar-cell-with-22-86-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 26, 2022",Ionic liquid-based perovskite solar cell with 22.86% efficiency,"A Swiss-Japanese research group has utilized ionic liquids (ILs) with halide anions as additives to improve the performance and stability of a perovskite solar cell. Ionic liquids are considered a valid and greener alternative to organic solvents due to their lower volatility and flammability, as well as to their wide liquid-state window.
Their work built on previous research showing that ILs doping containing iodide anions or cations with fluorous chains did not influence the overall 3D structure of perovskite films, with the stability of the solar cells being increased by the formation of the hydrophobic surface. “As ILs are gaining increased popularity as additives for perovskite solar cells because of their attractive physical properties, such as non-volatility and high thermal and electrochemical stability, the chemical mechanism of the passivation process is an urgent issue that has been long overdue in being tackled,” the scientists explained.
Three different ILs, ([C1CNmim]Cl, [C3CNmim]Cl, and [(C3CN)2im]Cl), were paired with a chloride anion and utilized as additives for a perovskite precursor solution known as (Cs0.08FA0.8MA0.12)Pb(I0.88Br0.12)3. Chloride salts were employed for the first time in the chloride anion to stabilize the perovskite crystal lattice. The three resulting pervoskite films, according to the academics, exhibited improved uniformity and clear grain morphology with bigger crystal size compared to reference films without ILs.
The films were integrated in a solar cell architecture consisting of a a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a titanium dioxide (TiO₂) layer, a Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, the perovskite layer, a hole transporting material made of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), and a layer made of gold (Au). “For all PSC devices, the perovskite absorber layer was prepared via a one-step spin-coating method,” the scientists emphasized. “All of the perovskite films were treated with PEAI prior to the deposition of the HTMs, a recent but widely used technique that results in increased performance.”
The cells were tested under standard illumination conditions and the device based on [C3CNim]Cl achieved the highest power conversion efficiency of 22.86%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V, a short-circuit current of 24.03 (mA cm−2), and a fill factor of 0.818. The reference cell without ILs, by comparison, achieved an efficiency of 20.94%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.09 V, a short-circuit current of 24.31 of mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.793. The other two cells fabricated with [C1CNim]Cl and [(C3CN)2im]Cl achieved efficiencies of 21.82% and 22.45, respectively.
With the champion cell, the Swiss-Japanese team fabricated a mini module with a size of 7 cm × 6.5 cm that showed an efficiency of 20.9%, which compares to 18.54% in a reference module without the IL-based device. The panel also showed remarkable stability, with around 95% of its initial efficiency being retained after 1,000 hours of operation.
Their findings are presented in the paper “Halide exchange in the passivation of perovskite solar cells with functionalized ionic liquids,” published in Cell Reports Physical Science. The research group is formed by scientists from the University of Tokyo and Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL).

The European development finance institution (EDFI) on Thursday revealed Redavia had settled a $2 million loan it took out in 2018 to back its expansion in Ghana and had subsequently signed for the new package to back further expansion in Ghana as well as in Kenya.
Redavia supplies modular, standardized solar systems to commercial and industrial clients in East and West Africa, with customers leasing the systems from the German company and reaping the benefits of reliable, clean, affordable electricity.
EDFI ElectriFI said the company had installed 3.4 MWp of solar capacity for 41 commercial customers in Ghana since 2018.

A joint venture between state-owned utility Western Power and local engineering firm Power Research and Development will see the town of Walpole receive Western Australia’s first microgrid with pumped hydro as its storage cornerstone.
On Thursday, work began on the 1.5 MW pumped hydro facility, which will use two farm dams to provide 30 MWh of storage. The “mini” pumped hydro facility is slated to be operational by the second half of 2023.
It will connect into the state’s islanded South West Interconnected System (SWIS) network and work as part of a microgrid, providing power to just over 500 local customers, Western Power said. In the event of a network disruption, the microgrid will be able to work independently.
The pumped hydro facility will be able to provide enough power to supply Walpole for up to two days, much longer than a typical battery solution. Western Power also said the facility will be powered by solar panels and batteries “making it self-sufficient.”
“This project, despite being on a smaller scale, will be used as a template for other areas in the state, and possibly nationally and internationally,” WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said.
Earlier this month, Power Research and Development was awarded $2 million as part of the state government’s Clean Energy Future Fund to advance the project.
The pumped hydro solution, which stores energy by pumping water uphill when renewables are abundant and cheap before releasing it downhill when needed, will ultimately not only store renewable energy but also safeguard the regional town against power outages.
Situated on the southern tip of the state, Walpole sits at the end of a 125-kilometre-long feeder line that is exposed to storms, lightning, bushfires, animals and other disruptive elements.
The pumped hydro solution will mitigate up to 80% of outages experienced in the town though, according to the state government. The plan for the microgrid is to offer this vastly improved reliability at no additional cost to businesses or the community.
Western Power and Horizon Power, both government owned entities, have pioneered a number of microgrid projects in the state, which has long been challenged by connecting its regional populations across vast, harsh landscapes. The utilities have found not only a cleaner but also a more economic solution in deploying renewable microgrids and standalone solutions.
In February, Western Power switched on its largest renewable energy microgrid to date in the coastal town of Kalbarri. It is powered by 1 MW of feed-in from residential rooftop solar, a 1.6 MW wind farm and backed by a 5 MW/2 MWh battery energy storage system.
“Our project has new and clever technology; but generating power from two farm dams in Walpole is inspired by the earliest AC hydro power plant, built in 1892. It is still running today as a source of clean, renewable energy,” Power Research and Development Director Colin Stonehouse said.
“We must be onto something good because the project has drawn on some of the leading suppliers in the world for its equipment and without exception, they have all wanted to be involved and been very generous with their help.”

The system is south-oriented, not west-east oriented as is usually recommended for vertical installations due to topographical restrictions, the ISEP said in a statement. The project owner is Nihonmatsu Community Energy.
The solar modules for the facility were supplied by German manufacturer Luxor Solar, which provided n-type heterojunction panels for the project. The vertical mounting system was provided by German specialist Next2Sun. The array design was adapted to comply with domestic wind speed standards. Ground and bearing capacity surveys were also conducted to ensure sufficient resistance to strong winds.

The distance between the panel rows ranges from 8 to 10 meters and the agricultural surface within the rows will be utilized by local livestock farmers as pasture.
Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) recently released new guidelines to develop and build ground-mounted agrivoltaic facilities in a bid to increase the presence of such projects in the land-scarce country.
According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 200 MW of grid-connected agrivoltaic projects were in operation in Japan by the end of September. The projects cover a total surface area of around 181.6 hectares and they are spread across the entire country.
*The article was updated on April 29 to specify that the project owner is Nihonmatsu Community Energy.

The company's patented storage technology uses just saltwater as the storage medium and is described as a flow battery that is able to independently amend power (kW) and energy (kWh) capacity. The proposed solution is also said to be low-cost, highly scalable and sustainable, as it uses only water and table salt, with its storage capacity being expandable by just adding water reservoirs or using larger tanks.
The battery system utilizes three storage tanks, one with fresh water, one with concentrated salt water and one with diluted salt water, and also relies on membrane stacks. During the charging phase, the diluted salt water is split into concentrated salt water and fresh water in the membrane stack and stored separately. The separation is achieved through electrodialysis (ED), which is a separation process in which charged membranes and electrical potential differences are used to separate ionic species from an aqueous solution and other uncharged components.

In the discharging phase, the two streams are combined and the resulting energy is converted to electricity with the help of the membrane stack through reverse electrodialysis (RED), which is a technology to generate electricity from the salinity difference between two solutions, for example, seawater and river water.
“AquaBattery’s solution could provide virtually unlimited storage capacity from eight hours up to days, weeks or even seasonally,” reads a statement from the Imperial College London, with which the Dutch start-up is cooperating. “The fund will provide around €2.5 million in grant funding to AquaBattery, with options for direct equity investment of up to €15 million depending on their needs. The grant will enable the team to speed up R&D and product development and bring forward commercialization of AquaBattery to 2025 or earlier.”

India’s Borosil Renewables has announced the signing of a binding offer for 100% equity in Interfloat Group, Europe’s largest solar glass manufacturer. With this acquisition, Borosil’s solar glass output will grow 66% to 750 tonnes per day (TPD).
The Indian manufacturer currently has a solar glass production capacity of 450 TPD in India, with exports comprising about 16.1% of overall sales. It anticipates attractive future growth in exports to Europe and the USA on the back of an expected rise in the production of solar modules in these markets.
The acquisition of Interfloat will make a broader range of solar glass available to Borosil Renewables’ expanded customer base in Europe. Besides, “Borosil’s expertise in achieving high efficiency in the manufacturing process to enhance throughput and lower costs will bring economies of scale to Interfloat’s expansion and manufacturing plans while reducing the carbon footprint of its European operations,” read a Borosil statement.
Interfloat Group consists of GMB Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg GmbH (GMB), which has a production plant with a current capacity of 300 TPD near Berlin, and Liechtenstein-based Interfloat Corporation, well known as a supplier to the European glass market. Interfloat has been servicing customers in Europe for close to 40 years and has deep-rooted relationships with the glass trade in the region.
Pradeep Kheruka, executive chairman of Borosil Renewables, said, “This acquisition of [Interfloat Group] moves us closer to our vision of being the most customer-centric company in the world. We believe that by leveraging the existing synergies and several complementary skill sets offered by the two companies, we will be able to serve our customers better.”
Christian Kern, Interfloat chairman and former Austrian chancellor, said, “Borosil Renewables, a worldwide innovation leader with a focus on green production of solar panels, is a huge gain for Interfloat and the production in Brandenburg. In such difficult times, when the European industry suffers from soaring gas prices, a strong international partner will ensure the European production of clean energy.”
Kern will remain on the board of Interfloat.
Borosil is currently expanding its PV glass production capacity in India to 1,000 TPD by September this year. It plans to further grow the capacity to 1,550 TPD by the end of 2023-24, and 2,100 TPD by the end of 2024-25.
The manufacturer will also invest in increasing the capacity at GMB’s Europe plant to 500 TPD by 2023 from the current 300 TPD.
Thus, with about 2,600 TPD manufacturing capacity, Borosil Renewables will be able to supply solar glass for more than 15 gigawatts of solar modules from 2025 while de-risking production from a single location.
“With the capacity expansions planned in India and Europe in the near future, we expect to enhance the reliability of our supply chains for our customers,” said Kheruka. “On this journey, our unremitting efforts shall remain focused as always on reducing the overall carbon footprint of our operations.”

In a fresh take on the solar car concept, a team of scientists from Sydney’s north will test printed organic photovoltaic panels by embarking on an 84-day journey around Australia.
The team plans to charge an electric Tesla vehicle (EV) by unrolling 18 flexible panels beside the car forming an off-grid charging system. The organic solar cells being deployed have been printed on laminated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic by a printer formerly used for wine labels.
The 18-meter long ultralight and ultraflexible strips are similar in thickness and appearance to a chip packet, the university team has said. The project will see the technology’s performance and durability tested in the real world, while also offering the team an opportunity to educate along the way.
The Charge Around Australia project is set to embark in September and is a partnership between the UK company Charging Around Britain Ltd and the University of Newcastle’s Centre for Organic Electronics, where the printed solar cell technology was developed by Professor Paul Dastoor and his team.

“This is actually an ideal testbed to give us information about how we would go about using and powering technology in other remote locations, for example, in space,” Professor Dastoor told Reuters about the project.
The main challenges for printed organic photovoltaics are efficiency and durability, the Charge Around Australia project notes. It says extensive economic modeling has found that even with modest device efficiency and lifetimes, large area oriented solar technology can compete with coal-generated power.
It says the projected efficiency of a pilot-scale installation of the technology is around 1%–2% with a lifetime between one and two years and for manufacture at scale, this would correspond to a cost of electricity as low as $0.88 per kWh.

The university team says its technology can be manufactured at a production cost of less than $10 per square meter and can rapidly be produced, with commercial-scale equipment capable of printing kilometers of material a day.
“No other renewal energy technology can be manufactured as quickly. The low cost and speed at which this technology can be deployed is exciting as we need to find solutions, and quickly,” Professor Dastoor said.
Over 99% of the panels are made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, for which the Newcastle team is currently looking into recycling processes. “Our hope is that we can separate the outer PET layers and reuse them to make new panels with minimal processing,” Professor Dastoor said.
The technology has already been deployed in the form of a solar arbour in Sydney’s Lane Cove, which opened in June 2020.
The low-cost, lightweight, flexible solar technology could hold promise for a range of applications including disaster relief and recovery; retractable recharging systems for electric vehicles, caravans, camping and the defense industry; floating covers for dams and pools; yacht sails; smart blinds for residential and high-rise buildings; greenhouse covers and more, the Newcastle University team have said.
In the Charge Around Australia project, the team is aiming to dispel “range anxiety” around electric vehicles and prove how efficient solar technology can be at car charging.

Exponential growth of PV installations continues in the US and so will the growth in PV panel waste streams. According to the Solar Futures Study conducted by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), solar could account for as much as 40% of the nation’s electricity supply by 2035 and 45% by 2050.
To reach these levels, solar deployment will need to grow by an average of 30 GW each year between now and 2025 and then double that between 2025 and 2030—four times its current deployment rate—to total 1,000 GW of solar deployed by 2035. That’s a lot of solar panels that would start being retired from service even before 2050. Needless to say, a lot of people–including 7-year old Neil— are concerned about what will happen to solar modules at the end of their life. That concern is real and growing, and is the subject of many studies around the world.

To begin this work, however, researchers need end-of-life data for solar modules. For example, they need to know how many solar modules will be retired this year, what will happen to them when they are retired, how their retirement affects the flow of PV materials, and at what rate will solar modules be retired in the future. To this end, The NREL researchers have developed the PV in the Circular Economy (PV ICE) modeling tool, which attempts to model the flow of PV materials over the next several decades. It also addresses the question of whether it is better to build more durable modules that last longer before needing replacement, or shorter-lived, fully recyclable modules. And it looks at how the evolution of PV technology, like thinner panels or new materials, may play into a more circular economy.
“There is much interest in making PV, an already clean energy source, fully sustainable economically and environmentally,” said Silvana Ovaitt, an NREL PV reliability researcher. “People jump to recycling as the solution, but for a product that is supposed to last more than 30 years—something more like a roof than a cell phone—that puts a big delay into the stream of recycled material. This gives us time to proactively plan for effective collection and recycling of modules. But it also points to the importance of alternate pathways of circularity for PV materials.”
PV ICE uses the latest data from the PV industry to model the flow of PV materials over the next several decades, helping predict the effects of different market trends, technological developments, and government policies.
Modeling today’s modules
Developed by a small team in NREL’s PV Reliability Group, the open-source tool consists of two main pieces. The first piece is a set of data files that collect the key properties of today’s solar modules. And it makes predictions on future modules, including types and quantities of materials, expected lifetimes, and power conversion efficiencies, among others.
PV technology has evolved rapidly and continues to do so. So this ‘average’ silicon module also needs to evolve to accurately capture the materials going into and coming out of the field. I started by looking at market share over time for different types of cell and module designs and created averages of what a silicon module looks like from 1995 through 2030. I drew component material and module data from a number of different sources—industry and literature—to track cell and module changes. This technique could also be applied to a single manufacturer’s bill of materials, though the PV module industry hasn’t offered this type of materials transparency to date, said Heather Mirletz, a Ph.D. student at Colorado School of Mines who helped develop PV ICE.
Modeling future modules and flow of materials
The second piece of PV ICE is modeling how these modules and the materials they contain will move through the PV life cycle. This includes projections of how many solar modules will be installed in future years and assumptions about key processes, such as manufacturing efficiencies or yields and rates of failure. It also models the decisions of stakeholders and how these decisions might modify the flow of materials.
By varying process efficiencies and stakeholder decisions, PV ICE enables researchers to explore how improved reliability or different circular pathways—such as repair, reuse, remanufacturing, or recycling—could affect how much retired module material is landfilled and how much can be recaptured to help deploy more PV modules. The result is a detailed model of how materials enter, move through, and potentially exit a circular PV economy.
“This tool is unique because it brings the PV and the sustainability communities together in an interdisciplinary approach; we capture real-life industry practices like bifaciality, merchant tail, project lifetime, and degradation. It goes beyond a first-approximation approach of simple material-flow analysis,” said Silvana Ovaitt, a member of the PV ICE development team.
For example, the PV ICE team found that several previous predictions had overestimated the rate at which today’s modules will fail and require replacement. Field data and longer-term contracts suggest modules are lasting longer. Updating this assumption in the PV ICE tool revealed that the volume of PV module waste will grow more slowly and arrive later than previously predicted.

“Our sensitivity analyses show that pre-2050 life cycle wastes are most sensitive to module lifetime and reliability,” Mirletz said. “Virgin material demands are most sensitive to manufacturing yields. Circular economy pathways—’reduce, reuse, recycle’—are in order of impact, and our sensitivity results reflect and reinforce this ranking.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/26/auditor-of-solar-developer-issues-disclaimer-on-2021-figures/,"FINANCE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",MAX HALL,"APRIL 26, 2022",Auditor of solar developer issues disclaimer on 2021 figures,"The auditor of Chinese solar developer Shunfeng International has issued a disclaimer on the financial results it has signed off for last year.
BDO Limited audited the 2021 numbers published by the developer on Thursday but repeated a cautionary note related to the sale of 11 solar project companies during 2020, for which Shunfeng recorded a loss on disposal of CNY 31.9 million ($4.87 million) during that year.
The professional services firm stated: “During our audit of [Shunfeng's] 2020 consolidated financial statements, the directors of the company were unable to grant us the access to the books and records and the relevant information of the 11 target companies because the 11 target companies were no longer subsidiaries of the group, and management of the 11 target companies denied the group’s directors, and our, access to the books and records and other information of the 11 target companies.” As a result, the auditor said it could not fully confirm the 2020 figures, nor the numbers for last year, which would require complete 2020 statistics for year on year comparatives.
That meant, BDO stated, in the audited figures published by Shunfeng: “We do not express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the group because we have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence.”
The developer published its 2021 figures with the statement: “Save (i) the amendments to note 1 (b) to the consolidated financial statements (‘basis of preparation') and (ii) the additions of paragraphs headed ‘scope of work of BDO Limited' and ‘extract of the independent auditor’s report,' the annual results contained in the 2021 unaudited results announcement [published on March 31] are the same as the 2021 audited annual results which are set out as below.”
Those amendments to note 1 (b), however, included the fact an order has now been issued by the Changzhou Intermediate People's Court of Jiangsu province freezing the assets of Shunfeng's Xinjiang Tianli business in a move which will pause the proposed sale of four solar projects with 132 MW of generation capacity that is set to generate CNY 890 million. The freezing order came at the behest of two investors who backed a 2015 corporate bond and are claiming payment from the developer.
Other details revealed in the note 1 (b) amendments included the amount of overdue and payable borrowings listed by Shunfeng had risen, since the end of March, from CNY 853 million to CNY 886 million and that a proposed sale of seven solar project companies will now take place for CNY 538 million, rather than the CNY 605 million previously stated.
Shunfeng revealed the litigation lodged against it on May 20 by China Development Bank was in connection with a loan payment of CNY 22.2 million and the developer's previous confidence an agreement would be reached over that obligation before May has now simply become confidence of reaching an agreement.
The company stated the settlement made at the end of last year with backer Chongqing Future Investments, and reported on March 31 as amounting to CNY 17.1 million, had also included interest of CNY 145,000, and another change in the amended note published on Thursday was that the remaining cash due to the developer from the forced sale of nine solar companies is now expected by April next year, rather than by the end of this year.
Shunfeng repeated publication of the 2021 figures on Friday, with the stock market ticker indicating headlines in Thursday's document had been replaced but pv magazine could not spot any difference in headline content in the more recent document.
This copy was changed on 26/04/22 to include today's yuan-dollar exchange rate.
