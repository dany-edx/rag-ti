During the 10th Foro Solar show, organized by the Spanish PV association UNEF last week, Spanish Ecological Minister Teresa Ribera said that the solar sector will continue driving innovation and industrial employment while supporting the collective efforts to address decarbonization challenges, including the integration of the electrical supply chain. She also noted the necessity of reforming the electricity market, an issue not prominently discussed at the forum.
Despite political changes proposed by the right-winged party Vox, which includes continued fossil fuel use and reversing bans on gasoline and diesel cars, attendees at the forum did not express significant concerns about a change of government.
The distributed generation segment was a popular topic at the event, with the potential to add between 1.7 GW and 1.8 GW of capacity this year. However, this represents a 50% to 60% decrease compared to 2022, which some analysts view as a natural adjustment given the absence of historic electricity price highs and the impact of inflation on household purchasing power.
Joan Groizard, general director of the Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy (IDAE), said that battery storage will play a central role in the distributed generation segment in the near future.
Although economic feasibility currently hinders its implementation, we anticipate a trend similar to self-consumption, which initially appealed to early adopters but has since become widely adopted, he said.
“We are going to have a real problem, market congestion,” said Franc Comino, general director of Sonnen Ibérica. “There is a lot to do at the regulatory level for batteries to penetrate the market, since the market is going to need them. Regulation must be opened to empower the end customer so that they can participate in the market.”
Large-scale storage is facing challenges as there are 15 GW of standalone storage projects and 1.5 GW in hybrid systems with renewables currently in the pipeline. Spain's energy strategy, known as PNIEC, aims for 22 GW of storage by 2030, but there is a lack of clear market signals.
Beatriz Corredor, the president of Red Eléctrica, urged the government to reform the electricity sector to enable faster development of the transportation network.
“Without transmission, there is no transition,” she said. “We encounter a difficulty in being able to deploy network infrastructure. We need electrical planning.” She also pointed out that “Spain is the country with the lowest percentage of curtailment in the world.”
During the second day's opening session, Rocío Prieto, director of energy at the National Markets and Competition Commission, noted the need to strike a balance between security and flexibility in the energy sector, regardless of political changes. She also announced the signing of an intra-border cost-sharing agreement with the French regulator to facilitate interconnection.
In the closing speech, José Donoso, general director of UNEF, said that Spain is uniquely positioned with a competitive economic advantage in facing the third industrial revolution. He emphasized the importance of fair remuneration and regulation for the sector's future.
He said that 23 GW of ground mounted PV capacity has just been reached, and 5,550 MW of self-consumption.
“We are in a scenario that 10 years ago we could not even dream of, we are building a new reality,” he said.

Beijing-based Sol-Bright Technology, the world’s largest supplier of automatic robotic cleaning systems (ARCS) for solar panels, has introduced its Gen.6 Robot for utility-scale solar projects in India.
The Gen.6 ARCS features a lightweight design, an aluminum frame to minimize corrosion, and curvilinear body to withstand high winds.
“The robot uses gear transmission, unlike the chain and sprocket mechanism used conventionally. It provides four different levels of protection. Cleaning efficiency is more than 99.5%. Availability is also more than 99%,” Kumar Shailendra, country head for Sol-Bright Technologies India, told pv magazine. “So, if you have bought 100 robots, out of 100 only one robot will go under breakdown at one point of time.”
Shailendra said Sol-Bright Technology has shipped solar panel cleaning robots for around 17 GW of PV projects around the world.
The robot uses a roller brush rotating at a speed of 130±10 rpm to dry-clean the panels. The Gen.6 ARCS measures 2,500 mm x 418 mm x 238 mm.
“The robot can handle land undulations up to 15 degrees,” said Shailendra. “The torsional structure allows it to twist from zero to forty degrees while walking.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/09/eu-council-adopts-new-renewable-energy-directive/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 9, 2023",EU Council adopts new renewable energy directive,"This morning the European Council in Brussels announced it had adopted a suite of measures under the banner of the Renewable Energy Directive which is part of legislation, passed in June, meaning all European Union (EU) member states must contribute to the EU’s common goal of 45% renewable energy use by the end of the decade.
The new rules aim to target sectors where renewable energy integration has been “slower,” the EU Council press release states, including transport, industry and buildings. Some sector rules include mandates while others include options.
For transport, the member states can opt to aim for a binding target of 14.5% reduction of greenhouse gas intensity in the use of renewables by 2030, or a binding share of at least 29% of renewables within the final consumption of energy by 2030, the press release states.
For industry, member states will increase renewable energy use by 1.5% per annum and also “have the possibility” to discount the contribution of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) by 20%. They can do this if their national contribution to the binding overall EU target meets their expected contribution, or their share of hydrogen from fossil fuels consumed is no more than 23% in 2030 and 20% in 2035.
The new rules for buildings, heating and cooling stipulate there is an “indicative target” of at least 49% target of renewable energy use in buildings by the end of the decade. The press release states that targets for heating and cooling would “gradually increase.”
Permitting procedures for renewable energy projects will also be sped up, with their deployment “fast-tracked” to help achieve the targets. Member states will identify areas worthy of acceleration and renewable energy projects will undergo a “simplified” and “fast permit-granting” process. The renewable energy projects will also be presumed to be of “overriding public interest” which will “limit the grounds of legal objections to new installations.”
The directive also strengthens the sustainability criteria for the use of biomass energy while aiming to reduce the risk of “unsustainable” bioenergy production. “Member states will ensure that the cascading principle is applied, with a focus on support schemes and with due regard to national specificities,” the press release states.
Spanish Acting Minister for the Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera, described the new rules as a “step forward” that allow the EU to pursue its climate targets in a “fair, cost-effective and competitive way.”
The “general context” created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in energy prices across the EU, which has highlighted the need to accelerate energy efficiency and increase the use of renewable energy, the original European Council documents state.
“In order to achieve the long-term objective of an energy system that is independent of third countries, the Union should focus on accelerating the green transition and ensuring an emission-reducing energy policy that reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels and that promotes fair and affordable prices for Union citizens and undertakings in all sectors of the economy.”
In March all member states in the European Parliament voted in support of the measure except Hungary and Poland voting against and the Czech Republic and Bulgaria abstaining.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/09/integrating-sky-images-global-solar-irradiance-into-solar-forecasting-algorithms/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,NEW MEXICO,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 9, 2023","Integrating sky images, global solar irradiance into solar forecasting algorithms","A research group in the United States has created a solar forecasting methodology that utilizes a combination of infrared (IR) images and global solar irradiance measurements.
The scientists claim that the novel approach is able to improve solar nowcasting and intra-hour forecasting, while being applicable to PV real-time markets and the optimization of energy dispatch into microgrids.
“Sky imager is more expensive than regular visible light all-sky imagers, but it can also approximate the height of clouds, so it is a low-cost alternative to a ceilometer,” the research's corresponding author, Guillermo Terrén-Serrano, told pv magazine, noting that the method is suitable for PV systems of any size. “Ceilometers cost around $20,000, and our method costs less than $2,000. Our system includes a radiometric infrared camera, data logger, high-resolution solar tracker, pyranometer, outdoor computer, weatherproof case, visible light fisheye, weather sensors and camera lenses.”
Visible light cameras are often used for ground-based sky images, helping PV models to react to cloud conditions. However, the sun saturates the pixels in those cameras, destroying information that could increase the performance of a solar forecast. Therefore, IR cameras are alternatively used, as they reduce the sun’s saturation.
IR-based forecasting, however, has issues of its own, such as a lower signal-to-noise ratio, among others. That is partly due to solar irradiance, which might distort images under some conditions. “This investigation introduces efficient data processing methods to remove the deterministic component of the global solar irradiance in pyranometer measurements and infrared images,” the paper explains.
In order to remove the effect of the irradiance, the novel method first uses machine learning to identify biases that might affect the clear sky index (CSI). As the CSI quantifies the effects of clouds on global solar irradiance (GSI), more accurate findings in the first measurement result in more precise findings in the second.
Then, another algorithm is used to classify the sky conditions of the IR images into four – clear sky, cumulus clouds, stratus clouds, and nimbus clouds. Using this classification, the algorithm further interacts with the GSI data and calculates the effect of the irradiance on the image, effectively clearing it for forecasting.
In addition, the algorithm removes the effect of dirt on the camera. “This investigation assumes that a sky imager will not be cleaned daily during operation,” the research group explained. “For this situation, a method based on image processing is proposed to remove the radiation emitted by debris on the outdoor germanium camera window from IR images.”
The algorithms were trained and tested with data from Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the United States, which has an arid semi-continental climate, with minimal rain. “Future research is required to develop a global model valid for any location,” they emphasize.
The researchers concluded that the proposed method is efficient and said that low-cost radiometric IR cameras can potentially be a substitute for expensive ceilometers in the future.
“Adequate data processing reduces learning algorithm complexity when implemented in the application of solar forecasting,” they said. “Complexity reduction increases the accuracy of the prediction and reduces the required computing time for making a prediction. This is of particular importance in real-time applications such as nowcasting and intra-hour forecasting of solar energy.”
Their findings are introduced in the study “Processing of global solar irradiance and ground-based infrared sky images for solar nowcasting and intra-hour forecasting applications,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The researchers are from the University of California Santa Barbara and the University of New Mexico.

The Norwegian electrolyzer has completed a short-term validation, including a 96-hour baseload run. The Japanese one is undergoing long-term validation under real-world conditions, covering aspects such as performance, operations, start-ups, shutdowns, gas quality, safety, and digital control integration.
“The objectives include performance, operations, startups, shutdowns, gas quality, safety, and digital control integration,” said Mitsubishi Power.
Mitsubishi Power plans to incorporate the design of these single-stack pressurized alkaline electrolyzers into the Advanced Clean Energy Storage (ACES Delta) project in Delta, Utah. This is a green hydrogen initiative in collaboration with Chevron, with commercial operations set to begin in 2025.
The facility will use renewable energy and store hydrogen in two 150 GWh capacity salt caverns. The electrolyzers were supplied by Norway's HydrogenPro AS, which previously worked with Mitsubishi Power to construct one of the world's largest single-stack high-pressure alkaline electrolyzers.
“This order shows our confidence in HydrogenPro’s electrolyzer system due to work begun last year with HydrogenPro to construct and validate one of the world’s largest single stack high-pressure alkaline electrolyser systems in Norway,” the Japanese company said in a statement released at the time.
HydrogenPro's electrolyzer has an output of 1,100 Nm3/hour of hydrogen at normal current density, equivalent to 100 kg of pure hydrogen per hour, setting a new industry standard.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/09/recipe-for-expansion/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,INDIA",,"OCTOBER 9, 2023",Recipe for expansion,"From pv magazine 09/23
In 2021, India’s annual solar manufacturing capacity stood at 14 GW. While superficially an impressive figure, much of this capacity was sub-scale and technologically obsolete, with Chinese imports meeting more than 80% of Indian demand. Even though module manufacturing capacity has now grown to 26 GW, actual production remains low, at around 8 GW annually.
There are multiple policies that have driven solar manufacturing expansion. In April 2022, the Indian Ministry of Finance levied hefty 40% and 25% border customs duties – plus a 10% surcharge – on imports of all solar modules and cells, respectively. As a result, module imports fell sharply from a monthly average of slightly more than 1.6 GW, in 2021-22, to just 175 MW in the last fiscal year.
An additional policy, the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) has also had an effect. Under the ALMM, all grid connected projects, including rooftop solar systems, are required to use government-certified cells and modules, made by approved manufacturers. While the scheme does not formally discriminate between suppliers on the basis of nationality, approvals have so far only been granted to Indian companies.
The scheme was meant to be applicable from March 2021 but the implementation timeline was shifted to April 2024, due to lack of sufficient domestic capacity. By July of this year, 19.2 GW of module manufacturing capacity had been approved across 78 manufacturers.
The government has allocated capital subsidies of $2.2 billion to 12 companies setting up a total manufacturing capacity of 48.3 GW under its Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Subsidy amounts will be differentiated based on parameters such as the extent of upstream integration, local value addition, capacity, and solar module efficiency. It is estimated PLI funding will amount to around 25% of investment capital costs. Notable companies to win subsidies include Reliance, Shirdi Sai, Adani, First Solar, ReNew, Tata Power, Avaada, JSW, AMP, Waaree, and Vikram Solar.
The Ministry of Finance has also reduced the corporate tax rate from 25.2% to 17.2% for manufacturing companies incorporated after September 2019, provided they go into operation before April 2024.
The government is setting up three dedicated renewables equipment manufacturing zones with capital assistance of INR 10 billion ($121 million). These zones are being selected through a competitive bidding process based on the lowest power and land costs for the manufacturing businesses. The government of the state of Madhya Pradesh has been awarded the first tranche, with a capital assistance of INR 4 billion.
Local and regional funds are also available to manufacturers. Most states offer multiple benefits including capital and operating-cost subsidies, lower general sales tax rates, cheap land, and so on. The central government is also encouraging public and private lenders to support manufacturing projects.
The substantial policy thrust has resulted in a flurry of market activity. Bridge to India estimates total domestic polysilicon, cell, and module production capacities will reach 30 GW, 43 GW, and 110 GW, respectively, by 2026. That said, module supply is expected to remain constrained in the short-term until a significant chunk of new capacity comes online, by the end of 2024. Most manufacturers prefer to sell in the overseas market, particularly in the United States, where they can command up to 40% higher prices.
India is on the way to becoming the world’s second largest manufacturer of solar modules but there are still many issues and challenges to consider. There is lingering policy uncertainty as project developers are seeking another extension of ALMM and further import duty petitions are being considered by both upstream and downstream solar manufacturers. There is also the risk of World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes causing uncertainty. China has already flagged the ALMM mandate as a specific trade concern four times at the WTO.
The goal of becoming self-sufficient, as far as solar energy products are concerned, still appears elusive as upstream Indian polysilicon and wafer production capacity is expected to be insufficient to meet demand. Indian manufacturers are critically dependent on China for technology expertise, manufacturing machinery, component supplies, and even engineering skills. In the longer term, there are also concerns that the generous US Inflation Reduction Act may mean Indian modules are not cost competitive in export markets. Indian modules are expected to remain at least 25% to 30% more expensive than their Chinese counterparts.

Located near the town of Baricha, Kirinyaga County – and on the premises of a formerly abandoned hydro project – the 1,200 m2 mini-grid facility is in close proximity to the nearby Rwamuthambi river. The facility uses the natural flow of the water to power a crossflow turbine, managed by Hydrobox, and is expected to deliver 50 KW of hydropower with a design flow of 0.65 m3/s.
The solar array, managed by SolarNow, has an installed capacity of 150 KW with expectations to ramp up to 350 KW next year. It is expected the Gitwamba power plant will connect 150 households, eight schools, two medical facilities and 10 businesses to power.
Hydrobox CTO Rik Vereecken told pv magazine that solar capture and storage would be the plant’s master and primary energy source, with hydropower acting as the secondary source or slave, supplying energy when the load was in “deficit”.
Renewable Energy Forum Africa.
“This combination leads to a stable and consistent power generation system,” he said. A 50 KW crossflow turbine, Victron Quattro inverters and chargers, Fronius Inverters, a 240 KWh storage facility and a 90 KVA backup generator comprise the hydro part of the project, Vereecken added.
SolarNow director and CFO Ernst Vriesendorp told pv magazine that the technicalities between hydro and solar had “proven complementary” but did not go into detail as to how the solar component of the project was comprised.
He said that despite the project’s humble size, it has “large” benefits. “I think it's a very entrepreneurial and rewarding segment, and, in our opinion, with a very high impact potential,” Vriesendorp explained. “It is a technical achievement, but also a strategic achievement.”
Hydrobox sales manager Annelies Vanderwaeren told pv magazine that a power purchase agreement (PPA) with an unspecified business owner – whom they are considering their “anchor customer” – had been secured as well as another PPA with a “bigger telecom provider”. She also said the project is expected to be completely online by the year's end, adding the $650,000 project was financed through private equity funding and crowdfunding, with the latter garnering $263,511.
By the end of 2022, Kenya's total installed solar capacity stood at 307 MW, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Around 90 MW of PV was newly deployed last year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/09/reducing-solar-module-temperature-via-dew-point-evaporative-cooling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 9, 2023",Reducing solar module temperature via dew-point evaporative cooling,"A group of scientists led by Japan's Kyushu University has developed a new technique based on dew-point evaporative cooling (DPEC) to reduce the operating temperatures of photovoltaic panels.
DPEC is a heat and mass transfer technique that has been broadly used for energy conservation in several industrial sectors to date. This technique is one of the most effective and energy-efficient ways to cool down hot air. It has a higher cooling efficiency than traditional evaporative cooling and can reach dew point temperature, which is the temperature point at which the air can hold no more water vapor and is always lower or the same as the air temperature.
DPEC systems are usually designed to supply air into a wet channel as the working air. This enhances the heat and mass transfer process in the wet channel, due to the lower temperature of the incoming working air. “The exhaust air in the DPEC system can reach saturation, while the supply air in the dry channel can reach its dew-point temperature,” the researchers explained. “The proposed system consists of a separate dew-point evaporative cooler that supplies the near-saturation air to the wet air channels which are attached to the back of the PV panels.”
The proposed system consists of two wet channels, one located in the DPEC system itself and another one placed on the back of the PV panel. The DPEC system provides near-saturation cooled air to the wet channel attached at the back of the PV panel where further evaporative cooling occurs to ensure the maximum cooling effect.
The academics claim that the DPEC system is able to considerably reduce the solar panel operating temperature, particularly at the air inlet of the panel. “A large temperature difference between layers at the panel inlet is observed, due to the cool air supplied from the DPEC unit,” they said. “As the air flows along the channel, the temperature difference between each layer is reduced via heat transfer.”
They also explained that the water evaporation process triggered by the continuous heat transfer from the dry channel to the wet channel embedded in the DPEC system and to the wet channel placed in the panel resulted in an increase in air humidity.
The system was tested for 10 h a day, and the group found the DPEC system consumes 0.0736 kg of water, while the second wet channel at the back of the PV panel consumes 0.7157 kg, with total water consumption being about 0.7893 kg.
The team also found that the channel height has a significant impact on system performance. “Increasing the channel height allows a larger amount of unsaturated air to enter the PV panel, which promotes the heat and mass transfer process to control the panel at a lower operating temperature and thus improves the solar cell efficiency,” it stressed.
The researchers compared the performance of a solar module cooled by the novel technique with that of an uncooled panel and of panels cooled by direct evaporative cooling, and DPEC-based sensible cooling systems. They found that, in all cases, the proposed system achieved better cooling performance and maintained higher module efficiency.
“Shorter channel length and larger channel height improve the cooling performance and yield higher efficiency for the PV panel,” they emphasized. “On the other hand, higher inlet air velocity and working air ratio are favorable.”
They presented the system in the study “Dew-point evaporative cooling of PV panels for improved performance,” published in Applied Thermal Engineering.

Meanwhile, grid operator TenneT has introduced a new contract to provide reduced grid transmission fees to battery operators and other flexible capacities, offering potential discounts of up to 65%. The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) will determine the updated fees by the coming spring.
“This makes it easier to connect batteries to the Dutch electricity grid,” the government said. “Battery operators who use this form of contract must, upon request, help the grid operator to limit grid congestion. For example, by charging or supplying less at times when a lot of electricity is being transported.”
Research commissioned by TenneT suggests that these reduced grid fees could stimulate the addition of 2 GW to 5 GW of new battery capacity by 2030. The Netherlands faces the pressing need to address grid constraints as it plans to deploy substantial solar capacity in the coming years.
In response to grid limitations, Liander has implemented various measures in areas experiencing grid bottlenecks, including the installation of two large transformers and congestion management. TenneT has also created an interactive online map highlighting congested grid areas across the country.
The October issue of pv magazine, due out on Wednesday, turns the spotlight back onto agrivoltaics. We’ll consider how solar on farmland is taking root in Australia and South Africa, how agrivoltaic data harvesting could help more farmers take the plunge, and how an insistence on expensive minimum heights for agrivoltaic panels is hindering the technology in Italy.
These measures include the deployment of two giant transformers and congestion management for grid bottlenecks. Tennet also recently developed an interactive online map showing where the power grid is most congested.
As of June 2022, the Netherlands had a cumulative installed PV capacity of 16.5 GW, with 3,803 MW added in 2021 and 3,882 MW in 2022, according to the nation's statistics agency, CBS.

“The potential for battery storage technology is immense,” he said. “It is a key part of the clean energy transition and goes hand in glove with harnessing and firming Australia’s abundant renewable resources.”
The Riverina battery system utilises Tesla Megapacks fitted with grid-forming inverters, operating in a ‘virtual synchronous generator’ mode. This allows the storage system to function in a manner similar to a traditional generator, providing crucial system strength services to help facilitate the connection of future clean energy power plants in the region.
“Advanced power electronics technology is key to addressing our energy challenges,” Cole said.
Edify designed and developed the battery but in June sold a 90% stake in the project to Federation Asset Management.
Stephen Panizza, co-founder and head of renewable energy at the Sydney-based private equity firm said the need for large-scale energy storage is becoming increasingly important as the nation’s aging coal plants retire.
“Advanced grid-forming batteries like the Riverina BESS are critical to extracting the maximum capacity from our existing grid infrastructure, allowing timely integration of additional wind and solar generation into the NEM while our grid infrastructure is upgraded,” he said.
The Riverina battery system is the largest battery energy storage system yet connected to the National Electricity Market in NSW, having overtaken the 50 MW/75 MWh Wallgrove Grid Battery in western Sydney.
Both batteries are however set to be relegated with a plethora of mega-scale batteries planned for NSW.
Origin Energy has commenced construction of the first stage of a planned 700 MW/2,800 MWh battery at its coal-fired power plant site at Eraring in the NSW Hunter region. Stage one of the Eraring battery involves the construction of a 460 MW battery storage system with a dispatch duration of two hours. French energy giant Neoen has announced plans to build a 500 MW/1,000 MWh big battery at the site of the former Wallerawang coal power station site in the Central Tablelands region. Shell Energy is also seeking to develop a 500 MW/1,000 MWh battery at that site while electricity gen-tailer EnergyAustralia is planning to build a 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery energy storage system adjacent to its Mount Piper coal-fired power station in the state’s central west.
These batteries will however all be overshadowed by the proposed Waratah Super Battery Project that is being built by BlackRock battery offshoot Akaysha Energy on the state’s Central Coast.
The 850 MW/1,680 MWh battery, being installed at the site of the decommissioned Munmorah coal-fired power station near Doyalson north of Sydney, will be the largest standby network battery in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the biggest in the world.
Construction of the WSB began in May and is targeted for completion before August 2025.

One of their advantages is the ability to store energy over short and long timeframes and provide even annual storage.
In a recently released paper, researchers from the University of Perugia and the Sapienza University of Rome have explored the potential of SWBs focusing on renewables-rich Sardinia Island as a case study. The SWB technology they considered employed sodium-biphenyl (Na-BP) as the anolyte. It resembles a conventional redox flow battery with both the anolyte and the catholyte (seawater) flowing through the battery cells.
According to the researchers, a key strength of Na-BP-based SWBs lies in the possibility to externally store metallic sodium. This allows for an extension of the storage timeframe by increasing the Na metal external reservoir, enabling hourly to monthly and seasonal energy storage with only one device and thus decreasing the investment costs.
“This work aims at demonstrating the applicability of SWB to meet the European energy requirements, to arise the interest of the public and private sectors into the further development needed to bring the laboratory scale cells so far developed into commercial applications,” said the researchers.
To this aim, the researchers have investigated SWBs for short-term application when coupled with wave energy converters and found that this could allow for a potential reduction of more than 85% of generated power fluctuations on the Sardinian grid. In this case, the power ramp up reduction was calculated as the difference between two consecutive power values with a timestep of one second and the energy was stored in the Na-BP anolyte.
In the long-term scenario, the researchers found that SWBs could allow for coverage of Sardinia’s seasonal and even annual energy demand thanks to high volumetric densities of Na metal, which is around four times that of compressed hydrogen at 700 bar. The full decarbonization of the Sardinian grid involves integration of approximately 340,000 m3 of Na metal, corresponding to a 12-meter-high Na reservoir covering a surface of less than four soccer fields, the researchers calculated.
They also found that SWB application could eventually meet around 29% of the desalinated water requirements of the Sardinian population, in addition to harnessing its carbon-dioxide capture auxiliary functionality, which results in 37.3 grams of CO2 per stored kWh.
“The results of the modeling demonstrate the effectiveness of SWB-based energy storage combined with the abundant renewable sources of Sardinia, enabling the full decarbonization of the energy system on the island,” the researchers write. “Moreover, SWBs desalination and CO2 capture functionalities is an exemplar of clean energy transition implementation that can be extended to other islands and coastal areas.”
They discussed their findings in “Na-seawater battery technology integration with renewable energies: The case study of Sardinia Island,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/09/u-s-utility-scale-solar-to-more-than-double-installations-year-over-year/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 9, 2023",U.S. utility-scale solar to more than double installations year-over-year,"From pv magazine USA
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LNBL) released its 2023 utility-scale solar report, reflecting on data collected through 2022. The report noted that utility-scale solar had a “strong” 2022 despite numerous challenges, installing 10.4 GW across the nation. This lagged the record 12.5 GW installed in 2021.
Cumulative utility-scale solar reached 61.7 GW nationwide by the end of 2022, said LNBL. Texas added the most last year, with 2.5 GW brought online, followed by California (2.1 GW), Virginia (0.6 GW), and Georgia (0.5 GW).
Single-axis tracking remained the most common configuration for the sector in 2022, with 94% of all new capacity added in 2022 using that mounting type. The remainder was mounted on a fixed tilt.
Installed costs of projects continued to fall in 2022, with median installed costs $1.32 per Wac. This occurred despite inflationary pressures throughout the year. Costs have now fallen by 78%, averaging about 10% per year, since 2010.
The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) also fell in 2022, reaching an average of $39 per MWh. LNBL said the average LCOE has fallen about 84%, averaging 14% annually since 2010. This has been driven by lower capital costs and improving project capacity factors, among other factors, said LNBL.
Power purchase agreement (PPA) prices averaged $25 per MWh in 2022. Prices have largely followed the decline in LCOE over time, though prices stagnated and even increased in 2019.

Rising wholesale electricity prices have boosted the utility-scale solar national average market value by 40% in 2022, reaching $71 per MWh. Solar’s average market value in 2022 was lowest in CAISO ($51 per MWh) and highest in Duke Energy Florida’s service territory ($108 per MWh), said LNBL.
Hybrid projects that include battery energy storage are on the rise as well. In 2022, 35 projects totaling 3.6 GW of PV and 1.8 GW / 5.4 GWh of battery storage achieved commercial operations.
Looking ahead, massive amounts of utility-scale solar is queued up and waiting for interconnection approval across the United States. At least 947 GW of capacity was waiting in queues at the end of 2022. Almost half, about 457 GW, is paired with a battery.
While the Inflation Reduction Act has generated much excitement in the industry, the benefits have yet to be realized in this 2022 summary report, said LNBL.
“Nonetheless, 2023 is shaping up to be the strongest year on record for utility-scale solar, as the first eight months have already yielded 8.6 GW of capacity additions, which is 30% more than the prior record pace through August set in 2021,” said the report. “Based on EIA projections of capacity additions for September through December, total new utility-scale solar capacity added in 2023 could surpass 24 GW by the end of the year.”
The report’s authors will host a webinar to summarize key findings on Wednesday, October 18, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. PT/1:00 p.m. ET. Registration link here.
