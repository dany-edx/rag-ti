Trina Solar and German developer GP Joule have finished building a 170 MW solar plant on a former lignite opencast mine in Klettwitz, in the German state of Brandenburg. The first 90 MW section of the plant has been operational since May 2022.
The project is part of the Lausitz energy park, which is one of the largest ground-mounted PV facilities in Germany, at 300 MW. The Klettwitz mine in Schipkau, Brandenburg, is one of the largest brownfield sites in Europe and is highly contaminated. 
“When it comes to reallocating and rehabilitating former brownsites, solar plants on conversion sites are an absolute must,” said Gonzalo de la Viña, president EMEA of Trina Solar. “Our Vertex modules provide many benefits to any country, city, or municipality looking to convert a contaminated brownsite. Through innovation, efficiency, and a commitment to excellence, Trina Solar has reached new levels of enabling environmental rehabilitation.”
Last spring, GP Joule said that it wanted to complete the rest of the Lausitz Energy Park by the fall. It said that the solar power would be partly used to produce green hydrogen.

The main goal of the study was to rank nine types of solar power system typologies – four kinds of PV plants and five types of CSP facilities – while defining land-use performance metrics.
“This ranking does not include economic factors, scalability, or technology complexity; which may make one system preferred to others even if it demands relatively more land area to yield the same electric energy,” the scientists explained.
They looked at PV systems with fixed photovoltaic panels (PVF), arrays with single-horizontal-axis trackers (PVH), installations with single-vertical-axis trackers (PVV), and systems with two-axis tracking (PV2). They also considered CSP systems based on parabolic dishes with attached heat engines (CSPd), plants with parabolic troughs (CSPt), facilities with linear Fresnel reflectors and single absorbers (CSPF1), projects based on compact linear Fresnel reflectors wit two absorbers (CSPF2), and solar towers with heliostats (CSPh).
The scientists used three different simulation tools to describe the performance of the nine project typologies: Energy3D, PVWatts Calculator, and PVGIS. They considered monthly energy generation intensity (MGI), daily energy generation intensity (DGI), and hourly energy generation intensity (HGI), with the aim of defining the overall energy generation intensity (EGI) of projects. They found that PVF systems are the best performers among the PV typologies.
“Despite the simplicity of the system, being free from any major moving parts, it allows high ground coverage ratio (packing density),” the scientist said. “Adding a single-axis (horizontal) solar tracking gives the best EGI. Upgrading the tracking system to two-axis tracking can misleadingly show better energy conversion assuming the same amount of panel surface, but the EGI actually dropped.”
The scientists said that CSPd, CSPt and CSPF1 have comparable EGI, but the parabolic dishes are preferable when less seasonal variability is required.
“Adding absorbers to a linear Fresnel reflector system without adding a proportional number of reflectors (keeping the same ratio of reflectors to absorbers) is not recommended, and can actually cause a performance penalty,” the scientist said.
They presented their findings in the paper “Land-Use competitiveness of photovoltaic and concentrated solar power technologies near the Tropic of Cancer,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.

The electrolyzer will have an output of 500 MW and will be operational by 2028, as part of plans to reach 1 GW of green hydrogen capacity at the site. “The declaration of intent is part of the German energy strategy to extract clean energy from the North Sea and expand the supply for hydrogen production,” the two companies said in a joint statement, noting that up to 2 GW of electrolyzers could be set up at the site to produce green hydrogen.
Rice University researchers have engineered a light-activated nanomaterial to convert ammonia into hydrogen. The scalable copper-iron catalyst, which uses inexpensive raw materials, needs only the power of light to break ammonia into hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas. The findings show that photocatalysis can be efficiently performed with inexpensive LED photon sources. The best thermocatalysts are made from platinum and related precious metals like palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium. “When illuminated with light-emitting diodes rather than lasers, the photocatalytic efficiencies remain comparable, even when the scale of reaction increases by nearly three orders of magnitude,” the researchers said in “Earth-abundant photocatalyst for H2 generation from NH3 with light-emitting diode illumination,” which was recently published in Science. 
Schulich School of Engineering researchers at the University of Calgary in Canada have presented a new way to structure catalysts for fuel cells. They used a larger catalyst support – a 130-nanometer carbon particle, rather than a 30-nanometer one. They also changed the surface chemistry of the catalyst support by using platinum (Pt) and distributing nitrogen-functional surface groups uniformly. “We introduce a bottom-up designed spherical carbon support with intrinsic nitrogen-doping that permits uniform dispersion of Pt catalyst, which reproducibly exhibits high ORR mass activity of 638 ± 68 mA mgPt−1 at 0.9 V and 100% relative humidity (RH) in a membrane electrode assembly,” the researchers wrote in “Designing fuel cell catalyst support for superior catalytic activity and low mass-transport resistance,” which was recently published in Nature Communications. 
McKinsey & Company said that total hydrogen demand could reach 600 million to 660 million tons by 2050 if four key conditions are met. The industry must scale up competitive supplies, stimulate local demand, facilitate cooperation across value chains, and develop transportation tech focusing on liquid hydrogen or ammonia. “Converting hydrogen to ammonia for transport to Europe from the Middle East then converting it back into hydrogen could result in an additional cost of $2.50 to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen in 2030, which is significant, given that green hydrogen production costs could be less than $2.00 per kg by 2030 in the region,” said the management consulting firm.
The US Department of Energy‘s (DoE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory have kicked off a four-year project to power the next generation of trains with up to 100% hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels. The researchers installed Wabtec’s single-cylinder dual-fuel locomotive engine in the National Transportation Research Center, a DoE-designated user facility located at Oak Ridge. “The team will develop hardware and control strategies for the engine, which will run on hydrogen and diesel fuel to demonstrate the viability of using alternative fuels,” said Oak Ridge. Researchers said the project could accelerate the commercialization of these technologies to retrofit locomotives. 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand have signed an agreement to study and exchange information about hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage in Thailand. The collaboration will run for the next three years.
ACWA Power has signed a memorandum of understanding with PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) to collaborate on hydrogen development in Indonesia. The two sides will develop 4 GW of battery storage capacity for renewable energy facilities and hydroelectricity-powered hydrogen developments in Indonesia, said the Saudi developer.
Airbus is developing cryogenic hydrogen storage tanks to use hydrogen in Nantes, France – where a team built the first cryogenic hydrogen tank ever produced at Airbus in about a year – and Bremen, Germany. “The final objective is to have a tank ready to install in the A380 demonstrator by 2026-28,” said Airbus.

As of Dec. 15, the subsidy for solar will be raised from PLN 4,000 to PLN 6,000. The rebate for storage will more than double from PLN 7,500 to PLN 16,000, according to the scheme’s website. The scheme is open to residential rooftop PV projects ranging in size from 2 kW to 10 kW, and storage installations from 2 kWh.
The changes will cover beneficiaries of the fourth edition of the rebate scheme, which was launched in April. The government also extended the call for applications for the current edition of Mój Prąd from the end of December 2022 to the end of March 2023.
Prosumers can submit applications under an agreement regulating the injection of electricity generated from micro-installations into the Polish grid. Since the scheme was launched in 2019, it has allocated more than PLN 1.7 billion to 411,494 PV projects.
The scheme’s total funding is PLN 5.34 billion, and applications will be accepted until the funds are exhausted. Up to PLN 855 million have been earmarked for the third and fourth editions of the program, which run between 2021 and 2023. The higher rebates are designed to strengthen Poland’s energy security amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/25/low-breakdown-voltage-topcon-ibc-solar-cells-to-improve-shading-tolerance/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 25, 2022",Low-breakdown-voltage TOPCon IBC solar cells to improve shading tolerance,"Researchers from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands have investigated how fine-tuning the reverse characteristics of interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) solar cells based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) technology could help to improve the performance of PV modules, mainly by increasing the shading tolerance and limiting the operating temperature of shaded solar cells.
“Our work had a double objective: on the one hand, to show how it is possible to decrease the breakdown voltage (BDV) of TOPCon IBC solar cells, and on the other hand to demonstrate how modules using low-breakdown-voltage cells are more shade-tolerant,” researcher Patrizio Manganiello told pv magazine. “We used this approach in all applications where partial shading conditions are common,  such as for example in urban-integrated PV.”
The researchers described their findings in “Low-breakdown-voltage solar cells for shading-tolerant photovoltaic modules,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science. They simulated the breakdown characteristics of IBC solar cells based on polysilicon and silicon monoxide (poly-Si/SiOx) passivating contacts.
“Typically, in IBC solar cells based on TOPCon technology, the emitter and the back surface field (BSF) regions are physically isolated to prevent shunting because of diffusion of dopant atoms into the c-Si base during the thermal processing steps,” they explained. “However, it has been experimentally demonstrated that it is possible to design highly efficient TOPCon IBC cells with contiguous BSF and emitter regions, where the p+ and n+ fingers are separated by a compensated poly-Si region, forming a p-i-n junction.”
They said the breakdown voltage can be tuned without significantly degrading the efficiency of the solar cell. Through a device-level simulation, they claim to have shown that it is possible to reduce the BDV in TOPCon IBC solar cells by simply reducing the distance between the emitter and the BSF, without creating a shunt.
“Simulations of partially shaded PV modules indicate that, if the BDV can be reduced to 0.3 V, then the energy yield could be boosted up to 20% for a PV module with three bypass diodes that is shaded approximately 20% of the time,” the scientists said. “The simulations results are supported by outdoor experiments showing that, under partial shading conditions, a PV module made with IBC cells with a BDV of 3 V produced an average of 4.2% more energy than a PV module with FBC solar cells with BDVs larger than 10 V and six bypass diodes.”
Despite these encouraging results, the research group said there is still much left to be done to bring this cell technology close to commercial production.
“The feasibility of manufacturing cost-effective solar cells with breakdown voltage as low as 0.3 V has yet to be demonstrated,” said Manganiello.

Solar accounts for around 90 % of the assigned capacity thus far.
Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO), the state-run agency that manages the SDE++ program, has accepted 2,052 renewable energy project proposals with a combined capacity of 2,344 MW. Of these projects, 1,944 were for rooftop PV installations with a combined capacity of 1,275 MW, while 77 were for 955 MW of ground-mounted solar capacity. Another 20 were for 20 MW of floating solar arrays, in addition to 75 MW of wind farm proposals.
“Developers could apply for a maximum of 37.5 TWh of renewable electricity generation on land for solar PV and wind in this round,” said the RVO. “This production ceiling has not been reached.”
The budget for the 2022 SDE++ program is €13 billion ($13.5 billion), which is the highest amount for the scheme to date. The program also accepted renewables-linked green hydrogen proposals for the first time, as well as industrial electrification projects based on hybrid glass furnaces. In addition, there were three proposals to build 42 MW of hydrogen electrolyzers.
In the latest round of the program, the Dutch government selected 3,426 PV projects with a combined capacity of 3,535 MW. The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a new report by Netbeheer Nederland. By the end of December, the country’s cumulative installed solar capacity hit 14.3 GW.

ElectraNet, an Australian high-voltage transmission network owner, has signed a 30-year transmission connection agreement (TCA) with French renewables developer Neoen for the first 412 MW portion of the massive Goyder Renewables Zone installation, a hybrid wind, solar and storage project that is being built in the state of South Australia.
The first stage of the project features the 412 MW Goyder South wind farm, which is expected to be operational in 2024. ElectraNet Corporate Development Executive Ashley Manna said the state-owned network operator has executed a connection agreement with Neoen for 50% of the capacity in the first stage of the Goyder South project. A new transmission line will be built to connect the project to the grid via ElectraNet’s existing Robertstown substation.
“This is the first half of Stage 1 of the development for Neoen, connecting initially 209 MW of wind generation,” Manna said. “A TCA for the second half is expected to be executed in the coming months for additional wind generation.”
Manna said construction of the connection assets is already “well underway,” with “energisation expected in early to mid-2023.”
Goyder South is a part of the planned Goyder Renewables Zone project, which has secured development approval for 1,200 MW of wind, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW/1,800 MWh of battery storage capacity. Future stages of the project will be unlocked with the completion of Project EnergyConnect, the new 800 MW transmission interconnector linking South Australia with New South Wales. Neoen has already secured energy offtake agreements for much of the output from the first stage of the Goyder project.
The Australian Capital Territory government has signed a 14-year power purchase agreement for 100 MW of the project’s output, while energy retailer Flow Power will buy 40 MW of the generation capacity to on-sell to its South Australian commercial and industrial customers.

They analyzed the impact of clouds and aerosols on PV potential and concluded that disparities in clouds and aerosol efficiency could explain the difference.
The academics used the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) to collect data on direct and diffused surface shortwave radiant fluxes. They looked at a range of atmospheric conditions, including aerosols and clouds, aerosols without clouds, clouds without aerosols, and no aerosols or clouds.
They added that data into the PVLIB-Python modeling tool produced by Sandia National Laboratory, which calculates solar irradiance on the plane of a PV panel (POAI), measured as kWh/m2/day. This represents the maximum theoretical potential of PV power generation. The researchers found that northern India has a PV potential of 5.27 kWh/m2/day, versus 3.57 kWh/m2/day in China.
To explain the difference, the scientists analyzed the impacts of clouds and aerosols on POAI in the two regions.
“The reduction in POAI due to the impacts of clouds and aerosols are defined as the cloud effect (CE) and aerosol effect (AE) in the unit of kWh/m2/d, respectively,” they explained. “The percentages of reductions in the all-sky POAI contributed by clouds (PCE) and aerosols (PAE) are also calculated to show the relative importance of the two factors.”
The results show that the cloud impact is stronger in absolute and relative terms in southern China than in northern India. The impact is up to 2.67 kWh/m2/day or 75% of the POAI reduction under all-sky conditions.
The scientists explained the variations in the cloud effect between the two regions in terms of co-variations in cloud fraction and optical depth. Southern China has nearly twice as much cloud density as northern India. Clouds are also thicker and therefore transmit less solar irradiation.
The researchers found that aerosol optical depth is higher in southern China than in northern India, but aerosol impacts on POAI are similar in magnitude over the two regions.
“The aerosols mostly composed of dust and sulfate over [northern India] are found to be nearly three times more efficient in reducing POAI than the counterpart which is manually composed of sulfate over [southern China],” said the scientists.
They shared their findings in “Diverse cloud and aerosol impacts on solar photovoltaic potential in southern China and northern India,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
