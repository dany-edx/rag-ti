Hydrogen sulfide smells like rotten eggs, due to the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen, as in swamps and sewers. It is also found in many refinery streams. “Under visible light illumination and with no external heat source, up to a 20-fold reactivity enhancement compared to thermocatalysis can be observed,” wrote the team in “Direct H2S Decomposition by Plasmonic Photocatalysis: Efficient Remediation plus Sustainable Hydrogen Production,” which was recently published in ACS Energy Letters. They explained that the “substantially enhanced reactivity” can be attributed to plasmon-mediated hot carriers that modify the reaction energetics. Light-driven, one-step decomposition of hydrogen sulfide represents an opportunity for simultaneous high-efficiency hydrogen production and low-temperature sulfur recovery, especially for petrochemical refineries.
The Sovereign Fund of Egypt and its consortium partners – Fertiglobe, Scatec, and Orascom – have officially started commissioning “Egypt Green,” Africa's first integrated green hydrogen plant. The companies said the facility will deliver up to 15,000 tons of green hydrogen as feedstock to produce about 90,000 tons of green ammonia per year at Fertiglobe's ammonia plants. Upon completion, the facility will consist of 100 MW of PEM electrolyzers powered by 260 MW of solar and wind. The consortium is now in the process of finalizing engineering and technology choices for the full-scale 100 MW plant and aims to make a final investment decision in 2023. It will build, operate and own the facility, backed by a long-term off-take agreement with Fertiglobe.
Germany and Egypt have signed two declarations of intent to intensify cooperation on the production of green hydrogen. The German government said in a statement that the declarations mark “the start of a structured dialogue with the private sector and other actors to promote the mutual exchange of knowledge and the transfer of technological expertise,” in order to clarify financing issues and “harmonize the regulatory framework.”
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Alikhan Smailov have signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a partnership on raw materials, batteries, and renewable hydrogen. The European Union and Kazakhstan aim to identify joint projects, introduce new technologies, and enhance transparency, in addition to developing a 2023-24 roadmap. The European Commission said it expects “concrete joint actions” within six months of signing the partnership with Kazakhstan, which recently signed a separate bilateral energy cooperation deal with Germany. The commission also noted that von der Leyen is set to meet with the Namibian President Hage Geingob this week to sign a similar partnership.
BP has signed an agreement with the government of Mauritania to conduct studies to evaluate the technical and commercial feasibility of producing green hydrogen in the West African country. The UK oil and gas producer said that it will initially conduct a data collection campaign to assess the suitability of solar and wind resources at specific sites, for renewables generation and green hydrogen production.

The researchers based their analysis on three methods that are commonly used to quantify the impact of technical risks. They considered failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), which is a tool used to determine the effect of each module failure on system operation, in order to identify and implement corrective actions. They also considered reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) analysis, which is an engineering tool used to address operational and safety issues in systems. In addition, the researchers adopted the cost priority number (CPN) approach by using the metric CPN, expressed in euros per kilowatt per year, instead of the risk priority number (RPN), which is a numeric assessment, generally used in FMEA, of risk assigned to a process.
The academics created a risk database covering the range of affected components, the description of causes and consequences, failure rates, the probability of occurrence, the impact on key performance indicators (KPIs), and the recommended control and mitigation actions.
“It should be updated and maintained as a growing data hub through all phases of the project,” they said.
They also used the Trust-PV Risk Matrix, which is a standardized taxonomy to improve and standardize the categorization and the readability of operation and maintenance (O&M) tickets, to describe 30 examples of common technical risks. These examples were then included in newly developed PV failure fact sheets (PVFSs).
“The risk matrix covers all failures and events in the operational phase of a PV plant and is subdivided according to components, subcomponents and individual events/failures,” the scientists said.
They outlined their review in “Identify, analyse and mitigate – Quantification of technical risks in PV power systems,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. They said they aim to increase the knowledge of methodologies to assess technical risks and mitigation measures, in order to investigate the most important risks by collecting case studies and updating the database with the acquired information.
“With the knowledge acquired and data collected, the risk and cost-benefit analysis was demonstrated in one case study that showed methods for prioritizing decisions from an economic perspective and provided important results for risk managing strategies,” they explained. “However, providing an overview of quantification methods, we draw the conclusion that more standardization is required.”

That corresponds to an 80% increase on 2021. In the second half of 2022, corporate renewables procurement is on pace to increase by about 4 GW.
Solar dominates renewable corporate PPAs in the region, accounting for 57% of contracts.
“However, wind has been catching up since 2020 and accounted for 44% of new contracts in the region in the first half of 2022,” the report says.
In Australia, solar and wind account for 45% and 43% of PPA contracts, respectively. Solar dominates in India, with 82% of contracts. Wind – particularly offshore wind – accounts for 89% of total capacity in Taiwan.
“For the remaining countries in southeast and east Asia, solar accounts for nearly all contracted capacity,” said Wood Mackenzie.
As of the first half of 2022, India, Australia, and Taiwan were the top three markets in the Asia-Pacific region’s cumulative corporate PPA procurement capacity, accounting for 89% of the total, or 18.6 GW. India leads the charge, with 8.1 GW. Australia has 5.2 GW, while Taiwan has 3.2 GW.
Other countries account for the remaining 2 GW of contracted capacity, with Singapore, China, and Thailand completing the top six. South Korea, Cambodia, and Pakistan contracted the least capacity in the first half of 2022.
“In most Southeast Asian countries, including Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and the Philippines, PPAs are rooftop solar projects,” the report explains. “These are of limited size, reducing their contribution to capacity.”
The top developers in Asia’s corporate PPA market are Amp Energy, Amplus Solar, and Cleantech Solar. They have the vast majority of their capacity in India, according to the report. Most developers in the region are domestic and regional players. The key clients for PPAs are large energy users in the industrial, retail, and technology sectors.
“In Australia, companies including BHP and Newcrest use PPAs to power their mining operations,” says the report. “Other big users include supermarket chains and telecoms providers who use renewables to power their data centers.”
The Asia-Pacific region's renewable corporate PPA capacity accounts for 15% of the global PPA market. The main barrier for further growth in corporate PPAs in the region is lack of regulation permitting large-scale procurement of renewables, according to Wood Mackenzie.
“Countries including South Korea, Japan, and China are all gradually easing regulations surrounding offsite corporate PPAs, which should open up opportunities in the coming years,” it says. “However, we expect Australia, India, and Taiwan to continue to lead future growth.”

As part of the REPower EU package launched in May, the European Commission has proposed a large bundle of measures intended to lower dependence on Russian energy imports, reduce CO2 emissions, and accelerate the expansion of renewables. This includes, among other things, plans to shorten the permitting procedures for PV and wind energy installations.
However, it will still take a while before the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED IV), which is part of the REPowerEU package, is passed and implemented into national law across the member states. Therefore, the commission has drawn up a proposal to simplify the approval process and bridge this period, although the draft has yet to be officially published. It is based on proposals already included in the REPowerEU package. The measures will initially apply for one year, but could be extended if necessary, according to documents seen by pv magazine.
Specifically, the commission has said that the member states should define renewable projects as being of overriding public interest. These projects could then immediately benefit from simplified permits, according to EU environmental legislation.
The EU Commission is pushing for permits to be granted for PV installations linked to structures created for purposes other than electricity generation, with grid-connection permits to be issued within a maximum of one month. Environmental impact assessments would not be conducted for such projects, but this would explicitly not apply to floating PV systems.
Systems with outputs of less than 50 kW usually do not have major negative environmental impacts and do not require any capacity expansion at the point of grid connection, so the commission wants to further streamline approval procedures for them. It reinforced this point by noting that self-consumption from small systems helps operators to keep their electricity costs within limits. In concrete terms, a plant should automatically be considered approved if the responsible authorities do not respond to the application within a period of a month.
When repowering solar parks, the nature conservation and compensation requirements should not be increased unless the new system takes up more space, according to the commission. And last but not least, all decisions from the approval processes should be publicly accessible, the commission said.

The highway in the province of Flevoland is the shortest connection between Amsterdam and the northern provinces of Friesland and Groningen.
The park will host 25,000 bifacial solar panels mounted on a tracking system. It will span 20 hectares, with an additional 5 hectares to be dedicated to a green zone for biodiversity preservation.
Vattenfall said it has applied for a permit to build the site, which it claims will be the first subsidy-free solar project in the Netherlands. The land is owned by the Dutch government. The company expects to complete a tender for project developers by the end of 2023. Construction is set to begin in 2024.
“A condition for this is that there is room on the busy energy grid in the area. We have been discussing this with the grid operator from the start of the project,” said the company, noting that it will start operations in late 2024 or early 2025.

The project joins a list of several solar parks that are being built along Dutch highways. The latest project was announced by Dutch energy cooperative Energie Coöperatie Bunnik (ECB) and IX Zon in January. They are building the 16 MW solar project along the A12 motorway, which connects The Hague with the German border of Gelderland province, in the eastern Netherlands.
In June, four other projects were announced by the Rijkswaterstaat, which is the water management agency of the Netherlands, under the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. The plants are being developed close to on-ramps and off-ramps of the A7 highway, which connects Zaandam, in the province of North Holland, with the German border.

The Push2Heat project started in October and will have a duration of four years.
“The industry's potential for industrial decarbonization through high-temperature heat pumps is huge. For applications of up to 200 C, heat pumps could potentially deliver 730 TWh per year – which is 37% of the process heat required by European industry,” said Maider Epelde, the coordinator of the project at Spain's Tecnalia R&D center. “This could potentially avoid 146 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year.”
The market for high-temperate heat pumps for industrial applications is still limited because “their size needs to be scaled up and their cost … reduced, notably by improving their performance,” according to the project description. The project will scale up four heat-upgrade technologies and assess the related difficulties and solutions.
The systems will have a full-scale net rated thermal input of 0.5 MWth to 10 MWth and will supply industrial processes with heat in the range of 90 C to 160 C. The heat will be extracted from renewable heat sources like solar thermal, as well as ambient heat or industrial waste heat. The technologies will be demonstrated in four selected industrial sites from the food, paper, and chemical industry sectors.
Push2Heat will also demonstrate which business models can help push the use of heat upgrade systems. Its final goal is to increase the market potential of waste heat valorization.
The project consortium includes technology manufacturers, industrial end users, business-oriented companies, research entities, universities, and representatives of the heat pump industry.

The Canadian government's recently released 2022 Fall Economic Statement  introduces investment tax credits (ITC) for clean technologies and clean hydrogen that will help to spur the transition to net-zero energy and make the nation more competitive with the United States.
“Following the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, the need for a competitive clan technology tax credit in Canada is more important than ever,” said the government.
The clean-tech tax credits will be offered to entities that invest in net-zero technologies, battery storage, and clean hydrogen. The move follows passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act., which was signed into law in August by President Joe Biden. The IRA includes a 10-year extension of the ITC at 30% of the cost of the installed equipment, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Years of uncertainty about the ITC created instability in the clean energy sector in the United States, but the 10-year extension is seen as the kind of assurance that US investors need in order to embrace clean technologies.
“While the IRA will undoubtedly accelerate the ongoing transition to a net-zero North American economy, it also offers enormous financial supports to firms that locate their production in the United States – from electric vehicle battery production, to hydrogen, to biofuels, and beyond,” the government said in the economic update. “Without new measures to keep pace with the IRA, Canada risks being left behind.”
The new 30% Canadian tax credit will apply to investments in renewable energy generation and storage, as well as in as low-carbon heating and zero-emission industrial vehicles. The Canadian government is also planning a tax credit for hydrogen production, but the design of it has yet to be determined.
The tax credit is just an initial part of Canada’s response. The Canadian government said it has also proposed a 2% tax on corporate stock buybacks to “encourage corporations to reinvest their profits in their workers and business.”
“What Canadian workers need is a government with a real, robust industrial policy; a government committed to investing in the net-zero transition, to bringing in new private investment, and to helping create good-paying jobs,” said Chrystia Freeland, deputy prime minister and minister of finance.

RWE has chosen two decommissioned lignite-fired and coal-fired power plants in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia as the locations for a new large-scale storage project. It said it wants to install 220 MW of battery storage capacity at both locations for around €140 million  ($139.9 million). Construction is scheduled to start in 2023, and commissioning is planned for 2024.
RWE wants to use the storage capacity to stabilize the power grid. It said its new lithium-ion batteries can generate 220 MW over the course of an hour. It plans to virtually connect the storage facilities with its German power plants, so it is possible to optimally control the units, individually and as a group.
The site in the city of Hamm, Germany, will have 140 MW of battery power. It will occupy an area of 14,000 square meters. In the city of Neurath, another facility will have 80 MW of power over an area of 7,000 square meters.
RWE currently operates around 150 MW of battery storage systems. It is now working on new projects with outputs of 800 MW and capacities of 1,800 MWh. By 2030, RWE aims to install 3 GW of battery storage.

Renewables developer ACEN Australia has agreed to invest in the AUD 800 million ($513 million) Stubbo solar project, allowing the 400 MW installation in the Australian state of New South Wales to fully proceed. It includes provisions for a 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage system.
The final investment decision comes after ACEN signed a connection agreement with infrastructure service provider Lumea. It also follows the execution of a PV module supply contract, mere weeks after the parent company committed AUD 800 million for the construction of the project.
“ACEN Australia is pleased to kick off the construction of the Stubbo solar farm,” said ACEN Australia CEO Anton Rohner. “Again we have been able to close and commit to a project on a merchant basis and, in the case of Stubbo, do this on our balance sheet.”
This plant will be ACEN Australia’s second 400 MW solar farm, after the New England Solar Farm, which is currently being commissioned. The 400 MW solar project is located within the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) in the Mid-Western Regional Council region and will connect to the existing 330 kV network.
Rohner said the finalization of the connection agreement with Lumea, the commercial arm of transmission network operator TransGrid, was a major step in moving to the committed stage.
“It was good to work with Lumea to achieve this major milestone and confirm the connection of Stubbo Solar to the 330 kV Transgrid network,” he said. “The ability to get the connection agreement done illustrates the value of ACEN Australia’s strategy of connecting into secure and robust parts of the Transgrid network.”
Lumea Chief Executive Richard Lowe described the Stubbo solar project as a “vital” part of the state’s energy transition. “This is an important milestone in the transition to a cleaner grid and delivering cheaper energy for consumers into the future,” he said.
Construction of the Stubbo Solar Farm proper is set to commence before the end of the year. It is expected that the project will generate up to 400 jobs during construction.

The US Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories has concluded a five-year, early-life solar module degradation study that examined 834 fielded PV modules, representing 13 types from seven manufacturers in three climates.
The report, recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics, studied 23 systems in total. Six of the studied were determined to have degradation rates that will exceed panel warranty limits in the future, while 13 systems demonstrated the ability to extend their lifetime beyond 30 years. “Lifetime” in this study is defined as the amount of time a panel produces electricity above 80% of its beginning-of-life rate.
The report said that module costs have fallen by 85% since 2010 due to economies of scale, higher efficiencies in cell designs, production line automation, larger modules, and changes to bill of materials components like backsheets. It said that lower costs have led to solar becoming a central part of energy infrastructure buildout today, but noted that cost-cutting design and material changes could lead to a lowered degradation rate, which in-turn could cancel out many of the positive results of lower module costs.
The degradation study showed that degradation is highly nonlinear over time and seasonal variations are present in some module types. Mean and median degradation rate values of −0.62%/year and −0.58%/year, respectively, are consistent with rates measured for older modules.
The report said that the market share of cell types has shifted dramatically in recent years. In 2018, conventional aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) designs dominated global solar cell production, representing up to 90%. By 2020, the market share shifted to only 15% AI-BSF and 80% high-efficiency cell concepts like passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), passivated emitter with rear locally diffused cell (PERL), passivated emitter rear totally diffused cell (PERT), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon).
The report said there is a lack of long-term field data for these new cell and module technologies. It aimed to tackle that lack of data by studying each of these technologies in the field over time. 
Nameplate power rating differences ranged from around −3.6% to 4% with initial power stabilization varying from −3.3% to +0.6%. Flash-over-flash measurements showed variable performance with seasonality amplifying the variations.
Overall, the degradation rates found in the work were within the values observed in the past from 1979 to 2014 module technologies for more expensive conventional PV technologies. The study concluded, although the costs declined sharply in the last decade, module degradation rates do not seem to be affected, at least for the sample investigated in the report.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/08/new-study-looks-at-sundrives-25-54-silver-free-heterojunction-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 8, 2022",New study looks at Sundrive’s 25.54% silver-free heterojunction solar cell,"Sundrive revealed in September 2021 that it had achieved a record-breaking power conversion efficiency of 25.54% for a silver-free heterojunction solar cell. Now, in a new paper that was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics, scientists from Sundrive and Maxwell describe the technological innovations that made this possible.
At the time, the Australian startup said that the results, which were certified by Germany's Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), represented the highest efficiency ever recorded for a commercial-size silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cell. It noted that it used large-scale production processes provided by China-based equipment manufacturer Maxwell Technologies.
“In this paper, we shared some of our recent advances about HIT solar cells, including the use of indium oxide doped with transition metal elements (IMO), that of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) films and copperd (Cu) plating,” researcher Cao Yu told pv magazine. “IMO and nc-SiOx:H films have already been used in our customer's production line, while Cu plating has not.”
The researchers said the IMO films used for the solar cell have a larger bandgap, higher carrier mobility and lower carrier concentration than common indium tin oxide (ITO) films. They used IMO films with an optical bandgap of about 3.88 eV and high mobility of up to 83.2 cm2/V per second to build TCO thin films that they then deposited in the cell by using direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method at room temperature.
The research group used the nc-SiOx:H films, which have a low absorption coefficient, to improve the cell's short-circuit density. They deposited these films through very high frequency (VHF) excited plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). “VHF-PECVD can be used to efficiently fabricate nc-SiOx :H layers with thickness of about 20 nm while maintaining high passivation quality in industrial mass production,” they said.
For the Cu plating, the academics said that they formed the surface Cu finger-busbar grids by using Sundrive Solar's proprietary metallization process. The latter includes a mask forming step and the horizontal plating of the metal grid from an acid Cu plating electrolyte. They added that the width of the finger openings in the formed mask was about 20 μm.
For the fabrication of the solar cell, with an area of 274.5 cm2, the scientists used an n-type Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafer provided by Chinese manufacturer Longi. The wafers have a thickness of 150 μm and resistivity of 1 Ωcm. They used a wet-chemical process wafer treatment including removing of saw-damage, texturing, and cleaning.
“Approximately, 16 nm nc-SiOx:H(n) (or 6 nm a-Si:H(n)) and 8 nm a-Si:H(p) layers were deposited as carrier selective layers on front and rear surfaces, respectively,” they said. “After that, about 80 nm TCO films were sputtered on both wafer surfaces. Finally, metal finger grid contacts (Ag paste or plated Cu) were patterned on each of the surfaces.”
Measured under standard illumination condition, the cell not only showed the above-mentioned record efficiency but also a remarkable short-circuit current of 40.24 mA per square centimeter.
“These results demonstrate the feasibility of high efficiency, and most importantly, low-cost and sustainable mass production of SHJ solar cells,” the research group said.
Yu noted that the the production costs of HIT solar modules are very close to those of PERC modules.
“That means the production cost of HIT cells is a little bit higher than that of PERC cells,” Yu added. “But I think there is still a lot more to do to further reduce the cost of HIT solar cells.”
More recently, Sundrive said it had achieved an efficiency result of 26.41% on a full-size silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cell featuring its copper-based technology. It said the improvement of the HJT cell, with a total area of 274.3 square centimeters (M6 size), had been observed in all three key performance parameters, including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc) and fill factor (FF).
