Transportation expenses make up 29% to 63% of the total cost of imported e-hydrogen. Importing fuel in the early 2020s was 39% to 79% higher in Germany and 34% to 100% higher in Finland compared to domestically produced e-hydrogen. They predict that by 2050, imported e-hydrogen could be 39% to 70% more expensive in Germany and 43% to 54% more expensive in Finland.
TotalEnergies and VNG have partnered to supply green hydrogen to TotalEnergies' Leuna refinery. The agreement involves producing green hydrogen from renewable electricity using a 30 MW electrolyzer in German, operated by Uniper. TotalEnergies said that the pipeline connection to the Bad Lauchstädt Energy Park will provide the Leuna refinery with access to the future European hydrogen infrastructure and international markets.
Cepsa and Yara Clean Ammonia have formed a commercial partnership to establish a green hydrogen maritime corridor linking the ports of Algeciras and Rotterdam. As part of the alliance, Yara Clean Ammonia joins the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley, where Cepsa intends to construct a green ammonia plant near the port of Algeciras. The Spanish company, a subsidiary of the Mubadala group, said it plans to invest €1 billion ($1.08 billion) in the project.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said it will meet its net-zero commitment by 2050 through a combination of policies, including hydrogen propulsion solutions. “New aircraft such as blended-wing bodies demonstrated with full-scale working prototypes, electric/hydrogen for short-haul markets” should become available by 2040, while the needed hydrogen infrastructure should become available by 2045. 
Thyssenkrupp Nucera said another company has signed a reservation agreement for its alkaline water electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen for an unspecified North American project. “A company has contractually secured the supply of the standardized 20 MW scalum electrolysis modules with a total installed capacity in the high multi-hundred-megawatt range,” said the German company.
Schneider Electric and H2-Enterprises have agreed to explore and develop clean hydrogen solutions for energy supply and management in buildings in the Middle East and Africa. Earlier this year, H2-Enterprises signed an MoU with Madayan to develop a waste-to-hydrogen plant in conjunction with PV solar power plants with base-load capacity in Oman.
Mitsubishi has set up Eneco Diamond Hydrogen in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, to develop green hydrogen and associated renewable energy in Europe.

Vikram Solar, an India-based solar module producer, has partnered with investors Phalanx Impact Partners and Das & Co. to create a U.S. joint venture, VSK Energy LLC. The new company plans to invest up to $1.5 billion to develop a vertically integrated solar manufacturing operation.
The first phase of the investment consists of a $250 million investment to establish the Colorado module manufacturing facility in a recently completed building owned by Mortenson Properties and Hyde Development.
The new factory is expected to create over 900 direct jobs with an average salary of more than $70,000 and 200 construction phase jobs. VSK Energy expects the facility to commence operations in 2024 with an initial capacity of 2 GW of solar PV modules and planned expansion of up to 4 GW in the coming years.
With two planned projects, VSK extends Vikram Solar’s 17 years of solar manufacturing experience to the U.S. with financial support from sustainability-focused private equity firm Phalanx Impact Partners and Das & Co., a multi-tiered asset manager.
“Colorado is one of the top states in the country for solar production so this expansion in Brighton will help build upon our plans to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040, create more than 900 new good-paying jobs for Coloradans and contribute to our state’s thriving economy,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis.
“Cleantech in Colorado contributes $4.6 billion per year to the state’s economy and employs over 62,000 Colorado workers. By establishing a new solar manufacturing facility in Brighton, VSK will grow this important employment sector and help further Colorado’s commitment to grow clean energy technologies,” said Eve Lieberman, Executive Director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.
The second phase of investment would complete VSK’s vertical integration of the solar manufacturing process with the development of a second U.S. factory in a Southern state to produce solar ingots, cells, and wafers with a planned annual capacity of 4 GW and $1.25 billion capital commitment.
VSK Energy is expected to commence operations in 2025 following the evaluation and finalization of available federal, state, regional, and local incentives for the project. The new factory is expected to create over 1,500 direct jobs and 1,000 construction jobs.
Mortenson, a leading solar engineering, procurement, construction, and commercial contracting firm, will oversee the engineering and construction of both phases of VSK Energy’s planned investment.
To construct both phases of VSK Energy’s planned module and ingot facilities, Mortenson intends to hire hundreds of team members from the local communities involved in the project, including pipefitters, electricians, sheet metal workers, plumbers, operators, carpenters, laborers and safety professionals.
“With our 17 years of experience in solar manufacturing, combined with the VSK team’s commitment to a clean energy future, we look forward to driving the solar industry forward and setting a new benchmark for innovation and efficiency in solar manufacturing in the United States,” said Gyanesh Chaudhary, founder, chairman, and managing director of Vikram Solar.
“The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act was a landmark moment for the clean energy future of the United States,” said Sriram Das, Co-Chairman of VSK Energy and Managing Director of Das & Co. “The Biden Administration and Congress have called for immediate action and through our partnership in VSK, we are taking a decisive step towards achieving solar technology self-sufficiency, fortifying America’s energy security, and propelling large-scale solar deployment.”
Dentons LLP represented Vikram Solar for the creation of the VSK Energy JV, while McDermott Will & Emery represented Phalanx Impact Partners and Reed Smith represented Das & Co.
Based in Kolkata, India, Vikram Solar has a presence in 32 countries, operates a portfolio of 1.42 GW of PV projects and employs close to 2,000 employees. The company’s cumulative production capacity of solar modules is 3.5 GW.

Launched in June 2021, the Whole County PV pilot program is open to 676 counties representing approximately 21% of Mainland China's land area and 24% of its population. “The eastern provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan lead with over 50 counties each,” the study noted.
The study reveals that sales of air-source heat pumps rose in China from 1.5 million annually in 2017 to 2.5 million in 2021. “However, heat pumps face challenges in China's Severe Cold regions due to poor efficiency at low temperatures, poor building insulation, and high humidity leading to issues of frosting,” it also states.
The economic analysis on the use of PV-linked residential heat pumps included 137 counties. “These counties include each province of China, and, where possible, cover a range of geographies within each province,” the academics said. “The model bases hourly heating load on an individual 100-square-meter house that follows the basic China rural residential building standard.”
They assumed a heat pump is connected to a 5 kW PV system and, in some cases, they also considered the use of an 8 kWh battery. Under this system configuration, the solar array can cover a bit less than half of a total household electricity load over a full year when combined with an air-source heat pump for both heating and cooling. “Given that heating accounts for the major share of total electricity load under this scenario, PV coverage of load generally increases in warmer climate zones,” they specified.
Through their analysis, the researchers found that China's northern provinces provide the greatest economic benefit, with payback times being in most of cases under three years. They also ascertained that, in the country's central regions, the payback time is between three and six years, and that, in the southern regions, the adoption of solar-powered heat pumps is “uneconomical.”
They published their findings in the paper “Synergies between China's Whole County photovoltaic program and rural heat pump adoption,” which was recently published in Wires Energy and Environment. “The analysis shows that pairing heat pumps with PV is most beneficial in North Central China, including in those provinces where the Whole County PV program is most active: Henan, Jiangsu, and Shandong,” they concluded.

Wind speeds reached more than 65mph and rainfall of up to 500mm led to the evacuation of over 180,000 people and the death of at least 8. It has also left nearly 1000 villages without power.

Cyclone season is from April to December in the Northern Indian basin. Although the Bay of Bengal typically sees more than twice as many cyclones, it is still common for storms to form in the Arabian Sea and move into northwestern Indian and southern Pakistan.
Solar Irradiance clearly shows the lingering impact of Cyclone Biparjoy over the region. Although by June 17 the storm had been downgraded to a “Tropical Depression” with winds and rainfall weakening, rotating clouds around the weakening core still covered a large area of northwestern India and significantly reduced solar generation by more than 50%.

Elsewhere in India, solar generation was high as monsoonal activity over this period remained mostly offshore to the southeast. However, clouds with monsoonal showers are often very thick and stationary, and so solar generation where they do occur is cut much more drastically and for longer periods compared to typical showers in the mid-latitudes. An El Niño pattern is developing in the Pacific Ocean and can influence the monsoonal season in India, where it is associated with drier than normal conditions.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

In the aftermath of Intersolar Europe, the market must reckon with clear signals that the region is oversupplied with modules, as well as how China polysilicon prices upstream are very close to their floor.
The 11.73% week-on-week plunge is also record-breaking in being CMM’s largest percentage drop ever.
It comes as OPIS contacts, during and since Intersolar, have almost unanimously highlighted that prices are falling fast and hard. The majority saw prices in the $0.170-0.175/W range, with numbers as low as $0.150/W heard. Some did not share prices as they assessed the degree of the drop.

With a similar unanimity, market players also lamented the overstocked state of Europe’s module inventories, which face falling values and which curtail further shipments. Europe installed a record 46.1 GW of solar power in 2022, according to a SolarPower Europe report. But around 85 GW of modules were shipped there last year, with the remainder ending up in warehouses owned by Chinese companies across Europe, according to a veteran market observer.
Given these modules represent 2022’s much-higher-than-present prices, it is better to get them sold now, before prices fall further and companies risk losing even more, the veteran added.
A continent away from Europe, China polysilicon prices have plummeted to CNY63.5 ($8.84)/kg, on the threshold of the CNY60/kg figure OPIS contacts generally consider the material’s cost figure. It is a “common consensus” that this market now faces overcapacity, said one source, who added that China’s tier-1 manufacturers alone have more than 100,000 MT of polysilicon stockpiled.
Looking ahead and in light of these bearish factors, module prices are expected to keep sliding, with one source expecting them to stabilize in the next quarter after the polysilicon and wafer segments have hit their cash cost.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

The accomplishment has been included in Version 62 of the “Solar Cell Efficiency Tables.”
The team said it improved the cell's efficiency from 23.7% by using a “novel interface material.”
“The introduction of this novel interface material brings forth a range of advantageous attributes, including excellent optical, electrical, and chemical properties,” the academics said. “These properties work synergistically to enhance both the efficiency and longevity of perovskite solar cells, paving the way for significant improvements in their performance and durability.” 
The “Solar Cell Efficiency Tables” show that the cell achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.159 V, a short-circuit voltage of 25.60 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 82.1%. The researchers said that the cell has an area of 1.007 cm².
“This work represents the first instance of an inverted-structure perovskite solar cell exceeding the normal structured perovskite solar cells with an active area of 1 cm2, and this is mainly attributed to the innovative charge transporting material incorporated in our perovskite solar cells,” the researchers said. “Since inverted-structure perovskite solar cells always offer excellent stability and scalability, achieving a higher efficiency than for normal-structured perovskite cells represents a significant milestone in commercializing this cutting-edge technology.”

There is a wealth of research into the many different mechanisms that can start to affect the individual components in a solar module when installed outdoors for a long period of time, and the industry has shown that it can rapidly adapt when unexpected problems are discovered.
A group of scientists led by the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands has conducted an exhaustive review of literature on PV cell and module degradation published over the last 30 years. Their work seeks to provide a detailed guide to the main stress factors faced by PV modules in the field, and a component-by-component guide to the common degradation and failure modes faced by each.
Their guide, Review of degradation and failure phenomena in photovoltaics, is published in full in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. Among the key findings they take from looking into the existing research this way is that the next step for improving module reliability is to understand the combined effect of multiple stresses over different time periods and develop tests that can take this into account.
“Quality and reliability testing has come to a stage where the durability of each component under a single stress can be predicted well, but accurate reliability estimations for a combination of materials under a combination of time-varying stresses remain challenging,” the group explains. “Building on this knowledge, strategies to improve the operational lifetime of PV systems and thus, to reduce the electricity cost and improve the sustainability can be devised and lifetimes of PV modules can be extended.”
They note efforts by DuPont with its module accelerated sequential testing, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s combined accelerated module testing, and Europe's Solliance’s in-situ degradation method as leading the progress in this area.
“All three combine multiple stress factors such as light, humidity, temperature, rain, mechanical load and voltage stress,” the group states. “It is worth reminding that stress factors and stress levels in the outdoors are uncontrolled and time-varying, while conventional accelerated life testing approaches have a more monotonous character.”
The paper also praises the PV industry and research communities’ quick reactions in developing tests to give advance warning of weakness to degradation mechanisms as they are discovered – such as with potential-induced degradation. And the scientists warn that the full combination of factors must be considered with any new material solar producers plan to take up.
“New materials must work within the whole module package and in concert with the other materials present,” the scientists add. “Agnostic combined stress tests need to be used, so that also unknown, new failure modes related specific designs or BOMS may be triggered during the development phase. Standardization of such agnostic stress tests will be instrumental in the further development of long-lifetime modules and the necessary market acceptance and appreciation of long-lifetime claims.”

In their study of a 749 kW FPV system on the lake, the researchers investigated the impact of the system on near-surface lateral wind flow, irradiance, water temperature, and energy balance using extensive meteorological and hydrological measurements.
The group found that the uppermost water layers show large water temperature differences (ΔTw) variability depending on the time of day.
“In particular, negative ΔTw values can be observed in the near-surface layer indicating a cooling effect of the system. The depth and standard deviation of mean water temperature differences show a strong negative correlation (r = −0.87). The fluctuations of the water temperature differences are significantly higher in the depth range of 0 to 5 m than in the depth range of 5 to 10 m (p = 0.0007).”
Researchers say the findings could indicate that the effect of FPV is mainly reflected in the upper water layers, as well as that different effects can be expected during the day and night, with the strongest cooling occurring in the near-surface water layer.
To determine the effects of the FPV on the lake, the team used the General Lake Model, inputting data from measurements of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) above and below the modules. Additionally, the team used data generated by small wind transmitters to analyze differences in near-surface lateral wind speed due to the system.
“Based on the sensitivity analysis of the wind reduction, it can be observed that the impact of FPV on the near-surface wind speed can have a considerable effect on the thermal properties of the lake,” the study notes. “While the measured reductions in irradiance (73%) and wind (23%) imply a counteracting effect to climate change, high wind reductions can have a stabilizing effect on the stratification and significantly increase the surface water temperatures in extreme years such as 2018. This, in turn, could further amplify the expected effects of climate change.”
The group says the above complexities mean that more research should be done to monitor the interaction between FPVs and water, so that systems can be specifically designed “to achieve beneficial effects for the water bodies with regard to climate change.”
Their findings are available in the report “The impact of floating photovoltaic power plants on lake water temperature and stratification,” published in scientific reports.
