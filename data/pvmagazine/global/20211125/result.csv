That is the volume of solar the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) estimates will be needed to achieve a net zero economy in mid century – alongside 3.8 GW of wind farms every 12 months for the next 29 years in what would be an annual CA$8 billion (US$6.3 billion) investment.
Presenting its 2050 Vision document this month, subtitled Powering Canada’s Journey to Net-Zero, the trade body said Canada, which currently has 3 GW of solar capacity, would need 47 GW by 2050.
The renewables lobby group said policymakers should heed the advice given by the International Energy Agency and totally decarbonize electricity by 2035.
That would be an easier task for Canada than many industrialized nations as hydro supplies around 59% of the country's electricity at present, with nuclear, solar and wind accounting for 15%, 0.5%, and 5%, respectively.
The scale of the challenge is illustrated by the fact the government has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, from 2005 levels, by 40-45% this decade, but has only managed a 1% fall thus far. The country has also set five-year targets for 2030, 2035, 2040, and 2045.
CanREA called on policymakers to do more to incentivize renewables roll-out and said grid upgrades should be co-ordinated on a regional, rather than provincial scale. The membership group also wants legacy gas-fired power plants to be eligible for the rising exposure to carbon pricing new facilities will have to accept, with full exposure this decade.

The institutes' experts identified all suitable locations for both technologies and combined these geographical data with technical parameters and meteorological data taken in 2017. “Reported new capacities in the study assume covering the available roof space with a 226 Wp per m² PV module (SPR-MAX3-400) at [a] specified tilt and orientation per building type,” EnergyVille experts specified. “The availability of PV varies between 930 [and] 1,060 full load hours in Belgium, or a potential additional energy production of approximately 99.3 TWh per year.”
Of the three Belgian macro-regions, Flemish-speaking Flanders is the one with the largest solar potential for rooftop systems, at around 65 GW, followed by French-speaking Wallonia, with around 30 GW, and the Brussels metropolitan region, with around 4.2 GW. At the end of 2020, Belgium had a total cumulative PV capacity of over 6 GW and almost all of this power is represented by residential and commercial PV systems, with only a few ground-mounted solar parks having been constructed in the country. Its legislation, on the other hand, is extremely hostile to utility scale solar and the vast majority of the PV installations in the country do not exceed 10 kW in size.

The model used considered current policy constraints on available space and calculated the generation potential according to demand and grid capacity and flexibility. According to the research's findings, the potential for commercial and industrial projects is highest in Flanders and is concentrated around industrial districts along highways and navigable waterways, like the southern West-Flanders and the Meuse-Sambre axis, rather than in urban centers.
The research institute specified that potential additions of ground-mounted and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) installations were not included, which shows the country may have a larger technical potential for the solar technology than that estimated by its analysis. “Unfortunately, no clear policy guidelines exist to prioritize ground-mounted PV over other land uses (water bodies, agriculture or industrial complexes) nor to evaluate in a spatially explicit manner the technical potential for BIPV in a reliable way, and therefore [they] are not yet assessed in this study,” its experts concluded.

Their technique is called ‘surprise pounce' and consists of surrounding escaping prey from the sky and forcing it to run in a zig-zag movement that inevitably pushes the animal between the claws of one of the hawks to then be shared with all the group's members.
Inspired by this scheme, an international group of scientists developed, in 2019, the so-called Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) tool that, despite being relatively new, has already raised enormous interest within the global scientific community and has found application in a wide variety of fields.
The HHO sort of reproduces the hunting behavior of the Harris hawks by mimicking their exploring, exploiting and attacking strategy. It works in several steps, as follows: it initializes the hawk population and calculates fitness value for each hawk before selecting the best one; it identifies the position of a rabbit, or rabbit population, and calculates jump and energy strength for each of the rabbits; it then performs exploration and exploitation phases and calculates the rabbit's best location and fitness.
According to most of the scientists involved, this nature-inspired algorithm exhibits smooth transitions between exploration and exploitation while providing competitive results to complex problems.
With this in mind, a group of scientists from the Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, in Iran, and the University of Guelph, developed a modified version of the algorithm, which they called Whippy Harris Hawks Optimization (WHHO), with the intent of applying it to estimate the model parameters of a PV installation.
“In the proposed algorithm, modifications are applied to the process of [the] hawks’ movement towards the prey,” the researchers explained. “The applied changes reduce the likelihood of getting stuck in local minima and increase the convergence speed, compared to the original HHO.” They added an elimination period, during which a certain number of the worst solutions are eliminated and replaced by new solutions in the search space.
The tool was used to estimate the model parameters of systems based on both mono and polycrystalline modules, considering the effect of temperature and irradiance changes. The main goal of the algorithm, the research team emphasized, is to minimize the amount of the obtained Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This is a standard way to measure the error of a model in predicting quantitative data. “It was observed that the saturation current of the diode and the photocurrent slightly change with the variation of the temperature and irradiance, respectively, and the rest of the parameters remain almost constant under various operating conditions,” they also stated.
According to their findings, exposed in the paper Parameter estimation of PV solar cells and modules using Whippy Harris Hawks Optimization Algorithm, published in Energy Reports, the achieved results confirm the high reliability of the proposed algorithm and its improved convergence speed compared to other recent optimization methods.

The commission yesterday announced the contracts-for-difference (CfD)-based system is not in breach of EU state aid rules.
Under the terms of the incentive regime, joint solar and wind power auctions will be held at which developers will compete to secure permits for generation facilities by bidding the lowest ‘strike price' they will accept for each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. With the clean electricity to be sold on the retail market, developers will receive a premium payment to bridge the gap when the strike price they agreed is higher than the wholesale electricity price. When the strike price is lower than the retail price, developers will refund the difference to the state. The CfD premium payment contracts can be offered for up to 20 years.
The program is set to run until 2025 and the Greek government hopes it will drive 4.2 GW of renewables generation capacity.
While onshore wind and PV project developers will bid competitively to establish a strike price, generation projects based on biogas, biomass, landfill gas, hydropower, concentrated solar power, and geothermal technology will receive a standard tariff, determined by the state and linked to the technology used and its estimated costs.
Announcing the green light for the Greek scheme yesterday, the commission said the EU member state would hold joint solar and wind power auctions but may separate the technologies if one form of generation is too dominant.
The article published on the commission website also stated, without providing any further explanation: “Greece plans, also, to finance projects located outside Greece.”

The leaders of Germany's new government coalition, formed by the Green party, the Liberal party (FDP) and the Social-democrat party (SPD) have presented, yesterday, their 177-page program for the next four years.
In the renewable energy chapter of the document, the government coalition is aiming for the share of renewables in gross electricity demand to rise to 80% by 2030, assuming an increased demand of between 680 and 750 TWh per year. In accordance with this goal, a further expansion of the electricity network is planned and the renewable energy capacities to be allocated through tenders should be “dynamically” adjusted. In addition, more funds will be provided for the further implementation of Germany's renewable energy law (EEG) and long-term power purchase agreements will be supported by more favorable regulatory conditions.
Furthermore, the coalition decided to raise the country's 2030 solar energy target from 100 to 200 GW. The country's cumulative solar capacity topped 56.5 GW at the end of September. This means that another 143.5 GW of PV capacity will have to be deployed during the current decade.
This would require annual growth of around 15 GW and the elimination of growth limits on future new capacity additions. “To this end, we are removing all obstacles, including accelerating grid connections and certification, adjusting tariffs, and planning tenders for large rooftop systems,” the document reads. “We will also support innovative solar energy solutions such as agrivoltaics and floating PV.”
“All suitable roof areas will be used for solar energy in the future. This should be mandatory for new commercial buildings and the rule for private new buildings,” says the coalition agreement. “We will remove bureaucratic hurdles and open up ways in order not to overburden installers financially and administratively. We also see this as an economic stimulus program for medium-sized businesses.”
The agreement also includes the gradual phasing out of all coal power plants by 2030. “That requires the massive expansion of renewable energies that we are striving for,” the coalition stated.

Perovskite cells built with 2D hybrid materials are generally known for being more stable than conventional, 3D devices, due to the protection provided by the organic ligands, and exhibit large exciton binding energies. “2D perovskites have tremendous stability but are not efficient enough to put on a roof,” the scientists explained. “The big issue has been to make them efficient without compromising the stability.”
The researchers designed the new cell after they discovered that, when the sunlight hits a 2D perovskite, it contracts the space between atomic layers in the material. “We find that as you light the material, you kind of squeeze it like a sponge and bring the layers together to enhance the charge transport in that direction,” they further explained.
Under standard illumination conditions, the 2D perovskite material used for the cell contracted by 0.4% along its length and about 1% top to bottom. “It doesn’t sound like a lot, but this 1% contraction in the lattice spacing induces a large enhancement of electron flow,” said research co-lead author Wenbin Li. The perovskite material's lattice also showed lower degradation rates compared to 3D materials when it was heated to 80 degrees Celsius.
The solar cell was built with a layer of organic cations between the iodide on top, and lead on the bottom enhanced interactions between the layers and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.3%. “We’re on a path to get greater than 20% efficiency by engineering the cations and interfaces,” co-lead author Siraj Sidhik said. “It would change everything in the field of perovskites, because then people would begin to use 2D perovskites for 2D perovskite/silicon and 2D/3D perovskite tandems, which could enable efficiencies approaching 30%.”
The cell is presented in the study Light-activated interlayer contraction in two-dimensional perovskites for high-efficiency solar cells, published in nature nanotechnology. The research group comprises scientists from the Rice, Purdue and Northwestern universities, and U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories in Los Alamos, Argonne and Brookhaven and the Institute of Electronics and Digital Technologies (INSA) in Rennes, France.

Lagos-based All On – which is funded by the Shell Foundation set up by the Anglo-Dutch energy giant – and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) led by the Rockefeller Foundation established by Shell's U.S. peer, have provided a $10 million cash pot to the Demand Aggregation for Renewable Technology (DART) program.
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The DART fund will be loaned to eligible solar equipment suppliers to enable them to purchase products at a cheaper rate, thanks to the aggregation of orders centrally by Colorado-based renewables data and technology business Odyssey Energy Solutions.
The program will initially lend to solar companies approved by Nigerian state entity the Rural Electrification Agency to supply its Nigeria Electrification Project, and will then be rolled out into four other, unspecified African “pilot countries.”
It is hoped lower solar system prices, driven by the aggregation of demand, will attract more investors to the solar business case in Africa, not least commercial banks who could be persuaded to offer cheaper finance.
“This is an example of the kind of innovation and collaboration needed to close the energy access gap, enable a just and inclusive energy transition, and unlock a sustainable future for all,” said Damilola Ogunbiyi, CEO and special representative of the UN secretary-general for sustainable energy for all, quoted in a press release issued yesterday on behalf of DART project partners All On, GEAPP and Odyssey.
Ahmad Salihijo, MD of the Rural Electrification Agency, said: “This could be a breakthrough in bridging the finance gap that hinders the growth of small and medium sized enterprises in the nascent renewable energy sector in Nigeria.”
The recently-launched, $10 billion Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet has members including the Bezos Earth Fund established by Amazon owner and world's richest person Jeff Bezos, and the Ikea Foundation connected to the Swedish furniture giant. Publicly-funded partners include the World Bank, USAID, the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the International Renewable Energy Agency.

A report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) thinktank, and consultant JMK Research, has highlighted the role mixes of different electricity generation sources and storage can play in overcoming the intermittency challenge of variable renewables, such as solar and wind, to ensure grid stability.
Clean power blended with either conventional, fossil fuel-fired thermal plants with low load factors, or renewables plus energy storage systems can provide the firm, round-the-clock power needed by electricity distribution companies, according to the report.
Solar PV could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. This year, pv magazine’s UP initiative shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
“There is increasing emphasis on [the] firming of VRE [variable renewable energy]-integrated power,” said Jyoti Gulia, lead author of the report and the founder of Haryana-based JMK Research. “This will be even more the case now that India has pledged, at COP26, to install 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity, and to meet 50% of energy requirements from renewables by 2030,” she added, referring to the pledge made by the government at the recent climate change summit held in Glasgow. “In India, we have seen renewable energy tenders evolve from plain vanilla solar or wind, to hybrid, to assured peak power, to round-the-clock.”
Utilities are now driving a new set of tenders to manage their 24-hour power supply requirements with renewable energy sources that meet 80-85% annual capacity utilization factor (CUF) conditions during peak and off-peak hours, added Gulia.
The report, co-written by Vibhuti Garg, energy economist and India lead at Cleveland-based IEEFA; and JMK research associate Akhil Thayillam, examined the key conditions of the two round-the-clock tenders held by state body the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
The study points out the term “round-the-clock” may be misleading as successful projects in the two procurement exercises are required to provide a CUF of at least 80% and 85%. The CUF is the volume of electricity actually generated by the power plants in a year, expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible output, under ideal conditions.
Having modeled the generation and storage technologies available, the authors of the study concluded a renewables-plus-fossil fuel mix could be most effective to meet the needs of the SECI tenders.
“Growth in new thermal power capacity is neither viable nor sustainable,” said Garg. “The thermal power sector in India is already grappling with numerous stranded coal-based assets and an increasing amount of coal capacity that is being left idle. Bundling renewable energy with electricity generated in coal-based plants that have low PLFs [plant load factors, an indication of how often power plants generate at full output] to provide firm RTC [round-the-clock] power is one way to make use of some of this idle capacity.”
Garg said the government recently issued guidelines which enable fossil fuel-based energy to be replaced by renewables under existing power purchase agreements (PPAs). 
“As part of this change, thermal power generation companies are allowed to set up renewable energy generation capacity, either by themselves or through other renewable developers, by open bids, and [can] supply the electricity generated to consumers under their PPAs.”
In the longer term, as the cost of batteries continues to decline, the authors of the study said battery energy storage systems are likely to become the most viable option for providing critical, non-intermittent power.
The report stated India needs time-based incentives to better match renewable energy supply to demand. Looking at the different approaches to demand-based power supply which have been applied in countries such as the U.S., Germany, and Chile can help India find a path forward.
To further enhance grid balancing, India could also explore options beyond the physical aggregation of generation resources and storage technologies, such as virtual power plants – cloud-based networks of grid-integrated generation and storage assets.
“To make round-the-clock a reality in India,” said Gulia, “the renewable energy industry needs to work alongside policymakers, investors and other stakeholders to provide cost-effective power procurement models that target grid [imbalances], along with [aiming for the] improvement of capacity utilization and reliability of power infrastructure.”

Through the scheme, dubbed the Green Electricity Tariff (GET) program, the government will offer 4,500 GWh of power each year. GET customers will be charged an additional MYE0.037 ($0.087) for each kWh of renewable energy purchased. The energy is sold in 100 kWh blocks for residential customers and 1,000 kWh blocks for industrial consumers.
The new mechanism will come into force starting from January 1 and applications by consumers will be accepted by local utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) from December 1.

The plant was constructed for Korea Water Resources Corp., which is a governmental agency that manages water resources.
The facility is the largest floating PV plant built in the country to date. It was built with the Q.Peak Duo Poseidon modules for floating projects provided by South Korea-based manufacturer Hanwha Q-Cells and floating structures supplied by Scotra itself.
The floating plant has the shape of a flower and, according to the project developer, will also become a tourist attraction.
Scotra previously built a 25 MW floating solar plant on a reservoir in Goheung county, in the South Korean province of Jeollanam, and a 500 kW pilot floating array at the Hapcheon dam itself.
The company is also developing a 72 MW project at the Saemangeum sea wall on the Yellow Sea, for which it has also built a new 300 MW factory to produce floaters and frames.
In March, the South Korean Ministry of Environment announced a plan to install around 2.1 GW of floating PV capacity by 2030. The new 2.1 GW program is part of South Korea's plan to become carbon-neutral by 2050. It will add to the 2.1 GW floating solar complex the South Korean government is developing near the Saemangeum tidal flats, on the coast of the Yellow Sea.
The KRW4.6 trillion ($3.82 billion) project was unveiled in 2019. It will be built in two stages, with the first 1.2 GW phase set to come online in late 2022 and adding the remaining capacity by 2025

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/25/renewables-to-drive-down-prices-as-fossil-fuel-generators-exit-australian-electricity-market/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 25, 2021",Renewables to drive down prices as fossil-fuel generators exit Australian electricity market,"From pv magazine Australia
A new report by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) says the impact sparked by the planned closures of several of the nation’s fossil-fuel generators, including the 1.68 GW Liddell Power Station which is set to shutter in 2023, will be largely offset by decreasing wholesale electricity and environmental costs as more renewable energy comes online across Australia.
The AEMC’s 2021 annual residential electricity price trends report, which examines the direction household electricity prices will take over the next three years, forecasts an average national drop in annual bills of 6%, or $77, by 2024 as cheaper renewable energy flows to consumers.
AEMC chair Anna Collyer said the report shows that, based on current trends, prices per kilowatt hour are likely to be under 26c p/kWh by June 2024, the first time since 2016/17.
“This illustrates how integrating renewables in a smart way makes it possible to have both lower emissions and lower costs for consumers,” she said.  “What we are seeing is the impact of new generation already commissioned as well as new capacity committed across the NEM.”
The predicted declines come in spite of the impending exit of several fossil-fuel generators from the National Electricity Market (NEM), including the staged exit of AGL’s Liddell Power Station in 2022 and 2023, one of the biggest coal-fired generators in the NEM.
AGL will close the plant in the New South Wales Hunter Valley in April 2023, having already lodged plans to establish a giant 500 MW battery at the site.
Collyer said prices are expected to fall slightly this financial year, increase by about $20 a year in FY2022/23 when Liddell exits the system, and then fall again as that lost capacity is replaced by a combination of solar, wind, gas and battery energy storage.

“While we have just under 2,500 MW of generation expected to exit the grid over the next three years, there are almost 5,500 MW of committed new large-scale generation and storage projects coming online over the same time period,” she said.
“This is in addition to 4,130 MW of new rooftop solar PV capacity, which will also influence prices by lowering demand and through exports.
“This diversity of generation and storage puts us in a strong position to manage the forecast retirement of ageing thermal generators and highlights the importance of being smart in how we connect resources to the grid and ensure the back-up needed for a secure supply, so the benefits of low cost and low emission generation aren’t eroded.”
While the report indicates wholesale costs and environmental costs are trending lower in most jurisdictions, it warns that regulated network charges are increasing.
“We can now see far enough into the future to be confident that power prices paid by consumers will continue to trend downwards over the next three years,” Collyer said.
“But while wholesale costs and environmental costs are trending lower, we are starting to see increases in the cost of network investments, and this is likely to accelerate over the next decade as more network investment is required to connect dispersed new generation to the grid.”
Queensland is predicted to see the biggest price drop over the next three years, with prices expected to fall by 10%, or $126, to their lowest level in more than a decade.
The report predicts the price falls will be driven by more than 1.3 GW of new solar and wind generation and 100 MW of new battery storage coming online in the state’s southeast in the reporting period.
“Significant new generation has been committed in southeast Queensland,” Collyer said, highlighting the 200 MW Bluegrass Solar Farm being constructed by Spanish solar EPC X-Elio near Chinchilla on Queensland’s Western Downs, the 162 MW Columboola Solar Farm being developed at nearby Miles, and 120 MW Gangarri Solar Farm developed by Shell in the state’s south west.
Collyer also identified the Kennedy Energy, Maryborough, Warwick stage 1 and 2, Western Downs and Woolonga solar projects and the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South BESS project being developed by Singapore-based Vena Energy.
Electricity prices are forecast to fall by 4% ($50) by 2024 in New South Wales, 8% ($99) or in Victoria, 6% (125) in Tasmania, while a modest drop of 2% ($35) in South Australia is predicted.
The report said wholesale prices would fall in South Australia despite the withdrawal of 420 MW of generation capacity with the closure of the Torrens Island and Osborne units over the next few years.
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) is the only jurisdiction where power bills are predicted to rise. A net increase of 4%, or $77, is forecast by 2024.
Collyer said the modelling showed prices in the ACT increasing by $99 this financial year, and by $123 the following, before falling by $145 in 2023/24.
“A comparatively large number of ACT consumers, 28.7%, are still on standing offers rather than cheaper market offers so there are savings available to households if they shop around for a better deal,” she said.
The report said the price rise would be driven by rising wholesale and network costs, driven by increases in transmission and distribution costs.
It said environmental costs in the ACT would also increase due to the costs of large-scale Feed-in Tariff Schemes.
The report does not include the Northern Territory or Western Australia, which are not part of the NEM.

Investments in gas and electricity networks, the broader energy transition, and energy services; including storage, EVs and waste-to-energy, accounted for $57.2 billion of the quarter’s total of $72.8 billion in deal value.
This trend of a higher focus on renewable deals began its ramp up in the first half of 2020. EY strategy and transactions partner, Miles Huq, in previous conversations with pv magazine, said individual deals in renewable energy are typically lower in value, so the total value driven by these transactions shows continued investor confidence.
That mark of $72.8b in deal value represents the highest level of investment in the last eight quarters, showing the potential of a return to pre-pandemic levels of deal activity. Corporate investors acquired $8.3b of renewable assets in Q3, as compared to $3.2b acquisitions by financial investors.
There were 53 deals in the Americas, which includes Central and South America, with cumulative deal value of $23.9b, a 69% increase from Q2. Value was driven by very large “megadeals” in energy services and networks assets. Renewable assets drove deal volume with 17 deals.
The report also asserts that utilities are trying to sell off their fossil fuel generation assets, instead focusing on keeping nuclear, renewables and regulated businesses in their portfolios. In return, financial investors are jumping at discounted assets that are critical for grid stability. To illustrate this point, the authors point to the Public Service Enterprise Group selling off its 13 gas-fired plants to ArcLight Capital, a private equity investor, for $1.9b against the assets’ book value of $4.5b.
And while emergent climate and renewable tech historically have been slow in drawing large investment activity, that narrative may be changing, as Q3 saw significant investments in hydrogen technologies. According to the report, gas utilities are increasingly betting on hydrogen to help them transition to clean energy companies.
For example, the report outlines that Avangrid announced plans to construct a 20 MW electrolyzer and hydrogen storage facility for its Connecticut gas and electric utilities, powered by renewable energy from offshore wind. Across the country, American utilities have announced more than 26 hydrogen pilot projects.
