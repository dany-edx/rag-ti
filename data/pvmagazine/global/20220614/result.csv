https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/14/chinese-pv-industry-brief-jolywood-scraps-solar-plans-in-indonesia/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"JUNE 14, 2022",Chinese PV Industry Brief: Jolywood scraps solar plans in Indonesia,"Jolywood‘s board has decided to scrap a plan to invest in Indonesia because the pandemic has complicated its efforts. The company cited a range of issues, from flights to logistics. Its original plan, announced in March 2021, was to invest in 1 GW of solar cell and 1.5 GW of PV module capacity in Indonesia. 
Hangzhou First Applied Material has announced plans to invest $226 million in EVA film capacity expansion. The company, which is among the world’s largest manufacturers of EVA film for PV modules, plans to build a new EVA film production base in Vietnam. The plan still needs to be approved by several agencies and regulators in China, however. 
Qujing, a city in Yunnan province, has revealed plans to develop 18.3 GW of solar by 2024. More specifically, it aims to build 50 solar farms, with a total capacity of 4.83 GW, by the end of this year. It said it will install 4.91 GW in 2023 and 8.59 GW in 2024, when it aims to have generate 20 TWh of electricity per year from renewables.
IDG Energy Investment will pay €50 million ($52.3 million) for PV wet processing units owned by Germany's Rena Technologies GmbH. Under the terms of the deal, Rena Technologies will exit the Chinese solar market for five years and will licence its solar wet processing patents to IDG Energy Investment for a period of 15 years. Rena Technologies produces wet processing equipment for the renewables market, semiconductors, medical technology, and glass. IDG Energy Investment said the move would give it access to “leading technologies of manufacturing high-throughput cleaning equipment and copper plating equipment.”

The aim was to compete with conventional, 10-minute fueling times for diesel vehicles. The team demonstrated an average mass flow rate of 14 kg/min (21 kg/min peak) with a 40.3 kg fill into a bank of eight hydrogen storage tanks – similar to those used by HD vehicles – in 2.87 minutes. The researchers used 3-D computational fluid dynamic modeling for the project and are now working on a 60 kg to 80 kg fill in under 10 minutes.
Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin and University College London (UCL) have visualized the water distribution in a fuel cell, three-dimensionally and in real time. The researchers said part of the water produced from oxygen and hydrogen in fuel cells should remain to keep the membrane moist. However, most of the water must be taken out to avoid affecting efficiency. They tried to optimize the tiny channels milled into metal plates on both sides of the membrane to allow hydrogen, air and water to flow in and out. The researchers, who used neutron radiation to improve the quality of the images, are also collaborating with Institut Laue-Langevin and Université Grenoble Alpes.
DNV said in a newly published report that hydrogen will only account for 0.5% of the global energy mix in 2030 and only 5% by 2050. It said that hydrogen uptake will need to roughly triple to meet 15% of total global energy demand by the middle of the century, in order to meet the targets in the Paris Agreement. “This will require a surplus of renewable energy, to power an electrolyzer capacity of 3,100 GW. This is more than twice the total installed generation capacity of solar and wind today,” said the Norwegian classification society. It sees a vital role for blue hydrogen in the short term, but noted that its competitiveness will fall as renewable energy capacity increases and prices drop.
TotalEnergies has agreed to acquire a 25% stake in Adani New Industries (ANIL), which is the renewables unit of Adani Enterprises. ANIL will become the exclusive platform for Adani and TotalEnergies to produce and market green hydrogen on a large scale in India. ANIL aims to produce 1 million metric tons of green hydrogen per year (Mtpa) by 2030, based on approximately 30 GW of new renewables capacity.
Volvo Construction Equipment has started testing the world’s first fuel cell articulated hauler prototype, the Volvo HX04. It said the prototype can be charged with 12 kg of hydrogen in about 7,5 minutes, for about four hours of operation.
TECO 2030 has teamed up with partners Ektank, Shell Shipping and Maritime, and DNV to launch Hy-Ekotank, its hydrogen-powered tanker concept. The concept is based on a retrofit installation of fuel cells with compressed or liquid hydrogen storage, said the Norwegian company.
Wood Mackenzie said the total potential demand for low-carbon hydrogen in the refining sector could reach up to 50 Mtpa by 2050.

The group of companies, which also includes engineering consultancy GHD and environmental planning and design consultancy Boffa Miskell, recently secured
a contract to investigate the engineering, environmental planning, and geotechnical feasibility of the project.
During the project's first phase, the consortium will evaluate the feasibility of different pumped hydro configurations at the lake and other possible locations around the country. It will also consider different pumped hydro systems as a technical solution to resolve New Zealand’s “dry year problem.” In addition, it will investigate the nearby availability of materials for dam construction, the geology of the possible dam wall area, tunneling costs, early geotechnical details, and environmental and cultural impacts.
“The Lake Onslow option referenced by the Interim Climate Change Committee could be anticipated to provide at least 5 TWh of annual generation/storage,” the government said. “It is estimated to have a construction timeframe of four to five years, with commissioning and filling taking a further two years”
In the second phase, Rōpū Matatau will perform geotechnical and engineering field work, analyze local geology, and determine the exact location of the project.
“Te Rōpū Matatau has been granted resource consents and other permits to undertake geotechnical, geological and hydrogeological investigations, which will inform the Lake Onslow feasibility study,” the government said.
Preliminary work began at the first site in April and is expected to continue at various times throughout the year at a number of sites near Lake Onslow. The feasibility study will likely be concluded by the end of the year.
According to New Zealand's University of Canterbury, the pumped hydro storage facility could have a head of 650 meters and a “very large” storage capacity. It would also require an atypical scheme design, due to the 20 km distance from the Clutha River.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/14/hydrogen-generation-from-organic-waste-non-recyclable-plastic/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JUNE 14, 2022","Hydrogen generation from organic waste, non-recyclable plastic","New York-based H2-Industries has announced a plan to produce 300,000 tons of hydrogen per year in Egypt, out of up to 4 million tons of organic waste and non-recyclable plastic.
The company said its Suez Canal Project is the first of its kind in the world. It explained that hydrogen production at the planned facility could achieve a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) that is almost half of other existing green hydrogen production technologies, and also lower than that of gray hydrogen.
“We are currently in discussion for similar projects in 30 countries from South America, Europe, the Middle East to all areas in Africa,” H2 Industries Executive Chairman Michael Stusch told pv magazine, noting that preliminary approvals for the project in Egypt have already been secured.
H2-Industries uses a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technology, which it considers to be the cheapest, safest, and most reliable transportation method. Its system is based on integrated thermolysis plant units based on pre-assembled scalable modules in standard container frames, which are designed to produce hydrogen from non-recyclable plastic waste such as hydrocarbons like polyethylene, biogenic residues from agriculture, forestry, food waste, and sewage sludge.
“Thermolysis is not waste combustion, but rather a high-temperature conversion process without oxygen or air to produce hydrogen,” Stusch explained. “The thermolysis units decompose waste at temperatures of around 900 C and close to ambient pressure in the presence of steam reforming. The integrated process splits and regroups the feedstock molecules into a hydrogen-rich gas mixture and, finally, the hydrogen is purified from this mixture.”
Stusch claimed that waste-to-hydrogen is a game-changer. “A change in paradigms takes a little longer, but we are convinced it will have the bigger impact,” he said.
The technology will jump-start when the first production plants show that hydrogen from organic waste and non-recyclable plastic will be cheaper than green hydrogen, he said, noting that this may also require a supportive regulatory framework. In addition, he noted that Europe's waste sectors are over-regulated, which poses a range of challenges.
“Nevertheless, we are in touch with potential partners in various European regions. Countries with underdeveloped waste sectors often are very open to our technology,” said Stusch.
In late April, H2 Industries unveiled plans to develop a $1.4 billion waste-to-hydrogen plant in conjunction with PV solar power plants and baseload capacity in Oman.
Core criticism
Not everybody is in favor of using waste-to-hydrogen technology. Canadian expert Martin said that municipal solid waste (MSW) contains some energy but that any fuel that you make out of it has to be considered fossil fuel.
“Once you take into account the energy needed to dry it, the net energy in excess of the energy required for drying, is of fossil origin,” he told pv magazine, adding that it is better to bury non-recyclable plastics. “They cease to degrade. They do not release their fossil CO2 content for thousands of years.”
According to Martin, there is a growing interest in technology, especially in countries running out of landfill space. “They should therefore focus on better waste segregation, waste reduction, and recycling. Switching from landfilling to air-filling is not a good tradeoff.”
He also argued that wet organic content should be removed at the source and fed to anaerobic digesters to make biogas. “It needs not to be converted to hydrogen, wasting at least 30% of its energy content in the process.”

The Abu Dhabi-based entity held its first auction of CECs in September 2021. The organizers of the scheme claimed that it was the first program in the world to issue certificates that classify nuclear power generation as “clean energy.”
The Abu Dhabi Department of Energy is issuing the certificates in megawatt-hour blocks. They can be bought by energy consumers to offset the carbon emissions associated with the energy they consume.
The last CEC auction was held in March. EWEC announced the fourth CEC auction by urging more energy offtakers to participate. Last October, the utility signed a deal to supply enough certificates to cover “up to 100%” of the electricity consumption of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/14/a-simmering-cauldron-of-revenue-cannibalization/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE,SPAIN,SWEDEN",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 14, 2022",A simmering cauldron of renewables ‘revenue cannibalization’ ,"Swiss consultancy Pexapark has published a new report, “The Effect of Cannibalization,” that looks at “renewables’ silent risk.” Ostensibly, the report is a “back to the basics” guide to “revenue cannibalism,” whereby the oversaturation of renewables on the grid at particular times could see technologies like PV eat into its own profits. But there are also some insights to be had into how the European market for power purchase agreements might deal with this growing risk. 
With more and more renewables set for development over the next decade, and renewed support in the form of the European Commission’s REPowerEU strategy, the cannibalization effect poses a serious threat in the long-run “to the viability of renewables operating on the free market,” according to Pexapark. 
“Pricing cannibalization risk into your PPA is important to ensure your agreed pricing is far not only today but also throughout the tenor of the agreement when cannibalization impact is more prominent when renewables build-out increases,” it said. 
Of course, the risk of cannibalization is already well-known.
“This is why in mature PPA markets,” the report states, noting that in Spain and Sweden, in particular, “we see the shift of buyers demanding baseload PPAs, and pay-as-produced (PAP) structures providing significant discounts, because the cannibalization risk has been factored in.” 
New beginning 
Maritina Kanellakopoulou, an analyst for Pexapark, told pv magazine that the reason for this higher interest in baseload PPAs is not driven by energy storage. “We see a notable surge of interest in the solar-plus-storage topic,” says Kanellakopoulou, “[The levelized cost of electricity] is still too high to allow for large-scale adoption.” 
However, it’s not all doom and gloom.
“The higher interest in baseload PPAs is driven by the better demand and thus higher prices shown by utility offtakers,” said Kanellakopoulou. “For solar, baseload profiles have been called impossible, but physical backing by storage assets starts to make baseload hedging for PV assets much more palatable, as it addresses fears around the structural mismatch between production and contract profiles.” 
While widespread adoption of solar-plus-storage is still inhibited by price, it seems as if some deals of this nature are being done. Energy storage for baseload hedging for PV assets is becoming more “palatable,” and perhaps the age of solar-plus-storage enabling baseload PPAs is dawning. 
Of course, baseload PPAs are more mature for wind assets in Nordic countries and also in Spain. Kanellakopoulou pointed to the recent deal between Alcoa and Greenalia as an example of this. 
Because the market for PAP PPAs is becoming increasingly saturated by offtakers wanting to warehouse their cannibalization risk, costs are starting to become prohibitively high. According to Kanellakopoulou, “storage is a genuine alternative which is not based on trading. The most immediate action one can take, is to review co-location with battery storage, as it’s the quickest way to shield from the cannibalization effect.” 
Werner Trabesinger, the head of quantitative products at Pexapark and a co-author of the report, told pv magazine “that baseload-profiled PPA contracts receive substantially better prices, as they do not shift the burden of cannibalization risk onto the offtakers. In other words, the economics of baseload – hedged PV assets is much more favourable.”
However, many project owners fear that entering into baseload hedges will push them into an active role in the spot markets.
“They fear is that spot markets might work systematically against them, causing poor overall performance,” said Trabesinger. “Colocated BESS assets help circumvent this issue, as they allow for storing production volumes for release during higher-priced hours. In this sense, they ‘future-proof' assets against cannibalization issues.”
The LCOE is still too high for widespread adoption of co-located solar-plus-storage projects, but the higher revenue from higher PPA prices – combined with the cannibalization risk reduction provided by a BESS asset – significantly improves the profitability of such projects. As Trabesinger put it, “we feel that the tipping point might very soon be reached.”

“The primary contribution of this work is to perform such multi-objective optimizations for VFB and LIB systems using the most detailed degradation models available for each technology,” they said, noting that they see solar oversizing, storage power, and storage duration as the main variables.
The group used a mixed-integer linear programming approach to calculate the self-sufficiency ratio of the storage solutions and a hybrid VFB-LIB system. The solar facility was assumed to have a capacity of 636 kW, to power a grocery store in a single-floor building.
“The facility is active seven days a week and displays a broad peak between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m.,” the researchers said. “In the summer, shorter load spikes occur during the active hours, presumably due to air cooling load.”
The roundtrip AC efficiencies of the LIBs and VFBs were assumed to be 0.94 and 0.78, respectively, and the plant operation was optimized 24 hours at a time, with the assumption of perfect forecasting of PV and demand within this time frame. A rain-flow-counting algorithm was applied to the state-of-charge (SOC) profile of both LIB and VFB in order to calculate their degradation.
The academics found that both the LIBs and VFBs, as well as their hybridization, with an oversized PV array, could achieve a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of less than $0.22/kWh, while still providing a self-sufficiency ratio of 0.95.
“Between 0.8 and 0.95 SSR, the optimum duration of both systems is six to 7.5 hours,” the scientists said. “The optimal choice of LIB or VFB depends on both the CAPEX assumptions and the assumptions regarding LIB cell temperature with respect to the ambient climate.”
The group said that LIBs are the cheaper option with a high SSR, as they require battery oversizing and a lower number of cycles.
“VFB manufacturers should focus on sites with high upper ambient temperature ranges, as LIB will suffer increased LCOE in these situations,” the scientists. “Given the overlap in LCOE for LIB and VFB depending on the scenario, it is likely that other factors will come into consideration when making the choice between the two technologies.”
The scientists presented their findings in “The economics of firm solar power from Li-ion and vanadium flow batteries in California,” which was recently published in Large-scale Energy Storage.

Hanersun’s president, Yunzhou Liu discusses what is behind the name change and what the company envisions for its future.
Our company Hanersun, formerly known as CSUNPOWER, was originated from China Electrical Equipment Group (CEEG), which was established in 2004 and played an important role in the history of Chinese solar industry. Before 2018, CEEG is one of the main shareholders of CSUNPOWER.  After June 18, 2018, CSUNPOWER separated from CEEG and operated independently from then on. We have always insisted on providing customers with cutting-edge solar modules, and comprehensive solar solutions for the entire project lifecycle. And on May 1st, 2022, as is known to all, our brand changed to Hanersun officially.
First, the new name Hanersun is a tribute to the past and a longing for the future, representing not only our long journey of innovation and pursuit of excellence, but also our constant effort and commitment to solar industry.  Second, we want our brand to be very unique and easy to remember, sometimes, our clients were confused Csunpower with other brands, and therefore we decided to differentiate us from others creatively and make sure our brand can be well recognized in the future.
We brought our new TOPCon module, HITOUCH 5N, to the Intersolar. This new series combines 182mm TOPCon solar cell, multi bus bar (MBB), high density encapsulation with other small design changes, and overall module efficiency of up to 22.4%–all of which makes it an ideal choice for C&I rooftop system and utility-scale solar projects.
In addition, we also brought our newly released storage product HISMART RS to Munich. It’s a low- voltage lithium battery especially designed for residential applications with excellent performance, safe battery technology, and an optimized user experience. The built-in auto recognition function and the plug & play design allow for easy installation, maintenance and capacity expansion.
We have already obtained orders of over 300 MW from customers in Europe and South America. These shipments will have the new name. The first batch of modules bearing Hanersun trademark were shipped from the factory in Yangzhou, China at the beginning of June, which marks the successful brand renewal of the company and the official beginning of global shipment of Hanersun products. Thanks to the thorough preparation of our marketing team, the brand switch has processed smoothly. All of our global clients have been supportive and understanding.
We are now in the process of negotiating with the government of Xuancheng, Anhui province to implement our next-generation module manufacturing facility. The plan is to invest $30 million for2 GW TOPCON + HJT technology production lines, which should be operational in early 2023 to keep pace with the strong global demand in the field of high-efficiency solar modules. We warmly welcome all the customers to come to the new factory opening ceremony early next year to celebrate Hanersun’s next step in the solar industry.
Yes, the 210 bifacial module is our best seller in 2021 due to its high cost performance that makes it perfectly suitable for large-scale power stations. Orders of more than 200 MW 600W+ bifacial modules were shipped last year, which made us one of the major manufacturers of 600W+ bifacial module in the industry.
At the same time, we have been doing research on the next-generation module technology. At present, our TOPCon modules get to mass-produce status and HJT is still in the technical reserve stage. We won’t miss any opportunity to provide our customers with better choices.
First of all, I want to emphasize that although we have changed our brand name, we will not change any promise that we made as CSUNPOWER and will continue to guarantee the best quality of our products either already sold out or to deliver in the future, as well as the most professional services to our global clients.
Despite the constant commitment, there will still be changes in our business strategy, we will be more globalized and more localized. We already had branch companies in Japan, the US, Vietnam, and Pakistan to provide services for local customers, and recently we established one more branch company in Netherlands, to expand our localization service map. In the future, we will always pursue the quicker response to the market and contribute our technological strength to the industry.

It works through the so-called piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric materials are commonly used for engineering applications, mainly as actuators and sensors generating and sensing mechanical deformation in materials.
“The effect of piezoelectric materials polarized by mechanical strain or vibration on photovoltaic or photocatalytic performances is called the piezo-phototronic effect,” the scientists said. “The piezo-phototronic effect has attracted attention for improving the performances of photovoltaic devices and LEDs by rearranging the energy bands at the p-n junction.”
Researcher Taizo Kobayashi said the cells could be produced at lower costs than copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) or perovskite thin-film solar cells, as the p-type selenium used in the devices is an inexpensive element.
“Potential applications are thin-film flexible piezoelectric-photovoltaic devices that can generate electricity simply from indoor lighting produced by LEDs and compact fluorescent lamps, or self-powered strain sensing devices,” Kobayashi told pv magazine.
The group fabricated the solar cell on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film with sputter-deposited ZnMgO thin film and photo-absorbing selenium as the n-type window layer and p-type layer, respectively.

“When compressive strain is applied on the ZnMgO layer, which is piezoelectric, wurtzite and semiconducting, a negatively polarized ZnMgO region is formed near the Se layer,” the scientists said.
The polarization decreases the conduction band offset (CBO) at the interface of ZnMgO and Se layer. The CBO is the energy difference between bands of materials when considering a semiconductor heterostructure.
“ZnO has a non-centrosymmetric wurtzite-type crystallographic structure which can induce piezoelectric polarization charges on its surface under strain,” said the scientists.
Wurtzite zinc oxide (ZnO) is a remarkable multifunctional zinc sulfide mineral with a hexagonal structure, a distinctive property set, and a huge range of existing and emerging applications. The ZnMgO piezoelectric layer is deformed to negatively polarize ZnMgO/Se interface. As a result, the positive piezoelectric polarization charges can be generated at the interface between the ZnMgO and indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layers. This is turn forms a barrier that facilitates carrier collection from both layers via excessive negative polarization.
The scientists applied different strain levels to the ZnMgO/Se interface and the cell performance was measured to assess the impact of this variation. When the applied strain was increased from 0.41% to 0.40% by varying the bending angle, the device's open-circuit voltage increased from 0.59 V to 0.75 V. The scientists claim this paves the way for significant efficiency improvements for ZnMgO/Se heterojunction photovoltaic devices based on piezo-phototronic effects.
They introduced the new cell concept in “Impact of piezo-phototronic effect on ZnMgO/Se heterojunction photovoltaic devices,” which was recently published in Nano Energy.
“Since ZnMgO/Se heterojunction can be fabricated by only common sputtering and evaporation system, it is considered that it is not difficult to fabricate the proposed device commercially,” said Kobayashi.

The Weazer habitation module is purportedly 100% self-sufficient for energy and water supplies. Electricity is provided by a rooftop PV array and water comes from filtered and sterilized rainwater.
“The special purification technology used does not generate sewage drainage, so it does not damage the environment at the installation site,” the company said.

The size of the small building can be adjusted according to the needs of clients by combining different units. It can be installed in just a few days, according to Arth. It can also host electric vehicle recharging.
“Since it is self-sufficient for energy generation, it can be also used as an emergency evacuation site,” the company said, without revealing more details.
Arth plans to install the first prototype in Nishiizu, Shizuoka prefecture, in the fall. It wants to provide the system to hotels, resorts, and emergency evacuation areas.
“We will deploy the Weazer residential unit in areas with vulnerable infrastructure,” it said.

REC Silicon and Ferroglobe have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to develop an end-to-end US solar supply chain from raw silicon, to polysilicon, and finally fully assembled modules. Recent investment into REC Silicon by the Hanwha Group, in conjunction with Hanwha’s subsidiary Qcells, was the impetus for the MOU.
REC Silicon is a producer of advanced silicon materials, supplying high-purity polysilicon and silicon gases to the solar industry worldwide, and it was producing silicon in its facility in Moses Lake, Washington, until mid-2019, when China imposed steep tariffs on US-made polysilicon, in retaliation for tariffs imposed on Chinese-made solar panels in 2013.
In the REC Silicon audiocast Q4 2021, CEO James May said that investments by Hanwha in January “improves the company’s liquidity position and is expected to give us the capital necessary to restart the FBR facility in Moses Lake and make targeted investments in and improve our product portfolio in the semiconductor materials segment.” The Moses Lake facility is expected to be operational again in 2023.
Ferroglobe is a producer of silicon metal and its alloys and it supplies critical materials for many industrial and consumer products, from silicones to solar power cells, from steel to aluminum to foundry components. The company will be a critical partner in ensuring a steady supply of fully traceable metallurgical grade silicon metal produced in the US from locally sourced raw materials.
In March, Hanwha Solutions, parent corporation of Qcells, announced that it was stepping up efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products when it became the largest shareholder of REC Silicon. Following its initial $160 million acquisition to acquire a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha announced that it was acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at around $44 million. This investment will help American manufacturers secure the raw material critical to the solar supply chain.
Hanwha’s US initiative supports the Biden administration’s efforts to increase solar power generation by 40% and to decarbonize all electricity by 2035. Hanwha sees the enactment of the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) as critical to a US-based solar supply chain.
