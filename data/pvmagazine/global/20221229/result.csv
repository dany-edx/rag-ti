ESIA was launched in Brussels on Dec. 9 and the months ahead will be a litmus test for the European political and industrial community to check the seriousness of intent for a PV manufacturing renaissance in Europe.
The ambition evident in the EU Solar Energy Strategy adopted by the European Commission in May, and developments in global solar equipment production, bear witness to huge expectations related to European solar demand. The US has seriously entered the race to re-establish PV manufacturing, with the support measures in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). That policy package offers incentives ranging from $0.127 per Watt-peak of solar generation capacity manufactured to $0.197/Wp, to be applied to US-made equipment until 2029, with the figures then tapering down until 2033. That equates to US-made panels being 30% to 50% cheaper than before the IRA’s provisions. The $369 billion legislation – which dedicates $40 billion to PV manufacturing – is a game-changer.
European solar ambitions cannot be viewed in isolation from the US policy drive but the EU is a hostage to its commitment to leveling the trade playing field among its member states, without reference to external markets. The energy crisis is further threatening the competitiveness of European industry. European solar manufacturers want an IRA moment in the EU, to avoid the continent becoming totally dependent on a mix of the current Chinese imports and future, made-in-America PV products.
The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) in December made overtures to the European Commission about what the bloc’s planned ESIA organization should address. The fundamental dilemma for Brussels is whether to stick to its internal-market fair-trade principles, and thus surrender any chance of competitive renewables manufacturing in Europe, or to distance itself from its long-held approach to trade. The ESMC says the answer is to take temporary, emergency action to help European solar manufacturing get onto its feet without abandoning, in the longer-term, the EU’s core values.
The ESMC has pointed out the severity of the energy crisis is, in part, down to sluggish deployment of clean energy facilities – the EU should avoid moving too slowly again when it comes to legislating for European solar manufacturing. European companies stand ready to develop 30 GW of solar production capacity – along the supply chain – within three years, but only if the right conditions are put in place for finance, and help is provided with capital investment and operational costs. Manufacturers would also need to believe demand will exist for their products.
The EU has already invoked article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to introduce emergency measures to protect energy consumers and to keep its clean energy targets viable. The ESMC wants policymakers to use the same approach to exempt solar manufacturers from clearly-defined parts of the bloc’s state aid rules, for a temporary period.
EU member states should be allowed to support PV manufacturing with financial support from the bloc's funding frameworks, such as the Covid-related Recovery and Resilience Facility, the Just Transition Fund, the Cohesion Fund, and other instruments. At the same time, the European Commission could temporarily abandon its state aid procedures for PV manufacturing.
For Europe, now, it is of the utmost importance to scale up solar manufacturing. That 30 GW of production capacity will enable European companies to become globally competitive. Current EU funding for solar manufacture is earmarked for innovative products. Such substantial support is important to raise European competitiveness in the long term but, right now, Europe needs to mobilize finance to scale up manufacturing capacity. Activation of emergency support measures for solar production, using article 122, is the fastest, most sustainable way to scale up production to the extent needed.
The European Commission has already taken actions in response to the IRA legislation. The Clean Tech Europe framework was endorsed weeks ago, to build bridges between companies and policymakers, and ESIA has been launched with the target of endorsing a strategic action plan for European PV manufacturing.
The ESMC understands the holistic approach taken by the commission while evaluating potential European solar support measures. However, the current situation requires extraordinary measures to be applied by ESIA, in close cooperation with the commission. There is an immediate threat that, unless measures are put in place in the first three months of the new year, European companies, specialists, and capital will move to the US to build production lines, rendering a build-up of European industry impossible.
The EU solar trade deficit has reached an average of €10 billion ($10.6 billion) to €12 billion. If European PV manufacturing challenges are not addressed with a clearly defined emergency plan of financial support, that figure will rise to at least €15 billion to €20 billion annually in the years ahead. Investing the equivalent of a year or two of such deficits into emergency support measures for PV now can save European solar manufacturing and help it build long-term competitiveness. As European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told the College of Europe on Dec. 4, “Our state aid frameworks exist to preserve our precious single market. But if investments in strategic sectors leak away from Europe, this would only undermine the single market. And that is why we are now reflecting on how to simplify and adapt our state aid rules.”
The European PV manufacturing industry, ESIA, and the European Commission should operationalize emergency measures as soon as possible with an open mind, a dedicated effort, and concrete breakthrough proposals for scaling up European solar manufacturing.

The developer signed a joint cooperation agreement with Yemen’s Ministry of Electricity and Energy earlier this month. The deal includes the construction of transmission lines and transformer stations.
The solar project will be built in Aden. The 120 MW plant will be the “first and the largest strategic project to generate electricity through clean and renewable energy” in Yemen, according to the Yemeni Energy Minister Manea bin Yameen.
The ministry has reportedly started conducting surveys for the project. It did not reveal the project completion date or any other details, but it noted that the solar plant will reduce the cost of electricity generation during the daytime and contribute to lowering Yemen’s carbon footprint.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Yemen’s cumulative renewable capacity was 253 MW at the end of 2021, all from solar. Reports from local NGOs and the Ministry of Electricity and Energy put the country’s total installed solar capacity between 300 MW and 400 MW in 2018. Rooftop PV and small-scale solar applications like water pumps are expected to account for all the installed capacity.
According to a recent paper by Berlin-based Energy Access and Development Program (EADP), solar become the main source of energy for Yemeni households after 2016 – two years after the start of its ongoing civil war. EADP said that 75% of the urban population and 50% of the rural population in Yemen have access to solar energy.

While promising, production volumes of heterojunction (HJT) cells remain far below TOPCon. JinkoSolar has been at the vanguard of adopting the technology in large volumes. Even by mid-2022, Jinko was reporting having some 16 GW of TOPCon module capacity, and an order book of some 8 GW – with expectations that would swell to 20 GW.
Jinko’s Tiger Neo n-type tops out at 21.82% module efficiency with power classes up to 625W in a 78 full-cell format.
“Neo did rank highest in Exawatt’s PV Module Tracker in terms of efficiency in our TOPCon category and also because Jinko has such large capacities it also dominates our TOPCon category in terms of production volume,” says Molly Morgan, a senior research analyst for Exawatt.
Jinko is far from alone in switching large production volumes to TOPCon. Canadian Solar aims to produce M10 (182 mm) and G12 (210 mm) TOPCon solar cells in the first quarter of 2023 and targets 30% of its sales shipments to be based on the technology for the year.
As Touloupas notes, TOPCon does not trail HJT at present by any wide margin in terms of efficiency. Canadian targets 25% efficiency on its TOPCon lines, and Chinese rival Trina achieved 24.24% for n-type TOPCon solar cells on a G12 wafer in August. Trina targets 20 GW of TOPCon capacity by the end of the year – although initial plans had been delayed.
Beyond the cell
While perhaps not a trend, there is also innovation on the module front that may evolve into larger developments going forward. There has been considerable convergence around half-cut cells, large format modules for utility scale, and multi-busbar interconnection – the latter increasingly using round wires.
However, there is continuing innovation around new or more mature module concepts for niche applications. The range of flexible and lightweight modules available is growing. Notable is Chinese metal wrap through (MWT) producers Sunport – which appears to have found a suitable application for its novel cell structure, in a flexible module, the S Flex II.
The range of modules for BIPV applications, along with mounting structures, is growing as the segment slowly builds momentum. This includes colored and patterned modules and also produced with robust materials that meet rigorous building codes.
Major cell producer Tongwei is also making progress with its shingling technology, demonstrating that a large-volume Chinese producer is confident it can bring it into large scale production – albeit with products initially targeted for rooftops. Tongwei’s Terra Series is currently based on p-type PERC cells, and while not high performance does offer other advantages.
“Tongwei claim they have their own way of interconnecting, so they don’t have IP concerns,” says George Touloupas, senior director of Clean Energy Associates (CEA). “The big advantages are hotspot resilience, because of the low current and the way it is interconnected, and lead reduction, due to the absence of soldered cells.”
Touloupas adds that he understands that the company is exploring a new cell layout that would be even more resistant to hotspots that it may deploy in the near future.
“Tongwei has the guts to do shingling and this technology has a great potential to give very reliable modules, if done correctly, so that is a genuine improvement,” he says.
The modern history of PV cell and module development has been one based on incremental improvements; step-by-step rather than major leaps. 2022 has seen more steps taken on this journey, and a number of promising pathways in the form of TOPCon, HJT, and shingling are being pursued.

Microgrids not dissimilar from the one in Castañer, Puerto Rico, highlighted in the first part of this series, are also being used to run pumps in order to access groundwater. And this is just one example of how solar is helping in the battle against water scarcity in many parts of the world.
The solar-water nexus is a rapidly expanding network of applications and for many regions around the world solar’s ability to work on small scale could reap big benefits.
On the island of Zanzibar, diesel generators are used to pump often quite brackish water through rundown pipes at a cost of over $200,000 a month. The Zanzibar Water Authority (ZAWA) wants to use off-grid solar systems to operate water pumps at its bore holes, treatment reservoirs and distribution network.
ZAWA Director General Salha Mohammed Kassim told pv magazine that only 36% of households are water connected on the island of 1.7 million people.
“We have a long way to go to get to 100%, but for this reason we are looking to off-grid solar,” said Kassim.

Another application in the solar-water nexus is solar-powered desalination. This is a deployable off-grid solution in drought-ridden regions like Somalia, but it is also attractive at the larger scale to supply water for industry – notably green hydrogen.
McKinsey & Company says that companies with water-intensive operations can reduce their risk by switching to renewables. From analysis of 1,500 companies in the chemicals and food-and-beverage processing industries, it found that a considerable amount of the energy purchases came in countries with low renewables uptake and high levels of water stress, resulting in disproportionate impacts for water and emissions. The analysis showed that a 50% increase in renewables purchasing, would provide a 60% reduction in water consumption in both sectors.
One particularly promising trend is that of installing solar above canals, particularly in regions battling water scarcity. Canal-top solar was pioneered in India a decade ago when the first canal-top solar array was installed in Gujarat. But new findings from the University of California (UC) and Project Nexus are now highlighting the symbiotic nature of the solution, which helps to save water while generating energy and all without occupying arable land.

“Using canal infrastructure for solar development can make both systems more efficient. Shade from the solar panels can reduce evaporation of water from the canals, especially during hot Californian summers,” said Brandi McKuin, a UC Merced environmental engineer and the study’s lead author. “And because water heats up more slowly than land, the canal water flowing beneath the panels could cool them by a few degrees, boosting electricity production by 3%.”
The study showed that if all 6,500 km of California’s canals were covered with solar panels it would save almost 300 billion liters of water per year and generate 15 GW of renewable energy.
Building-integrated PV
Building-integrated PV (BIPV) has long held great promise, but large-scale applicability remains a challenge. In the last decade, BIPV’s technological and aesthetic improvements have made it more feasible across a broader range of projects. One interesting use case for BIPV is in the renovation and emissions reduction of historical buildings.
“The fact that you can develop new products based on crystalline technology which hide the solar cells makes it easier to employ solar in renovation projects because the glass is going to look like any other material, such as ceramic tile or stone,” said Teodosio del Caño, chief technical officer of Spain-based Onyx Solar.

Onyx Solar has already installed innovative BIPV solutions on historic buildings around the world, and del Caño says it is the technology’s aesthetic improvements that have seen the niche grow in recent years. “In the last two years, facades have become our main product,” said del Cańo. “It used to be skylights and canopies, but now façades are an excellent market. There are now no restrictions on using BIPV on the front of a building.”
Sky-scraping solar
The technology improvements in BIPV facades are something the owners and operators of tall buildings are keeping an eye on, especially as avenues for emissions reductions for grid-reliant buildings are rather limited.
With the exploding populations of global cities, many of us live in work in places that have long been solar deserts. For most of history the rather small rooftop size compared to the structure’s overall square footage made the generation profile of solar hardly worthwhile.
But as solar’s cost has continued to fall and panel energy density increase, the often barren rooftops of cities’ skyscrapers can now provide a respectable percentage of a building’s electricity. Combine that change with the improvements in BIPV technology, particularly when it comes to facades, and suddenly skyscrapers have the potential to be solar powerhouses.
“With the advances in solar technology, energy-dense panels now available exceed 450 W per panel, enabling significant and meaningful renewable projects in [central business district] locations that couldn’t otherwise be achieved on the constrained rooftop,” said Venergy Australia CEO Matthew Wilkins.

Venergy integrated the 223 kW solar system with the building’s regenerative lifts and its trigeneration of 600 kW gas turbines across five commercial towers in downtown Melbourne’s Collins Square, bringing the site’s total generating capacity to 2 MW.
According to a study published in the journal Solar Energy, the buildings in Melbourne’s downtown are capable of providing 74% of their own electricity needs of solar was fully integrated into roofs, walls and windows. Rooftop solar would constitute 88% of this supply, with wall-integrated and window-integrated solar delivering 8% and 4%, respectively.
Monash University Professor Jacek Jesieniak, an author of the study, said that the researchers’ goal “was to showcase that actually there is huge potential (for urban PV, particularly rooftop), it’s just enormous. But people don’t think about it because people tend to think at the scale of a building rather than the scale of a city.”
Jim Stewart, associate director at Fender Katsalidis – the Australian architectural firm behind the world’s second-tallest building, Kuala Lumpur’s 678.9-meter Merdeka 118 (p. 50), topped with a 140 kW solar array for its Park Hyatt Kuala Lumpur hotel – told pv magazine that clients are encouraged to consider PV solutions, as “most buildings over 180 meters tall are not demolished within 50 years. Rooftop solar arrays have become common place in skyscraper design and development.”
Few remain unconvinced of solar’s ability to provide reliable energy in remote off-grid locations or utilise previously barren or single-usage spaces. In 2022 we’ve seen the spectrum of places solar shines expand yet again, even to some of the world’s most hazardous locations.
From offshore oil rigs to remote mine sites and the frontlines of conflict zones, solar power functions where others fail, and it does so without the need of refuelling or regular maintenance. Not only can remote sites use solar and save expensive fuel transportation and upkeep costs, but also reduces worker risk.
These savings have also been noticed by the US military. Brooklyn-based solar fabric and structure developer Pvilion has developed an easy to put up solar tent. Pvilion’s Julia Fowler told pv magazine that the tents do a lot more than provide shelter in forward locations. They also “provide power, convenience, adaptability, heating and cooling, and protection from the elements … with the goal of maximizing mission-objective readiness.”
Interestingly, the solution can also be considered part of the solar-water nexus. The US Army’s Project Arcwater sees the solar tents’ energy generation used to harvest water in agile combat deployment situations.
Senior Master Sgt. Brent Kenny of the 52nd Fighter Wing says a three-day 30-person mission that would normally cost $40,000 would, with the help of the solar tent power other tech such as the water harvester, cost under $600 while providing the same combat capability.
