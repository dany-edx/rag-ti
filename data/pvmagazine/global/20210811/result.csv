The developer said the 10 new projects are all located in southern Sweden and have a combined capacity of around 500 MW, which brings the total capacity of the company's PV project portfolio to over 1 GW. “The company's next target is to increase the development portfolio to 2 GW by the end of 2022 in well-suited locations,” said Helios CEO, Andreas Tunbjer.
No further technical and financial details on the projects were provided.
Several unsubsidized large-scale PV projects have been recently developed in Sweden. Solar developer Alight secured a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for an 8 MW solar park in June and five-year PPA for an 18 MW solar park with Swedish restaurant and catering specialist Martin & Servera in December.
The potential of this segment in the Nordics is still unclear, but signals from neighboring Denmark suggest the region is at the beginning of a new phase. It is worth noting that the Nordic countries already have significant experience with private PPAs from the wind sector, which will be valuable for developers and investors in the solar sector.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) have devised a method that increases hydrogen production up to three times while significantly lowering the energy required for water electrolysis. The research team, led by Prof. C. Subramaniam, demonstrated that a water electrolysis system that produced 1 ml of hydrogen gas, required 19% less energy to produce 3 ml of hydrogen in the same time, when electrolysis was carried out in the presence of an external magnetic field. The team achieved this by synergistically coupling the electric and magnetic fields at the catalytic site. 
Manipulating heterogeneous electrified interfaces with an external magnetic field (Hext) explicitly mandates the constant presence of Hext for achieving magnetoelectrocatalytic kinetic enhancements. The researchers demonstrated the highest kinetic enhancement of 650% in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), without the mandatory presence of Hext. 
The key to this effect is the electrocatalytic (carbon-cobalt oxide catalyst) interface that does not require the constant presence of any external magnetic field and can sustain the magnetization for prolonged time periods. The cobalt-oxide-based catalyst developed by the researchers also provides a cost advantage over platinum (Pt)-based catalysts. 
Speaking to pv magazine, Prof. C. Subramaniam said, “There are numerous attempts to fabricate the best electrocatalyst for water splitting at the low material cost, low energy penalty without compromising on the rate of hydrogen generation. Pt-group-based catalysts are the best known in this direction. However, the prohibitive cost of the catalyst is a huge challenge for commercialization. This led to developing earth-abundant cobalt oxide as catalysts. The cobalt-oxide (Co3O4) nanocubes were dispersed on nanostructured carbon florets as supports to make the final catalyst.”
He continued, “Given the kinetics of water splitting is slow with these catalysts, we developed an innovative solution of coupling an external magnetic field to the electrolytic process.” 
With this approach, the researchers said they were able to obtain a 650% increase in current density, a 19% lowering of energy required, and a three-fold increase in volumetric hydrogen production rate. 
The magnitude of the enhancements achieved is unparalleled. And the intermittent magnetic field required is similar to what a fridge magnet can provide. 
“This route can be directly adopted in existing electrolyzers without any change in design or mode of operation and one-time exposure of magnetic field for 10 minutes is enough to achieve the high rate of hydrogen production for over 45 minutes,” according to the researchers. 
“The intermittent use of an external magnetic field provides a new direction for achieving energy-efficient hydrogen generation. Other catalysts can also be explored for this purpose,” said Prof. Subramaniam. “A basic electrolyzer cell of 0.5 nm3/h capacity can be immediately upgraded to a 1.5 nm3/h capacity by replacing the catalysts and supplying the magnetic field,” added Jayeeta Saha and Ranadeb Ball, project researchers and students at IIT Bombay.  
Having shown that the method is not very complicated either, the team is now working with an industrial partner to ensure its successful commercialization. 
The research findings are published in Sustainable Chem. Eng Journal of American Chemical Society, 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/11/indium-supply-not-an-issue-for-cigs-industry/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 11, 2021",Indium supply not an issue for CIGS industry,"The supply of indium for the production of copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) thin-film solar cells and modules in Europe could be provided exclusively by an EU supply chain and would not pose environmental issues, according to a white paper that was recently published by a group of researchers specializing in the development of this thin-film PV technology.
The association says the European Union recognized the beneficial impact indium can have in a list of critical raw materials that was published last year. The organization considered its use in PV cells and batteries to enable low-carbon energy solutions in the EU economy.
Indium is not a limiting factor for large-scale deployment of CIGS technology, Daniel Lincot and Ayodhya Tiwari, the spokespeople for the research group, told pv magazine.
“The value and actor chains for CIGS are very favorable for this, in particular in Europe,” said Lincot. “Indium production is sufficient for more than 100 GW per year PV production with the potential to meet terawatt challenges in a cost-effective manner.”
Tiwari is also the head of the Laboratory for Thin Films and Photovoltaics at Switzerland’s Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) and the founder of Switzerland-based thin-film module manufacturer Flisom. Lincot is the research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the former scientific director of the L'Institut Photovoltaique d'Ile-de-France (IPVF).
Efficiency gains
The researchers said the indium content per gigawatt of modules, currently about 15 tons, can be reduced to several hundred kilograms, or even lower.
“The case of indium is an excellent example of the wrong perception of abundance or criticality concepts when applied to a given technology, which could destroy its development if not used properly,” Lincot explained. “In fact, an element can shift from rare to ‘sufficiently' abundant, depending on the quantities which are used for producing the same amount of energy.”
In his view, with 15 tons of indium per gigawatt, up to 20 GW of indium can be produced per year throughout the world, with only 30% of available refinery production.
“The rise toward 100 GW and more would be possible with extracting systematically indium from zinc refining, going to thinner films or tandems, as described in the white paper,” he said. “Moreover, there are many routes available for even further reducing the indium content in the modules, by reducing the thickness, increasing further the efficiency, going to tandems and also to concentration with microcells.”
He said that the issue of abundance and the criticality of elements should be examined based on facts. He added that it is important to ramp up R&D support for CIGS photovoltaics to further capitalize on the potential of the technology to support net-zero carbon emission targets via applications in buildings, transport, and other areas.
“In this context, lightweight flexible CIGS modules offer great opportunities,” Lincot said.
The authors of the white paper claim that current prospects for CIGS technology are high.
“The technology has experienced a continuous improvement of the efficiency,” said Lincot, in reference to the 23.35% record efficiency rating achieved by  Japanese manufacturer Solar Frontier for a CIGS solar cell and the recent 19.64% efficiency level recorded for a CIGS module by German thin-film module maker Avancis.
These and other recent signs of progress are made by new processes, like alkali addition, and also by alloying the absorber layer.  “So, the current prospects for CIGS at the efficiency level are high with expectations to reach 25% in the coming years,” Lincot said. “Bandgap tunability, from over 2 electron volts (eV) with sulfur alloying to a low value of 1 eV with pure selenide, with this class of materials opens unique opportunities for more than 30% efficiency tandem solar modules in coming years and several labs are working in this direction.”
CdTe comparison
To date, it remains unclear whether CIGS will be able to follow the same path of cadmium-telluride (CdTe) thin-film PV technology, which has seen the creation of a gigawatt-scale industry over the past two decades.
“In the case of CdTe, there is one dominant player, First Solar, which has a strong strategy and has been able to successfully integrate the signs of progress at the research level into the production plant and solve very strong problems as the back contact stability and gained efficiency improvements with optimized device composition,” Tiwari explained. “By this way, it succeeded to reach 19% record module while commercial large area modules are at 18.2%, with production up to 6.2 GW in 2020 from 2.6 GW in 2018.”
High efficiency levels for large-scale production, he said, are key to allowing successful competition in the mainstream market for glass substrates with low costs and specific advantages like better efficiency in hot and humid climates, due to a higher bandgap.
“For CIGS the competitiveness of modules on glass is more difficult since the commercial module efficiencies of the leader company are still lower, while demonstrating successfully the GW production scale capability,” Lincot said. “For the other companies with smaller volumes, at the level of tens to several hundreds of megawatts, the cost issue is even more pronounced since they do no benefit from scale effect.”
However, this impact may be triggered by the record module efficiency of 19.6% achieved by Avancis. Thiw could open up new perspectives if it or other companies are able to translate this value for commercial modules.
Nevertheless, the competition with silicon technologies for glass substrates is difficult, according to both experts. The opportunity for the CIGS is raising for high efficiency flexible and lightweight modules, as crystalline silicon, CdTe and organic PV are not strong competitors in this segment.
“Low production volume remains a concern for increasing the competitiveness in the mainstream market while plenty of niche markets are available for flexible lightweight modules,” Lincot said.
Record efficiencies of up to 20.8% achieved by EMPA for flexible cells and 17% in commercial modules from U.S.-based Miasolé on steel foils are presently opening this avenue.
On top of the scale effect and efficiency improvements at the module level, some simplification of manufacturing processes is expected to take place in the future.
“The cost prospect for CIGS as a thin film industry has inherent advantages in terms of cost as compared to slicing and assembling wafers,”  Tiwari said. “First solar is already demonstrating the competitiveness of thin films at this regard.”
He said CIGS technology can follow the same trends for lower costs with advancements in manufacturing equipment and higher production volume, especially for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). This market could reach 20 GW per year over the next few years and raise to hundreds of gigawatts in the by 2030.
“The need for lightweight high-efficiency modules is important for fragile roofs and facades,” Lincot explained. “However the CIGS markets are much broader, beyond BIPV, in particular for agrivoltaics, floating PV, autonomous PV and also seasonal PV with retractable units which can cover temporarily the land during summer.”
CIGS solar cells, on the other hand, can also be used for tandem applications in mainstream markets, for 30% efficiency modules, either with silicon for wide bandgap CIGS as top cell or perovskites as low bandgap bottom cells.
“CIGS technology can thus become a key component of next generations of silicon solar cells,” Lincot said. “This development which was unexpected a few years ago may become a reality within a few years with a key advantage that CIGS and silicon are already commercial technologies.”
On the other hand, CIGS-perovskite tandem cells are opening up possibilities for ultra-high efficiency lightweight flexible modules beyond the excellent results already obtained with CIGS cells alone, he added.
R&D outlook
The research on CIGS is still at a very high level and widely distributed internationally, according to the two scientists. Historically, Europe has been and remains a key actor in CIGS R&D.  In view of the new market developments for the CIGS technologies, there is a need to reinforce industrial strength through more R&D.
“For this, we have to extend research studies towards low bandgap CIGS solar cells for bottom cells and toward wide-bandgap for top cells, with silicon in particular, beyond the historical trend to focus on highly performing standard composition with the intermediate bandgap adapted for single-junction optimization,” Tiwari said. “Collaborative R&D and adequate funding support in consistent manner is essential, especially the role of EU programs is extremely important.”
There are many studies about the life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis of CIGS technology. The scientists claim this shows that environmental concerns are very low, as the solar cells are composed of chemical elements with low toxicity
“The only concern is about the presence of a minimal amount of cadmium which is used in the form of a very thin cadmium sulfide (CdS) interfacial buffer layer,” Lincot said. “This is a small amount and modules are well encapsulated and protected which minimizes the risk, allowing their utilization.”
However, alternative cadmium-free buffer layers have already demonstrated high-efficiency devices, including the record solar cell produced by Solar Frontier and all its gigawatt-scale production, making already CIGS a cadmium-free technology. This, according to the two experts, gives CIGS technology a supplementary advantage for its environmental acceptance.
“In view of the potential of the CIGS PV technology for contributing to the zero carbon emission objectives, it was important and timely to address the question of indium availability,” Lincot concluded. “The investigation suggests that it is not a blocking factor as often considered. The aim of this white paper initiative was to assess the potential of CIGS technology and its role in terawatt PV production in the future.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/11/recovering-waste-heat-from-solar-cells-via-a-thermoelectric-generator/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 11, 2021",Recovering waste heat from solar cells via a thermoelectric generator,"A U.S.-Italian research group has fabricated a hybrid thermoelectric photovoltaic (HTEPV) system that is able to recover waste heat from its solar cell and use it to generate additional power output.
The device consists of an optimized thermoelectric generator (TEG) placed in thermal contact with the back of a perovskite solar cell with a surface area of 1 cm² by means of a layer of thermal grease. While in thermal contact, the two units are electrically separated.
“The HTEPV should be used once two main requirements regarding the PV part are met,” research co-author, Bruno Lorenzi, told pv magazine. The first is that they use cells with a wide bandgap. The researchers estimate that cells with an energy gap greater than about 1.6 eV are needed, as large gap cells are less sensitive to temperature in terms of their performance. The second requirement is that the system has sufficient input power to raise the temperature enough.
Heat flows naturally through the TEG because its cold side is kept at room temperature, while its hot side, which is in thermal contact with the cell, is at a high temperature. The Seebeck effect, which is the direct conversion of temperature differences between two semiconductor materials into electric voltage, generates this difference which then translates into additional electrical power.

The scientists decided not to use a spectrum splitting technology, which is generally utilized in these applications, to direct different parts of the solar spectrum towards either the PV or the TEG unit. “It is more convenient, in terms of final efficiency gains, to keep the solar cell at the same temperature of the TEG hot side, instead of keeping the cell cold but losing much of the recoverable heat,” the academics explained, noting that a wide-gap solar cell based on perovskite was chosen for the device, due to its lower sensitivity to high temperatures. “Temperature-sensitive materials, such as silicon, lose too much efficiency to make the hybridization convenient,” they further explained.
The TEG is placed into an evacuated tube to minimize the heat exchange with the environment. It is able to extract waste heat from the solar cell and convey it to its cold plate, where it is dissipated by a fluid. Its cold side is attached with thermal grease to the vacuum chamber bottom and its temperature is controlled with a K-type thermocouple. “As the TEG part is placed under a difference of temperature a delta of electrical potential is developed between its hot and cold electrodes due to the Seebeck effect,” Lorenzi further explained. “Thus once the TEG is connected to a load it generates a flowing electrical current.”
The extraction of heat from the solar cell, according to the scientists, can provide efficiency gains ranging from 0.2 to 3.05%. Although the group tested different kinds of wide-gap solar cells for the HTEPV system, it found the perovskite-based devices offer the best performance in terms of power conversion efficiency.
“Evaluating the cost of this technology is not easy, because it depends a lot on the type of system you are considering,” the Italian researchers emphasized. “The thermoelectric material itself has a negligible cost, as very little is needed in volumetric terms per unit of area. What may increase the device's cost, according to him are the heat sink, the vacuum tube, and the concentrator used for its assembly. “If you develop a hybrid starting from a PV technology that works in concentration and with a cooling system, the cost is very low and there are no problems,” he further explained. “The other cases must be carefully evaluated.”
The full description of the thermoelectric-photovoltaic device can be found in the paper Practical development of efficient thermoelectric – Photovoltaic hybrid systems based on wide-gap solar cells, published in Applied Energy. The research group includes scientists from the University of Milano-Bicocca and the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Italy, as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/11/current-affairs/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 11, 2021",Current affairs,"For more than a year now, wafer size has been the number one debate in PV cell and module technology. From the earlier standard of 156.75mm, manufacturers quickly went through several iterations to reach the situation today, where two sizes – 182mm and 210mm, are expected to represent the bulk of the market for the next few years at least.
These two sizes have seen the industry quickly divide into two camps, some preferring the 182mm product introduced by Longi, and others backing the larger 210mm wafer manufactured by Zhonghuan semiconductor. The newest modules based on these wafers are only now moving into mass production and beginning to go through field testing, which will show whether either has a particular advantage.
In a new white paper, module manufacturer JA Solar describes a comparative study carried out in collaboration with TÜV Nord that seeks to investigate difference in performance between the products. JA Solar initially exhibited a product based on the 210mm wafer at last year’s SNEC exhibition, but has since come to focus more on the 182mm dimension in its ‘DeepBlue’ module range.
The study is based on both simulations and field installations, with both module types in operation at Yinchuan National Photovoltaic Experimental Base. In simulations under unspecified conditions, the paper claims the 182mm modules generated 1.8% more electricity per year than the 210mm product, and achieved an LCOE of $0.0292/kWh – which was 0.04-0.08 cents/kWh lower than the 210mm module simulated.
The losses are largely blamed on the higher currents seen in the largest modules, and the resulting higher operating temperatures. “The heat loss of super-large current module B is 0.53% higher than that of 182 module,” they claim. “If we take a 3 GW project as an example, because of the direct heat loss, the super-large current modules will generate 20 GWh less electricity than 182 modules per year.”
At the testing site in Yinchuan, the study found that the 210mm products had an average temperature 1.8 degrees Celsius higher than the smaller wafer modules, and a maximum temperature difference of 5 degrees. “each degree-Celsius increase in working temperature will make the power decrease by about 0.35%,” JA states in the study. “It can be seen from data of the demonstration system, with influence of various factors, the average energy yield per watt of the 182 module is about 1.8% higher than that of the super-large current module.”
The study further notes that these larger currents place a heavier burden on other system components, particularly the junction box, cables and connectors. Noting that junction boxes should have a rated current at least 1.25 times the short circuit current of the module, they find that the 182mm product can still use the standard 25amp junction box, while the 210mm product would still be outside of the margin with a larger, 30 amp box. And on the cabling side, they note that for rooftop installations, in particular, larger cables than usual will be needed to mitigate the risk of overheating failure and even fires.
Compatibility of other balance of systems components, the inverter in particular, was initially a concern for all of the new modules, however, JA finds that this has been effectively addressed with suitable products available for all module sizes.
Overall, while JA Solar finds a small advantage for the 182mm products in this study, it may not play out the same for every installation in every situation. And it’s likely in any case that both will remain on the market for the next few years at least. JA Solar concludes its study, however, by stating that its work clearly shows that module sizes have reached their practical limit, and any further increases will not necessarily achieve lower systems costs, finding that “…there is a significant decrease in power generation performance and an increase in safety risks.”
And the company calls on the PV industry to return its focus to innovations, rather than simple size optimizations, to keep on improving performance. “the focus of the industry in the future should be switched towards efficiency and energy yield improvement via technological progress,” they conclude.

Brazil-based Energy Source is betting on two new business models to boost its revenue in 2021: storage services with reused batteries and the recycling of batteries that have already completed their second life cycles, including the recovery of metals such as cobalt.
The company expects to conclude a financing round by October that will support its “battery-as-a-service” (BaaS) model. The expectation is to raise BRL 12 million ($2.3 million) from existing partners and investors.
“The manufacture of new batteries from batteries that have already gone through a first life cycle started in 2017, and the recycling of batteries at the end of the second cycle began in December 2020,” Energy Source CEO David Noronha told pv magazine.
Up until this year, Energy Source had mainly been selling its products through a partnership with Brazil's largest PV product distributor, Aldo Solar, which also sells and distributes reused batteries. The idea now is to expand the relationship with end customers, in order to sell the batteries but also to sell storage services, which could include battery replacement. So far, the company has traded 6.5 MWh of second-life batteries and 1.4 MWh of new batteries. The expectation is to reach 10 MWh per month, on average, from 2022.
The company aims to serve the energy backup market, off-grid systems, and hybrid energy systems.
“The investment round is also to make this new commercial model for the company viable,” said Noronha.
To also serve the energy management market, the company has developed a battery monitoring system that can be integrated with technologies other than lithium, including lead-acid batteries.
The software is part of the BaaS model and enables end-to-end monitoring, maintenance, failure prevention, and battery behavior prediction functions.
“In the end, what we intend is to guarantee the delivery of the contracted energy, that it is available when needed,” said Noronha.
Energy Source is also ramping up its recycling line for batteries that have already passed through their second life cycle at its plant in São João da Boa Vista, in the state of Sao Paulo. It began running a pilot line in December 2020.
So far this year, the recycling plant has already processed 50 tons of batteries. By the end of the year, there will be 300 tons.
“(They) are no longer discarded and are returning to the market as metals used by the industry, such as cobalt and nickel,” said Noronha.
The process, which is carbon neutral, is designed to appeal to people and companies that are interested in the proper disposal of batteries. Automakers Renault and BMW Group Brazil are already Energy Source partners.
The recycling of batteries and the recovery of metals is conducted in two stages, both without associated emissions, as they do not involve the burning of materials. The first stage is carried out at the Energy Source plant itself. It is an electrochemical-mechanical process that produces the so-called “black mass,” which consists of large amounts of lithium, manganese, cobalt and nickel metals. The black mass is then sent to InCasa, a company based in Joinville, which is also located in Santa Catarina, for the second stage. This phase involves the separation and refinement of metals through a hydrometallurgical process. Under this recycling model, the company becomes eligible to issue carbon credits.
This year, it started a certification process led by ACV Brasil, with completion scheduled by 2022. The estimate of preliminary studies is that each ton recycled is equivalent to 5 tons of carbon credits.
“One of our main goals currently has been to capture the batteries,” said Noronha. The batteries collected by Energy Source mainly come from electronics, as well as products such as phones, drones, electric vehicles, electric bicycles, and electric scooters.
The recycled batteries are mainly traded with waste managers, but also with equipment manufacturers. Noronha said partnerships with disposal companies can be designed in different ways.
“Among other variables, it depends on the composition of the batteries, the amount of lithium, iron, phosphate. Batteries with higher concentrations of cobalt tend to be worth more,” he added.

Syncline Energy has revealed plans to build the Melton Renewable Energy Hub, a big battery project, near Melbourne. It will be located next to the Sydenham terminal station and will connect to the state’s main 500 kV transmission backbone.
The big battery project has been fast-tracked by the Victorian government under its planning scheme amendment, which is a pathway for significant state projects. The company hopes to reach financial close by the second quarter of 2022, with production to begin by the second half of 2023 to support the network over that summer.
“We see this as a longterm piece of energy infrastructure that will play a range of different roles as the decade rolls through to a range of different customers,” Syncline Energy CEO, Phil Galloway told pv magazine Australia.
The Australian company will own and operate the project, which will also include a 12.5 MWp solar farm to supply the battery’s ancillary cooling loads and ensure low cost, “net-zero” operations.
The project site, which spans more than 90 hectares, was secured after the company spent a year driving between Victoria’s various substations and speaking to councils, gathering together a list of 20 potential locations.
“This was by far No. 1,” said Galloway.
One of the reasons for that is the site lays at the junction between three of Victoria’s emerging Renewable Energy Zones, allowing the Melton Renewable Energy Hub to connect to each of those separate zones via the state’s 500 kV transmission “backbone.”
The chemistry of the proposed big battery is yet to be finalized, though it will be of the lithium variety.
Galloway said Syncline Energy is also looking to use “second life” batteries from cars and buses in its energy storage array. When its battery cells reach the end of their lives, it plans to build systems to recover the lithium, nickel and cobalt on site. Key to that will be using a narrow range of chemistries to optimize the recovery process, said Galloway. This, he says, is part of a “product stewardship approach” the company plans to take.
“We need to be responsible for that whole cycle,” he said, adding that he would like to see the storage industry become more mature about the OHS (occupational health and safety) around its operations.
The project will integrate grid-forming technologies, though Galloway said he is still waiting for clarity around the national electricity rules for grid-forming services, which are still being developed. This has been earmarked as a top priority for network operators, with regulations expected to become clearer in the coming year.
Likening it to the model of data centers, Galloway said “storage as service” will form the core of the project’s business model. That is, he is looking at leasing battery space with the project.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has registered the Melton Renewable Energy Hub as a market participant, with the project already completing the preliminary connection enquiry stages. Its connection application process is now underway.
Syncline Energy is behind Victoria’s  110 MW Bannerton Solar Farm, as well as two commercial geothermal projects at Warrnambool. It has also developed hybrid microgrids in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.

Ambri Inc., an MIT-spinoff long-duration battery energy storage system developer, secured $144 million in funding to advance calcium-antimony liquid metal battery chemistry.
The investment round was led by Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd, a unit of Reliance Industries Limited; Paulson & Co. Inc., a group that includes Ambri’s largest shareholder, Bill Gates; and new investors, including Fortistar, Goehring & Rozencwajg Associates, Japan Energy Fund, and others.
The company plans to use proceeds to commercialize and grow its long-duration system technology and to build manufacturing facilities, both in the U.S. and internationally.
Ambri also entered into a long-term antimony supply agreement with Perpetua Resources.  The agreement helps secure a domestic source of antimony for its supply chain.
