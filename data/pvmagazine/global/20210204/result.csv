Budapest-based bank CIB, which is owned by Intesa Sanpaolo, made the 15-year loan for the PV projects, which were all commissioned in October or November in the Püspökladány municipality, and which are licensed under Hungary's Megújuló Támogatási Rendszer (METÁR) renewables incentives scheme.
Photon chief financial offer Clemens Wohlmuth, quoted in a press release published to announce the deal last week, stated the refinancing would “free up substantial liquidity that will allow us to continue our plans for ongoing growth as we further expand our portfolio.”
The deal follows a HUF1 billion, 15-year loan from CIB Bank in December to refinance five other Hungarian plants developed by Photon, with a combined generation capacity of 3.5 MWp.
The Netherlands-based company claims to be developing more than 793 MW of solar generation capacity in Australia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

The power company, in which the French state has the largest individual shareholding, said solar made up 21% of the 3 GW of new renewables generation capacity it installed in 2020.
With Engie acquiring an additional 1.7 GW of operating hydro capacity in Portugal and 300 MW of wind farms in France and Italy, the 5 GW of clean power capacity added in 2020 took the company's total renewables portfolio to 31 GW. In a press release issued in January to announce last year's figures, Engie said it had a total power generation capacity of 101 GW. The business also operates gas, nuclear and petroleum assets.
Engie said it secured 1.5 GW of clean energy power purchase agreements in 2020 and added, the majority of its newly-commissioned renewables generation capacity – 1.8 GW – was added in North America. Europe accounted for 900 MW of the remaining 1.2 GW.
The company said it is on track with the ambition announced in 2019, to add 9 GW of renewables capacity by the end of this year.

In December, S&P Global Platts awarded its “Emerging Technology of the Year Award” to Australia's Star Scientific for its Hydrogen Energy Release Optimizer (HERO). Star Scientific’s technology can transition coal-fired electricity plants to green energy, desalinate water in a clean process, use green hydrogen to generate the high temperatures needed for industrial processes, and, in a similar vein, provide emissions-free warmth to large areas. 
Its HERO technology has now caught the eye of the Philippines Department of Energy, which this week announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Star Scientific to help the country’s push toward the use of green hydrogen. As an archipelagic nation with large numbers of people in isolated regions, the Philippines is heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The Department of Energy hopes that Star Scientific’s HERO technology will accelerate the use of green hydrogen revolution in the country by providing clean, self-sufficient sources of energy, as well as water security. 
The MoU set out objectives for Star Scientific to retrofit existing coal-fired power stations with HERO systems powered by green hydrogen. The two parties will also explore whether the Philippines’ large resources of offshore wind can be used toward this green hydrogen end. The Department of Energy is keen to use every application of the HERO system, in order to help it provide decentralized, scalable power and desalination services for all of the country’s inhabited islands. 
Star Scientific Global Group Chairman Andrew Horvath said that he is proud that an Australian innovation has captured the attention of a national government that wants to drive its economic development through an environmentally sustainable energy source of power generation and water desalination. 
Horvath called the agreement “a significant milestone in the development of the global hydrogen economy.” He added that this bold and holistic step by the Philippines is a sign that “we can begin to see the reality of whole economies turning over to hydrogen and a rapid acceleration to sustainable energy on a global scale.” 
In an interview with pv magazine in December, Horvath was not shy about the global interest in Star Scientific’s technology and Australia’s potential in developing the global hydrogen economy.
“The Norwegians have been all over us,” Horvath said. And northern Europe has been knocking down the virtual door because “They’re desperate to get off Russian gas.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/04/russia-to-tender-500-mw-of-solar-in-2021/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021",Russia to tender 500 MW of solar in 2021,"The Russian government will tender another 500 MW of solar capacity this year in the frame of the program for large scale renewables that it launched in 2014.
“Around 1.7 GW of solar capacity was online in Russia at the end of 2020,” Anton Usachev, president of the Russian Solar Energy Association, told pv magazine. “This capacity comes mostly from the auction program launched by the government in 2014, and the 0.5 GW of PV that it will tender this year is the remaining quota of the program.” The auction will likely take place in June 2021.
The auction scheme, which has also brought online about 550 MW of wind power, is being managed by Russia’s Trading System Administrator, JSC ATS.
“All utility scale projects selected in the tenders meet local content rules but, since 2014, several manufacturers of cells and modules, inverters, wafers [and] mounting systems have been operating in Russia” Usachev specified. Solar parks that use Russian materials receive higher feed-in tariffs than projects using components fully manufactured abroad.
In the latest round of the scheme, held in June 2019, three projects, with generation capacities of 5.6-6 MW, were pre-qualified for a 5.6 MW capacity procurement and Finnish utility Fortum secured the only PV project selected. The average bidding price was around RUB62,000 ($821) per megawatt installed. The capex figure offered by solar developers was lower than that for 71 MW of wind power allocated and lower than for previous PV projects. The previous auction round, held in June 2018, saw Russian module manufacturer Hevel Group and Fortum win the 148.5 MW worth of solar PV projects awarded.
Usachev has also revealed that the Russian government is also planning to approve a new program to deploy another 7 GW of solar and wind by 2035. “The country is now taking steps towards a more diversified solar PV industry by encouraging new segments of distributed power,” he added, explaining that rooftop under net metering and solar-plus-storage projects in remote areas will play a significant role in the new strategy.
“Russia’s residential PV is set to thrive in [the] next five years once new net metering rules will come into force,” he stated.
The Russian government is currently supporting solar in areas disconnected from the grid through the CSA program. The Republic of Buryatia and the Far East Federal District have strong potential for this kind of project as they have poor energy and transport infrastructure.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/04/romania-improves-rebate-scheme-to-speed-up-rooftop-pv-development/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROMANIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021",Romania improves rebate scheme to speed up rooftop PV development,"Romania‘s Ministry of Environment has published, in the country's official journal, a few amendments to the Casa Verde Fotovoltaice (green PV home) scheme to support residential solar installations under the country’s net metering regime, which was launched in June.
“The new provisions improve the installation process and settlement of rebate payments,” environment minister Barna Tánczos said, adding that of the approved 12,650 applications, only 450 have led to the grid-connection of a rooftop PV array. “Now there are no more barriers for the execution of works and the settlement of payment, and we invite all beneficiaries to complete this process,” he said.
The new rules include an extension of the timeframe to install a PV system, from eight to twelve months, the possibility of incorporating more powerful products that expand the capacity of the approved projects, and the possibility of changing the location of a project within the same property.
Romania’s Environment Fund Administration (AFM), the state funding body for environmental protection, allocated a total of RON252 million ($59 million) for the rebates in 2020. The total budget for the program is RON536 million. The Romanian government first launched the rebate scheme in August 2018.
The AFM is providing rebates for installations larger than 3 kW in size, which cover up to 90% of the array costs, provided that the grant does not exceed RON20,000.
Romania's net metering regulations include fiscal incentives for owners of PV systems with capacities up to 27 kW. Under this scheme, owners of renewable energy power systems up to 100 kW in size are entitled to sell power surplus to the country’s four power distributors – Enel, CEZ, Eon and Electrica – at a rate that will be set by the energy regulator ANRE, depending on the distributor.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Romania had 1.38 GW of solar installed at the end of 2019. Most of this capacity is represented by megawatt-scale PV plants built under the green certificate scheme launched in 2011 and, since this program was shut down, the country saw almost zero growth in terms of new installations. From 2015 to 2019, new PV additions totaled just 14 MW.

Of the 23 mini-grids, which currently have capacities ranging from 50-2,320 kilovolt-ampere (kVa), only one will add wind power while another 21 will add exclusively-PV installations. The remaining mini-grid will integrate a hybrid wind-solar power generator.
The deadline to submit project proposals is March 2.
The projects are being supported by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation and French development agency the Agence française de développement.
By the end of 2019, Kenya's total installed solar capacity stood at 95 MW, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Only 2 MW of PV was newly deployed last year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/04/novel-catalyst-produces-green-hydrogen-from-seawater-via-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021",Novel catalyst produces green hydrogen from seawater via solar,"From pv magazine Australia
Researchers from Swinburne University’s Centre for Translational Atomaterials and Shaanxi Normal University have developed a novel catalyst that can produce high-performance solar-triggered hydrogen from seawater. If there is one thing that we all know about seawater, it’s that there is a lot of it, so it's no surprise that this  scientific discovery has great potential.
In order to utilize this new catalyst, the researchers had to develop a prototype device, the Ocean-H2-Rig. It can float on the ocean's surface to produce green hydrogen from seawater.
One of the easiest and greenest ways to produce hydrogen is through photocatalytic water splitting, which uses solar energy to split water into its composite atoms, securing the hydrogen and harmlessly emitting the oxygen. The novelty of the single-atom platinum catalyst the researchers have developed is that the photo-generated electrons and holes triggered by solar radiation do not try to recombine, which greatly improves hydrogen production efficiency.
Tianyi Ma, the lead author of a related research paper that was recently published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, said that the team used the single-atom platinum catalyst as the electron extractor.
“It is synthesized by a scalable and low-cost calcination method, easily produced at large scale,” said Ma. “The high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency is what we need for industrial application.”
According to Baohua Jia, the founding director of the Centre for Translational Atomaterials, the reusable catalyst “promotes highly efficient hydrogen production with an outstanding quantum yield of 22.2% under LED-550 illumination, which stands among the best catalysts ever reported.”
The idea of “Solar Rigs” floating on the world’s oceans to convert seawater to hydrogen fuel is not a new one. In 2018, scientists from Columbia University in the United States developed a device called “a floating photovoltaic electrolyzer.” Columbia University researcher Daniel Esposito even worked out how much of the ocean’s surface would need to be covered by giant “solar fuel rigs” in order to generate enough hydrogen fuel to replace the 2018 levels of global oil use. He told Smithsonian Magazine that 63,000 square miles, or an area equivalent to the state of Florida, would be required.
Of course, this technology still needs to overcome enormous obstacles. Nevertheless, Australian researchers are now on the cutting-edge of this promising line of green hydrogen technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/04/sunpower-launches-home-monitoring-app-for-solar-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021","SunPower launches home monitoring app for solar, storage","From pv magazine USA
SunPower has launched its new mySunPower app, which allows homeowners to review and manage their energy generation, consumption, and battery storage settings from their mobile devices.
The app will be available to download for SunPower Equinox customers from Feb. 16 on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. It also will be available to all of SunPower’s 285,000 monitoring customers at some point in the second quarter.
The app will allow customers to track how much solar their systems are generating on an hourly, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis, or by time parameters that customers can set themselves. The app will also allow customers to track how much grid-supplied energy they are consuming, while monitoring the current state of their battery’s charge.
The app builds on what Jacob Wachman, SunPower's vice president of software product and engineering, calls a digital experience from the ground up. Wachman notes the different software tools that SunPower provides to digitize the entire solar system purchase and installation process.
This begins with the company’s Instant Design tool, which allows potential customers to digitally build a system that fits their needs. Customers can then buy the system and monitor installation through the mySunPower portal. The new app, which is the last step of the fully digital process, is designed to flow seamlessly with the other two services.
The user interface is something that the company prioritized throughout the app’s development. It aims to bring a new, accessible experience to customers who may not be technically experienced with their home’s energy needs.
“We wanted to make it as easy to use as possible,” said Wachman.
He said the development team looked beyond the solar industry to develop the user interface. For example, the app developers took inspiration from unlikely non-energy sources, such as the animated film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.”
The company plans to include a warning system that will alert homeowners about impending blackouts. This could include planned outages, like Pacific Gas & Electric’s weather-related rolling blackouts in California, or a natural disaster. That upgrades will be released later in the year.
