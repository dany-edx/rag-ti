The two companies will invest CNY 5.3 billion ($791 million) in the new facility, which will have a capacity of 10 GW and could also potentially host 10 GW of solar module production.
Solarspace has signed a deal with the government of Chuzhou, Anhui province, for a 16 GW solar cell manufacturing facility. The factory will be built in two 8 GW phases and produce cells based on 182 mm and 210 mm wafers. The total investment is CNY 10.5 billion. Solarspace has currently a cell production capacity of 19 GW and 4.5 GW of module production.
Energy China, one of the largest state-owned energy enterprises in China, has submitted a project proposal for a huge PV and concentrated solar power (CSP) complex in Xuzhou, in China's Xinjiang region. The plant will consist of a 1.35 GW solar array, a 150 MW CSP unit, and an unspecified amount of storage capacity.
Xinte Energy said it expects a net profit of CNY 5.5 billion to CNY 6 billion for the first half of this year. Last week, the manufacturer said that its solar and wind project development margins had increased, along with polysilicon prices.

In a new report, it noted that electrolyzer capacity has doubled over the past five years, to around 0.3 GW by the middle of 2021. Global hydrogen production from electrolyzers could exceed 8 million metric tons by 2030, it said, adding that the Asia-Pacific region has thus far dominated demand for electrolyzer capacity.
BP and Thyssenkrupp have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop long-term supplies of low-carbon hydrogen and renewable power for steel production. The companies will explore supply options for blue and green hydrogen, as well as power from wind and solar generation through power purchase agreements. Thyssenkrupp Steel aims to replace coal-fired blast furnaces with direct reduction plants where iron ore is reduced with low-carbon hydrogen, in order to make steel production climate-neutral over the long term, said the German industrial group. 
Nel Hydrogen has secured a purchase order from Viva Energy for a MC500 containerized PEM water electrolyzer. “The electrolyzer will be the biggest in Australia and provide green hydrogen to a fleet of heavy fuel cell vehicles,” said the Norwegian company. Earlier this month, Nel Hydrogen won a purchase order for an alkaline electrolyzer system from Skovgaard Energy Aps in Lemvig, Denmark. The electrolyzer system will be used to produce green ammonia with wind and solar.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said that international trade via pipelines and ships could support about one-quarter of global hydrogen demand. “With falling costs of renewables and the hydrogen potential exceeding global energy demand by 20-fold, three-quarters of global hydrogen would still be produced and used locally in 2050. This is a significant change from today’s oil market, where the bulk is internationally traded,” said IRENA. It sees about half of all hydrogen being traded through repurposed gas pipelines, while shipped green ammonia would account for most of the other half.
Peugeot has allowed journalists to test its e-EXPERT Hydrogen van for the first time in trials in Rüsselsheim, Germany, where its production line is located. The van is based on a system featuring a battery that can be recharged from the mains, with a fuel cell-powered by hydrogen in the canisters under the vehicle floor.
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia’s national science agency, has agreed to collaborate with the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the hydrogen sector. “A 100% renewable system would not be entirely made up of wind and solar, but include other renewables such as hydropower, biomass, and green hydrogen,” said CSIRO, noting that electrolyzer costs are falling rapidly.

This compares to around 1.62 million in 2020 and brings the total number of heat pumps in Europe to 16.98 million, which represents around 14% of the continent's heating market.
The markets with the strongest growth were Poland (+87%), Ireland (+69%), Italy (+63%), Slovakia (+42%) Norway (+36%), France (+36%) and Germany (+28%). The five biggest European heat pump markets were France (537,000 units), Italy (382,000), Germany (177,000), Spain (148,000), and Sweden (135,000).
“These figures could skyrocket further next year as the REPowerEU plan to get off Russian gas and its ambitious targets for heat pumps kicks in,” said Jozefien Vanbecelaere, head of EU affairs for the European Heat Pump Association. “We do see limitations in components supply, though, that may dampen the increase. Here we see the need for an EU heat pump acceleration action plan, to ensure smooth growth and avoid supply or HR bottlenecks.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/12/photovoltaics-and-anaerobic-digestion/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EGYPT",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 12, 2022",Photovoltaics and anaerobic digestion,"Researchers from the Arab Academy for Science have tried to assess the viability of combining PV plants and cattle manure anaerobic digestion (AD) projects in the livestock business in Egypt.
An anaerobic digestion plant is a power facility that can produce methane from manure.
“In an anaerobic digester, the organic substrate is first liquefied by bacteria,” the scientists explained. “This is followed by a two-step process involving acid production by acid-forming bacteria (acidogenesis) and methane production from the acids with methane-forming bacteria (methanogenesis).”
In “Case study for optimum techno-economic integration of PV and anaerobic digestion for sustainable agri-business,” which was recently published in Energy Reports, the research group considered the use of renewable energy in a hybrid configuration for a 6,300-square-meter farm capable of housing 200 head of milk/beef cattle in El-Horeya, a village near Cairo.
“The farm suffers from a continuous electrical power outage that disturbs the daily production schedule and affects the quality of refrigerated products,” they said. “In addition, mistiming of machinery operations for cattle-feed mixing and milking – due to sudden power outage – significantly reduces both milk and beef productions causing financial losses that threaten the business.”
The Egyptian group used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a stochastic optimization method based on the movement and intelligence of swarms, to minimize the CoE of both energy sources in the modeling. They considered constraints such as the maximum number of cattle and the maximum are available for a PV system.
They found that PV systems require a larger area than the AD plant for the same daily production, and that the initial cost for both technologies is very close for energy production less than 25 kWh. The area needed for the solar array was estimated at around 93 square meters.
“The CoE from the AD project is relatively higher than PV for loads less than 45 kWh per day due to the high price of the biogas-powered electrical generator,” they said, noting that AD is the cheapest option for daily production greater than 45 kWh.
The farm's daily load was estimated at about 60 kWh and the cost of energy (CoE) of the PV installation and the AD systems were $0.029/kWh and $0.0273/kWh, respectively, while the final average CoE for the hybrid plant was estimated at $0.0226/kWh. For both energy facilities, the academics assumed a rate of return of 9%.
“The inflation rate is calculated according to the central bank of Egypt and it averaged 8.95% for the last 57 years,” they explained. “The initial cost of any system was calculated according to a 30% government grant for renewable energy projects.”
The scientists concluded that both energy sources are affordable for small-scale farms, although their CoE is higher than that of grid electricity. They also said that the proposed hybrid dual configuration increases the reliability and availability of power supply.
“The implementation of renewable energy projects in a manner suitable to the farming workspace in Egypt shall increase the profitability of the farming business, attract investors by combining energy and farming businesses, help the land reclamation planned for the country in rural areas, and reduce the demand on the national power grid,” they said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/12/us-lifts-tariffs-on-solar-products-from-canada-mexico/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 12, 2022","US lifts tariffs on solar products from Canada, Mexico","From pv magazine USA
Nearly half a year after an independent panel said that the Section 201 tariffs were not in compliance with the 2018 Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), the US government has agreed to lift those tariffs for Canadian-made solar products.
The three countries have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng said reflects the countries’ shared commitment to combat climate change and develop renewable energy.
The Section 201 tariffs, originally imposed under former President Donald Trump, imposed a 30% duty on all imported solar cells and modules, in an attempt to prop up US manufacturing of those products. In opposing the tariffs, Canadian officials argued that American import levels of Canadian hardware are too low to justify the tariffs. Since the Section 201 imports were put in place in 2018, Canada-to-US solar panel trade has decreased as much as 82%, said the Canadian government.
According to US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, the new deal contains a mechanism to ensure that solar product imports from Canada do not undermine the existing US safeguard measure on imports of solar products. The deal and its terms also apply to Mexican solar manufacturers, but Canadian manufacturers have been notably hit harder by the tariffs, with the United States importing a higher volume of modules from Canada than Mexico.
In February, the Biden administration said that it would extend the Section 201 tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar panels and solar cells above an annual 5 GW tariff rate quota, thus upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and doubling the tariff rate quota for cells. The extension was described by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) as “a balanced solution in upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and increasing the tariff rate quota for cells.”
