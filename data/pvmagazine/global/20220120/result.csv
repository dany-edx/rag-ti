With the information gathering exercise opened on Tuesday set to run until April 12, the EU executive has also asked how private power purchase agreements (PPAs) – signed directly between renewables site operators and electricity users without incentive payments such as feed-in tariffs – can be made more accessible.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

With solar developers in European nations such as Italy long having complained of the chilling effect convoluted permitting regimes have on PV deployment, the latest call for information is likely to attract a big response.
Although PPAs have boomed in Spain, and begun to crop up in further-flung European markets, the commission on Monday said only eight EU member states had reported on the progress of such unsubsidized clean power contracts as part of their National Energy and Climate Plans, as required by Brussels.
The commission is seeking input on methods of reducing the duration and complexity of renewable energy PPAs.
The findings of the consultation exercise will inform a guidance document on both issues which the commission is set to deliver by late September.

With the country backing solar through an auction scheme and incentives for rooftop PV, this week also brought a few new subsidy-free announcements.
Swiss energy company Axpo has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) for the electricity to be generated by nearly 300MWp of solar projects in Poland which are being developed by domestic company R.Power Group. The projects range in capacity from 300kWp to 30MWp and will be put into operation gradually, with full production expected by mid-next year.
Local subsidiary Axpo Polska will buy the full output of the solar plants from this year to 2026 and will act as balancing agent for the project portfolio. Axpo will also provide R.Power Group access to price hedging instruments to ensure the bankability of the clean power sites.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
A separate Polish deal was announced by Norwegian hydropower business Statkraft and Danish renewables developer Better Energy. A 10-year PPA contract will ensure the construction of a 36MW solar park in Resko, western Poland. That project is slated to start operation next year.
The latest announcements indicate the business case for grid parity solar in Poland, according to the companies concerned.
“Few things are more important in our common fight against climate change than adding new affordable and renewable energy to the electricity grid, which is exactly what Statkraft makes possible through this deal,” said Rasmus Lildholdt Kjær, CEO of Better Energy. “It is also wise for energy consumers to demand additional renewable energy through a fixed-price power purchase agreement that serves as a hedge against higher energy prices.”
Elsewhere, Polish power company Tauron Polska Energia has completed the installation of its third PV project, its largest to date. The 8MW Choszczno II solar array, in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship of northwestern Poland, is said to be able to satisfy the electric demand of around 3,500 households.
The project sits next to the 6MW Choszczno I solar plant commissioned last year. Tauron had previously built a 5MW solar farm on a disused coal site in Jaworzno. That was the first project developed under Tauron's program for PV deployment in post-industrial areas, which envisages the construction of solar projects with a total capacity of around 150MW.
“We currently have three photovoltaic farms with a [total] capacity of 19MW, and in the near future we will start the construction of another farm, this time in Silesia,” said Artur Michałowski, acting CEO of Tauron Polska Energia. By 2025, the power company plans to have 1.6GW of installed renewables capacity.
This week also brought the announcement of plans for what was described as the largest on-site PV project in Poland to date. Local developer Quanta Energy is gearing up to install PV on the roofs of 10 logistics parks belonging to MLP Group, which specializes in the construction and management of warehouse centers, and is targeting zero-emission operations. The Quanta project will have a total generation capacity of 5.93MWp, most of which will be used for self-consumption.
Work has begun, involving a special lightweight installation design due to the limited load-bearing capacity of the warehouse roofs. With the project slated for completion within 14 months, its estimated revenue – based on current wholesale energy prices – is expected to amount to around PLN4 million (€883,000), according to the project's backers.
Quanta Energy president Piotr Grzybczak said environmental, social and governance requirements have greatly increased the use of green energy by Polish companies but solar also offers an excellent business case. “The rates of return are in the region of 20%, based on energy prices for 2022, and corporate projects have pay-off periods ranging from five to seven years. These returns are quite different from what we saw only three years ago,” he said. “Energy prices for 2022 across Europe, including [in] Poland, have risen by up to 50-100% depending on the time of purchase. This growth has been driven by several factors, including the rising prices of CO2 emissions – which recently have topped €82 per ton; the unprecedented spike in energy demand seen in 2021; [and] the surging gas prices.”
Grzybczak added: “In addition, the capacity fee [levied on non-household electricity consumers as part of their bills], introduced in January 2021, will go up in 2022 from PLN76.20 (€16.82) to PLN102.60 (€22.64) per megawatt-hour, and we also expect a slight increase in [grid] distribution fees. Against this backdrop, solar power systems offer the most effective solution to the problem of rising energy costs.”
Poland uses coal to generate around 70% of its electricity but its solar fleet has grown rapidly in recent years. The nation is expected to reach 10GW of solar this year, according to research body the Instytut Energetyki Odnawialnej, which would significantly top the country's 2030 target.
Analysts expect the country's total PV capacity to grow from around 6.3GW today to 30GW by 2030, despite an anticipated contraction in the distributed generation segment of the solar market. Last year's growth, which saw the addition of around 2GW of small-scale, residential, rooftop PV, came as the result of an end-of-year rally as net metering rules and incentives expired. As a result, the upward trend for Polish PV in the coming years is expected to be maintained by utility scale developments.

The Emirates News Agency (WAM) reported that the partnership will investigate the development of 1.2GW of solar and potential storage facilities.
Masdar has already gained experience in developing renewable energy projects in Indonesia. It entered the market in 2020 by forming a joint venture with PT PJBI, a subsidiary of Indonesia’s state electricity company, to drive the development of the 145MW Cirata floating PV array in West Java – the country’s first project of the kind. Financial close on the project was announced last August, and it is expected to begin commercial operations in the fourth quarter of this year.
The UAE-based developer is a newcomer to the consortium, which was established by the three other stakeholders last September. Tuas Power, EDF Renewables and PT Indonesia Power initially signed a memorandum of understanding that included a proposal for 1GWp of solar PV, feasibility studies in Indonesia and grid connection to Singapore, as well as the development of technical solutions to address issues of supply intermittency and transmission stability.
Last year, Singapore made a commitment to import up to 4GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which would translate to 35% of its total supply. Currently, about 95% of Singapore’s electricity is generated from natural gas. Thus far, several moves have been made to drive the island-city state toward importing green electricity, in a bid to diversify supply and boost energy security.
In November, the nation’s Energy Market Authority issued a request for proposal to select suppliers to import and sell around 1.2GW of electricity into Singapore. In a speech at Singapore Energy Week last year, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said the plan was to issue two requests for proposals: 4GW of low-carbon electricity imports and then 2.8GW, which is expected in the second quarter of this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/20/residential-heat-storage-system-uses-pv-electricity-for-space-heating-hot-water/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 20, 2022","Residential heat storage system uses PV electricity for space heating, hot water","France-based FHE Group has developed a residential thermochemical energy storage system that can be coupled with solar power generation to provide space heating and hot water to a household.
“Our storage system can ensure a solar self-consumption rate of 100%,” the company's CEO and founder, Jonathan Laloum, told pv magazine. “It is compatible with all heating and hot water networks and the links are made by simple hydraulic connections.”
Called Inelio, the device consists of a solid-gas sorption system based on adsorption and thermochemical processes. This kind of system utilizes an evaporator/condenser, a refrigerant fluid that changes state by condensing or vaporizing, and a reactor/adsorber. The latter is an active solid material that is able to adsorb and desorb the gaseous refrigerant to generate heat and regenerate the system, respectively. “As these two phases are not simultaneous, these technologies intrinsically adapt to a storage application with the ability to produce heat and cold on demand,” Laloum explained.
The storage system is able to store excess solar electricity in the form of heat during the day and to release it when the sun is not shining for space heating or domestic hot water. “This product can be easily combined with our Inelio Dynamic heat pump and enable 100% of solar self-consumption,” Laloum emphasized, noting that the company's heat pump series comprises products ranging in size from 8 to 16 kW.
The storage system has an output of 2.5 kW and a storage capacity of 2.5 kWh. It measures 1450x760x286mm and weighs in at 95 kg. According to the manufacturer, the storage device can retain over 95% of its initial performance after 20,000 cycles.
The system is offered with a 2o-year product guarantee and is developed in Perpignan, southern France, where the company is headquartered. “Our production is located in Kénitra, Morocco, with a capacity of 12,000 units per year,” Laloum added.
The system is sold at €7,500 in France. “This allows rapid and risk-free returns on investment given the 20-year performance and hardware warranty,” Laloum concluded. “After its launch, Inelio has been a real success, we have already equipped 400 homes in three months and our order books for the first half of 2022 are full.”

The system combines a 650kWp ground-mounted solar array and an 896kWh battery. With the installation completed early this month, TotalEnergies will remain in partnership with Kulara Water for the next 15 years to ensure the safe operation of the system.
The project is intended to improve Kulara Water's energy efficiency, reduce power costs, and ensure better access to power supply. “This project represents the latest achievement in our sustainability strategy and is just the beginning of our adoption of solar energy solutions to power our operations,” said Margaret Forey, Chairwoman of Kulara Water.
For TotalEnergies, this is the second recent C&I PV installation in Cambodia. In December, the French energy giant partnered with Vanco Industries to install 750kWp of rooftop solar on its factory in Kandal province to help garment manufacturers such as Swedish retailer H&M deliver on its climate commitments.
A lack of access to reliable electricity supply and high electricity prices have become an obstacle for companies and industries in Cambodia, undermining the Kingdom's competitiveness compared to its neighboring countries. While its neighbor Vietnam has seen astounding growth of PV installations, Cambodia has been slow to diversify its energy mix and remains mostly reliant on hydropower and coal.
Under the current solar regulation in Cambodia, C&I customers connecting solar PV for self-consumption are subject to a two-part tariff, consisting of a usage charge and a capacity charge. The usage charge tariff, ranging from 9.3 to 12.0 USD ¢/kWh, is lower than the one-part tariff charged to users only buying power from state-owned electric utility EDC.
The capacity charge is charged per month on the basis of the contract demand (in kW) that is agreed with EDC for customers connecting at higher voltages. In Cambodia, solar is the only technology subject to a capacity charge, with all other technologies charged a simple, one-part, per kWh tariff, according to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/20/how-artificial-intelligence-can-be-used-to-identify-solar-panel-defects/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 20, 2022",How artificial intelligence can be used to identify solar panel defects,"For example, if you are running a computer vision algorithm to identify solar panel defects, you are engaging in AI, ML, and CV. In contrast, if you are translating words from English to Spanish using an algorithm, that is more likely to be AI or ML, not CV.
Most AI inspection projects in the solar panel industry are typically computer vision (CV) initiatives. This means that an algorithm uses images to identify solar panel defects.
The use of AI and CV in solar panel inspection is relatively novel. Traditionally, solar farm operators would use a team of workers to manually inspect solar panels for defects. This process is slow, expensive, and not very accurate. Every solar farm operator knows that maintenance visits are extremely expensive, and are simply not feasible to perform daily for an entire solar deployment.
To speed up the inspection process and improve accuracy, solar farm operators are turning to AI-powered inspection. This involves the use of algorithms that can automatically detect solar panel defects from images.
This process is much faster and more accurate than manual inspection. Additionally, solar farm operators can use AI-powered inspection to identify defective panels before they are installed on the solar farm, and after they are already operational.
There are a few different ways that solar farms can deploy AI-powered inspection. The most common way is through the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone. UAVs provide a non-contact way for solar farm operators to perform quality control of their solar panels using aerial imagery.
Images collected by a UAV over a solar farm can be processed by an algorithm either in the cloud or on-device. The results of the AI algorithm will tell the quality controller which PV panels have visible signs of defective equipment.
By using automatic defect classification AI, quality controllers can reduce costs by surveying their entire facility in a few hours rather than hiring someone for days to conduct maintenance. Moreover, automatic identification of defective panels can speed up inspection time with location-based tagging, thus improving efficiency.
The most common algorithm type used in solar panel inspection is a deep learning algorithm. Deep learning algorithms are a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a neural network to learn how to solve a task. Neural networks are composed of interconnected layers that can learn how to recognize solar panel defects from images.
These deep learning networks require training data, which are large datasets of labeled images. In many cases, the solar farm operator can provide these labeled images to the deep learning algorithm. Alternatively, an AI vendor can provide these labeled images off the shelf.
For the in-house approach, this is done by creating a training dataset that consists of images containing solar panel defects, and also images without solar panel defects. The solar farm operator will label each image as either defective or non-defective so that the neural network learns how to identify both types of panels.
Once the deep learning algorithm has been trained, it can be used to inspect solar panels in images collected from a solar farm. The neural network will identify any solar panel defects in the image and provide a classification (defective or non-defective).
While AI-powered inspection offers several advantages for solar panel inspection, there are some challenges that need to be overcome.
The first is the availability of training data. In order for a deep learning algorithm to learn how to detect solar panel defects, it needs a large dataset of labeled images. This means that the solar farm operator needs to provide a set of solar panel images that contain solar panel defects and a set of solar panel images without defects.
The second challenge is the lack of standardization in solar panels. Solar farms can install hundreds or even thousands of different types and models of solar panels – each with its own unique characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc. Since solar panel characteristics can vary between solar farms, this could affect how well a single deep learning algorithm works across multiple solar facilities.
The final challenge is in the model accuracy of inspection results. Algorithms trained to detect solar panel defects will not be 100% accurate. This means that a small number of solar panels may be incorrectly classified as defective. However, by using multiple deep learning models (trained on different datasets), the chances of incorrect classification can be minimized.
Overall, AI is a very powerful tool for solar farm operators and should be incorporated into their maintenance routine. While there are some challenges, solar panel inspection using AI will increase efficiency and reduce costs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/20/quantum-battery-prototype-for-superextensive-charging/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 20, 2022",Quantum battery prototype for superextensive charging,"An Australian-Italian research group has designed a prototype of a quantum battery that could be used for applications based on superextensive charging.
Quantum batteries are storage devices that work on Quantum Mechanics principles and reportedly have a faster charging time due to the quantum entanglement among the units. These devices are able to harvest and store light energy simultaneously and are intended for applications on the nanoscale. “Quantum batteries have a counter-intuitive property in which the recharge time is inversely related to the battery capacity, that is the amount of stored electrical charge,” said Cnr-Ifn researcher, Tersilia Virgili. “This leads to the intriguing idea that the charging power of quantum batteries is super-extensive, meaning that it increases faster with battery size.”
The prototype consists of a microcavity enclosing a molecular dye known as Lumogen-F orange (LFO). “The structures fabricated consist of a thin (active) layer of a low-mass molecular semiconductor dispersed into a polymer matrix that is deposited by spin coating and positioned between two dielectric mirrors, forming a microcavity,” the scientists explained. “By diluting the LFO, we reduce intermolecular interactions that lead to emission quenching, producing a high photoluminescence quantum yield of around 60% at low concentration.”
The Italian group prepared samples with 0.5, 1, 5, and 10% concentrations, which are described as representative of the optimal operating regimes. The device's charging and energy storage dynamics were assessed via ultrafast transient-absorption spectroscopy. “Our results demonstrate that as the number of molecules in the microcavity increases, its charging power density remarkably increases”, the academics said commenting on the testing results. “This means that it takes less time to charge a single microcavity containing N molecules than it would to charge N single-molecule microcavities, even if the latter were charged simultaneously.”
These properties, which the research group described as superextensive, are claimed to be supported by the theoretical modeling presented in the study and to be their key experimental findings. “By constructing the quantum battery in a way that units can exist in superposition, the total system can behave collectively,” the researchers went on to say. “This behavior, known as quantum coherence, allows the units to act cooperatively, giving rise to a hyper-fast charge that depends on the number of molecule-units.”
According to the scientists, the device's capability for energy retention should be gauged through decoherence processes, which would enable the battery to charge quickly and discharge much more slowly. “This stabilization of stored energy is a key step to exploit superextensive charging,” they concluded, noting that the battery could be used as an optical sensor in low-light conditions or potentially for energy harvesting applications. “More generally, the idea of superextensive charging may have wide-reaching consequences for sensing and energy capture and storage technologies,” they concluded.
The prototype is presented in the study Superabsorption in an organic microcavity: Toward a quantum battery, which was recently published in Science Advances. The research group includes scientists from the University of Adelaide in Australia and Italy's National Research Council (Cnr-Ifn) and Politecnico di Milano

This result compares to 620 MW in 2020, 932 MW in 2019 and 2.41 GW in 2018.
Around 150 MW of last year's new capacity was registered in the third quarter, and brought the country's cumulative installed solar power capacity to 7,815 MW.
The Turkish PV market is currently being driven by self-consumption and net-metered rooftop PV. Turkey introduced net metering in May 2020 and the market has responded by starting to shift away from the megawatt-sized projects which have traditionally dominated. More recently, however, several tenders for large scale were launched or held and new capacities for utility scale projects should come online over the next years.
The Solar Energy Roadmap report published by the Turkish PV association in 2019 predicted the nation could install 38 GW of solar by 2030. A separate study, published by the Istanbul-based Shura Energy Transition Center in May 2018, had predicted solar could pass 20 GW by 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/20/topcon-vs-perc/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 20, 2022",TOPCon vs PERC,"Researchers from Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have outlined a series of cost-driven strategies to accelerate the industrial upscale of tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar products.
“Maintaining a high conversion efficiency in mass production is a key aspect to compete with the state-of-the-art PERC cell in terms of system cost and levelized cost of electricity,” the research's corresponding author, Bishal Kafle, told pv magazine. “Recent developments in device research have led to an increasing gap between the conversion efficiencies of TOPCon and PERC cells. Nevertheless, a standard process flow for industrial TOPCon cells is not yet established.”
According to him, although a reduction in production costs is important, the economic viability of TOPCon requires a stable 24/7 production with equivalent uptime and utilization rates to current passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cell manufacturing facilities. “Additionally, a TOPCon cells on an n-type substrate requires silver (Ag) contacts on both sides, reduction of Ag usage remains an important aspect as well for this concept, at least in the middle and long term,” he further explained.
In the paper, TOPCon – Technology options for cost efficient industrial manufacturing, published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the German research team explained that the processes and existing equipment that are commonly used in the manufacturing of PERC cells may be easily adapted to TOPCon cell production by adding two process steps: the formation of tunnel oxide and the deposition of intrinsic/doped polysilicon.
“The properties of these layers are vital towards designing the subsequent cell processing steps, aiming to achieve high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and a low series resistance promised by the TOPCon-concept,” explained the researchers, noting that n-type substrates are more expensive to integrate than their p-type counterparts, due to the higher costs of the boron emitter diffusion process compared the phosphorous diffusion process typically used in PERC cell manufacturing.
The study provides a technical route to improve the low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) process, which is currently the standard in the industry for TOPCon products, and evaluates possible alternatives to this technique, based on industrial tool availability, process compatibility, availability of all process parameters required for a cost of ownership (COO) modeling, lean process flow, and successful demonstration of the process functionality.
The LPCVD technique is still considered a valid approach by the research team as it ensures good thickness distribution along the wafer, pin-hole free layers with good step coverage, the use of relatively low deposition temperatures close to 600 degrees Celsius, a large number of wafers per batch, and the option of in-situ doping with constant doping profile. However, the LPCVD tool also has a reduced throughput due to a significantly longer process duration compared to that used in PERC cell manufacturing, which inevitably leads to higher production costs.
“Nevertheless, for the process route featuring in-situ deposited LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si layers, we identify a possibility of combining the high temperature annealing and oxidation of boron emitter in a single step, which makes this approach economically competitive in comparison to the process route featuring ex-situ LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si layers,” they continued.
Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) were considered as alternatives to LPCVD and the analysis showed that no clear winner can be identified between the three technologies. “It is observed that COO of a-Si deposition step scales down significantly with the thickness of the a-Si layer, although interestingly the cost reduction is largely dependent upon the used deposition technology,” the Fraunhofer ISE researchers said. “A much stronger reduction in COO for thinner layers is observed for PECVD and APCVD-deposition technologies, which is mainly related to their significantly higher a-Si deposition rates in comparison to LPCVD.”
The scientists also compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for 5MW ground-mounted PV plants relying on bifacial PERC technology and TOPCon products featuring LPCVD, PECVD and APCVD. Their analysis showed that the TOPCon techs have 13.5–18.6% higher All-in Cell costs and 3.6–5.5% higher All-in Module costs in comparison to PERC benchmark.
“The additional cost for TOPCon module is mainly related to a higher CAPEX and facility-related costs for the cell production facility, a significantly higher process consumable costs in the cell processing due to the additional process steps required compared to a PERC cell, and the higher price of n-type as to the PERC p-type wafer substrate,” they emphasized. “At LCOE level, all the evaluated TOPCon concepts under monofacial illumination show slightly lower LCOE values to the bifacial p-PERC technology, assuming a TOPCon cell efficiency advantage of 0.5% over PERC at 23.5% and 23.0% respectively.”
According to them, in order to outperform PERC in economical terms, the most conservative TOPCon concept should achieve a minimum efficiency gain of 0.55%. “For the best-case TOPCon concept, a cell efficiency gain >0.40% to bifacial p-PERC already allows cost-effective high-volume manufacturing of TOPCon solar cells,” they concluded.

Ávila-based photovoltaic glass manufacturer Onyx Solar has provided its product for the construction of a photovoltaic skylight at the Port of Malaga.
The installation covers a surface of 214m2 and has a peak power of 20kW. It is comprised of 70 crystalline silicon photovoltaic glass modules of different sizes and shapes.
“The project consisted of replacing the existing and inactive glass with photovoltaic glass from Onyx Solar,” the company said in a statement. “In addition to generating its own clean energy, this project will allow the Port Authority of Malaga to start considerably improving the interior comfort of the building by filtering harmful radiation from the sun, while also improving thermal transmittance.”
The glass modules have been fully customized to the customer's needs. For the comprehensive renewal of the skylight, it was also necessary to adapt the size of the photovoltaic glass modules to the existing structure of the building.
Specifically, glass has been supplied in rectangular, triangular, and rectangular trapezoidal shapes: the rectangular glasses have 9 different sizes, ranging from 2,580 x 920mm to 2,700 x 1,320mm; the triangular glasses measure 1,251 x 1,256mm; and, finally, the trapezoidal rectangular glass reaches 3,459mm and 2,554mm.
A glass with medium transparency was chosen, with enough space between the polycrystalline solar cells to allow plenty of natural light to enter the building.

Renewable energy developer X-Elio said this week that it has achieved financial close for its 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm. Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) committed AUD 37 million ($26.7 million) toward the south-east Queensland project.
The CEFC invested in the project as part of a syndicate of lenders featuring Dutch-based financial group ING and Japanese financial institution Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC).
The Blue Grass solar farm, located 14 kilometers west of Chinchilla in the Darling Downs Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), Queensland, is X-Elio’s first major project in Australia. It is also its largest to date and is expected to generate 420 GWh of green energy per year when complete.
X-Elio Australia Country Manager Belinda Fan said the Blue Grass solar project represents the opening phase of the company’s long-term interest in Australia’s energy transition, with full commercial operations expected in the first quarter of 2022.
“We’re thrilled to have achieved financial close for the Blue Grass Solar Farm – our largest solar project in Australia and one that strengthens our position in the domestic renewables market where we continue to pursue new growth opportunities,” she said. “This includes more than 600 MW of projects in our development pipeline which is growing exponentially each year. X-Elio is a global business with a local mindset, and we are committed to enhancing economic and social outcomes in the local communities and regions where we operate.”
CEFC Chief Executive Ian Learmonth said the government-owned green bank’s AUD 37 million investment in the project supports the “latest solar technology” to further strengthen the nation’s renewable energy grid while supporting the Australian Renewable Energy Agency-led (ARENA) “30 30 30” initiative that is designed to achieve ultra low-cost solar.
The initiative aims for solar PV to achieve 30% efficiency at AUD 0.30 per installed watt by 2030 and is expected to help drive down costs to meet the goal of solar electricity generation at AUD 15 per MWh.
The Blue Grass Solar Farm features an estimated 375,000 bifacial solar modules, which Learmonth said have an increased generation capacity compared with existing panels, as well as half-cut cell technology, which reduces the cell to half the normal size.
“Blue Grass Solar Farm will include the latest technology that this innovative sector can deliver and will truly be a solar farm for the 21st century,” he said.
Learmonth said the CEFC’s commitment is its 32nd solar farm investment since inception and a further demonstration of the critical role it plays in Australia’s transition to net zero emissions.
“This latest renewable energy investment demonstrates that CEFC expertise and capital is central to the ongoing evolution of the sector,” he said. “Since our earliest investments, the CEFC has been instrumental to the development of renewable energy capacity, which is pivotal to cutting emissions across our economy. With this latest investment we are proud to have contributed to the delivery of more than 3.5 GW of low-emissions generating capacity, including 2 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of wind. This clean energy will underpin our energy transition for generations to come.”
Learmonth said the investment builds on new renewable energy investment commitments by the CEFC of AUD 810 million in the 2020-21 period, representing a 53% increase on the AUD 529 million of the previous year.
“The transition to net-zero emissions requires substantial decarbonisation, at a much faster pace than we are currently achieving,” he said. “One of the most effective ways to do that is to fortify Australia’s renewable energy sector and reduce the cost of solar PV generation to help meet stretch targets for technologies such as green hydrogen, low-emissions steel and aluminum.”
X-Elio’s successful financial close for the Blue Grass Solar Farm comes more than one year after it announced a “landmark” virtual power purchase agreement” (VPPA) for the output of the solar plant with US-based software company Salesforce.
X-Elio said it had signed a 10-year agreement with Salesforce which will purchase 25% of the Blue Grass output, contributing to its commitment to reach 100% renewable energy by 2022. It is the US tech giant’s first renewable energy offtake agreement in Australia.
X-Elio, which is co-owned by US investment firms Brookfield and KKR, said the Blue Grass project represents the opening phase of the company’s long-term interest in Australia’s energy transition. It plans to leverage its 17 years of experience in the development, construction and operation of solar PV projects. It has already built 2.6 GW solar PV plants across more than 10 markets throughout the world.
X-Elio currently has 25 solar plants in operation in 13 countries, including the 42 MW Marcovia solar farm in Honduras and the Guanajuato solar farm in Mexico. The company is also developing the Forest Glen (120 MW) and Wunghnu (80 MW) solar farms in New South Wales and Victoria respectively.

A downward trend in polysilicon prices is anticipated this year, and inventory levels across the entire solar value chain are expected to begin building through the first half of 2022, said Corrine Lin, chief analyst at PV Infolink and Dora Zhao, senior analyst at PV Infolink, in a recent webinar held by Philip Shen, the managing director of ROTH Capital Partners.

PV Infolink says that polysilicon ex-VAT (pre-tax) prices should improve from the current levels of $26-$30/kg to as low as $19/kg by the end of the year. Prices have recently ticked back up to about $30/kg, largely due to decreased polysilicon inventories driven by seasonality ahead of Chinese New Year and a rebound in utilization levels from the end of 2021, said Zhao. 
Inventory levels are expected to build across the value chain, according to the report. Currently, value chain inventory levels are well below healthy levels, sitting at about a month to six weeks across all segments, said PV InfoLink. Polysilicon inventory is about two weeks, and wafers hold less than one week of inventory.
The report predicts an increase in production to 318 GW of polysilicon and 322 GW of wafers globally in 2022. It said that an inventory build of about 30 GW above forecast production for modules may result in pricing support for polysilicon and wafers through 2022. 
Capacity expansions are on the way across the value chain, driven by “just-in-case” inventory considerations due to ongoing Covid logistics. Lin and Zhao noted many new entrants are expected to continue through 2023, including Shangji Automation, Gaojing Solar, Shuangliang Group and Fuxing New Energy (n-type wafers.) 
Lowered polysilicon pricing will send a ripple effect through the supply chain, and PV InfoLink projected module prices will drop from $0.27/W in the first quarter to $0.24/W by the fourth quarter. 
N-type modules are expected to increase to about 7% to 8% market share this year, while PERC modules will likely retain their dominance with about 90% market share. Lin said there has been a rise in companies taking interest in TOPCon expansion over heterojunction. She said that perovskite technology likely needs five or more years to take a meaningful share of the market.
