The will complete the installations through their joint venture, Meton Energy S.A.,  which is 51%-owned by RWE Renewables. Construction is set to start in the fall, with commissioning scheduled for next year.
The investment has been estimated at €196 million ($214.5 million) with €98 million to come from the European Union’s post-pandemic recovery fund. The companies are securing about €59 million of the total in the form of commercial debt from several Greek lenders – Alpha Bank, Eurobank, and the National Bank of Greece – in addition to €39 million of shareholders’ equity.
“The financing is subject to financial close,” said the companies in a press release.
The Amynteo Cluster II will not participate in the country’s renewable energy tenders. They will be remunerated via 15-year-long power purchase agreements (PPAs) with PPC. Konstantinos Mavros, chief executive of PPC Renewables, has spoken to pv magazine in the past about plans to build subsidy-free solar farms that sell electricity to PPC via PPAs.
PPC Renewables was the first utility to start working on subsidy-free projects in Greece – a market segment that has progressed slowly. However, this trend is now shifting as several PPA-backed projects are currently underway in Greece.
There is no doubt that under Mavros' leadership, PPC Renewables is taking the lead. A few months ago, pv magazine reported that Heron, a local Greek utility, signed 10-year and 12-year PPAs with RWE and PPC's joint venture, Meton Energy. These PPAs pertain to a different portfolio of solar plants currently under construction.
RWE and PPC's plan for Greece is to develop 2 GW of solar capacity in the country's former lignite regions, such as Western Macedonia. This aligns with Greece's target to establish 3 GW of solar in mining regions.

Enel Green Power has developed a new robot for automated solar panel cleaning without the use of water, in partnership with Sicily-based startup Reiwa.
The robot can move on the panel rows independently and does not require human assistance. It is also able to recharge itself via solar panels and return to its docking station at the end of the journey.
The SandStorm system is equipped with a system of brushes that act as the cleaning force.
“The approach normally adopted involves cleaning the surfaces with pressure washers or tractors equipped with hydraulic brushes; both cases entail water consumption and gas emissions from the motor vehicles used,” Enel Green Power said. “Sturdy and versatile, SandStorm adapts – when necessary – even to the non-homogeneous alignment of the trackers of the panels, managing to move independently from one row of panels to the adjacent one.”
Enel Green Power has already tested the system at its Innovation LabEGP research center of Passo Martino, near Catania, and then on an industrial scale in a 1 MW section of a PV plant it operates in Totana, Spain.
“Today EGP is scaling up the application of this technology with an initial contract for the implementation of around 150 robots in two Spanish PV plants, Totana and Las Corchas, for a total capacity of 135 MW,” the company said.

But their study shows that an early deployment of green hydrogen could lead to higher hydrogen costs and CO2 emissions. If natural gas prices mirror those of the 2022 energy crisis, green hydrogen will become the primary source by 2030 and 2050, causing a substantial price increase.
Aalto University researchers have led a team to show the potential of introducing hydrogen as an energy carrier in Finland. The study indicates that this transition would result in a substantial reduction of CO2 emissions by 71.5% and fossil energy consumption by 72.6%, alongside a notable increase in electricity consumption by 31.9%. Their analysis says that the incorporation of 19.98 TWh of hydrogen in the industry and transport sectors could notably reduce fossil fuel utilization from 78.92 to 21.60 TWh/a, as well as CO2 emissions from 22.91 to 6.54 MtCO2/a in Finland by 2040. To accommodate the heightened electricity demand, a significant expansion of renewable generation becomes essential. The researchers also emphasize the advantages of flexible hydrogen production, which helps mitigate renewable curtailment and enhances energy efficiency. However, they note that such flexibility requires hydrogen storage, which is currently economically unfeasible.
Nikola says that its has recorded more than 200 sales orders for the Class 8 Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, with a majority of the agreements established directly between fleets and dealers. The company, headquartered in Phoenix, said that the sales comprise 202 orders for the purpose-built heavy-duty trucks, serving 18 different end customers. The production of these trucks has commenced at the Nikola Coolidge manufacturing facility in Arizona, with deliveries anticipated to commence later this year. Notably, Nikola has also secured an additional $16.3 million in funding for the development of seven open-network hydrogen refueling stations across the United States.
Solvay Peróxidos de Los Andes has inaugurated a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production plant in the city of Coronel, located in the Biobío region of Chile. The plant, designed to operate for a minimum of 30 years, will initially have a production capacity of 23 thousand tons per year during its first phase.#
H2i Technology has produced its initial batch of 10 commercially viable hydrogen injection kits in Victoria. These kits will be employed for field testing with prospective clients over the upcoming six months. The Australian company said that its hydrogen enhancement system involves specialized hardware and proprietary software for managing hydrogen injection into diesel engines, leading to substantial emission reduction and fuel cost savings. The final testing and calibrations are projected to conclude within 2-4 weeks.

An investigation carried out at the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) used research into solar cell materials provides an example of this, as well as illustrating how quantum computing techniques could be used to simulate even more complex interactions.
Singlet fission is a process where one photon is able to excite two electrons – potentially greatly increasing solar cell efficiency. It has been observed to occur in various materials, but understanding its mechanics and getting it to happen in a uniform way have so far proved difficult.
“Conventional solar cells have a theoretical maximum efficiency of about 33%, but it has been postulated that materials that exhibit singlet fission can break that limit and can be more efficient,” said Daniel Claudino, a research scientist at ORNL’s Quantum Computational Science group. “The downside is that to understand fundamentally whether a certain material exhibits singlet fission is very hard. There is a specific energetic requirement, and it's difficult to find materials that fulfill it.”
Using Quantinuum H1-1 – a commercially available quantum computer located in Colorado, the group was able to develop an effective simulation to identify molecules that demonstrate singlet fission, and showed that a “linear H4” molecule consisting of four hydrogen atoms has the necessary energetic level for the singlet fission process – which the group says could be useful knowledge in the development of more efficient solar cell materials.
The simulation is described in full in the paper Modeling Singlet Fission on a Quantum Computer, published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters.
More valuable than the actual findings in this study is the demonstration of a useful application for quantum computing – a technology still in its early stages. Quantum computers are able to go beyond the binary ones and zeros used in conventional computers, and also use both positions simultaneously – making them potentially much more powerful in solving certain types of problems.
Claudino says that singlet fission provides an excellent solution to a problem for quantum computers to tackle. “The energetics of singlet fission revolve around double electronic excitations — two electrons move up to higher energy levels simultaneously, which is quite difficult to pin down with algorithms for conventional computers,” Claudino said. “But the underlying way that a quantum computer works, it can naturally treat the quantum correlations that give rise to this singlet-fission phenomenon.”

The group came up with multiple ways to simplify and optimize its algorithms for use in the quantum computer “The idea is that you want to envision a way to tap into the quantum computer but only for specific tasks that we know they can perform better than conventional computers,” Claudino said. “Yet, even then, you’re still limited by the current state of the art that only allows us to either go up to a certain size or perform tasks that only take so long. That’s the major bottleneck when turning to quantum computers.”
The group says that its optimizations reduced the processing time from several months to a few weeks, demonstrating the viability of quantum computing, and introducing a set of best practices for use of current systems.
Claudino and colleagues now plan to move on from singlet fission and investigate other applications for the quantum computing techniques it developed, including looking into “the interaction of matter and light.”

This is the main conclusion of new research from Afeka Tel-Aviv Academic College of Engineering that expects PV to cover at least three-quarters of the country's electricity demand by the end of the first half of the century.
In the study “The potential of renewable electricity in isolated grids: The case of Israel in 2050,” published in Applied Energy, the research team estimated that Israel may offer a total area of 1,129 km2 for solar energy deployment, most of which is located in the Galil Golan and the Negev regions.
The research did not include an economic assessment of the potential transition, stating uncertainties regarding cost evaluations as well as micro and macro-level developments. Gur Mittelman, the corresponding author, highlighted macro-level variability as the main reason for avoiding an economic analysis.
“From the state’s point of view, the transition to renewables is far exceeding the scope of the energy economy,” Mittelman told pv magazine.  “This fundamental observation is missed by many researchers who only try to compare the fossil electricity cost versus the costs of renewable energy plus storage”.
Available land for PV
This availabe surface, according to the scientists, offers the technical potential for deploying 172.5 GW of photovoltaics, of which 132.1 GW may come from conventional installations, and 40 GW may be from agrivoltaics. If deployed, this huge amount of solar power would require energy storage with a combined capacity of 500 GWh. Intensive storage capacity would be required to compensate for the intermittent nature of solar energy. “Peak demand in Israel usually occurs in the evening,” they said.
They also estimated the country's total electric demand for the year 2050, including electromobility, at 183.3 TWh and considered vehicle-to-grid (V2G) as a major source of storage. “In the V2G concept, the battery cost is actually embedded, or sunk,” Mittelman added. “There is a need for smart charging stations infrastructure, which are expected to be developed anyway as more and more electric vehicles are predicted to enter the market”.
Electromobility
The team assumed Israel may have 7 million electric vehicles (EVs) circulating in 2050, of which 6.6 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and 0.4 million plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), with their respective battery sizes being 75 kWh and 15 kWh, which in turn would result in a theoretical V2G capacity of 501 GWh.
It calculated an annual mileage of 16,200 km for the private sector and a fuel economy of 180 and 200 Wh/km for BEVs and
PHEVs, respectively, with annual demand in the private sector being 20.5 TWh, and 22.7 TW with the addition of public EVs.
Scenarios
The study predicts under its “more realistic” scenario that 80% of Israel's 2050 electrical mix could be based on renewable energy, with around 57.6% being covered by conventional solar PV and 17.6% by agrivoltaic solutions. The remaining minimal share of renewables would be covered by wind, sea wave energy and other minor sources. Solar would use only half of the area available for deployment and the total energy storage capacity needed would amount to 216 GWh.
The most optimistic and less likely scenario provided by the study predicts solar may reach an 88% share of the country's electricity mix by 2050, with the storage capacity reaching its maximum potential of 500 GWh.
Another mid-term scenario also projects that solar may reach a 47% share by 2030, with storage capacity reaching 60 GWh.
“To our best knowledge, several energy resources, such as agrivoltaics and sea waves in Israel, were analyzed in detail for the first time,” the scientists concluded, referring to the novelty of their work. “Thus, the current work could be referred as a roadmap for the future Israeli electricity sector. “

Ana Cabral-Gardner, the CEO of mining company Sigma Lithium, met with Brazilian Minister of Energy Alexandre Silveira this week to discuss lithium extraction projects in Vale do Jequitinhonha, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. This region offers significant potential for mineral production.
The ministry is currently formulating a comprehensive program tailored to the region, with a primary focus on exploring the mineral's opportunities within the context of energy transition and regional development. The program encompasses the generation of business opportunities, income augmentation for the local populace, and overall social development.
Lithium, a critical raw material for battery production, is abundant in Brazil, which ranks as the seventh-largest global holder of mineral reserves, totaling 1.23 thousand tons. Moreover, the country stands as the world's fifth-largest mining producer.
Silveira said that the Vale do Jequitinhonha lithium mining project presents a chance for Brazil to establish itself as a prominent player in the global production of this essential mineral for the energy transition.
“We know that critical minerals will be fundamental for the energy transition, so we have to work on top of these Brazilian potentials, reconciling public policies that bring significant social returns to our society and that guarantee sustainability,” said Silveira.
Last week, Sigma Lithium dispatched the world's first shipment of green lithium from Porto de Vitória to China. This shipment, originating from the mineral extracted in Vale do Jequitinhonha, includes 15,000 tons of triple zero green lithium and an additional 15,000 tons of ultra-fine, high-purity byproducts. It is expected that by the end of this year, exports will reach approximately 130,000 tons.
Brazil – alongside countries like Chile, Argentina, the United States, Canada, and Australia – stands among the nations with the highest potential for lithium extraction.

Data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, using the Solcast API, revealed a relatively normal month, with the majority of the continent seeing between 90%-110% the July average. This is despite a relatively extreme month for local weather.
While the northern regions battled storms, southern Europe was scorched by the Cerberus’ heatwave, with Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Bosnia all seeing over 40 C. Yet, despite these meteorological variances, the overall solar irradiance averages for the month remained largely normal.

The shift from the exceptionally high irradiances observed in June in the UK and France, driven by a dominant high-pressure system over the North Sea, to a more traditional summer weather pattern, was clearly discernible in NOAA data visualized below.
July was characterized by a low-pressure system extending over the UK and Scandinavia and the Azores high-pressure system exerting
influence over the southwestern region.

This low-pressure system, more profound than is typically observed during this period, ushered in a significant amount of moisture from the Atlantic. Consequently, this led to lower-than-average solar irradiances for regions like northern France, the UK, Benelux, and Scandinavia, as you can see in this daily irradiance map for July 27th.

 
Conversely, the Azores high-pressure system brought about clearer skies across southern Europe, resulting in above-average irradiances. However, these were punctuated by severe storms triggered by the collision of cold fronts with the region's heatwave-induced hot air.
Northern Italy, Switzerland, and Croatia were particularly impacted by these storms before they swept over Eastern Europe and Russia.
Hailstones as large as tennis balls caused substantial damage to photovoltaic systems near Milan, as highlighted in our article earlier this month. In Switzerland, 125 mph winds wreaked havoc.

Despite these weather extremes, the balance of solar irradiance between the stormy north and the heatwave-stricken south culminated in an overall irradiance average that remained within typical bounds for the month of July.
This reaffirms nature's remarkable equilibrium amidst a period of significant weather fluctuations.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

The research group stressed that solar module recycling is currently not viable economically, and said its approach consists of making conventional solar panels into BIPV products without any modifications.
“There is a significant reduction in the cost due to the wall, windows and roof in case of the adoption of EoL-PV modules,” the research's lead author, Roshan R. Rao, told pv magazine. “The weight of these panels is much lower when compared to that of conventional 250 mm thick brick walls. The foundation for an EoL-PV structure would be much lighter and cheaper.”
The researchers constructed a real building integrated with EoL-PV panels, which they said is configured a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) house where the walls, roof, and windows are constructed using EoL-PV panels.
Its performance was then compared with that of a simulated building-applied photovoltaic (BAPV) house using brick walls with plaster and RCC Roof, with the EoL-PV modules being attached to the structure, as well as that of a reference house built with traditional materials. Each unit housing unit is assumed to measure 3 m × 3 m × 3 m and to be based on the typical construction practice followed in India.
“We conducted climate responsiveness of these buildings through measurements and whole building simulations,” Rao said. “We are assessing the climate responsiveness of such buildings in different climate zones and possible interventions to improve the thermal performance of such buildings.”
Despite the theoretical end of their lifecycle, the reused solar panels are still assumed to provide a nominal power of 4 kWh/m2/day and to be used for providing the housing units with part of the power they need. Furthermore, the Indian team considered their net embodied energy, which is the initial embodied energy subtracted by the energy they generated till the end-of-life stage.
“The cost analysis has been done considering the actual cost of each building material by developing ‘Bill of Quantities’ for a building constructed conventionally in India and the structure of the EoL-PV panel integrated buildings,” added Rao.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the BIPV building has lower net embodied energy than the BAPV concepts, as the latter requires additional material to fix the EoL-PV to the existing building. “The net embodied energy of the building is only because of the non-PV building elements,” note the researchers.
Utilizing Energy Payback Time (EPBT) analysis, they ascertained that payback times for the BIPV and BAPV units using 15-year-old solar modules would be 3.42 years and 5.5 years, respectively, with the annual degradation rate of the modules representing the most significant factor influencing these values. “The benefit of upcycling an EoL-PV panel from the Net Embodied Energy perspective depends on the age of the EoL-PV panel,” they noted.
The group presented its findings in the paper “Examining the use of End-of-Life (EoL) PV panels in housing and sustainability,” published in Solar Energy.
“With our approach, EoL-PV would no longer be seen as a liability to either manufacturers or users,” Rao said. “PV manufacturers may consider re-design/modify the frames with an intent to allow for such application in the end-of-life stage.”

Major California utility PG&E has launched a distributed energy management system (DERMS) in partnership with Schneider Electric. The cloud-based DERMS operates on Microsoft Azure.
The software is intended to enable greater amounts of distributed energy to participate on the grid, responding to periods of extreme weather or heavy electricity demand. PG&E said the software enables faster grid connections.
The platform, called EcoStruxure DERMS, collects and analyzes data for resources like electric vehicles, rooftop solar, battery energy storage, and microgrids. The data then provides grid operators with improved coordination and communication to help demonstrate and unlock the value of flexible grid resources.
Microsoft, Schneider Electric, and PG&E will work collaboratively to achieve a new utility-industry standard for integrating distributed energy resources at scale. The collaboration is an example of Schneider Electric’s “Grid to Prosumer” philosophy.
“A stepwise approach is key in [distributed energy resources] implementation to effectively handle short-term goals and prepare for the long-term vision,” said Schneider Electric.
PG&E serves more than 16 million people across Northern and Central California. The utility has over 700,000 rooftop solar customers and 55,000 battery energy storage customers connected to its grid. This equates to over 500 MW of local, flexible resources ready to efficiently coordinate electricity use.
The utility also has more than 1.2 GW of grid-scale energy storage online, and that is expected to reach 1.7 GW by September. It has contracts for more than 3 GW of storage to be deployed over the next few years.
PG&E is preparing the grid to power and support three million EVs on the road in its service area by 2030, with goals of more than two million EVs participating in vehicle-grid-integration initiatives. A DERMS software platform is a ready-made fit for coordinating these resources.
“This methodology empowers utility companies to digitally transform to achieve their sustainability, efficiency, reliability, and flexibility goals,” said Schneider Electric.
The three have identified several initial use cases for the system:

Arizona-based Solestial, a specialist in space-based solar tech, has agreed to partner with in-space logistics firm Atomos Space. It will supply ultra-thin PV blankets for Atomos Space’s solar-electric orbital transfer vehicles (OTV).
The deal calls for at least 20 kW of ultra-thin, low mass, radiation-hardened solar blankets to power the craft for several upcoming missions in 2024. The company said its 20-micron thick cells demonstrate over 20% efficiency.
Atomos Space’s OTVs provide a range of transportation services for satellite operators. The craft use high-powered electric propulsion systems, making use of PV as a steady supply of power in space. Following an initial demonstration, the blanket shipsets from Solestial will power two OTVs providing deployment services to constellation operators in low Earth orbit and relocation services to operators in other orbits.
“It was clear that traditional space solar was too expensive and too supply-constrained to support our high-power OTV design,” said Atomos Space CEO Vanessa Clark. “We were attracted to Solestial’s solution as they provided the best combination of solar array specific mass performance, radiation hardness, and affordability available on the market today.”
The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) independently validated the ability of Solestial’s ultrathin silicon solar cells to effectively anneal radiation damage under sunlight at 90 C (194 F). This means the cells essentially self-heal under radiation damage.
Solestial’s silicon solar cells open circuit voltage dropped by only 4% and maintained 96% of initial value after being exposed to radiation equivalent to 10 years in low Earth orbit.
“Annealing of radiation damage in silicon is straightforward at high temperatures, for example, above 200 C to 250 C, but this is not useful for applications in space as these temperatures are rarely, if ever, experienced in situ,” said Romain Cariou, space silicon solar applications expert for CEA. “The differentiation factor here is that Solestial’s cells can cure radiation damage at normal operating temperatures for solar panels in space.”
The company has been developing its technology for over a decade, beginning its life in Arizona State University. It underwent a $10 million seed funding round in October 2022.
Solestial targets a 2025 launch of a manufacturing facility capable of producing 10 MW per year of solar blankets.

While the market eyes rising prices in the upstream segments, most manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see approach, according to OPIS’ market survey. Mono M10 cell prices increased 1.73% this week to $0.0939/W. The cell segment has the lowest inventory level across the whole supply chain, meaning cell prices could increase further, a source said.

Yet hiking module prices is challenging as the market deals with oversupply and intense rivalry among sellers, concurred multiple sources. Numerous recent low price bids for China projects from vertically integrated players have eroded the breathing room for manufacturers who only make modules and lack the advantage of low production costs, according to a source.
International markets are similarly gloomy as they sit on significant module inventories. Due to the backlog from this year’s first and second quarters, one maker stopped replenishing its European warehouses this June, a source at the firm said. Echoing the sentiment, another source said regions like Europe and South America “do not simply have the conditions for price increases due to the enormous backlogs of modules.”
According to the production schedule of module makers. China is expected to produce roughly 47 GW of modules in August, according to one source. Module makers could cut manufacturing if cell prices continue to rise, the source added.
