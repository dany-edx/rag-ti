The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened an investigation into Tesla in response to a 2019 whistleblower complaint alleging that the company failed to properly notify its shareholders, customers and the public of fire risks associated with solar panel system defects. According to Reuters, the defects were a known hazard for several years.
The issue was originally brought to light by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla field quality manager, who filed a whistleblower complaint on the solar systems in 2019. Henkes recently filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the SEC on the status of his complaint, which is when the regulator disclosed the existence of the investigation.
According to Henkes’ complaint, Tesla and SolarCity, which was founded by Elon Musk’s cousins, Peter and Lyndon Rive, and acquired by Tesla in 2016, failed to disclose “liability and exposure to property damage, risk of injury of users, fire etc., to shareholders” of SolarCity solar modules, both prior to and after the acquisition.
In 2019, Walmart filed suit against Tesla over fires that the company alleged originated at PV installations designed, installed, owned and maintained by Tesla/SolarCity at its stores in three states.
Walmart counted seven fires in total, but only four occurred on systems under contracts with Tesla and not SolarCity before the acquisition. These four started from March through November 2018, and include an array that was supposed to be de-energized but still caught fire in November 2018.
Walmart said that inspections of the systems revealed “widespread, systemic negligence and had failed to abide by prudent industry practices in installing, operating, and maintaining its solar systems,” and that this greatly increased the risk of fires. Company inspections allegedly found a large number of microcracks, hotspots and backsheet damage, which suggested the installation of damaged solar panels.
The lawsuit was settled shortly after filing.
Elon Musk, personally, is also facing an approximately $2.2 billion lawsuit filed by shareholders over Tesla’s purchase of SolarCity, which the suit alleges was an attempt to bailout Musk’s cousins’ struggling company, of which Musk was the largest investor and chairman. The shareholders’ suit also accuses Tesla’s board of having a lax approach to corporate governance.

That suggests same-continent supply deals will initially drive hydrogen trading, especially in Asia and Europe. Plans for more than 260 GW of electrolyzer capacity had been announced by the end of October. “We estimate that this could bring an additional 475 GW of wind and solar PV capacity, one-third of total installed variable renewables today,” wrote the IEA, adding Europe leads in terms of planned electrolyzer capacity, accounting for around 40% of the total. Lack of demand and competition from fossil-fuel-powered ‘grey' hydrogen could be problematic, however, the report stated. “The mismatch between currently planned projects and the demand for green hydrogen output remains a key uncertainty for future electrolyzer expansion,” wrote the report's authors. “Government policies are currently more focused on decarbonizing hydrogen production than developing demand for new applications.”
pv magazine Australia will be examining the outlook for large scale solar Down Under in a webinar tomorrow morning. The team, with our partner Risen Energy Australia, will kick things off at 7 a.m. (CET) and you can sign up for the event here.
The use of hydrogen at the Port of Valencia, to reduce the environmental impact of machinery in a terminal that operates year-round, will make the site Europe's first port to use the energy carrier for that activity, the port has claimed. The project “has been recognized by different organizations, and which the European Commission has selected as a strategic initiative for the decarbonization of maritime transport,” wrote the port on Thursday, adding it will install a green hydrogen supply station at the beginning of the new year. The mobile station will supply enough hydrogen to guarantee the continuous working cycle of the equipment which is part of the European Commission-backed H2Ports project. Oxford-based power market data company Aurora Energy Research says hydrogen will play a key role in Iberian decarbonization efforts. “There are three key reasons for this,” wrote Aurora last month, “one, the vast potential for renewable energy in Iberia will lead to lower green hydrogen production costs than in other European regions; two, policy efforts seem to be focused on green hydrogen versus other low carbon alternatives, e.g. nuclear or CCS [carbon capture and storage]; and three, the proposed hydrogen targets are highly ambitious, creating valuable opportunities for the industry.”
French automotive supplier Plastic Omnium has said it will continue “its expansion, in the wake of its first commercial successes” in hydrogen mobility. The company wants revenue of €3 billion by 2030. Last month, Plastic Omnium teamed up with U.S.-based automotive development, simulation, and testing company AVL for the development of high and medium-power hydrogen systems. “The new partnership will enable Plastic Omnium to accelerate the commercial roll-out, as of 2022, of a range of high-performance, cost-effective hydrogen systems for use in all categories of vehicles,” read a press release published in late November.
Saudi state-owned energy company Aramco has signed five agreements with French businesses, including a commitment to explore a hydrogen-powered vehicle business with zero-emission transport company Gaussin. Aramco and Gaussin wants to establish a manufacturing facility for hydrogen-powered vehicles in Saudi Arabia. As a first step, the partners will study the feasibility of a factory and a hydrogen distribution business to serve the Middle East. “This partnership is a continuation of Aramco’s long-standing relationship with a number of leading French companies,” said the energy company's CEO Amin H. Nasser. “It represents an opportunity to promote hydrogen as a low-carbon solution, not just for motorsport but eventually for mass transportation as well.” The Saudi energy giant is diversifying its business but this week signed a $15.5 billion (€13.8 billion) ‘lease and leaseback deal' for its gas pipe network, with a consortium led by U.S.-owned BlackRock Real Assets and the Saudi state-owned Hassana Investment Company buying a 49% stake in a new Aramco subsidiary which will lease usage of the pipes, including to its parent company.
Norwegian thermoplastic composite pipe producer Strohm has signed a memorandum of understanding with German-Spanish offshore wind business Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy. “The collaboration will focus on developing hydrogen transfer solutions that improve the decentralized green hydrogen concept, whereby green hydrogen is generated in each wind turbine generator and transported to shore by a subsea pipe infrastructure,” Strohm said today. “In this concept, power cables are replaced by a pipe infrastructure, storing and transferring hydrogen.” Strohm last month teamed up with Norwegian engineer Seanovent to work on offshore wind-to-hydrogen development. Siemens Gamesa is looking at opportunities in Scandinavia and last month struck a 455 MW deal with Swedish developer OX2 “for what will be Finland’s largest ever wind farm.”
South Korea's Korea Gas Corp (Kogas), one of the biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers in the world, will invest in hydrogen production and facilities while acquiring under-evaluated LNG assets, according to Kogas President Lee-Bong Chae. “For economical hydrogen production and supply, we will continue to build various types of hydrogen production plants and hydrogen refueling infrastructure, as well as actively pursu[ing] green hydrogen business overseas for hydrogen take-off,” said the executive. “In addition, we will make very substantial R&D investments, in the form of strategic alliances with leading companies, joint R&D, and M&As [mergers and acquisitions].” According to U.S.-based financial data company S&P Global, state-controlled Kogas – which is expected to produce 1.04 million tons of hydrogen per year by 2030 – will finish its first hydrogen production plant by March 2023. The company wants to produce the energy carrier through steam reformation.

One deal was sealed with Chinese-Canadian module maker Canadian Solar, for 22,800 metric tons of ingots for 182mm and 210mm wafers, which would equip 10 GW of solar products. The value of that contract is estimated at around RMB7.2 billion (US$1.1 billion). A second agreement has been signed by Juangsu-based Xinchao PV, which agreed to buy 9,720 tons of mono ingots, for the same two wafer sizes, in a deal worth an estimated RMB3.1 billion (US$486 million). The third supply award was secured from Changzhou-based SF Solar, which has purchased 300 million pieces. Shuangliang yesterday said that contract value is around RMB1.86 billion (US$292 million).
Energy company Petro China has opened a tender to procure 4.5 GW of solar panels for its renewable energy projects. Solar farms are planned in 24 Chinese provinces, mostly in the north of the country. Petro China issued three sub-tenders for the northwest, northeast and north of the country, with capacities of 2.6 GW, 1.1 GW and 800 MW, respectively. The buyer wants modules with power outputs ranging from 455 to 540 W and the deadline to submit bids is on December 27.
Independent shareholders in state-owned solar developer China Shuifa Singyes Energy yesterday unanimously approved a move by the company to spend RMB103 million (US$16.2 million) on three solar facilities owned by fellow Shuifa-controlled business Shandong Shuifa Clean Energy Technology Co Ltd. The solar capacity concerned is a 2 MW, distributed-generation array on a sewage plant; a 25 MW “fishery-solar” project; and 20 single-megawatt blocks of solar arrays.
Manufacturer China Glass today said it will pay RMB300 million (US$47 million) to state-owned CNBM Bengbu Design – a subsidiary of the Triumph Group which is a substantial shareholder of China Glass – to install production equipment for photovoltaic ultra-white rolled glass.
Solar cell and module maker Tongwei yesterday said a planned convertible bond issuance has been approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The company expects to raise RMB12 billion (US$1.88 billion) and will invest the sum chiefly in expanding its polysilicon and wafer production.

The first call of the program had been launched in late June. Of the program's total budget, CZK1 billion is being allocated for projects not exceeding 1 MW in size and CZK3.5 billion will be earmarked for solar installations with a capacity of over 1 MW.
According to him, around CZK1 billion should be assigned in the next round. “Currently, the projects submitted so far only cover about 80% of that allocation,” he also explained. “The maximum available subsidy is roughly CZK7,000 per megawatt-installed and, however, we do not currently have any info about the final capex of projects. Given that they are smaller, and given the current price volatility, we expect the capex for these projects to be between CZK15,000 [and] CZK20,000 per megawatt.”
“I am a bit worried about whether the market will be ready to react to the component shortage,” Krčmář emphasized. “Ultimately, I think installers will rather choose to build larger projects so I think, in case of a panel shortage and a shortage in manpower, it will, rather, be residential PV that will take the hit.”
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Czechia had 2,073 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020, 13 MW less than it had at the end of 2019. The nation has also provided incentives for rooftop PV through a Green Savings Program and to solar-plus-storage projects through a separate, dedicated scheme.

In theory, replacing this layer with nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) – a similar material that contains small grains of crystalline silicon within the amorphous structure – could bring even better performance thanks to higher transparency and conductivity. So far, however, the material has proved difficult to incorporate in manufacturing, and researchers have struggled to process layers thick enough to form a contact that also maintain the better characteristics.
Making this layer as thin as possible is one promising approach, and has been the focus of a group of scientists led by TU Delft in the Netherlands. Its latest work demonstrates a process for application of an nc-Si layer just 3 nanometers thick (compared with 8-10 nm typically achieved by other approaches), to a cell that achieves 22.2% efficiency and offers much room for improvement based on this approach.
The cell is described in full in the paper Ultra-thin electron collectors based on nc-Si:H for high-efficiency silicon heterojunction solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The cell showed improvements in short circuit current over a counterpart fabricated with amorphous silicon, and comparable performance in open circuit voltage and fill factor.
By adding a double-layer anti-reflective coating, the group was able to increase the cell efficiency to 22.88%. And they provide a list of several optimizations that could push the performance even further. “Further improvements to achieve cell η > 23% in the short-term are (a) a more transparent TCO, such as IFO:H, (b) a lower front metal coverage via finer-line screen printing or copper-plating, and (c) a better passivation quality by applying a bilayer (i)a-Si:H layer stack,” the group stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/07/solar-glass-anti-dumping-case-sent-back-to-eus-general-court/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,EUROPE,GERMANY",MAX HALL,"DECEMBER 7, 2021",Solar glass anti-dumping case sent back to EU’s general court,"A German glassmaker and the European Commission have succeeded in a bid to set aside a ruling by the General Court of the EU which favored the attempt by Chinese solar panel glass company Xinyi PV to avoid paying anti-dumping (AD) duties on its products in Europe.
A judgement by the European Court of Justice on Thursday rejected the first part of an appeal which was lodged by the Xinyi Solar-owned business against the AD duties in August 2014.
With Xinyi having responded to the permanent imposition of anti-dumping duties by the EU in May 2014 by making four legal pleas, the rejection of the Hong Kong-listed manufacturer's initial objection will now be sent back to the EU General Court to consider the remaining three arguments.
The December edition of pv magazine is out today. Read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 has been another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
The long-running case relates to the AD duties imposed provisionally by the EU on Xinyi and three other Chinese solar glass makers in November 2013, and on the right of Xinyi to be treated as if it were operating under market conditions, rather than receiving state-planned benefits.
The European Commission refused a request, made by Xinyi in May 2013, to be treated as operating under free market conditions on the basis it had benefited from two tax breaks which reduced the normal, 25% rate which would have applied to the business. One tax scheme offered full exemption for two years followed by three years at the half rate of 12.5%, and a second offered Xinyi a lower, 15% rate because it was deemed a high-technology business by the Chinese authorities. Xinyi's attempt to argue both regimes were temporary was undermined by the Court of Justice pointing out the latter program could be extended on a rolling basis at Xinyi's request.
In response to Xinyi's appeal against its lack of market-economy status, the General Court of the EU in March 2016 annulled that decision by the European Commission, explaining the latter had wrongly interpreted the rules for determining the Chinese company's status, as claimed by Xinyi in the initial part of the first plea of its four-pronged appeal.
That decision, by the General Court, was set aside by the European Court of Justice in February 2018, which said the other court had made legal errors in upholding the Xinyi argument and returned the case back to the General Court. The latter body responded by again annulling the commission's denial of market-economy status for Xinyi, this time on the basis of the second part of the initial plea made by the manufacturer.
That prompted Austrian-owned German company GMB Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg GmbH and the commission to apply, two years ago, to have the General Court's annulment set aside, leading to the decision made by the European Court of Justice on Thursday.
The Court of Justice agreed with the European appellants that the General Court had wrongly placed the burden of proof for establishing Xinyi's market-economy status with the European Commission's investigators, rather than with the Chinese manufacturer. The Court of Justice also agreed that either benefits to a Chinese company's general financial status or, specifically, to its production costs, would be sufficient to deny market-economy status. The General Court had agreed with Xinyi's claim that both would have had to be proven, meaning tax breaks would fall short of the requirement as they could not be proven to have directly affected solar glass production costs.
The ball is now back with the General Court, with the Court of Justice delaying a final decision on who will pay for the case. Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg, which is part of the Liechtenstein-registered solar glassmaker Interfloat business owned by Austrian wood company HS Timber Group, had sought to have Xinyi pay the costs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/07/new-provisions-may-help-italy-unlock-110-gw-pv-project-pipeline-with-grid-connection-requests/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 7, 2021",New provisions may help Italy unlock 110 GW PV project pipeline with grid-connection requests,"The latest Forum Italia Solare event, held last week in Rome, has shown, once again, the big disproportion between Italy's potential for solar energy development and the meager results that this market has achieved in the past years and is currently obtaining, despite the urgent need for reaching ambitious climate and energy targets.
During the event, representatives of the Italian high-voltage grid operator, Terna, and of the low and middle-voltage network, Enel Distribuzione,  revealed that the two companies have accepted to review, to date, grid-connection requests for PV projects with a combined capacity of 90 and 20 GW, respectively, which shows the huge interest between investors and both residential and commercial prosumers.
According to Italia Solare president Paolo Rocco Viscontini, however, this impressive pipeline is currently difficult to unlock, as Italy's regulatory framework represents a barrier that makes project development and construction very difficult, if not impossible in some cases. And the government, according to him and several more analysts presents at the event, is not doing enough to improve conditions for renewable energy developers of any size. “The last time we spoke with the government was in March 2020 and ever since, all our attempts to resume a dialogue have been ignored,” he repeated several times during the conference.
“What is missing and is urgently needed is the identification of regional targets in order to urgently move on to defining suitable areas,” Viscontini told pv magazine. “But, without regional targets, which are otherwise known as burden sharing, you can't get anywhere. I also see the need to adopt policies aimed at encouraging storage for commercial and industrial PV, as well as for the utility scale segment. In doing so, we may avoid continuing to say that renewables are not programmable.”
The event in Rome coincided with the publication in the Italian official journal of the Legislative Decree no. 199/2021 to implement the Directive 2018/2001/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 11 December 2018, on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, which most of the event's participants judged as a positive development. These new provisions will come into force on December 15 and will introduce, among other things, a series of improvements in the Italian legislative framework for renewable energy.
“The decree sets the goal of reducing emissions by at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels, and achieving 30% of renewables in the energy mix,” Emilio Sani, founder of law firm Sani Zangrando Avvocati and board member of Italia Solare, told pv magazine. “It also stabilizes the incentive system for both projects of up to 1 MW and installations exceeding this threshold. For the former, the access to incentives will be … simplified and developers will have direct access to the tariffs without having to go through a tendering process.”
With regard to authorizations, the new rules introduce a standardization of documentation at the national level. The areas for renewable energy project deployments were divided into three categories: suitable areas, unclassified areas, and unsuitable areas. In suitable areas, the opinion of the Soprintendenza Archeologia, Belle Arti e Paesaggio – which is the government department responsible for monuments, the environment and historical buildings – will be non-binding and there will be a fast track procedure to make the timeframe shorter for planned PV projects. “It will take a year to define which areas are suitable,” Sani further explained. “Six months for the definition at the national level and the following six months for the ratification by each region. This mechanism, however, leaves operators in a situation of great uncertainty for one year on the most critical issue today, which is the difficulty in authorizing projects.”
The new provisions also introduced a series of improvements for renewable energy communities. “The threshold for access to incentives is raised to 1 MW and the incentives will be guaranteed for the energy that is produced simultaneously with consumption by the members inside the primary cabin where the installations are located,” Sani emphasized. “The communities can also be of significant size because access to the communities will be open to all citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises located in the municipalities where the plants are located. In this way, it will be easier to set up communities with adequate economies of scale.”
According to data released by Italia Solare at the event in Rome, Italy's cumulative installed PV capacity reached 22.4 GW at the end of October. “More than 1 million PV systems are now operational in our country,” Viscontini said, noting that the milestone was being achieved in the same days as the forum. Of this capacity, around 35% is represented by PV systems ranging in size from 200 kW to 1 MW and 21% by installations with a capacity of up to 12 kW. Solar parks with a power of 1 to 10 MW account for 16% of the total and facilities over 10 MW for 5%. Residential installations of up to 4 kW reached a 17% share. The remaining 6% was secured by rooftop PV ranging from 12 to 20 kW.
The solar association believes that around 800 MW of new PV capacity may be deployed this year, growth judged insufficient to reach the 52 GW solar target set by the Italian government for 2030, which implies that more than 3 GW per year will have to be installed during the current decade.
The main market driver is currently the so-called ‘superbonus,‘ which has boosted growth in the residential segment, with PV systems up to 20 kW having so far this year secured a 49% share of all the 672 MW of deployed capacity. The more-than-generous tax break, which is being offered to building renovations and energy re-qualification projects, is an income tax (IRPEF) rebate that applies to three types of renovation projects, including building insulation, the replacement of cooling and heating systems in multi-unit apartment buildings, and the replacement of cooling and heating systems in single-family homes. PV projects linked to building renovations not included in these categories will not be granted the super eco-bonus but will still be awarded a 50% tax break.
As for the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, several issues were highlighted during the conference. Attilio Piattelli, president of SunCity Srl and member of Italian Solare, said that the investment return for self-consumption projects, under net metering, is currently between five and six years, which is discouraging many potential businesses from becoming prosumers. The current tender proceedings for projects of up to 1 MW, the so-called registri, are also slowing down development, and the above-mentioned new rules may bring more clarity in the months to come. Furthermore, Piattelli said that storage systems may play an increasing role in the C&I segment thanks to the new provisions introduced last week.
According to Emiliano Pizzini, the vice president of Italia Solare, the utility scale segment is currently the one that is suffering the most in the Italian market, due to the well-known issues for permitting and social acceptance. “Rooftop PV may provide up to 2 GW per year, which means large scale solar needs to achieve at least 1 GW per year,” Pizzini stated. “At present, there are many projects in the authorization phase but the completion of the process appears to be, in many cases, a mirage.” He also stressed the failure of the tender scheme for large scale renewables, which saw around 3 GW of power generation capacity remaining unallocated in the first six rounds of the scheme. “Both subsidized and unsubsidized solar, via PPAs, need a redesign of the market,” Pizzini stressed. Agrivoltaics may see stronger development in the years to come in this segment, as the Italian government has recently decided to allocate €1.1 billion for the deployment of around 1.04 GW.

French startup Wind my Roof has developed a small-scale hybrid wind-solar power generator for rooftop applications.
The system consists of a 1,500 W wind turbine and two 600 W solar modules. The company said the pairing of the two sources helps maintain a good level of production all year round, while optimizing the use of space on the roof.
The hybrid WindBox system can purportedly produce up to 2,000 kWh of wind energy and up to 800 kWh of photovoltaic energy per year, for a total of 2,800 kWh/year. In addition, the system integrates the same inverter and battery, which results in lower costs, according to the company.
The system requires a rooftop area of 4m² and measures 2.1 meters x 1.6 meters x 2 meters. It weighs 300 kg. It has been tested under extreme climatic conditions and its automatic safety systems can provide resistance to up to 180 km per hour of wind and temperatures down to -15 C. It is equipped with anti-vibration, fixing systems and a hull that makes it silent.
The manufacturer said that 92% of the installation is made in France. It added that a life-cycle assessment (LCA) study is now being certified.
The idea of developing the technology began at the end of 2016, during a course in fluid mechanics at the École des Ponts, where two engineers were studying the recovery of wind energy from buildings. Research shows that only one place on a rooftop is really usable – the ridge of a building. The wind “takes off” above the buildings it hits, after climbing up the facade and accelerating slightly.
On the edge of the roof, the WindBox can recover horizontal and vertical winds, said the company. This also offers good exposure to the sun, while optimizing a rarely used area and leaving space available for traditional solutions, such as more rooftop PV.
The company has installed a prototype on a building in La Défense, in Paris.
“We have international goals, and ambitions especially in Germany,” said Yanis Maacha, a company spokesperson.
The company – with the support of the SolarImpulse Foundation, BPIFrance, and the French environmental agency, Ademe – recently raised €700,000 ($790,280). It is now preparing to launch the installation of its first eight power plants in Rouen, in Normandy.
The company has also secured support from French engineering group Segula Technologies, both in terms of design and production development.
“The energy transition is an essential sector of diversification for our group. This is the challenge for the future that we wish to address,” said Segula Technologies Technical Director Nicolas Fraisse. “Thanks to our HeXplora startup support platform, we were able to support Wind my Roof in the first stages of their production to assemble the first eight WindBox prototypes.”

Gujarat-based Solex is putting up a 1.2 GW solar module manufacturing facility in Surat which will become operational by the end of January.
Solex representative Brijesh Khanna told pv magazine the new plant will be equipped to produce high-output, 500-750 Wp-rated, modules which will feature 182mm, M10 wafers, and 210mm G12 products, to offer conversion efficiencies of more than 21%.
The manufacturer then plans to install solar cell production facilities with an annual capacity of 1 GW in 2023 as well as another 2.5 GW of module lines in the same year, for a total module output of 3.7 GW.
“We will start working on [the] cell line as soon as our 1.2 GW module fab becomes operational in January,” said Khanna. 
Solex is also planning a ‘plug-and-play' solar development area in Bharuch, where energy generators without land or roof space can set up PV projects. The site, which it is expected will take four to five months to develop, will be able to host 15 MW of generation capacity.

Called X3-Forth, the new series offers three-phase products with power ratings of 80 kW to 125 kW, for a 380 V output; and 136 kW to 150 kW for a 500 V output.
All the inverters of the series have a size of 985x660x327.5mm and their weight ranges from 77 to 83.3kg. They are equipped with up to 12 MPPT inputs and are able to provide up to 32 A MPPT current. The maximum PV input voltage is 1,100 V and the maximum PV array input power spans from 120 to 225 kW.
Their efficiency ranges from 98.6% to 99.0% and the MPPT efficiency for all products, is 99.9%. “With only 200 V, low start-up voltage, 150% oversized input power, and 110% AC output power, the X3-Forth can harvest more energy from the sun and maintain stable working over a long period of time,” Solax said in a statement.
The systems also feature smart fan cooling, IP66-rated protection, and are able to operate at an altitude of up to 3,000m. “It’s equipped with a surge protection device, AFCI protection, AC terminal temperature monitoring and other protection modules to diagnose the system internally,” the manufacturer further explained. “[The] Solax Cloud platform provides open API protocol to third-party system[s] to integrate a customized system to make sure the customers can monitor the system [in a] timely [manner].”
When deployed in 60 units in parallel, the X3-Forth inverters can reach a maximum power of 9 MW. “Despite only being an inverter, the X3-Forth performs more like a power station assistant,” the company also stated. “By using dynamic MPPT algorithms and supporting bifacial components, customers will be fearless of complex topography.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/07/kaust-achieves-28-2-efficiency-for-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 7, 2021",KAUST achieves 28.2% efficiency for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell,"Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.2% for a tandem solar cell with an area of around 1 cm2, based on an n-i-p perovskite stacked on top of a silicon heterojunction. The remarkable performance was achieved through a novel strategy to suppress halide segregation and reduce nonradiative recombination loss, which consists of using carbazole, a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic molecule, as an additive for the cell perovskite precursor.
“The cell could be used for solar panels for large-scale applications, space application, and also other applications that now mainstream silicon can cover,” researcher Jiang Liu told pv magazine. “The cell technology could be easily transferable to commercial production, as Oxford PV and other Chinese manufacturers have shown.”
The researchers claim the molecule is able to passivate deep charge traps and suppress phase segregation in wide-band-gap perovskites, such as that used for their tandem cell with a bandgap of 1.68 eV.
“We find that this organic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic molecule interacts with halide anions through hydrogen bonds, immobilizes halide species, and passivates trap states,” they said. “Specifically, this happens at the grain boundaries because the carbazole molecules, with a relatively large molecular radius, cannot be incorporated into the perovskite lattice.” 
The additive was found to prevent the migration of ions in the perovskite film even under humid conditions – one of the main causes for halide segregation.
“Our results show that the illumination intensity, the environmental atmosphere, and trap passivation all alter the dynamics of halide segregation,” the academics said. “In the case of superposition of multiple stressors, halide segregation occurs faster, but the addition of carbazole minimizes this behavior.”
The single-junction perovskite sub-cell was built on a substrate made of glass and an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of the 2PACz carbazole additive, the perovskite layer, lithium fluoride (LiF), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The champion solar cell developed by the Saudi group achieved an efficiency of 28.6% for a device with a 1cm2 surface and 27.1% for an area over 3.8 cm.
“We verified our in-house measurements with 28.2% stabilized power output certified by an accredited laboratory, the Japan Electrical Safety & Environment Technology Laboratories,” the scientists said. “Our tandem device is commensurate with the state-of-the-art tandem devices in the literature and represents the record-certified PCE for double-textured perovskite/Si tandem devices.”
Currently, the most powerful perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is a 29.8% device that was recently developed by scientists at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) in Germany.
The KAUST researchers also conducted a stability test on the cell. They found it could retain around 93% of its original performance over 43 days in hot and humid outdoor environments. The team published all of the technical details in a recent report that was published in Joule. In July, the team also demonstrated a perovskite-silicon tandem cell that reached a 27% conversion efficiency rating.

As the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has noted, floating PV (FPV) is a growing niche, but within that niche, like a Russian doll, is the smaller but similarly growing niche of offshore FPV. 
While FPV projects have now been installed on freshwater lakes and reservoirs in more than 40 countries, offshore FPV does not have the luxury of such calm and protected waters, meaning the equipment for offshore applications needs to be of exceptional, specialized quality. 
Thankfully, the technology for these applications is improving rapidly. And considering a 2020 study by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimated potential FPV on hydropower reservoirs at 7.6 TW, there has not yet been any serious calculation for the potential of offshore FPV. 
Unlocking this potential depends on making the right technological advancements to develop offshore FPV arrays capable of withstanding ocean waves and winds. But there is no shortage of companies on the case. Take German wave energy technology specialist Sinn Power GmbH, for example – it recently unveiled its first floating ocean ‘hybrid’ platform, which combines wave, wind and solar energy. 
A G8 spokesperson told pv magazine Australia that practical trials of the Modular Tractive Buoyancy (MTB) technology, as well as the subsea stabilization system and high-voltage subsea power connection to the floating hybrid plant, “have proven successful in Singapore with the Sunseap Woodlands Project. A 5 MW PV system together with a 20 MW marine rated substation installed in  early 2020 off the northern coast of Singapore.”
“Our aim is to use this hybrid concept to increase the power generation capacity by up to two times that of a normal floating solar plant,” the spokesperson said. “G8 is presently in an advanced engineering study with WookYung Engineering and Construction of South Korea to construct a 3 MW turbine combined with 1 MW of solar on a stabilized platform.”
On the research side, scientists at Malta’s Institute for Sustainable Energy have developed a simulation tool to assess the effect of wave response motion in offshore floating PV installations.
G8 Subsea has announced its pipeline of projects until 2024 and the list contains some ambitious FPV installations. The projects include the 75 MW Sarawak FPV array in Malaysia by Sarawak Energy and a 100 MW FPV project in Ghana. On the engineering side, the company is also involved in the 145 MW Pandan FPV project in Singapore, and in the supply of floating substations for the 145 MW Cirata FPV array in Indonesia. 
G8 Subsea told pv magazine Australia that discussions on these projects are at an advanced stage, but it noted that more information is currently bound up in non-disclosure agreements. That said, site engineering and construction works are expected to begin next year, once the pandemic subsides.
G8 Subsea is targeting an initial public offering in mid-2022, as it looks to firm up investment.
“We’re facing the greatest energy transition timeline of our generation,” said G8 Managing Director Gerald Tan. “And it’s all about solving a global problem, by developing better and more sustainable sources of energy. An IPO will enable us to enter the global renewables arena. We want to play at the international, not just the national level. The growth prospects of this industry are limitless, and a public listing would better equip us to leverage that growth.”
