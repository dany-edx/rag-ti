They said the overshoot is equal to five times the total number of cars and vans sold throughout the world in 2021. Auto sales by General Motors, Hyundai-Kia, Volkswagen, and Toyota are on track to exceed the 1.5 C threshold by 13 million, 39 million, 43 million, and 63 million ICE vehicles, respectively. Projected ICE sales range from 645 million to 778 million vehicles, for “an overshoot of 105% to 147% compared to the 1.5 C-compatible number of ICE sales,” said the researchers.
Foxconn has laid the foundation stone for an electric-vehicle factory in Thailand, as part of its joint venture with Bangkok-based energy company PTT. It is scheduled to start operations in 2024, with an initial annual capacity of 50,000 EVs. It will gradually ramp up to 150,000 EVs per year by 2030, due to growing demand in Southeast Asia. Foxconn, which recently unveiled plans to become an EV maker, said the Horizon Plus joint venture's business model will be based on its contract production service.
FREYR Battery has announced plans for a US gigafactory in Coweta County, Georgia. It will develop the project in phases, beginning with an initial battery cell production module of approximately 34 GWh, with an estimated capital investment of $1.7 billion. FREYR, which is building a 29 GWh gigafactory in Norway, said additional investment could hit $2.6 billion by 2029. It is using the SemiSolid battery production tech of 24M Technologies, a spinout from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The 24M process reportedly simplifies lithium-ion battery production with a design that requires less inactive materials, such as copper and aluminum, and fewer manufacturing steps. The process reduces manufacturing costs by up to 40%, according to 24M.
SK On has signed a lithium supply contract with Chile's SQM. The South Korean battery cell manufacturer will buy up to 57,000 tons of lithium hydroxide from SQM over a five-year period from 2023, which is enough to produce batteries for about 1.2 million EVs. SK On expects the deal to boost its efforts to meet US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) requirements, as Chile is a free trade agreement partner with the United States. In October, SK On signed a deal with Lake Resources to secure battery-grade lithium for up to 10 years from the fourth quarter of 2024, after acquiring 10% stake in the Australian company.
Daihatsu has signed a battery supply partnership with CATL. The Japanese car manufacturer will use CATL’s cells and battery management systems for its future electric models, with the use of technologies such as CTP (cell-to-pack) specifically mentioned in the agreement. Daihatsu expects the deal to help it ramp up production of affordable EVs in Japan and emerging markets.

The floating photoelectrochemical devices showed a 0.58% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.
“With further development, we expect the floating leaves to match the performance of state-of-the-art artificial leaf prototypes, which is about 5-10% for solar to hydrogen production,” researcher Virgil Andrei told pv magazine.
The scientists assembled the 1.7 cm2 lightweight artificial leaves by attaching perovskite photocathodes to bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes with a contact adhesive. They deposited the lead halide perovskite photocathodes onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films. They then covered the resulting perovskite-BiVO4 photoelectrochemical devices with micrometer-thin, water-repellent carbon-based layers to prevent moisture degradation and water infiltration.
The artificial leaves can split water into hydrogen and oxygen or reduce CO2 to syngas.
“The current leaves can either develop hydrogen or syngas, depending on the catalyst choice,” said Andrei. “The devices are quite versatile, allowing us to easily integrate different catalysts for a range of products.”
The leaves produced visible carbon monoxide and hydrogen bubbles in a symmetric design during operation, which was key to maintaining balance while floating, the scientists said. Outside of the lab, lightweight reactors facilitated gas collection to aid floating during outdoor testing.
The devices show the potential to be scaled, noted the scientists. They said they produced larger-scale 100 cm2 samples with a comparable performance and stability to their 1.7 cm2 counterparts.
“We showed that the lightweight devices are compatible with modern, large-scale fabrication techniques. However, specialized equipment will be required to prepare these leaves on a square-meter scale,” Andrei said. “Acquiring such equipment and optimizing the deposition may take 5 years. Once these large-scale prototypes are manufactured and pass certain stability and performance standards, commercial products can become available within a few years.”
The scientists introduced the new hydrogen tech in “Floating perovskite-BiVO4 devices for scalable solar fuel production,” which was recently published in Nature.

TÜV Rheinland has developed new testing guidelines for the certification of BIPV modules.
The German certification body said the new testing guidelines will bring greater transparency to the BIPV market. It said it hopes that it will pave the way for manufacturers to get their systems approved by building authorities.
When certifying according to the guidelines, experts from TÜV Rheinland examine the properties of the BIPV panels that are relevant to building requirements and electrotechnical specifications. They consider European Construction Product Regulation CPR 305/2011, which harmonizes the rules for the marketing of construction products in the EU. They also take Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU into account, as it ensures that electrical equipment within certain voltage limits provides a high level of protection for European citizens. In addition, they look at CENELEC standards, which satisfy industry and legislative requirements for electric and electronic goods sold in Europe.
“The new TÜV Rheinland certification offers a solution for subjecting building-integrated photovoltaic modules to an independent and standardized testing and quality assurance process before they are sold,” said Lukas Jakisch, head of the solar department at TÜV Rheinland.
Reaching consensus on BIPV and what makes it different from conventional rooftop PV tech is one of the challenges that the emerging industry has to deal with if it wants to move from niche to mainstream. IEA-PVPS recently published a report to assemble developments from different parts of the world into a clear set of standards. They clearly defined functions for different products, in terms of their roles as construction materials and energy generators. At system level, the report notes three main types of BIPV systems: roof, facade, and external integrated devices.
*The article was updated on Nov. 15 to reflect that TÜV Rheinland has developed guidelines for new testing, and not standards as we previously reported.

Germany's Schüco published a product safety warning last spring indicating that solar modules delivered between 2010 and 2012 could be affected by a technical defect related to the backsheets.
It has now extended this warning, as it has found the module defects caused by the faulty backsheets, which were sourced from various suppliers, in other module series delivered between 2010 and 2014.
“A certain type of polyamide backsheet from different manufacturers can develop fault patterns that can lead to cracks in the backsheet itself,” said the company. “As a result, the potential danger resulting from the error pattern depends on the material, the location and type of installation, and other factors.”
It said that under certain weather and environmental conditions, there could even a risk of electric shock.
“From now on, parts of PV systems that may be defective due to the fault patterns in the backsheet described above must not be touched under any circumstances without the protective measures against electric shock,” it said.
It provides specific instructions on how to proceed if the solar modules are affected by the defect. Under no circumstances should the solar modules, plugs, wiring or parts of the substructure be touched without protective measures against electric shock, it said.

It reportedly has a 13% higher efficiency than similar devices with the same materials at the research level.
“This technology is directly transferable to real production,” researcher Basudev Pradhan told pv magazine. “Few solar companies are already making perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells which are on the verge of commercialization. We believe all perovskite tandem solar cells also can be manufactured commercially without being much dependent on costly silicon wafers.”
The researchers used SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium.
“Through this software, different types of solar cells can be configured by varying up to seven layers for which simulation is carried out under both dark and illumination conditions of AM 1.5G 1 sun spectrum,” they said.
In order to make the simulation more realistic, they also considered bulk defects in all the layers and interface defects between layers. They built the cell with a top perovskite cell featuring a wide bandgap of 1.75 eV and a bottom perovskite cell with a bandgap of 1.25 eV.
The top cell is designed with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer (HTL) based on copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), a perovskite layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer. The bottom cell relies on an ITO substrate, a hole-transporting material (HTM) based on PEDOT:PSS, a perovskite material, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a SnO2 buffer layer, and a metal contact made of silver (Ag).
Simulated under standard illumination conditions, the top cell exhibited an efficiency of 12.37%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.806 V, a short-circuit current of 18.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 83.91%. The bottom cell achieved an efficiency of 19.93%, which brought the overall tandem device to 32.3%. The scientists said this compares to an efficiency of 23.72%, as achieved in similar devices built with the same materials at the research level. The tandem cell also has an open-circuit voltage of 2.047 V, a short-circuit current of 18.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 86.23%.
“This simulation work provides insights into quantifying PV parameters limitation and understanding interdependency of one upon another with respect to device performance,” the academics explained. “It also helps in finding an optimized value of various device layer thicknesses along with ETL-HTL combination and its relation with device performance.”
“We haven't made an accurate cost estimation of the solar cell so far,” Pradhan said. “But the LCOE for perovskite modules built with this cell technology is definitely lower than the present mainstream crystalline silicon-based modules.”
The research team presented the solar cell tech in “All-perovskite two-terminal tandem solar cell with 32.3% efficiency by numerical simulation,” which was recently published in Materials Today Sustainability.
“This work provides a new direction for experimental realization with higher power conversion efficiency and establishes a new route toward the development of all-perovskite tandem solar cells,” the group concluded.

German utility RWE won the bid to build the hybrid large-scale wind farm.
SolarDuck will build the 5 MW offshore solar array for the project, which will include an undisclosed amount of energy storage capacity. It is expected to go online in 2026, according to a statement by the two companies.
“SolarDuck, being the first to build a hybrid project at this scale, will demonstrate the robustness of our solution, prove the important role of system integration in building future-fit energy systems, and enable the scaling of the technology to accelerate its adoption,” said SolarDuck CEO Koen Burgers.
The Dutch offshore PV specialist expects the project to accelerate the commercialization of its offshore solar technology.
“The complementarities between wind and solar resources as well as making better use of existing infrastructure and the ocean space will drive the growth of hybrid [offshore floating solar] projects,” it said in a statement.
In 2021, SolarDuck unveiled the first demonstrator project for its floating structure technology. The 64 kW system was deployed on an inshore site on the Waal (Rhine River), the widest river of the Netherlands, near IJzendoorn, a village in the province of Gelderland.
Its structures hold the solar panels more than 3 meters above the water surface. The system can handle coastal sea conditions and hurricane-force winds, but it is optimized for offshore sites in estuaries and natural harbors, as well as near-shore sites. The basic floating platforms are triangular structures measuring 16 meters x 16 meters x 16 meters. They resemble offshore floating wind platforms or floating oil platforms. They can be flexibly connected together to form large plants.

“The plant will be made of 48,000 square meters of TVP Solar High Vacuum Flat Panels, producing 25 GWh of solar heat, achieving 25% of solar share on the total energy consumption of the city,” TVP Solar's vice president of business development, Guglielmo Cioni, told pv magazine. “For the first time, a solar thermal plant will produce and inject directly into the network heat at the required temperatures, from 69 C to 93 C, in the winter time, in sub-zero climate and with low solar irradiance.”
Dutch solar developer Solarfields is cooperating with TVP Solar in to build the Dorkwerd solar thermal district heating project, backed by local investor K3. Cioni said the project combines modern private infrastructure finance with innovative technology solutions in one of the largest private investments even made in solar thermal plants.
“The Dorkwerd project will provide solar heat all year round, also in winter and subzero conditions, to about 10,000 citizens of Groningen, covering as much as 25% of their heating needs, at a competitive price, for 30 years and with zero emissions,” he said. “Solarfields poured into the project all of the best practices for the development of a typical PV investment, but this time dedicated to a new investment asset class such as the large-scale solar thermal plant for district heating application.”
The plant will begin commercial operations in October 2023.
“It will offer project developers a new and viable option to build valuable portfolios, alternative and complementary to traditional renewable assets,” Cioni said.
TVP Solar will provide its own solar thermal panels, which can produce hot water or steam at temperatures ranging from 80 C to 180 C for industrial process heating, district heating, and air conditioning. The company said its MT-Power panel exhibit no degradation over time, with an average thermal efficiency of up to 64.5% and a peak thermal efficiency of 68.6%.
TVP Solar is currently operating a manufacturing facility in Avellino, Italy. The factory has a fully automated line with a capacity of 110,000 square meters per year.

“The idea is to create what is called a technological brick and, once the industrial feasibility and profitability have been proven, to make the new product available on the European market,” said Lucas Weiss, Voltec general manager.
The latest edition of pv magazine considers the impact the Inflation Reduction Act will have on US solar and ponders where the resultant manufacturing sites will land. The situation is just the opposite in Germany, we discover, with PV investors piling up but few suitable sites left for solar farms. We also anticipate shortages in raw materials to drive the electric vehicle revolution, and the measures battery makers are taking to secure supply, and ponder the effect the rise of TOPCon solar will have on the supply of its preferred encapsulant resin.
The facility will make modules based on IPVF's 4T tandem solar cell technology. The two entities plan to set up the first pilot production line by the end of 2023 and the first 200 MW industrial demonstrator in 2025. They will then increase the factory's capacity to 1 GW in 2027 and 5 GW by 2030.
“While most market players, such as Oxford PV or the CEA, are working on two-terminal perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells, we have taken a step aside with a 4T technology,” said Weiss. “With this approach, the thin layer of perovskite is placed on glass and the assembly is integrated into a standard silicon cell as an underlayer.”
The IPVF said this innovation makes it possible to achieve a conversion efficiency of 30% at the module level. The advantage of this technology is that the silicon cell can be adapted to the thin layer and simplified. Weiss said there is also the possibility of using recycled silicon, which is less expensive, less pure and less efficient, but still able to provide a high yield.
The IPVF and Voltec plan to create a joint venture, France PV Industrie, so they can secure the necessary financing to scale up to industrial production. The pilot line will require an investment of €15 million ($15.4 million) and the industrial demonstrator €50 million. By The partners estimate the total investment at around €1 billion by 2030.
The pre-industrial line must be set up in the premises of the IPVF “as quickly as possible,” as indicated by Weiss. He said that the orders for machines will take place as soon as the financing is validated. This pre-industrial unit will be used to validate manufacturing processes.

The New South Wales government’s first tender seeking generation and storage projects as part of the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap had attracted significant interest from wind, solar and storage developers, with more than 5.5 GW of generation projects and more than 2.5 GW of long-duration storage projects received.
AEMO Services, which is administering the process in its capacity as NSW Consumer Trustee, said it has received more than 5.5 GW of wind and solar generation projects and more than 2.5 GW of long-duration storage projects covering technologies such as pumped hydro, lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and compressed air storage. The portfolio of projects is enough to power the equivalent of 2.4 million homes.
New South Wales Energy Minister Matt Kean said the level of interest is an outstanding result for the government’s long-term plan to modernize the state’s electricity system.
“This is an overwhelming response from the market and a strong endorsement of the roadmap’s vision for the [New South Wales] electricity system,” he said in a statement. “Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and the resulting global energy crisis has added extra impetus to modernise our electricity system. The need for new sources of electricity generation that are not tied to the volatility of global commodity prices has never been greater.”
The first tender is seeking about 950 MW of wind and solar and 600 MW of long-duration storage. The tender is designed to select projects capable of delivering new large-scale energy infrastructure as the New South Wales government looks to implement its roadmap which sets out a path to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage, defined as a minimum eight hours of storage, online by 2030 as the state prepares for the exit of its coal-fired generators.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said bids for the generation and long-duration storage tenders will now be independently assessed according to a set of merit criteria which evaluate the deliverability of the project, the quality of the proponent and social licence, before being assessed for financial value.
“We recognize there is an increasing need for additional energy generation and storage,” Verschuer said. “Our tenders are designed to drive competition from projects that are able to deliver that energy in the interests of [New South Wales] electricity consumers. We have a strict mandate to only recommend those projects that can demonstrate value to host communities and financial value to consumers, and in order to be successful bids will need to reflect that.”
Verschuer said while the tender had an indicative size of 950 MW of generation and 600 MW of long-duration storage, AEMO Services “can recommend greater or less capacity than this size if it is in the long-term financial interests of consumers to do so.”
Successful projects will be awarded long-term energy service agreements, underwriting the delivery of built energy resources that will benefit the long-term interests of the state’s electricity consumers.
This tender round is the first in a biannual schedule that will continue for the next 10 years, open to eligible projects located anywhere in New South Wales. The second tender is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2023.
“These tenders have been specifically designed to identify the best projects to bring quality energy to market in the earliest possible timeframe,” Kean said. “The level of investment we are facilitating in the [New South Wales] energy system is unprecedented, which is why these tenders will run every six months for at least the next 10 years.”

More than 1,000 shipments of solar components have been blocked at US ports since June under a new law that bans exports from China's Xinjiang region due to concerns about forced labor, according to a recent report by Reuters.
China's Xinjiang region, which is home to roughly 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, has fallen under scrutiny for its human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. Beijing has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor.
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) places a “rebuttable presumption” that goods from the region are made with forced labor, and it places the burden of proof on buyers to show that the imported goods have no connection to forced labor whatsoever. To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide comprehensive supply chain maps, complete lists of all workers, and proof that workers were not subjected to forced labor practices. Corporations such as Coca-Cola and Nike lobbied against the UFLPA, as their supply chains are deeply woven into China’s economy.
Reuters reported that US Customs and Border Protection seized 1,053 shipments of solar energy equipment between June 21 and Oct. 25. Customs said none of the shipments have been released yet. It quoted sources as saying that the shipments include about 1 GW of solar panels and polysilicon cells. They were primarily made by Trina Solar, JinkoSolar, and Longi, which together account for about one-third of US panel supplies, according to Reuters.
In August, ROTH Capital Partners said that more than 3 GW of components had been held up by US customs. It estimated that 9 GW to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering US markets by the end of the year.
In a press briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijan said that the forced labor allegations are “the lie of the century fabricated by a small group” people who are opposed to China.
“The US side should immediately stop the unreasonable suppression of China’s photovoltaic enterprises and release the seized solar panel components as fast as possible,” said Zhao.
Module supply challenges have been an ongoing issue in the United States, exacerbated by pandemic-related shutdowns, higher shipping costs, semiconductor supply chain challenges, the enforcement of the UFLPA, and other trade and labor laws.
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said solar developers across the United States planned to install 17.8 GW of capacity this year. However, through six months, only 4.2 GW had been brought online. From January through June 2022, about 20% of planned PV capacity was delayed, according to the EIA. Reports show solar installations were delayed by an average of 4.4 GW each month, compared with average monthly delays of 2.6 GW during the same period last year.
At the RE+ conference in Anaheim in September, Trina Solar spokespeople told pv magazine they were confident about the high degree of traceability of the company's products and supporting supply chains.
“We realized supply chain can not be centralized in one place and customers also want independence. Our mid-term strategy is to have a clear fragmentation of products and markets, as well as geographically diversify our supply chain,” said Helena Li, president of global cell and module business at Trina Solar. “Different markets require different supply chains.”
In an email, JinkoSolar said that it is working with Customs Border Patrol on documentation proving its supplies are not linked to forced labor and is “confident the shipments will be admitted.”
US Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh said that the “world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains.”
