The state authorities said that the project is scheduled to start construction in 2025, with green hydrogen production by the fourth quarter of 2026 or the first quarter of 2027.
Adnoc has opened “H2GO,” the region’s first high-speed green hydrogen refueling station in Masdar City, the United Arab Emirates. It will test a fleet of zero-emission hydrogen-powered vehicles. It said the station, operated by Adnoc Distribution, creates green hydrogen from water, using an electrolyzer powered by clean grid electricity.
Getech has launched a natural hydrogen exploration project in Eastern Europe for an undisclosed European energy company. The study focuses on harnessing natural hydrogen from ophiolites, igneous rock formations seen as prime sources of natural hydrogen. Getech uses 3D inversion modeling to distinguish magnetic properties of ophiolites from other magnetic anomalies.
The European Council and the European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on EU rules for renewable and natural gases and the internal hydrogen market. The council said that the agreement outlines a split between transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs) for hydrogen.
The German-Danish Chamber of Commerce called for implementing political measures to create a coherent Danish-German hydrogen pipeline by 2028. “We call on the German and Danish governments to accelerate the planned hydrogen infrastructure and the Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation signed in March. The final investment decision for the cross-border hydrogen infrastructure must be made by mid-2024,” said the German-Danish Chamber of Commerce. More than 30 companies, including Airbus, Basf, Siemens, thyssenkrupp, and Ørsted, participated in the event. 
Lhyfe has secured the rights to develop a green hydrogen production and distribution site in Montoir-de-Bretagne, France, following a call for proposals by the port of Nantes Saint-Nazaire. The project involves the construction of an industrial unit with a production capacity of up to 85 tons per day of green and renewable hydrogen. The French hydrogen producer said that the site should be operational by 2028, subject to regulatory approvals and the finalization of financial plans.

Both projects will be hybrid solar and diesel generator power plants consisting of a “smart” transmission and distribution network, according to tender documents.
The first microgrid will be built in the province of Palawan on the island of Panlaitan, and is expected to produce 17.3 GWh over 15 years.
The second will be located in the province of Barangay Bulalacao on the island of Mindoro, and expected to generate 11.7 GWh over 15 years.
Both regions register “underserved” levels of energy, according to the tender documents. The projects are expected to produce a minimum share of 35% of renewable energy one year following operation commencement. This will increase to 50% by 2040 and be maintained thereafter.
The projects form part of the Philippine Energy Plan – a government policy aiming to electrify all the Southeast Asian country’s households by 2030. Traditional energy sources – coal, geothermal, hydropower and natural gas – are envisaged to make up the bulk of the archipelago’s baseload capacity (70%), with a sliver (20%) coming from natural gas and the remainder (10%) sourced from oil-based plants and variable renewable energy, such as PV and wind.
Legal reforms and a liberalized energy market is making the Philippines an attractive place to rollout PV projects, one analyst told pv magazine recently.
The country aims to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030 with a possible focus on mini-grids and standalone clean power, according to a 2022 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Th US-based market research company describes China's current energy transition trajectory as a virtuous circle in a scenario characterized by falling interest rates, low energy costs, and intense price competition.
Analyst Sharon Feng attributes China's rapid expansion in solar manufacturing and reduction in solar module costs to its large domestic scale and robust export growth, effectively overcoming cost inflation challenges observed in other markets.
“China’s end-user power prices are less than half those in Europe or Australia and this supports a strong competitive edge in global trade,” said report co-author Alex Whitworth. “The China power market is now larger than that of Europe and the US combined, so if it can succeed in transitioning to a high share of intermittent renewables while maintaining stable prices, that would be a historic achievement.”

PV and wind curtailment in China reached 4% in 2022, down from over 10% before 2020, with analysts suggesting a potential increase in curtailment next year but emphasizing it will stay at manageable levels.
China is expected to install approximately 230 GW of new PV and wind capacity this year, surpassing Europe's 75 GW and 40 GW in the United States. The country is also projected to achieve a cumulative grid-connected energy storage capacity of 67 GW in 2023, with plans to expand to 300 GW by 2030.
The report notes the role of long-distance transmission lines over 1,000 km, unlocking over 100 GW of renewables development in inland China, and points to the design of around 100 GW of flexible plants to support renewable energy backup.
“China’s investment in renewables and support infrastructure in recent years has outstripped what was going into coal power by a factor of 5 to 1,” said Whitworth.  “The share of coal in power generation has been continuously falling, down 10 percentage points in the last five years to about 55% today. About 80% of the reduction was replaced by renewables and the rest mostly by nuclear power.”

German PV module provider Solarwatt will lay off 10% of its staff by the end of the year to mitigate what it is calling market turmoil.
The company blamed European politics and unfair trade competition for the restructuring in a statement to pv magazine.
“Unfortunately, there have been no quick and unbureaucratic responses from European and German politicians to the unequal conditions in competition with Chinese and US manufacturers,” the company said.
That manufacturer's “customer-related areas” – a department Solarwatt is expanding in order to accelerate a vision of the “sector coupler strategy” – will not be impacted by the layoffs.
“We are convinced that the development towards solar-driven sector coupling was and is the right decision for Solarwatt,” the company said.
Anchor investor Stefan Quandt continues to support the company.
At the end of September, Solarwatt started manufacturing solar modules based on TOPCon cell technology.

The European Union added 41.4 GW of solar power generation capacity in 2022, enough to power 12.4 million homes, and is expected to more than double the scale of its solar market in the next four years, according to a report from trade body SolarPower Europe.
Alight Energy
Of course, such a massive transition requires a lot of additional resources, not least skilled workers. SolarPower Europe's recent “EU Solar Jobs Report 2023” revealed a staggering 39% growth in the solar workforce, reaching an impressive 648,000 employees by the end of 2022 and up from 466,000 in the previous year. While initial estimates projected 1 million solar jobs by 2030, the industry now anticipates achieving this milestone as early as 2025, underscoring the rapid pace of solar market expansion.
In 2022, Poland emerged as an epicenter of the solar workforce, boasting the highest number of solar workers in Europe. Spain and Germany closely followed while Dutch, Italian, Greek, and French workers also contributed significantly to the continent's solar employment landscape. This geographical diversity emphasizes the pan-European nature of the solar revolution.
The uptick in solar job opportunities has, however, brought about its own set of challenges. The industry now faces a pressing concern: balancing the quantity of jobs needed to sustain growth with the need for skilled professionals to fill these roles. This dichotomy highlights the critical importance to solar companies of a strategic and dynamic approach to talent acquisition.
At Alight, we’re in a fast scale-up period, with a pipeline of more than 1.7 GW of solar project generation capacity in development across Europe and plans to invest more than €1 billion ($1.09 billion) over the next three years as we build out that pipeline. Of course, we need to bolster our workforce to accomplish that. We need skilled land originators, site developers, grid engineers, asset managers, sales executives, accountants, recruiters, and more.
In our quest to deliver our pipeline of projects, we’ve grown from 40 to 80 employees in the past year. To do so, we’ve implemented a recruitment strategy to attract and retain talent. We proactively target top-tier candidates and have a rigorous recruitment process to ensure a strong values and cultural fit. This, coupled with the strong sense of ownership and impact that employees report in internal surveys, helps to keep retention high and in 2022, we had a 3% turnover rate.
Recognizing the global nature of the talent pool, as highlighted by SolarPower Europe’s report, we’ve embraced a remote-first workplace culture. This enables us to source talent in mature markets where there is a lot of experience and, in turn, offer people the opportunity to translate skills they have gained in larger companies and apply them in a leading and entrepreneurial role at a growing company. In this way, geographical boundaries do not limit our access to the best and brightest minds in the industry and this flexibility has proven instrumental in meeting the urgency of the green energy transition.
To complement our remote-first culture, another key initiative has involved establishing a local presence in Madrid, tapping into the rich pool of solar expertise in the region. By opening an office in the heart of Spain we have successfully integrated local talent into our global workforce, fostering collaboration and innovation.
In addition to sourcing talent from diverse regions, we also see a strong case for recruiting from other industries. The “climate-quitters” trend, which sees employees leaving jobs from traditional industries and instead seeking roles and industries that align more closely with their values — namely the environment — has ben widely reported. This is especially true among younger generations that are more tangibly grappling with the climate emergency. In fact, a 2022 survey of 2,000 office workers in the United Kingdom found that at least half of 18- to 24-year-old workers would consider leaving a job because of the company’s net-zero policies, compared to around a third across all age groups.
Companies that actively seek skilled individuals from other industries have much to gain from bringing in fresh perspectives and ultimately driving innovation within the evolving solar sector. It is easier to succeed if we don't all fight for the same small pool of skilled labor, not to mention the fact we’re firm believers in the idea diverse teams make better collective decisions and lead stronger teams, ultimately delivering better business performance. By extending the talent search beyond the existing solar pool, we not only enrich our workforce but also contribute to a culture of cross-disciplinary innovation, propelling the industry forward.
As the solar workforce boom aligns with market growth, it is imperative for the energy transition to focus not only on job quantity but also on the quality of skills available. Our experience underscores the need for a holistic and adaptive approach to workforce management, combining local engagement, global accessibility, and a passion for making an impact. In navigating these challenges, the European solar industry will not only sustain its growth but also emerge as a beacon of sustainability and innovation on the global stage.

The state-run agency said that 105 MW of PV projects were selected in the procurement exercise.
It was Japan's eighteenth auction for utility-scale solar and was expected to assign 177.7 MW of generating capacity.
The 33 selected projects range in size from 500 kW to 25.8 MW.
The lowest bid was JPY 7.94 ($0.053)/kWh/kWh, the highest was JPY 9.19/kWh, and the average final price was JPY 8.55/kWh. The ceiling price was set at JPY 9.35/kWh.
In the previous auction finalized in late August, the lowest price came in at JPY 8.95 ($0.061)/kWh, with 69 MW of allocated capacity.
In the 16th auction held in July, the allocated power was 119.7 MW and the lowest bid came in at JPY 9/kWh.
In the 15th solar energy auction, which concluded in March, the Green Investment Promotion Organization only allocated 16.2 MW of the 175 MW tendered. The lowest bid offered in the auction was JPY 9.48/kWh and the average final price was JPY 9.56.
In the 14th exercise, held in November 2022, the Japanese authorities assigned 137.2 MW of PV capacity, out of 175 MW tendered. The lowest bid came in at JPY 9.65/kWh and the average final price was JPY 9.73/kWh.
In the 12th procurement exercise, which was finalized in June 2022, the assigned PV capacity was 153.7 MW. The lowest bid came in at JPY 8.85/kWh. In the 11th auction, held in March 2022, the assigned PV power was 268.7 MW and the lowest bid was JPY 8.99/kWh.
In 2021, the Japanese government allocated 675 MW of PV capacity across three different auctions. In previous auctions, it allocated 942 MW.

“It might already happen in late December 2023,” polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter told pv magazine. “I definitely expect it for the first half of 2024.”
The report states that the world could reach 2.95 million MT of polysilicon capacity by the end of this year, with just 200,000 MT of this capacity located outside China.
The company said that China-based Tongwei is set to add another 575,000 MT of polysilicon capacity in 2024, surpassing the global polysilicon demand increase of just 200,000 MT. This significant overcapacity is expected to result in the abandonment of numerous projects announced in the last two years and the elimination of up to 2,400,000 MT of capacity.
“This number also includes capacities still under construction,” said Bernreuter.
This new industry shakeout will mostly affect China-based producers, European companies, and new entrants.
“While China’s share in the global polysilicon output will further increase to 90% in 2023, the non-Chinese manufacturers Wacker, OCI, Hemlock Semiconductor and REC Silicon will remain exempt from the shakeout,” the report says. “The reason for that is the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in the United States, which bans products from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwestern China.”
Bernreuter said he also expects global PV demand to grow from 425 GW in 2023 to 1.1 TW in 2027. He claimed that this could lead to a shortage of silicon metal, a raw material in polysilicon production.
“Quartz for silicon metal will run short in the second half of this decade,” he said.

“In-depth research is missing in terms of the impact of smart control on the dynamic performance efficiency of the heat pump,” the researchers said. “Extensive work needs to be done to analyze the effect of PV and battery units on the energy consumed by the heat pump by redefining the system boundaries of the PV-HP systems.”
Their analysis is based on a year of data from a single-family home in Freiburg, Germany. It uses a ground-source heat pump with a nominal capacity of 13.9 kW. The PV unit has a module area of 60 square meters and a nominal power rating of 12.3 kW. The battery has a capacity of 11.7 kWh. The system had to account for heating a living space of 256 square meters, as well as a domestic hot water (DHW) tank.
The heat pump of the setup has an SG-Ready label, which means it can communicate with the grid and adjust its own operations. In the context of this research, however, it was used to maximize the PV self-consumption by adjusting the heat pump operation based on available PV electricity.
“In the analyzed system, the SG-Ready is configured to trigger the heat pump in boosted operation, whereby the space heating and DHW supply temperatures are increased,” the group explained. “The SG-Ready mode is activated when the battery is fully charged or is charging at its maximum power, and there is still a PV surplus available.”
When the instantaneous PV power stays below the total building demand for at least 10 minutes, the trigger-off condition is met, leading the heat pump to return to normal operation as defined by the system parameters, said the researchers. The thermal and electrical data of the systems used in the research was collected throughout the entirety of 2022 and analyzed at a one-minute resolution.
The researchers said the combined system achieved a self-consumption rate of 43% per year. During the winter, with reduced PV generation, the rate reached 94% to 100%. In the high-PV summer months, self-consumption dropped below 50%, reaching its lowest point in July at 25%.
The scientists also looked into solar fraction (SF), which refers to the ratio of PV electricity supplied directly to the heat pump load, or through battery discharge, to the total heat pump electricity consumption.
“During the evaluation period, the heat pump consumed a total of 5,064 kWh of which a major 63.8% was contributed by grid supply,” they said. “The PV array supplied 899 kWh (17.8%), and the battery unit supplied 934 kWh (18.4%), resulting in an annual solar fraction of 0.36.”
The researchers calculated the seasonal performance factor (SPF) for the combined system, yielding a rate of 6.7, a 59.5% improvement compared to a system solely reliant on the grid to feed the heat pump. Additionally, the smart grid-ready system increased supply temperatures for domestic hot water by 4.1 K and space heating by 1.8 K. However, only 5% of thermal energy in space heating mode and 28% in domestic hot water mode were provided at elevated temperatures.
“The temperature increase reduces the efficiency of 3.5 by 0.2 points and thus by 5.7%,” they said. “In space heating mode, the efficiency is reduced from 5.0 to 4.8 and thus by only 4.0%.”
They presented their findings in “Analysis of the Performance and Operation of a Photovoltaic-Battery Heat Pump System Based on Field Measurement Data,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Advances. The team included scientists from the Offenburg University of Applied Sciences.

Switched capacitors are discrete-time circuits that exploit the charge transfer in and out of a capacitor as controlled by switches. They offer the advantage of being easily implemented on an integrated circuit and being able to move a charge proportional to the voltage difference. A resistor, by contrast, achieves the same result only in a continuous manner.
Called 7L-SC-MLI, the proposed inverter concept has a 7-level structure and relies on nine switches, two diodes, and three capacitors. “All the switches have an anti-parallel diode across them to allow the load current to path in forward and reverse,” the scientists explained. “The self-balancing of the capacitors is achieved by the parallel charging and series discharging concept.”
The device performance was tested under a series of simulations to assess voltage stress and boosted output. “Input source voltage is considered fixed as 100 V and MOSFET switches with anti-parallel diodes are selected in MATLAB/Simulink,” the researchers noted, adding that the PV grid-tied mode simulation analysis was carried out under a closed loop control.
In the simulations, the inverter is operated at a 5 kHz switching frequency and a 50 Hz grid frequency. The PV system is assumed to have a capacity of 129 W, a maximum voltage of 17.38 V, and a maximum current of 7.43 A. “The maximum dc-link voltage is maintained at 100 V similar to the open loop study,” the academics said. “The grid voltage of 250 V is considered, which is interfaced with the proposed circuit through an LC filter 80 mH and 330 µF.”
After concluding the simulations, the researchers built a 500 W inverter prototype based on the proposed architecture. They tested the device under different loads, making changes in modulation index, and changes in frequency of operation, and they found that the inverter achieves a high efficiency, despite switching, conduction, and capacitor voltage ripple losses. “The proposed topology operates satisfactorily under any adverse condition,” they stated.
The new inverter technology is presented in the paper “Single-phase switched-capacitor boost multilevel inverter interfacing solar photovoltaic system,” which was recently published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. The research group includes scientists from the C.V. Raman Global University and the R.V. College of Engineering.

Sparc Hydrogen, a joint venture involving Sparc Technologies, Fortescue, and the University of Adelaide, has successfully demonstrated its prototype photocatalytic water-splitting reactor at a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) facility in Newcastle, Australia. The venture aims to advance next-generation green hydrogen technology.
An alternative to making green hydrogen via electrolysis, photocatalytic water splitting instead relies directly on sunlight, water and a photocatalyst. Sparc Hydrogen is developing a photocatalytic reactor, patent pending, which seeks to efficiently take hydrogen from water molecules using concentrated solar.
The CSIRO has been operating a concentrated solar thermal plant known as the CSIRO Energy Centre in Newcastle, New South Wales, where Sparc Hydrogen recently completed its initial testing.
“The data and learnings from the repeated on-sun trials are invaluable and will improve reactor design as we continue to scale the technology towards a pilot plant,” said Sparc Technologies Executive Chair Stephen Hunt.
The company said it has been working with an unnamed external consultant to complete a pilot plant  study. It said that study will completed before the year is out and is based on a site location “proximal to Adelaide.”
It will incorporate a concept flowsheet design, equipment selection, costs, risks and opportunities for a pilot plant which will enable continuous on-sun testing of the technology, the company said, noting the plant’s commissioning would be the next stage in its technology’s readiness.
“The study will provide valuable information for grant applications and will form the basis for detailed design and engineering in 2024,” Sparc Hydrogen said.
Sparc Hydrogen believes photocatalytic water splitting can deliver cost and flexibility advantages over electrolysis because of its lowered infrastructure and electricity requirements. The company has been awarded almost $500,000 (USD 315,000) by the Australian government to support the development of its photocatalytic technology
Sparc Technologies, the majority stakeholder in Sparc Hydrogen, collaborates with Queensland University of Technology (QUT) on sodium-ion battery technology and works on a graphene-based additive to combat steel corrosion.
Earlier this year, Sparc and QUT said their multiple trials had produced anodes averaging about 45% higher reversible capacities compared to commercial hard carbon anode materials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/28/reverse-bias-resilience-stable/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA,UNITED STATES",VALERIE THOMPSON,"NOVEMBER 28, 2023",Perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells provide extra protection against reverse-bias degradation,"Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia have tested the reverse-bias stability of monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem cells, comparing their performance to single junction metal halide perovskite solar cells, and have found that the tandem device is “protected by the silicon subcell under reverse bias.”
In the paper “Reverse-bias resilience of monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells,” which was recently published in Joule., the scientists noted that the silicon subcell delivers a reverse-bias resilience in both long-term reverse voltage biasing tests at the single-cell level and partial shading tests at the module level.
“We knew that the silicon solar cell’s diode would be a substantially larger resistor in reverse bias compared to that of the perovskite solar cell. That means that the tandem should inherit the great stability of the silicon solar cell, rather than the poor reverse bias stability of the perovskite solar cell on its own,” the research's co-corresponding author, Barry P. Brand, told pv magazine.
He also explained that, normally, efforts to improve some aspect of a device, such as reverse bias stability, will then compromise some other aspect of its operation, for example, efficiency. “In this case, that is not so,” he stated. “The silicon-perovskite tandem cell is as efficient as things get, and also leads to better reverse bias stability. That’s one thing that is really noteworthy here.”
The researchers expect the results to be meaningful for the commercial prospects of silicon-perovskite solar cells, contributing to the advantages over other choices. “They are not only more efficient, but they do not suffer the reverse bias stability issue of a typical perovskite single junction solar cell. These factor in acutely to the commercial prospects of any solar technology,” said Brand.
The team conducted a number of stress tests to compare the reverse-bias stability of three encapsulated cell technologies. Specifically, a perovskite single-junction cell, made with a triple cation perovskite solution spin-coated on glass, a silicon heterojunction single-junction heterojunction cell fabricated on a Topsil float zone wafer, and a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell made with the same conditions and deposition techniques as the single junction test cells, except for the necessary tandem-enabling layers.
The cells were encapsulated in thermoplastic polyurethane with edge sealing between glass sheets. To mimic the reverse bias condition in a practical scenario, the cells were connected in strings. The partial shading test included an initial 5-min maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with all three cells exposed to 1-sun illumination, followed by fully shading one of the cells and continuing MPPT for 30 m, followed by an additional 10-minute MPPT with all three cells being exposed to 1-sun illumination. The team then measured the power output across the entire module, and the voltage drop across the shaded cells before, during, and after shading.
“The favorable voltage distribution rather than an overall improved breakdown voltage plays the most important role in the reverse-bias protection effect,” the researchers noted.
In concluding remarks, they said that the advantages of the tandem cell include higher efficiency, a well-developed manufacturing process, as well as being able to withstand reverse-bias stress for stability under partial shading conditions. As for the reverse-bias resilience of perovskite single junction cells, they noted that improvements will be needed for further research into areas such as processing technology and effective ion-blocking barrier layers.

The EIA's November “Short-Term Energy Outlook” projects that solar will surpass hydroelectric power by 14% in 2024, due to the ongoing growth of utility-scale arrays and small-scale solar plants.
According to the American Clean Power’s (ACP) quarterly market report, the domestic utility-scale clean energy industry installed 5.55 GW of renewables in the third quarter. Solar installations ranked first at 3.1 GW, followed by battery storage at 2.1 GW and land-based wind at 288 MW.
The US Department of Energy, meanwhile, said in a recent report that hydropower datasets depicting capacity additions, investment in refurbishment and upgrades, turbine runner installations, and hydraulic turbine trade rates show lower activity throughout the early 2020s. This is compared to the 2010s, where hydropower capacity increased by 2.1 GW over the decade.
The DOE partially attributes hydropower upgrade and build-out decline to Covid-19 trade and travel restrictions. The new regulations caused supply chain challenges that resulted in construction delays and higher material costs. “In the case of US imports of hydraulic turbines and turbine parts, the decrease in activity started in 2019 and was likely influenced by US import tariffs.”
The Inflation Reduction Act offers a $5.50 MW/hour and $22 MW/hour tax credit for applicable hydropower and marine energy projects. However, the DOE also attributes the decline of hydropower activity during 2021 and 2022 to the legislation.
“Plant owners were waiting for full guidance on implementing these incentives (which types of projects would qualify, details on wage, apprenticeship, and domestic content requirements) to make new capital investment decisions,” said the report.
