However, the Mozambican government have a vision for the country, based on clean electrification for all.
The southern African nation possesses serious solar wealth, with 23 TW of its 23,026 GW estimated renewable potential attributed to solar. Despite economic challenges and high inflation, coupled with the shocks of Covid-19 and the Russian war in Ukraine rippling across the world, Mozambique continues to show an increasing appetite for renewables, both on and off the grid.
Shining energy landscape
Over the past two decades, Mozambique has seen steady economic growth, combined with a suite of actions aimed at strengthening the energy sector. The introduction of the Electricity Law in 1997 opened the way to greater participation of the private sector, including the facilitation of  Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
More recent reforms, including an update of the Electricity Law in 2022 that specifically addresses renewable energy and new off-grid regulations, have led to an even more investor-friendly landscape. The Power Infrastructures Master Plan 2018-2043 expects that 50% of energy generation in 2043 will come from renewable energy sources. Under this new plan, 125 MW of solar is in development, of which 60 MW has already been built. These projects have until now all taken the form of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model with direct negotiations. A number of plants have begun construction in 2022 and 2023, soon to be followed by at least three others, for which the PPAs have already been signed.
Another positive step was the establishment of the first Renewable Energy Auctions Programme, PROLER, set up by the Government of Mozambique in 2020 and funded by the European Union. This programme provides a clear statement from the Government of Mozambique, ensuring that renewable energy projects follow competitive and transparent procurement processes. The first tender under the programme was the Dondo solar power plant which was won by Independent Power Producer (IPP), Total Eren (now acquired by Total Energies), with a tariff of $52.45/MWh, and is supported by Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) and the French Development Agency (AFD). The project involves the design, financing, construction and operation of a 40 MWp solar photovoltaic power plant in the Dondo district, about 30 km from the port city of Beira. The plant will generate electricity to feed into the grid of EDM and is due to start construction before the end of 2023.
The PROLER programme is a game changer for promoting private sector investment in renewables in Mozambique. The set up ensures investor confidence through feasibility studies, and the facilitation of optional financial packages and guarantees. A transparent bidding process promotes competition between investors, delivering the lowest possible electricity tariffs to the end consumer. Future tenders are expected to be announced in Q4 of 2023, including the selection of two independent power producers for two 30 MW solar photovoltaic power plants and one 50 MW wind power plant.
But Mozambique has an enormous challenge that spreads far beyond where the national grid ends.
The underdog: off-grid solutions
Of Mozambique’s 32 million inhabitants, 65% are living in rural areas where less than 6% have access to electricity, compared to 34% of the country’s urban population.. By 2030, the Government of Mozambique hope to transform this landscape, and achieve universal energy access by the end of the decade. This would require capacity to more than double to almost 6,500 MW.
Solar is undeniably the most intuitive renewable technology when it comes to off-grid energy solutions. These options are particularly attractive for the Commercial and Industrial (C&I) segment, but also sectors like agriculture, fishing, tourism, and mining. The total estimated addressable market for off-grid solar is currently 173 MW, and is expected to grow in line with the growth of the aforementioned sectors.
Recent energy policy reforms are also changing the game for off-grid renewables in Mozambique. In 2021, the Off-Grid Regulation decree was passed to guide the electrification of the country through off-grid solutions, including mini-grids of up to 10 MW, and energy services (like solar home systems and clean cooking solutions) that will help regulate energy access in off-grid areas for public and private entities.
During the second quarter of 2023, the electricity regulator, ARENE, has gone a step further, publishing mini-grid-specific regulations including attribution of concessions, tariff regulations, interconnection, technical and safety standards and quality of service and commercial relations. This step is perceived by many on the ground to be a key milestone for the development of the energy sector in Mozambique, and particularly for achieving universal energy access in rural and hard-to-reach communities. Ricardo Costa Pereira, President of the Board of Directors at AMER, the Mozambican renewable energy association said of the regulation that “The bulk of Mozambique’s population still lives in rural areas where the expansion of the grid is still quite costly. Providing solutions through off-grid energy access is a pillar to ensure universal access. For the first time, Mozambique has a regulation that can provide guidance and a legal framework that can ‘light the path' to achieving SDG7.”
On the horizon
In theory, the energy landscape has been made more attractive to investors thanks to recent reforms improving energy sector governance. However, with a lack of direct and indirect incentives, private sector investment has been slow to get off the ground, particularly in the off-grid segment. As the new off-grid regulations enter into force this should bring enhanced clarity for investors, helping spur investment in renewables.
A delegation from the Mozambique renewable energy association, AMER, will be present at the Renewable Energy Forum Africa taking place in Nairobi in October. These events are an essential element for informing key players about market potential and spurring investment in the region, and having a presence here shows Mozambique’s commitment to going big on renewables.

Germany added approximately 1,200 MW of new PV capacity in July, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur).
The month's new capacity additions compare to 1,160 MW of solar in June and 535 MW of solar in July 2022.
The newly installed PV power for the first seven months of this year reached 7.69 GW, which is close to the 9 GW target set by the German government for this year. However, in order to reach the 2030 target of 215 GW, more than 1,571 MW will need to be installed per month.
The country's cumulative installed solar capacity surpassed 75.17 GW at the end of July.

“Production is currently being carried out at a small facility in the laboratory. The location of a full-scale production facility is under consideration. We expect JPY10 billion ($68 million), or more, for the investment,” a spokesperson from Sekisui Chemical told pv magazine.
In a recent statement regarding its participation in the upcoming World Exposition in Japan, Sekisui Chemical said that its thin film technology is currently made in a 30-centimeter-wide roll-to-roll process, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of 15.0%. The technology also features a proprietary “sealing, film formation, materials and process technology,” and is reportedly able to have a durability of 10 years.

To meet its 2025 goal, Sekisui Chemical has announced a number of projects to test the technology and validate applications. For example, it announced a multi-year project to test installation on buildings located in busy metropolitan areas owned by NTT Data, a large digital consulting and IT service company. As a first step, Sekisui Chemical is carrying out tests at its own Research & Development Institute site in Osaka to identify potential issues with installation methods and structural safety, including wind loads.
Yet, another test installation will be completed at a sewage water-treatment plant of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Earlier announcements noted that JERA, Japan’s largest power company, will complete outdoor tests at several power stations, and a collaboration with West Japan Railway Company, which operates railways in Osaka, Kyoto, and western Japan.
The company expects the roll-to-roll process development to accelerate with its participation in a research collaboration supported by the Green Innovation Fund, an initiative of Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

In the study “High-efficiency bio-inspired hybrid multi-generation photovoltaic leaf,” published in nature communications, the research team described the system as a hybrid multi-generation PV-leaf based on a biomimetic transpiration structure made of bamboo fibers and stacked hydrogel cells.
The 1 mm thick biomimetic transpiration (BT) layer moves water passively from a separate water tank onto a 10 cm × 10 cm solar cell placed on top of the structure. The water flowing onto the cell is able to reduce its operating temperature, thus increasing its efficiency, and excess heat is used to produce water and thermal energy. The PV leaf is protected only by a 0.7-mm thick high-transmittance glass layer.
The structure utilizes vascular hydrophilic fiber bundles that uniformly distribute water through the PV-leaf. Hydrogel cells are used to mimic the vascular bundles and sponge cells. “In the BT layer, around 30 branches of bamboo fiber bundles are homogeneously embedded into the potassium polyacrylate (PAAK) superabsorbent polymer (SAP) hydrogel cells, distributing water over the entire area covered by the BT layer,” the scientists explained, adding that the edges of the fiber branches are gathered together and soaked in water.
The scientists measured the performance of the system under standard illumination conditions and compared it to a reference standalone PV cell cooled by natural air convection. They found that the PV-leaf reached a temperature of 43.2 C, while that of the reference cell reached 68.8 C. “The temperature of the non-insulated water tank is close to the ambient temperature and has a slight influence on the cooling performance,” they stated.
The PV-leaf achieved a power conversion efficiency of 15.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.63 V, and a fill factor of 0.77. The reference cell, by contrast, achieved an efficiency of 13.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.58 V, and a fill factor of 0.75.
The academics also said the capital cost of the additional components required by the PV-leaf, is approximately 1.1 $/m2, which represents around 2% of the cost of conventional solar panels. The payback time of the additional components is estimated at less than half a year. “The PV-leaf concept can be upscaled to larger-scale collectors, beyond which even larger solar plants of a commercial size can be divided into several small areas allocated to separate, interconnected PV-leaves,” they added referring to their possible applications in real projects.
“Compared to previous studies on transpiration cooling, the solution in this work does not require pump, control unit, expensive porous materials, and is able to cool the target surface to a significantly lower temperature, which is suitable for multi-generation applications, as well as applications of thermal management for PV cells,” the UK group said, noting that the system may also use seawater instead of freshwater. “Simulation results show that PV-leaf has better transpiration performance in hot and dry climates.”
The academics also claim that the device may be able to generate an additional 1.1 L/h/m2 of freshwater under a solar irradiance of 1000 W/m. They also believe that the system may also use seawater instead of freshwater. “Simulation results show that PV-leaf has better transpiration performance in hot and dry climates,” they emphasized.

The scientists said the novelty of their work consisted of utilizing a novel simulation-based methodology to study the behavior of the new system in a renovated dwelling with an air-source heat pump and no gas supply.
“The proposed methodology integrates building performance simulation and a data-driven surrogate model, enabling the optimization of system design based on specific building requirements and characteristics,” they explained. “The reduction of imported electricity is a proper indicator for assessing the value that the system can bring to the homeowner.”
The heat battery (HB) consists of a storage module based on potassium carbonate (K2CO3), which is one of the most promising thermochemical storage materials for built environment applications, and an electricity-driven mechanical system that maintains continuous charging or discharging powers.
In the charging mode, the heat battery receives the inlet temperature and mass flow rate of the charging fluid in the heat exchangers. At the same time, it adjusts the powers of the fan, the pump, and other components. In the discharging mode, the battery uses a similar set of input and output variables by calculating the outlet temperature of the corresponding fluid, the actual charging power, and the electric power.
“After the charging or discharging process completes, these components will be turned off to switch the heat battery into standby mode when its heat loss is negligible,” the scientists said.
They assumed the heat battery to have a storage volume of 320 L or 93 kWh and the solar collectors to have a total surface of 8 m2. They also assumed the heat pump to have a nominal heating capacity of 12 kW and a rated coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0. The house is located in Eindhoven and has an annual electricity consumption of 9 MWh.
Through the simulation, the group found that the novel battery is capable of “digesting” the thermal energy coming from the solar thermal collectors and reducing the dwelling's annual electricity consumption for heating by between 0.7 MWh to 1.0 MWh. It also found that increasing the storage volume of the battery may lead to reduced thermal comfort and that its optimal size should be between 80 L and 160 L.
“The result also suggests that it is not worthwhile to increase the storage volume for achieving seasonal storage in light of the limited space for both the heat battery and solar collectors in a detached house, especially when compared with the specific benefit of water tanks with the same storage volume,” the academics concluded. “All these results suggest that a small-scale HB could be more practical than a large-scale one in this type of daily-storage use case because of the efficient usage of both the storage capacity and charging/discharging powers.”
The system was presented in the study “A design optimization method for solar-driven thermochemical storage systems based on building performance simulation,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research group also includes scientists from Netherlands-based heat battery company Cellcius B.V.

German solar module maker Heckert Solar, PV product distributor Wattkraft and Europe’s largest solar glass manufacturer Intefloat have unveiled a plan to build a vertically-integrated solar module production across several locations in Germany.
The consortium said it will invest around €2 billion ($2.18 billion) in the manufacturing facilities.
Thanks to this new investment, Heckert Solar's existing manufacturing plant in Langenwetzendorf, Thuringia, will see its capacity increase from 400 MW to 2.8 GW. Furthermore, the consortium will build a 5 GW facility to produce polysilicon and solar cells at a facility owned by Heckert Solar in Frankfurt am Oder, eastern Germany.
Moreover, Interfloat is planning to produce antimony-free, low-iron, textured solar glass for the combined value-added chain at one of its industrial sites in Brandenburg.
The consortium also said the new production facilities will manufacture glass-glass modules with an efficiency of 24% and a carbon footprint below 18 grams/kWh, which it says complies with the highest ESG sustainability standards.
The three companies did not reveal more details about the project.

China has dominated the solar module supply chain for the last 15 years but the status quo is shifting as multiple emerging factors pose a threat to the nation’s dominant position. These include increasing scrutiny of solar supply chain sustainability and traceability along with a growing global subsidy race, with the United States, India, and European Union announcing plans to provide funding support to their own manufacturers.
A suite of policy levers has recently been used by global markets to support the growth of domestic PV manufacturing directly and indirectly, including the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the Basic Customs Duty and Production Linked Incentive scheme in India.
At the policy level, Europe is lagging. The REpowerEU initiative sets ambitious 2030 targets for renewables but does not say much about supporting local manufacturing. The recent Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) proposal aims to spur local manufacturing. While that is a step ahead, it could take up to two years before the European Commission approves the policy. In other words, the European Union has set very ambitious targets for renewables installations in Europe until 2030 but such targets will not automatically increase demand for products manufactured locally.
The United States is ahead in timing and financial support so US incentives have the potential to become a risk for European manufacturing to scale up as the country is already pulling investment resources from major players. That risk increases the longer it takes to get EU policy and incentives firmed up.
To provide some context, the EU is targeting a minimum of 45% self-sufficiency across all manufacturing nodes despite the fact there is currently almost no ingot or wafer capacity to process polysilicon in Europe. It would require the building of more than 40 GW of annual ingot, wafer, and cell capacity – plus another 30 GW of module capacity – to reach these targets. To have any chance to get anywhere near this ambitious target, the European Union would need to introduce a combination of high manufacturing incentives and barriers of entry for lower-cost imports (such as its proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism to punish products with higher carbon footprints) as well as potentially setting quotas for local content in public tenders.
The large production cost gap between regions is the biggest challenge to overcome to spur local module supply chain manufacturing. A recent S&P Global Commodity Insights report revealed production costs in Europe could be as much as 50% higher than in mainland China – mostly thanks to higher EU power prices and labor costs.
The recent low-price module environment could become another unexpected hurdle to the reshoring of European module supply chains. High polysilicon prices have kept module costs elevated in the last two years, closing the gap between best-cost manufacturing locations in mainland China, Southeast Asia, and other regions (including Europe and the US). If the anticipated low module prices return, it will make onshoring module supply chain manufacturing increasingly challenging.
Local manufacturers could be competitive in other dimensions, however. European module production costs are higher compared with other regions but may hold advantages due to a reduced carbon intensity of the end products. This sustainability dimension will be particularly relevant given the current trend to tax imported materials and components with higher carbon footprints. European governments could also set quotas for locally-made, low-carbon content in public tenders – the current NZIA proposal includes a clause related to carbon footprint and equipment origin for public tenders plus a 15% to 20% sustainability and resilience weight-scoring system.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
Another dimension where EU manufacturers can be competitive concerns technology. There are opportunities for EU manufacturers to lead the development of new technology such as perovskites or new wafer technologies with lower cost production methods and higher efficiencies. Partnerships have emerged in several European markets aiming to commercialize next-generation cells and modules based on silicon-perovskite tandem technology. These ongoing research partnerships could promote European technological leadership across emerging cell and wafer technology, enabling a lower levelized cost of energy and reduced supply-chain risk.

Despite all the policy uncertainty, there were around 20 GW of module manufacturing capacity announcements in Europe to May plus a surge of new announcements in the last few weeks. These figures show evidence of new manufacturing activity in markets including Romania, Germany, France, and Italy. Even if all these announcements come online, however, Europe would still be highly dependent on imported cells from mainland China or Southeast Asian countries.
Recent discussions at the Intersolar Europe exhibition confirmed this view. Few among the main industry stakeholders (developers, utilities, investors, supply-chain companies) expect any major reshoring of module supply chain capacity in the next few years. The general industry view is that the European Union will prioritize the achievement of ambitious renewables deployment targets to 2030, ahead of reshoring-manufacturing ambitions that would make the energy transition more expensive.

Climate and renewable energy advocates suggest that the New York State Build Public Renewables Act can help to ensure that New York achieves economy-wide carbon neutrality by the middle of this century. That scheme includes the construction of a green transmission grid, which requires safe and affordable energy storage systems that can power vast residential and commercial electric needs.
In July, Governor Kathy Hochul announced the creation of a new Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group. The organization comprises state emergency environmental and public service institutions that will research energy storage facility fires and safety standards. It will also collaborate with national experts and laboratories to stay current on fire causes appropriate responses and approaches to building green grid infrastructure that can accommodate vast amounts of electricity while decreasing the risk of fires.
The state is also heavily investing in affordable long-duration renewable energy storage solutions. Four demonstration projects have received financial awards in line with this goal.
Climate science specialist Ecolectro secured $1.08 million to scale up its approach to reducing the cost of sustainably produced hydrogen. Clean hydrogen is made through electrolysis, or the separation of water to generate hydrogen and oxygen. The element is excellent for storing vast quantities of green energy over a long period. These reserves can give consumers backup power during peak hours or weather storms. However, current hydrogen production methods are pricey.
According to a 2018 study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, and Innovation the Future Progress and Neutrality (ISE and IPA) using the proton exchange membrane (PEM) approach, generating one standard cubic meter of hydrogen in 60 minutes costs between $4,900 and $6,000. Ecolectro will deploy its 10 kW electrolysis unit in a pilot demonstration in partnership with Liberty Utilities.
Form Energy, a Massachusetts-based grid-scale energy storage developer, has proposed a commercial-scale, low-cost 10 MW iron-air battery demonstration system, which stores energy by converting iron into rust and rust back into iron. It secured $1.2 million from New York state and recently announced plans to set up a manufacturing facility in West Virginia.

In its latest investment update, CEFC committed AUD 1.9 billion in new investments in the 2022-23 financial year, including a record AUD 1.2 billion in renewable energy and grid-related projects.
CEFC Chief Executive Officer Ian Learmonth said the government-funded corporation had worked with investors and project developers to bring forward 14 large-scale solar, wind and storage projects in the 12 months to June 30, 2023, with a total transaction value of AUD 5.7 billion.
“Investment of this scale is critical to our national goal of reaching 82% renewables by 2030,” he said. “We had a strong year last year, but a lot more needs to be done.”
Learmonth estimates that for Australia to achieve its renewables target, about 3.6 GW of large-scale renewable energy needs to be brought online each year.
“It is a big challenge,” he said. “Last year we installed about 2.5 GW of utility-scale wind and solar.”
Learmonth said developers and investors had faced numerous challenges in the past year including inflationary issues, supply chain shortages and grid constraints, noting that the CEFC is using its capital to help “deal with some of these issues and stimulate investment in renewables.”
“This has included responding to market headwinds in capex, interest rates and foreign exchange, with our capital accelerating project delivery and underpinning offtake agreements to aid proponents in navigating challenging market conditions,” he said. “Our finance is also backing larger projects, in terms of capital and generation capacity, a positive signal of investor and developer appetite in the required large-scale investments.”
In the 2022-23 financial year the CEFC committed $1.9 billion to transactions with a total value of AUD 11.7 billion. It also commenced early work on the AUD 19 billion Rewiring the Nation program, which is designed to fast-track upgrades to the national electricity grid to accommodate the influx of renewable energy.
Learmonth said he expects to announce the first Rewiring the Nation investment transactions within the next year.
The $19 billion initiative forms part of an additional $20.5 billion capital allocation approved by the federal government in 2022-23, the first increase since the CEFC was established in 2012.
Since its inception, CEFC has invested AUD 12.7 billion, taking lifetime total transaction value to AUD 48.8 billion. CEFC said its investments in large-scale renewables and transmission-related projects have contributed to transactions with a total value of AUD 18.8 billion. Capital returned to CEFC in 2022-23 was AUD 1.2 billion, taking lifetime repayments and returns to more than $4.5 billion.

A study, led by researchers from the University of Technology in Sydney, suggests that a ‘biosolar’ rooftop system – one that combines a solar system installed on a roof that is partially or completely covered with vegetation – provides significant improvements in panel efficiency and energy production.
“As solar panels heat up beyond 25℃, their efficiency decreases markedly,” the researchers said. “Green roofs moderate rooftop temperatures so we wanted to find out could green roofs help with the problem of heat reducing the output of solar panels.”
The research team, which also included academics from the University of Canberra and Charles Sturt University, compared a conventional rooftop PV system with a combined solar and integrated green roof system over an eight-month period that spanned summer and winter.
The two buildings used in the study are the same height, size, and shape and are located next to each other in Sydney’s central business district. Both rooftops encompass about 1,860 m2, with about one third covered by solar panels. Vegetation covered about 78% of the green roof and the solar panels covered 40% of this planted area.
Both the green and conventional rooftop systems employed four SolarEdge three-phase inverters rated to operate at 98 % efficiency. The green roof comprised 335 SunPower Maxeon 395 W panels, with a total system size of 132.33 kW. The conventional roof used 346 LG 320 W panels with a peak nominal power of 110.72 kW.
“We measured the impacts on biodiversity and solar output, as well as how the plants coped with having panels installed above them,” the researchers said, noting that the green roof had reduced surface temperatures by up to 9.63 C for the solar panels and 6.93 C for the roof surfaces.
The research team said the reduction in temperature had delivered significant improvements in solar panel efficiency which led to increased solar generation and overall energy production.
“This lowering of temperatures increased the maximum output of the solar panels by 21-107%, depending on the month,” they said. “Performance modeling indicates an extensive green roof in central Sydney can, on average, produce 4.5% more electricity at any given light level.”
The researchers said the benefits of combing solar panels with a living roof extended beyond increased energy production with the vegetation on the biosolar roof flourishing in the areas directly below and surrounding the solar panels.
“This was surprising,” they said. “It was not expected the plants would prefer the shaded areas under the panels to the open areas. This shows that shading by solar panels will not prevent the growth of full and healthy roof gardens.”
The green roof also supported more species of birds and insects than the conventional roof, decreased stormwater runoff, and insulated the building from extremes of temperature.
Another research group led by the Netherlands' KWR Water Research Institute recently investigated how a blue-green roof (BGR) may act as a cooling agent for rooftop PV systems and has found that this kind of roof may lower the roof surface temperature by up to 4.64 C compared to a conventional bitumen roof (BiR).

Cambridge Energy said the first Australian deployment of its Nomad system – that combines solar tracking technology in a prefabricated and modular design – has now been completed at Norton Gold Fields’ Binduli mining operation near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia’s Eastern Goldfields region.
“We were thrilled to have hosted site visits last week showcasing our newly completed Norton Binduli 2.3 MW Nomad project,” the company said.
“The success of this deployment was a proud achievement for us, and for the renewable energy landscape, demonstrating the huge potential for ultra-low cost solar here in Australia.”
“We now have firm proof of how the Nomad outperforms other technologies in the region and that prefabricated solar tracking will enable the next big leap.”

Cambridge, which delivered the project for Perth-based energy and mining consultancy ResourcesWA and investment firm CrossBoundary, said its Nomad system is the only PV solution in the world that combines prefabrication with solar tracking, setting “a new standard in delivering efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable solar.”
“The technology revolutionizes solar energy by offering the benefits of solar tracking in a unique, prefabricated design,” the company said. “It maximizes energy yield, making solar projects more feasible, cost-effective, and socially responsible.”
Cambridge which was founded by Australian Tom Miller, said the Nomad system features bifacial panels mounted on a single-axis tracking system which allows for maximum energy output, claiming the Nomad generates 45-50% greater yield than other prefabricated solutions.
The system also features an innovative anchoring solution that eliminates the need for piles and concrete. The tracker is anchored to the ground using percussion-driven earth anchors that utilize the soil as a counterweight and are connected to the structure through cables.
“This anchoring method eliminates the need for extensive groundworks, steel piles or concrete, and ensures minimal disruption to the soil during installation and decommissioning,” Cambridge said.

The system has been designed to be stored in a shipping container, and Cambridge said it can be removed and reinstalled as and when required with the modular design reducing inefficiencies in transport and installation, while making for faster deployment than conventional solar, resulting in lower deployment costs.
Trent Colyer, managing director of Perth-based OSOS Global Services which provided the installation team behind the 2.3 MW Binduli project, said the install had gone much quicker than expected.
“We had never installed one of these Cambridge models before, and no one in Australia has either. But they’ve made it very, very simple for us to do it,” he said.
Colyer said the small installation crew had deployed 1 MW per week using regular construction machinery.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently awarded up to $11.8 million in funding to a consortium or organizations, including utility Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), which is looking to build California’s first full-scale direct air capture and storage network of hubs.
This funding will be used to study a regional carbon management hub in California’s Kern County, following which the consortium plans to build similar facilities in other parts of the state. The group includes nearly 40 organizations, including representatives from industry, government, technology, and labor and workforce development.
 
The hub could be able to remove more than 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, or the equivalent of eliminating 220,000 gasoline vehicles on the road annually. In addition to bringing California closer to its climate goals, each hub could also provide high-paying and permanent jobs and workforce development programs, according to Carbon TerraVault Holdings, a subsidiary of the California Resources Corporation, which assembled the consortium.
The timeline for getting the hub operational will depend on the timing of further DOE funding for the development and construction stages, Richard Venn, a spokesperson for the California Resources Corporation, told pv magazine USA.
The direct air capture industry is in an early stage and provides a tremendous opportunity for many states and regions to invest in a new clean technology industry that will remove carbon dioxide from the air and deliver significant co-benefits to local communities, Venn added.
“According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), carbon removal methods such as DAC are key to mitigation pathways aimed at keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius,” said Venn.
Direct air capture technology involves separating carbon dioxide from the air, and either storing it underground permanently or using it in products that contain carbon, like concrete. At least 27 direct air capture plants have been commissioned worldwide, and plans for another 130 facilities are at various stages of development, according to the International Energy Agency.
The California funding is part of a larger DOE effort to invest in engineered carbon removal. Last week the agency announced up to $1.2 billion in funding to develop two commercial-scale direct air capture facilities in Texas and Louisiana, which are collectively expected to remove more than 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere every year.
The DOE’s investment lays the foundation for a direct air capture industry that will be crucial to tackling climate change, according to Jennifer Granholm, U.S. Secretary of Energy.
“Cutting back on our carbon emissions alone won’t reverse the growing impacts of climate change; we also need to remove the CO2 that we’ve already put in the atmosphere…” said Granholm.
The DOE also selected 19 additional projects – including the California hub – to support the earlier stages of project development, such as feasibility assessments.
“Our research has shown that carbon management, when combined with electrification and clean fuels, delivers the most affordable, resilient and technologically proven path to full carbon neutrality,” said Maryam Brown, president of SoCalGas. The utility’s role in the project includes a front-end engineering design study on transporting the captured carbon to permanent storage.
The DOE funding will be used in 2024 to conduct studies on the planned facilities in Kern County, Carbon TerraVault said. The consortium could begin developing and constructing the facility in 2025, and plans to put out additional funding requests next year as well.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/21/solaredge-adds-power-control-system-to-inverter-for-system-oversizing/,"INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ISRAEL",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 21, 2023",SolarEdge adds power control system to inverter for system oversizing,"SolarEdge, a provider of inverters for residential and commercial solar projects, announced it has released updates to its Home Hub and Wave inverters in the U.S., adding a new power control system (PCS).
The new PCS integrated with the inverters enables solar array oversizing by 50% larger or more without triggering the need for an upgrade to the home’s main panel. Main panel upgrades are often a late costly addition to a solar project that can be a barrier to adoption for the customer.
SolarEdge inverters can now monitor, balance and control the currents on the main panel busbar, enabling larger installations than the National Electrical Code’s 120% rule. A typical home with a 200 Amp main panel can now attach up to three 11.4 kW SolarEdge inverters without triggering a main panel upgrade.
The DC-coupled design also enables up to 200% DC oversizing and storage of excess solar production in its SolarEdge Home battery.
“Customers are seeking to install larger PV systems on their rooftops and financial considerations play a crucial role in their decision making,” said Zvi Lando, chief executive officer, SolarEdge. “With the new SolarEdge inverters, installers will be able to offer their customers bigger PV systems while avoiding main panel upgrades, significantly improving the economics of PV and battery storage across the U.S.”
The PCS will be embedded in SolarEdge’s Hub and Wave inverters, requiring only a current transformer to be installed on the main panel, with no external connector boxes required for installation.
Higher interest rates and lowered compensation rates for net-metered electricity have squeezed the return on investment offered to residential solar customers. Updates like this new PCS are designed to keep upfront costs low and navigate a shifting environment for rooftop solar. SolarEdge’s main competitor, Enphase, has made adjustments to its microinverter product offerings to adapt to these headwinds as well.
“While the U.S. residential solar market is currently seeing some headwinds primarily related to higher interest rates, we are navigating through this period by leveraging our geographic and multi-segment strengths in the solar markets and expect to benefit from the positive long-term outlook for this sector.”

The company said it also upgraded its inverters with software improvements for faster commissioning and automotive-grade critical components for improved reliability.
In its Q2 2023 earnings call the company reported record revenues of $991.3 million, up 5% from $943.9 million in the prior quarter and up 36% from $727.8 million in the same quarter last year. SolarEdge beat Wall Street’s consensus estimate by 0.21%, an estimate it has now consistently beaten in the last four quarters.
Revenues from the solar segment were a record $947.4 million, up 4% from $908.5 million in the prior quarter and up 38% from $687.6 million in the same quarter last year.
