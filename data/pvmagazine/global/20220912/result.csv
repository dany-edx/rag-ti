The project is currently the world's second-largest PV plant under construction, following a 3.3 GW solar facility that state-owned China Huadian is currently building in Changdu, Sichuan province.
The new facility in the Tengger Desert will be located in Yingshuiqiao, Shapotou district. It will require an investment of around CNY 15.25 billion ($2.2 billion). The project's first phase will have a capacity of 1 GW and the related investment will amount to CNY 5.11 billion.
The plant will be connected to the ultra-high voltage power line Ningxia-Hunan ±800 kV UHV DC. The CNY 100 billion line should be operational next year, and will stretch from Ningxia Hui to Hunan province. It will pass through Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Hubei and Hunan provinces.
The government of Hunan said that the solar park is expected to produce 5.78 billion kWh per year upon full completion. It said it is expected to generate an operating income of CNY 1.5 billion yuan, without providing further details.
The world's largest operational PV plant is currently a 2.2 GW facility that Chinese state-owned utility Huanghe Hydropower Development put into operation in October 2020. This project is also expected to be connected to an ultra-high voltage power line that State Grid Corp is building in China. The CNY 22.6 billion power line project includes the construction of two converter stations with 8 GW of transmission capacity. The line will extend 1,587 kilometers across Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi and Henan provinces.

“We have used these types of materials in pilot production of transparent solar modules at Ubiquitous Energy,” researcher Annick Anctil told pv magazine. “We have recently installed these transparent solar modules on campus.”
The scientists proposed two different materials for two different kinds of solar glass. One is based on phthalocyanine (ClAlPc), a class of colorant that is commonly used for automotive paints, printing ink, and paper. The other one is developed with heptamethine (CyTPFB), which is a near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) compound that has recently emerged as a promising agent for drug delivery. According to the researchers, the materials offer higher transmittance of visible light than conventional semi-transparent building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules and selective absorption of near-infrared radiation (NIR).
The ClAlPc and CyTPFB are used as top layers of the TOPV device, which consists of deposited layers of indium tin oxide (ITO) and molybdenum oxide (MoO3), and bathocuproine (BCP).
“ITO is deposited by sputtering, and all other layers are deposited by vacuum deposition except the CyTPFB active layer, which is deposited using a solution process,” the researchers stated.
They simulated the use of the proposed materials in the windows of five commercial buildings in four different climates in the United States – Detroit, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Honolulu.
“The TOPVs are assumed to be deposited inside the glass windows of the commercial buildings. The maximum window size is 2.1 meters by 3.7 meters, with silver grid covering 11 % of the window area,” the scientists explained. “The power conversion efficiency practical limit for ClAlPc TOPV is 10 %, and 11 % for CyTPFB TOPV.”
The researchers said that both versions of the solar glass have expected lifecycles of 20 years. The efficiency at the end of that period should be around 60% of the original efficiency, the claimed. They also found that the CyTPFB TOPVs have a 26.1% higher lifecycle impact than ClAlPc TOPVs, due to the higher energy demand of the synthesis and solution deposition processes.
“For most buildings, CyTPFB TOPVs have higher energy benefits because of a higher power conversion efficiency, but for hospitals, ClAlPc TOPVs perform better because of their spectral properties,” the scientists explained.
The group presented the TOPV technology in “Net energy and cost benefit of phthalocyanine and heptamethine transparent photovoltaics in commercial buildings,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments.
“Future TOPV designs can be optimized and tailored to the building for both electricity generation and building energy savings by changing either the active layer or using low emissivity materials for the electrodes,” they concluded.

The government said that it will increase the total power capacity allocation from 3.6 GW to 4.2 GW. However, the quota for solar will remain unchanged at 1 GW, while the wind quota will be raised from 2.6 GW to 3.2 GW. The new deadline to submit project proposals is Oct. 3.
“Further announcement regarding the remaining 1,000 MW of solar PV will be made following the conclusion of the NERSA process regarding the concurrence of new determination,” the government said.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa asked to double the size of the round in late July, in order to help the country to cope with frequent blackouts.
“The amount of new generation capacity procured through bid window six for wind and solar power will be doubled from 2,600 MW to 5,200 MW,” Ramaphosa said at the time.
The procurement exercise is part of a plan to tender almost 12 GW of capacity and follows the recent publication of South Africa’s new Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The IRP aims for up to 6 GW of new large-scale solar by 2030, as well as up to 6 GW of distributed-generation PV capacity.

The acquisition price will be paid upon achievement of specific development milestones, Ignitis said in a statement. It noted that the project is still in the early stages of development, with the start of construction scheduled to start between 2025 and 2026, with completion set for no later than 2028.
Ignitis currently operates a 4 MW solar park in Obeniai, Lithuania. The total capacity will be increased to 7.4 MW this year, a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Earlier this year, the company said that it is developing the first hybrid wind-solar project in Lithuania. It will build a 22 MW solar park next to a 10 MW wind farm which has been in operation for more than 10 years.
In July, Ignitis also secured a grid connection for a 252 MW solar park in Jonava district, Lithuania. Preliminary investments are estimated to reach up to €200 million.
In 2021, the company announced it had acquired 100% stakes in several Polish companies, with solar projects totaling 80 MW. The commercial operation dates of those installations are expected around this year and next. The revenue of the projects under development will be based on a contract for difference awarded in a Polish renewables auction, or under long-term power purchase agreements.
“We consider further expanding our projects in the Baltics as well as in Poland,” said an Ignitis spokesperson.

Perovksites also bring the potential for higher efficiency flexible solar cells, which could open many new applications for solar energy.
The roll-to-roll process, which involves a roll of plastic or other flexible material, is a potential low-cost approach to manufacturing for flexible perovskites. However, adding the electrode layer in a process compatible with the roll-to-roll setup has proven to be a particular challenge.
This was the focus of scientists at Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, who sought to develop a process that could see the electrode layer deposited without the need for solvents or heat treatments that potentially damage the perovskite layer as well.
“Replacement of the thermally evaporated metal electrode is a major challenge to be overcome and is a key to realizing flexible fully printed PSCs,” the group said. “This is particularly important because the metal electrode used almost exclusively in the record-breaking PSCs is vacuum evaporated gold, which accounts for about 70% of the cost of a PSC module.”
The group developed a process in which an electrode made from carbon and silver is first fabricated on a detachable plastic (PET) substrate, and then pressed onto the top of the perovskite solar cell. The PET layer is then removed and can be reused. The scientists described the process and the resulting solar cell in “Vacuum-Free and Solvent-Free Deposition of Electrodes for Roll-to-Roll Fabricated Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
Since the step of pre-treating the electrode layer before it is applied to the cell eliminates solvents in the pastes used, the process can be called “solvent free,” and scientists may be able to work with printing pastes not otherwise suitable for perovskite materials. The rest of the cell was assembled using more established roll-to-roll techniques, and then put through a series of tests.
The best of the cells fabricated achieved an efficiency of 16.7%, which the group claims as a record for such a device. In further testing, the cells were encapsulated with another flexible plastic material, saw no significant performance loss after 24 hours under constant one-sun illumination in ambient, indoor atmosphere. The flexible cells, this time without the encapsulant, were also subject to a series of bending tests, retaining better than 90% of its initial performance after 3,000 convex bends, and falling just below 80% after 3,000 concave bends.

Solar energy is central to models of environmental sustainability, but not all projects are built the same. One concern in energy development, renewable or otherwise, is the concept of “energy sprawl,” which is the dedication of land for energy production and distribution.
Environment California estimates rooftop solar could prevent the development of 148,000 acres of land versus a ground mounted utility-scale only model. This is based on a state regulator estimated deployment of 28.5 GW of rooftop solar through 2045 in order to meet clean energy goals. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles that could be preserved.
Solar is hailed for its ability to be integrated into the built environment, placed on rooftops, integrated into building facades, on carports, etc. However, in order to meet aggressive decarbonization goals and achieve a 100% renewable energy system, ground-mounted solar will be also needed. This is where agrivoltaics, the practice of co-locating solar energy production with agricultural functions, can step in.
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
The paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of US electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current US farmland. At a global scale, it is estimated that 1% of all farmland could produce the world’s energy needs if converted to solar PV.
Biosphere 2
Agrivoltaics does more than preserve land and make the most of an acre. There are synergies between the solar arrays and the agricultural activities below.
For example, a team of researchers with the University of Arizona, which operate an agrivoltaic test center at the Biosphere 2, a fully self-contained indoor “natural” environment, found that crops improve solar array performance, and the solar arrays improve crop yield in dry environments.
The Biosphere team found that the shade provided by the photovoltaic system reduced evaporation, meaning that water would stay on the surface longer and better feed crops than open-air land-based agriculture. Not only does this save water, but it makes the plants grow stronger, leading to a better crop yield. Additionally, the shaded space provided by the panels causes plants to spread out, searching for sunlight. In the trials, the agrivoltaic-shaded leaf was nearly twice the size of the open-air one.
In dry climates like the one that surrounds Biosphere 2, there can often be too much light and heat for plants to grow properly. The panel’s shade helps create better conditions for the plants. The same goes for solar panels, which produce less power at high temperatures. A conventional solar facility may remove all vegetation below, which, in large solar arrays, causes a studied effect of a heat island.
Excess sun energy that isn’t converted to electricity can leave the area in two ways: either as latent heat or sensible heat. Sensible heat is the type that we can feel, and the type that is damaging to solar PV production. Latent heat is the energy that is absorbed by nearby water, evaporating into vapor. By adding crops below in a dry climate, you are adding more latent heat absorption, taking heat pressure off the panels, and boosting production and lifecycle.
Dry-climate farmers may enjoy working with agrivoltaics, too. Preliminary data from the center suggests skin temperatures are about 20 degrees Fahrenheit lower than open-air farming.
InSPIRE project
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is exploring many possibilities for agrivoltiacs, including placing cattle or sheep, crops, pollinator-friendly native plants, or soil rehabilitation and other ecosystem services in the same plot of land as active solar arrays.
NREL’s main research project on agrivoltaics is called Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE). The InSPIRE project developed a financial calculator to quantify the benefits of the practice. It also developed a list of best practices for those interested in entering the field. Additionally, InSPIRE tracks all the active agrivoltaics site across the U.S., which can be found here.
“Through our work, which spans multiple regions, configurations, and agricultural activities, we’ve seen so many initial promising results,” said Jordan Macknick, NREL’s lead energy-water-land analyst and principal investigator for the InSPIRE project. “Now, our challenge is to figure out how to scale up and replicate these successes.”
NREL also developed a set of five basic principles for success in agrivoltaics, called the five C’s:
InSPIRE represents the largest, longest-running, and most comprehensive agrivoltaics research effort in the world, spanning 28 sites in 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Some of these sites involve direct research, some involve research design and consideration, and some involve ongoing consultation and mentoring of partners.
“One thing InSPIRE has done really well is to create a community of people who are thinking differently about PV solar design and management. Universally, following an InSPIRE conference call hearing scientists and industry practitioners share their results, there’s tremendous energy and optimism for the challenge and opportunity ahead of us,” said Rob Davis of Connexus Energy, the Midwest’s largest electric co-op.

The state-run agency said that PV projects with a combined capacity of 26.2 MW were selected in the procurement exercise. It was Japan's thirteenth auction scheme for utility-scale solar. It was supposed to assign 225 MW of generating capacity. It was also the second such exercise to award either fixed feed-in tariffs or feed-in premium tariffs.
For the feed-in premiums, which will be granted to projects above 1 MW, the assigned capacity was 14.3 MW across 10 projects. The Japanese authorities originally planned to allocate 150 MW and agreed to review 11 projects, totaling 44.3 MW. The lowest bid offered in the auction was JPY 9.70 ($0.068)/kWh and the average, offered final price was JPY 9.81. The ceiling price was set at JPY 9.88/kWh.
The feed-in tariffs will be awarded to projects ranging in size from 250 kW to 1 MW. The authorities assigned 11.8 MW of capacity and the lowest bid was JPY 9.50/kWh. The final average price was JPY 9.77.
In the twelfth procurement exercis, which was finalized in June, the assigned PV capacity was 153.7 MW. The lowest bid came in at JPY 8.85/kWh. In the eleventh auction, held in March, the assigned PV power was 268.7 MW and the lowest bid was JPY 8.99/kWh. However, that was the last auction to award fixed tariffs.
In 2021, the Japanese government allocated 675 MW of PV capacity across three different auctions. In the previous auctions, it allocated 942 MW.

In the latest edition of its scorecard, DNV evaluated 19 battery cell types and found that lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from Chinese manufacturers CATL and Narada were the top performers for stationary energy storage applications.
CATL and Narada were among few manufacturers that took part in the testing and allowed their names to be publicly disclosed, while others preferred to stay anonymous. The two battery makers emerged as the top performers within the “less than two-hour grid support” and “four-hour solar shifting” categories.
CATL also topped DNV’s table of top 10 battery cell manufacturers by production volume for 2022, with 132 GWh of total cell production. It overtook South Korea’s LG Energy Solution, which came in second with 93.9 GWh, followed by Panasonic with 60.1 GWh.
DNV said that the results include all battery cells produced across EV and stationary energy storage systems. It noted that most battery cell manufacturers have more than 90% of their cells going to EVs, with only a few notable exceptions. Its latest scorecard also includes recommendations that projects developers and owners should take into consideration when evaluating and selecting vendors within the energy storage market. It highlights four criteria:
In addition, DNV’s 2022 scorecard points to some key features that are important to consider when comparing different battery cells. In terms of safety, these are the temperatures at which venting and thermal runaway occur.
While the results of the safety testing remained anonymous in this year’s scorecard, DNV noted that cells from different manufacturers and chemistries have demonstrated “vastly different” venting and thermal runaway onset temperatures. It noted that large differences between venting and runaway temperatures are desirable in battery cells. For instance, it found that an LFP cell showed high temperatures and around 150 C difference, whereas one sample of a nickel, manganese, and cobalt (NMC) cell and another LFP cell showed lower temperatures and almost no difference between venting and runaway.

The clean energy unit of Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Metals Group has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Egyptian government to explore the development of a green hydrogen production project with 9.2 GW of installed capacity. The project could also include the construction of local manufacturing facilities for wind and solar components.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), which is seeking to create a global portfolio of renewable energy projects to supply 15 million tonnes per year of renewable green hydrogen by 2030, said the project could also include the construction of local manufacturing facilities for wind and solar components. The 9.2 GW plan was the topic of discussion for Forrest and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi when they met at the weekend ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), to be held in Egypt from Nov. 6 to Nov. 18.
“Egypt is on the way to becoming a global powerhouse in the green energy value chain and will be ready to show the world that at COP27,” said Forrest. “Egypt’s excellent wind and solar resources can generate the renewable energy required to produce large-scale green electricity, green hydrogen and green ammonia.”
Sisi said the deal emphasised Egypt’s commitment to catching up with the global march to promote the use of renewable energy and forms part of a national strategy to increase the share of renewables in the country’s total energy mix.
“The meeting tackled collaboration between Fortescue Future Industries and Egypt’s electricity and renewable energy sector in the fields of green hydrogen production and green ammonia with a 9.2 GW installed capacity from renewable energy,” a presidential spokesman said. “(It also discussed) the localisation of electricity production from solar and wind resources such as solar panels and wind turbines.”
One of the first key parts of the plan is a 2 GW electrolyzer factory being developed in central Queensland. The factory is expected to produce its first electrolyzer by the end of 2023. But newly appointed CEO Mark Hutchinson said the company is still some time off producing its first green hydrogen.
Hutchinson has been quoted as saying the first production of green hydrogen is at least two years away with first hydrogen exports likely to come from Queensland’s Gibson Island, where the company is working with fertiliser and chemical manufacturer Incitec Pivot to convert its ammonia-production facility to run on green hydrogen. Currently, the facility uses natural gas as a feedstock.
FFI plans to construct an on-site electrolysis plant which will produce up to 50,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, which would then be converted into green ammonia for Australian and export markets.

Amp Energy India, an Indian renewable energy developer, has partnered with Websol Energy System to produce up to 1.2 GW of monocrystalline PERC solar cells and modules.
The two companies will form a joint venture for PV production. Cells and modules will be produced in two phases of 600 MW each at Websol’s existing unit at Falta in West Bengal, said Amp Energy India, as it announced the signing of a term sheet for the establishment of the joint venture.
Amp Energy India said its entry into PV manufacturing will help it to better control the supply chain for critical components. Websol will hold a 51% stake in the venture, while Amp Energy will own the remaining 49%.
The project will be financed via a combination of debt and equity. It will supply up to 50% of its output to Amp Energy India under an off-take agreement. The rest of the power will be sold on the market, in order to fill the demand-supply gap for cells and modules in India. 
Amp Energy India said it has a renewable energy portfolio of more than 2 GW across 15 states in India. 
“We believe that our entry into manufacturing would not only help in backward integration but also help us have better control over the supply chain of critical components,” said Pinaki Bhattacharyya, MD and CEO, Amp Energy India. “We have always supported the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative by generating renewable energy in India, and this natural progression into manufacturing is also an extension of our support.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie said in a new report that installed and operational solar capacity could surge from 129 GW at present to 335 GW by 2027.
Despite this rapid growth, projections for this year have been trimmed to 15.7 GW due to the lingering effects of the US Department of Commerce’s investigation into antidumping violations by major international solar panel suppliers. Ongoing international trade and labor concerns, including the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), could continue to challenge supply and limit deployment in 2023. The full benefits of the IRA might not be reflected in deployment until 2024 at earliest, said the report.
Solar accounted for 39% of all new capacity additions in the first half of 2022. The US solar market now represents about 4.5% of the nation’s electricity mix. Perhaps the most significant development in the Inflation Reduction Act for the solar industry was the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) at 30%.
“The Inflation Reduction Act has given the solar industry the most long-term certainty it has ever had,” said Michelle Davis, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “Ten years of investment tax credits stands in stark contrast to the one-, two-, or five-year extensions that the industry has experienced in the last decade. It’s not an overstatement to say that the IRA will lead to a new era for the US solar industry.”
For the fifth quarter in a row, residential solar had record deployment with 1.36 GW installed, a 37% increase over the second quarter of 2021. This represents nearly 180,000 residential customers installing solar in one quarter. The report said customer demand was strong due in part to power outages and to power price increases. Residential solar installations may drop slightly next year as California’s NEM 3.0 policy takes effect.
Commercial solar installed 336 MW in the second quarter, down 7% year on year, while 2.7 GW of utility-scale solar was deployed, down 25% decrease from the second quarter of 2021. The extension and expansion of the ITC and other provisions in the IRA boosted Wood Mackenzie’s five-year outlook by 52 GW (47%) over previous projections.
Community solar deployment projects were lifted by 18% compared to the previous outlook. President Joe Biden’s executive order has brought relief to the industry, but most of the additions come from Maine and New York. The two states accounted for 72% of the community solar capacity additions in the first half of 2022. In Maine, Net Energy Billing (NEB) projects that are not wrapped up in the state’s interconnection studies are coming online at a fast pace. In New York, Community Adder projects continue to come online, with a healthy pipeline remaining.
System prices continued to climb in the second quarter across market segments, mostly due to module price increases. System pricing increased year on year by 9% for residential, 8% for commercial, 8% for utility fixed-tilt, and 13% for utility single-axis tracking solar projects.
