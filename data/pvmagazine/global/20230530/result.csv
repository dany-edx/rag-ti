Danish renewable energy company European Energy says it has secured all necessary approvals to build a 250 MW solar power plant in Vizzini, in the province of Catania, Sicily, in southern Italy.
The company said the PV facility will be located close to a substation owned by Italian grid operator Terna in Vizzini and that it will occupy a surface of around 200 hectares.
“At the moment, both traditional photovoltaic and ‘tracker' solutions are being technically evaluated, to increase energy production with panels that follow the orientation of the sun, as well as ‘agrivoltaic' solutions to reconcile electricity production and agricultural yield of valuable crops,” European Energy said in a statement, without providing further technical or financial details.
If built, the plant will become Italy's largest PV plant. Currently, the country's biggest solar plant is also owned and operated by the Danish company. It is a 123 MW solar project in Troia, in the province of Foggia. The facility was integrated with an ancient archaeological site discovered during surveys for the project.
“We have already demonstrated our ability to design, develop and manage record renewable energy projects of significant size and complexity,” said Alessandro Migliorini, Country Manager Italy of European Energy. “With this authorization, we take a further step forward in our strategic path, we will continue to invest in Italy for the realization of renewable energy projects, mainly wind and photovoltaic, always linked to programs for the recovery of the cultural environment or the development of the natural heritage of the territory on which they insist.”

Electricity demand
The fourth week of May finished with a rise in electricity demand in most of the European electricity markets analyzed compared to the previous week. The largest increment, of 3.5%, was registered in the markets of Portugal and Belgium, while the smallest increase took place in the Spanish market, at 0.1%. On the other hand, the markets of Great Britain and France registered decreases in demand of 5.1% and 1.0%, respectively. In the case of the markets of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, the rise was due to the recovery of the demand after the holiday of May 18, Ascension Thursday.
Regarding average temperatures, increases were registered compared to the previous week in almost all analyzed markets. In the case of Great Britain and France, the rise in temperatures led to the drop in demand in these markets, despite the recovery of demand from the May 18 holiday in France.
For the week of May 29, according to the demand forecasting made by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, the demand is expected to decrease in all the main European markets except in Portugal.

European electricity markets
In the week of May 22, prices in most European electricity markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting decreased compared to the previous week. The exception was the MIBEL market of Portugal and Spain, with increases of 64% and 70%, respectively. On the other hand, the largest drop in prices, of 39%, was that of the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries, while the German, Belgian, and French markets remained without large variations. In the rest of the markets, the prices decreased between 9.6% in the IPEX market of Italy and 13% in the EPEX SPOT market of the Netherlands.
In the fourth week of May, weekly prices stayed below €100/MWh in the European markets. The highest average price, €93.29/MWh, was that of the Italian market. On the other hand, the lowest weekly average was that of the Nordic market, at €13.02/MWh. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices were set between €62.40/MWh in the Dutch market and €62.40/MWh in the Portuguese market.
Regarding hourly prices, negative hourly prices were registered in the Dutch market in most of the days of the fourth week of May. On Saturday, May 27, negative hourly prices were also registered in the German, French, and Nordic markets. Besides these markets, there were also negative hourly prices in the Belgian market on May 28 and 29. The lowest hourly price of the fourth week of May, of ‑€400.00/MWh, was registered on Sunday, May 28, from 14:00 to 15:00, in the Dutch market and was the lowest of this market at least since April 2011. In the Nordic market, a new minimum historical record of -€12.93/MWh was reached on Sunday, May 28, from 12:00 to 15:00.
During the week of May 22, the decrease in the average price of gas and CO2 emission rights, as well as the increase in solar energy production, led to a drop in the European electricity market prices. However, the decrease in wind energy production in markets such as the German or the French one partially compensated this downward trend and prices remained stable. On the other hand, in the case of the MIBEL market, the drop in wind energy production in the Iberian Peninsula contributed to an increase in prices in this market.
The AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasting indicates that, in the first week of June, prices may continue to decrease in most of the European electricity markets, influenced by the decrease in demand. On the other hand, prices in the Iberian market may continue to rise, influenced by the low levels of wind energy production.

At an event organized by Afry Management Consulting, the consequences of closing nuclear power plants in Spain were analyzed, and the potential deployment of solar and wind energy to compensate for the loss of capacity was discussed.
Currently, there are 60 GW of approved large-scale renewable projects, while the Spanish solar association UNEF has requested an upward revision of the country's energy strategy to enable the deployment of an additional 65 GW of PV capacity by 2030.
If the current deployment rate continues, it is projected that there will be 75 GW of installed capacity in 2030, surpassing the forecasts of the current energy strategy. Solar power is expected to exceed 50 GW, while wind power may not reach 40 GW due to approval process barriers.
In extreme scenarios modeled by Afry, the difference in solar revenue between a scenario of moderate renewables and high battery penetration and a scenario of high renewable penetration would be almost €40/MWh, with the latter dropping below €20/MWh from 2025.
The consultancy company highlights that there are many launched projects whose realization is uncertain and that the high renewable penetration scenario has less installed PV capacity in 2030 than the new objectives proposed for the energy strategy.
Regarding storage, Afry suggests that up to 17 GW, including pumped hydro, would be profitable but would require incentives for installation. The consultancy foresees 3-4 GW of grid-connected electrolyzers by 2030 in a basic scenario.
As solar prices decline, revenue for producers decreases, making power purchase agreements (PPAs) unfeasible if retail prices fall below the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Only the government would be willing to pay above-market prices in such a scenario.
The early closure of nuclear plants would increase reliance on gas combined cycle plants, leading to higher prices and more volatility. It raises the question of whether to prioritize greater renewable generation with higher emissions or delay nuclear shutdown to reduce emissions and slow down renewable deployment.
A study on the security of supply in the event of nuclear shutdown has also been deemed necessary.

“We have proposed a two-dimension finite element model for PPV module electrical and thermal performance with ground influence,” researcher Tao Ma told pv magazine. “We conducted lab tests to analyze the anti-skid feature and energy output of the pre-fabricated module, as well as parametric analyses on the module design and surrounding ground material.”
The scientists conducted numerical and experimental studies on the potential integrated thermal and electrical performance of a PVP located in Hong Kong. The installation is based on monocrystalline solar modules with a 20% efficiency and a power output of 31.5 W. The PVP uses tempered glass sheets on the front and rear sides for improved structural strength and protection.
“The patterns are added to the front surface of the module for higher anti-skid properties compared to the resin,” the researchers said. “The damp layer with backfilling materials of air and epoxy resin (EP) is used instead of the hollow structure, for better support.”
Asphalt concrete was chosen as the surface ground, and input parameters including weather, site conditions, PV module output, module surface temperature, and surrounding road temperature were selected.
The scientists found that the PVP could reach a potential electrical output of 0.68 kWh/m2 and an efficiency of 14.71%. They said the epoxy resin filling reduces the annual maximum PVP module surface temperature by 8.4%, and noted that the average heat island effect alleviation could reach 13.16 C.
The research group conducted other simulations for PVPs in Shanghai and 255 other Chinese cities. They found that electricity potential could range from 0.70 kWh/W to 1.83 kWh/W, with cities in western and northeastern China showing higher PV generation potential.
“The pavement cost has not been estimated so far, but commercial production is being considered,” Ma stated.
The researchers presented their new technology in “Simulation and experimental study on the energy performance of a pre-fabricated photovoltaic pavement,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
In 2019, researchers at Hong Kong Polytechnic University developed PV floor tiles designed for pavements and cycling tracks. The tiles were tested on a ‘green deck' in Hong Kong and have shown satisfactory solar energy conversion, anti-slip performance, heat resistance, and strength.

The CQ-H2 project is being developed by Queensland-government owned generator Stanwell in conjunction with Japanese energy companies Iwatani, Kansai Electric Power Corporation, Marubeni, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Sydney-based energy infrastructure business APA Group.
The consortium partners have today committed $81.8 million to fund the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) for the CQ-H2 project, which would eventually include 3 GW of electrolyser capacity capable of producing up to of 800 tonnes of green hydrogen per day for export to Japan and use in local industry.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) will provide AUD 20 million in funding, while AUD 15 million will be provided by the Queensland government. The study will also investigate the development of a hydrogen liquefaction facility based at the port of Gladstone that will produce 400 tons per day of liquefied hydrogen for export by the end of 2030.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said successful completion of the FEED will bring the project one step closer to a final investment decision, planned for late 2024.
“Projects like this are critical to scaling up Australia’s green hydrogen industry,” Bowen said. “The government is committed to making Australia a global hydrogen leader and projects like the CQ-H2 project could lead the way in exporting renewable hydrogen to the international market. Japan, Korea and China are three of our largest trading partners and have all made clear commitments to increase the use of hydrogen, with a focus on establishing international supply chains for imports.”
It is anticipated the CQ-H2 project, being developed at Aldoga, about 20 kilometers northwest of Gladstone, would initially involve the installation of up to 640 MW of electrolysers to produce 73,000 tons of green hydrogen per annum by 2028. The electrolyzer capacity is to ramp up to 3 GW, producing to 292,000 tons per annum by 2031. The hydrogen would then be liquified or converted to ammonia for export to Japan and potentially local industry offtake.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said Australia is well positioned to capitalise on export opportunities to Asia, however, unlocking it will require the rapid development of substantial hydrogen production and export facilities at a globally cost competitive price point.
“Stanwell’s project represents a near-term renewable hydrogen production opportunity at globally significant scale,” he said. “The development of a renewable hydrogen hub in Gladstone could help decarbonise heavy industrial facilities in the region and create an export supply chain between Australia and Japan and Singapore.”
Miller said the CQ-H2 project could provide “valuable learnings around the current cost of producing hydrogen from renewable energy at large-scale …  This understanding is critical to scaling up hydrogen production in Australia and developing both the domestic and export industry for renewable hydrogen in line with Australia’s ambitions.”
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the CQ-H2 project will help establish the state as a global hydrogen heavyweight and unlock huge economic opportunities with estimates indicating the project will generate almost 9,000 jobs and more than AUD 17.2 billion in hydrogen exports over its 30-year life.
“Green hydrogen is the next resource frontier for a world hungry for renewables, and it’s Queensland’s green hydrogen industry that will ensure the greatest climate, jobs, and export opportunity in a generation,” he said. “We are writing a new chapter and carving our own path to ensure Queensland’s mighty sun, wind and water are leveraged to help decarbonise our nation, and the world.”
The funding for the FEED comes after a AUD 10.4 million feasibility study showed that the proposed CQ-H2 project is technically feasible and commercially viable, “with appropriate government support in the initial phases.”
Stanwell has already secured a 236-hectare site at Aldoga for the hydrogen production base and a ~100-hectare site is to be acquired at the Port of Gladstone to serve as a hydrogen liquefaction and loading base.
A memorandum of understanding has also been signed that allows for a direct connection to be established between the hydrogen production facility and Spanish renewable energy company Acciona Energia’s proposed 600 MWp Aldoga Solar Farm.
Acciona has previously said construction of the Aldoga Solar Farm is due to commence later this year with generation output scheduled to commence in December 2025.

A new study by the Canada-based International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Consumer Unity and Trust Society International (CUTS) has shown promising results in pilot agrivoltaics projects throughout India, highlighting the opportunities for further research and investment.
The study, which was supported by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), showed that agrivoltaics do not negatively impact crop yields and, in some cases, even increase them. Pilot implementers interviewed in the study indicated the technical feasibility of agrivoltaics, with certain crops like leafy vegetables, millet, and medicinal plants showing no change or increased yields under shading conditions.
However, the study also revealed that agrivoltaics is still limited to a small number of pilots in India and has not yet reached a commercial scale. To achieve commercialization, the study suggests focusing on technological innovations and testing business models suitable for the Indian context. It identifies three potential business models: joint ownership between farmers and developers, sole ownership by either party, or primary promotion by developers with farmers as partners.
Bifacial panels and sun tracking were found to be promising in agrivoltaics and can be encouraged through state-sponsored pilots. The study also identifies arid and semi-arid regions, as well as peri-urban areas, as favorable locations for agrivoltaics in India.
To support agrivoltaics, the study recommends state governments reform land-use and tax regulations, develop consistent standards and definitions, and go beyond a uniform ceiling tariff regime. Capacity building, continuous innovation, and peer learning are emphasized to overcome operational challenges.
The findings of the study are based on the experiences of various stakeholders, including power distribution companies, agricultural universities, private solar PV developers, and farmers who have implemented agrivoltaics pilots across India.
