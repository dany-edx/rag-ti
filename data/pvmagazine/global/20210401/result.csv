The government body will help Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) members benefit from improved energy efficiency and rooftop solar, including through access to installation information and low-cost finance.
The BGMEA has more than 4,000 member factories and Bangladesh is the world's second largest apparel producer after China. An official from the trade body said: “If we want to sustain … business globally, we have to lower carbon emission. And for that we have to go for renewable energy.”
With industry accounting for 48% of the nation's energy consumption–and 30% of that figure used by textiles and apparel makers, according to junior power minister Nasrul Hamid–the hope is that the widespread adoption of net-metered solar rooftops in the industry will have a sizable impact.
Hamid said: “The energy consumption of [the] textile and garment industry can be reduced by 18% if they are equipped with advanced energy-efficient technologies.”
With German development agency the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) set to provide technical support to the agreement signed today, a senior SREDA official told pv magazine BGMEA members have thousands of factory buildings where rooftop solar could be installed for self-consumption, with excess energy to be exported to the grid.
The SREDA official said the BGMEA is a signatory to the Fashion Industry Charter of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. “They are committed to lower[ing] carbon emission[s] and will be praised for producing goods through less carbon discharging,” said the spokesperson.
SREDA will soon start work with interested factory owners to set up rooftop solar as demonstration projects.
State-run financier the Infrastructure Development Company Limited, the Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited and international development partners could also offer financial support to the apparel sector.
SREDA chairman Mohammad Alauddin said businesses are an integral part of sustainable energy development. “This deal will pave [the] way to produce green energy and enhance energy efficiency,” he said. Referring to his nation's emissions reduction commitment for the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November, he added: “In the nationally determined contribution (NDC), Bangladesh has made [a] commitment to lower carbon emission[s], thus there is no alternative to [the] efficient use of energy.”
BGMEA president Rubana Huq said lenders would have to come forward to back plans to green the industry. “For [a] green revolution, all the factories have to be made green,” she said.
More than 100 Bangladeshi garment factories have already been certified green by the U.S. Green Building Council and more than 500 facilities have registered to make their manufacturing operations more environmentally friendly.

In April 2017, French renewable energy developer Tenergie commissioned its first photovoltaic greenhouse based on its proprietary technology Tenairlux, in Mallemort, in the Bouches-du-Rhône region of southern France. The plant was built with 265 W panels and has an installed power of 2.1 MW.
“Four years after the commissioning of this 33,000m² greenhouse, our feedback is positive, with a yield of four tons/hectare for this first year of growing green asparagus from Provence, after a period of diversified cultivation including zucchini, turnips, [and] sweet potatoes during the first three years and a production of 3.1 GWh of green electricity, which is the equivalent of the consumption of 700 households, excluding heating,” the company wrote in a detailed report. For 2022, the expected agricultural yield is expected to increase to nine tons/hectare.
“From the start of this project, we co-built the specifications with Laurent Chabert, market gardener and manager of family winery Domaine Saint Vincent, so that his tool fully meets his expectations,” Tenergie president Nicolas Jeuffrain explained. “Resolutely efficient and innovative, thanks in particular to the installation of photovoltaic modules, this tailor-made solution allows, in particular, better light diffusion and better ventilation and a more uniform temperature.”
Among the advantages of this greenhouse concept, the installation of photovoltaic modules makes it possible to reduce the shadow cast on the ground (36% against 52% for a conventional greenhouse). The light is better exploited by the use of filtering and diffusing polycarbonate, thus improving the uniformity of the light on the ground. Ventilation based on a roof-opening system coupled with a full-side motorized opening–controlled according to the indoor climate and outdoor weather constraints–is claimed to allow precise climate control.
“On the one hand, for this first year of growing asparagus in the Tenairlux greenhouse, we are producing particularly exceptional product quality,” said Chabert, adding that asparagus picking will end this year in mid-April. “On the other hand, thanks to its large volume and its very innovative design, the ventilation, brightness, and temperature of the greenhouse are clearly optimized for better climate management, but also, time savings and working conditions.”
Tenergie wants to develop around 30 greenhouses of this kind within three years. About ten projects are currently under study. The company is also working on other possible synergies with the agricultural world, in particular on projects related to anaerobic digestion.
To date, 75% of solar power plants operated by Tenergie are linked to the agricultural world, such as greenhouses or the renovation of roofs of agricultural buildings. In France, Tenergie owns and operates a fleet of more than 1,000 solar and wind power plants with an installed capacity of 615 MW.

The Greek Covid recovery strategy, which follows the principles of the EU recovery fund agreed in July, builds on reforms put forward by the Mitsotakis administration since its election in July 2019. Policies introduced since have included a 2030 energy and climate plan; phasing out coal by 2028 at the latest; and a new, digital renewables licensing regime.
The four pillars of the recovery plan outlined by Mitsotakis yesterday, and which will be submitted to the European Commission for approval this month, include the green energy transition and digitization of the economy, alongside social sector policy, for employment schemes and education, and private sector reforms of taxes, export programs, R&D and the like.
The green energy transition bid aims to invest €6 billion of EU grants towards clean energy, with that sum intended to be topped up by €4.4 billion of private investment.
With the EU ‘recovery and resilience facility' also offering loans, total liquidity for green power projects is expected to extend to some extra billions.
With all four pillars of the five-year Greek recovery plan set to secure €12.73 billion of EU lending on top of €18.2 billion in grants–and expected to attract €26.5 billion of private-sector cash–the €54.5 billion being eyed by Athens would boost Greek GDP 7% by 2026.
The European loan funding available will be offered only to private investors and can supply no more than half of project costs, Athens said yesterday. It will be channeled through domestic and international banks and financial institutions.
The Greek recovery program will include plans for up to 1.38 GW of pumped hydro and battery storage, with a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Environment and Energy telling pv magazine a team has been established to draft an energy storage regulation framework this year.
PV arrays will be included among plans for around €1 billion to be invested upgrading national building stock, through measures such as energy efficiency improvements and smart energy systems.
Smart energy–and electric vehicles (EVs)–will also be financed by €450 million earmarked for upgrading commercial infrastructure, and the recovery strategy also features plans to expand the national EV charging network and to establish an electric public transport fleet.
The partly operational electricity interconnector between the mainland and Cyclades islands will be expanded and the government also plans to devote cash to setting the national fund for the development of renewables on a firm footing, after previous financial travails.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/01/commercial-hjt-solar-cells-could-hit-26-efficiency-by-2030/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 1, 2021",Commercial HJT solar cells could hit 26% efficiency by 2030,"Prof. Shah, in “Solar Cells and Modules,” recently published by Springer, you devote an entire chapter to the pros and cons of heterojunction (HJT) solar. Do you think the advantages of HJT cells now outweigh the challenges still facing this technology?
Arvind Shah: Yes, they have more than offset the challenges. The main problem with HJT technology is that if you already have a traditional plant running on PERC modules, then changing that plant into an HJT plant does not make economic sense. But if you start from scratch, then it can be advantageous to build an HJT plant, because electricity produced by PV installations equipped with HJT panels will be cheaper. Additionally, HJT module fabrication plants will become even cheaper, as more and more plants with HJT technology are built.
Sylvère Leu: They will be particularly cheaper in terms of investment, surface, and energy consumption.
There are concerns about degradation mechanisms that could affect the long-term performance of such cells in the field. In particular, HJT cells are susceptible to light-induced degradation (LID) and light and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LETID). Do you believe these concerns are still justified? 
Shah: I disagree at least in part. While not completely LID-free, as for example n-type PERC cells, HJT cells and modules are in my experience less susceptible to these degradation mechanisms than traditional p-type PERC cells and modules. To go into the details, LID is mainly linked to the presence of boron-oxygen complexes; these are not present in n-type HJT cells. LETID is reported to have been caused inter alia by a rapid cooling step during the production process. As low-temperature processes are employed to produce HJT cells, such rapid cooling steps are not used in the fabrication of these cells. However, to date, not enough is known about the degradation mechanisms in HJT cells and modules.
Leu: Note that to increase quality and longevity, HJT cells are encapsulated in thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), rather than ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA), and often laminated in double glass. Therefore, the HJT modules are also suitable for use in very humid and hot climates.
Which manufacturing processes still need to be improved to further reduce costs and facilitate the rapid development of HJT panels? 
Shah: In my personal view, there are no major, further improvements possible for the goals you have stated. A minor improvement one could think of is to make HJT cells with “quasi-mono” silicon. This has been done and the results are encouraging. Back-contact HJT cells constitute another topic.
Do you believe the use of thinner n-type wafers could offer significant advantages in terms of cost and performance?
Shah: Yes, absolutely.
Leu: In terms of cost, the production of n-type material is as expensive as that of p-type material. Thinner cells have significant cost advantages because they use less silicon. Traditional PERC cells cannot be fabricated with thin wafers, because high process temperatures are used here, and thereby warping of the wafers occurs. HJT cells are produced at low process temperatures – hence, thin wafers can now be used. Given very efficient light trapping, such as used in all modern solar cells, a thinner cell also leads to a slight increase in cell efficiency. In this respect, thin n-type material is the optimal choice for HJT cells.
Several gigawatt-sized HJT module factories are now being built in China and Europe, including one by Meyer Burger, and small plants and pilot manufacturing facilities have been in operation for years. Does this mean the technology has now reached full maturity? Was gigawatt-scale production the last step in bringing this technology to a crystalline silicon-like dimension?
Shah: The HJT solar cell structure was first developed in 1983 and commercialized by Sanyo/Panasonic of Japan. By 2010, these solar cells had attained full technical maturity. At that time, they were characterized by higher production costs and lower temperature coefficients than all other crystalline silicon solar cells, Their application was thus restricted to small-size niche applications. Thanks to the efforts of the Meyer Burger Group (and the research group of Prof. Christophe Ballif in Neuchâtel, Switzerland), production casts could be dramatically reduced over the past decade. They are therefore now suited for gigawatt-scale applications, too.
Leu: Yes, the technological maturity of HJT for large-scale gigawatt-size fabrication plants is well established.
Temperature coefficients (TC) close to -0.3% ensure that HJT cells suffer lower performance losses over their life cycles. Is this advantage a crucial factor for their future success? 
Shah: Yes, obtaining a low temperature coefficient is indeed a crucial factor for the success of a given type of module. Note, however, that temperature coefficients do not depend on the technology used. Actually, they only depend on how near the cells come to the theoretical limit efficiency. That means how well recombination is reduced. Here, one notices an interesting relationship between the value of the open-circuit voltage and the magnitude of the TC. Cells that have – due to high recombination – low values of open-circuit voltage also have, in general, strong temperature dependence – that is, a high magnitude of TC. This is described in detail in our recent book.
HJT cells have already achieved efficiencies above 25% at laboratory level and several industrial players are convinced that similar efficiency levels may soon be reached in commercial production. Which is your view on this? 
Shah: Yes, they will soon be reached in production.
What efficiency levels could these cells potentially reach by the end of this decade? How much research is needed to make higher efficiencies possible and which direction should scientists follow? 
Shah: About 26%, which will then roughly correspond to the so-called semi-empirical limit, according to Australian researcher Martin Green. The Schockley-Queisser limit of some 30% – which is the absolute fundamental limit for crystalline silicon solar cells – can only be reached if all unnecessary recombination, including the Auger recombination, is eliminated. This recombination depends on doping, which means that to reduce it, we have to reduce doping – but then we have problems in contacting the cells. This is a very complicated issue. And scientists should elaborate on this, whilst keeping in mind the delicate issue of cell production. We would guess that by the end of the decade, we would be seeing laboratory small-size cells of about 28% efficiency. All this is described in detail in our recent book. A further interesting development is that of tandem structures, combining an HJT bottom cell and a perovskite top cell – in this way, laboratory efficiencies of almost 30% have been obtained. However, so far perovskite cells are not stable. Scientists are at present working on this.
HJT modules could be used in rooftop PV arrays and large-scale solar parks. Do you believe we will see a large share of these products in both segments?
Leu: Yes, investments will generally have the tendency to flow into new technologies. New players in the solar field will hesitate before investing in additional PERC module production lines today – they would probably judge that PERC technology has already reached very near to its limits and that only marginal cost and efficiency benefits are to be obtained in this sector. We thus estimate that the market growth for HJT technology will be greater than that for traditional cell types. HJT modules will be readily installed on rooftops, thanks to their higher cell efficiency. Because they are already bifacial, they will also be installed in megawatt-size solar parks. For such parks, one will increasingly deploy bifacial tracking systems, thus attaining the highest energy yields possible in the case of silicon solar modules. For all these reasons, the market share of HJT cells will steadily increase in the near future. HJT cells will, thus, increasingly replace traditional types of cells.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/01/shunfeng-prepares-to-sell-golden-goose-to-keep-creditors-at-bay/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",MAX HALL,"APRIL 1, 2021",Shunfeng prepares to sell golden goose to keep creditors at bay,"Chinese solar developer Shunfeng has updated shareholders on its latest grapples with creditors in an annual report very much focused on debts.
The solar project company and LED manufacturer, which sold off its solar manufacturing operation in 2019, published figures which showed solar electricity sales revenue in China fell 34% last year, compared to the volume generated in 2019. That is not surprising given Shunfeng sold off 17 solar project companies in two deals last year.
That fall off in clean energy income dragged down the figures to a net loss of RMB502 million (US$76.4 million) last year despite a 55% leap in LED-related revenue over the same period. That loss is significantly less than the RMB1.88 billion (US$286 million) shed in 2019 but with Shunfeng preparing to sell off that profitable Lattice Power LED unit, it appears there could be further tough times ahead.
In the meantime, the board admitted it is dependent on the goodwill of creditors in relation to RMB500 million of overdue debts. Shunfeng is hoping its inherently vague plans to sell off further solar farms will be enough to satisfy the holders of a 2015 corporate bond which matured in November 2019 and which are awaiting payments of RMB417 million. The same goes for other lenders who are owed RMB83 million (US$12.6 million).
And there are other pressing concerns, with Shunfeng due to have made its first quarterly payment of HK$75 million (US$9.65 million) to China Minsheng Banking Corp yesterday as part of a deal to make payments of that amount every three months this year and next before settling a final HK$180 million by December 18, 2023. That debt renegotiation involved Shunfeng pledging its 20% stake in Shunfeng Photovoltaic Holdings Ltd as security.
The holder of a 2016 corporate bond which matured in June 2018 has been persuaded to hold off settlement of the RMB298 million owed, but only for 24 days from today, and the company must also find HK$87.5 million for its first payment to a bondholder owed HK$350 million by the end of next month. The same amount will then have to be handed over by November 30, and then May 31 and November 30 next year, after Shunfeng worked out a deal on Friday.
The company reported it also hopes to announce a new repayment plan this month for the overdue RMB666 million (US$101 million) it owes Chongqing International Trust Co Ltd.
Those creditor negotiations were helped along by the fire sale of 17 solar projects last year although auditor BDO has put a fly in the ointment in the annual report, by being unable to confirm the carrying value of the 11 project companies sold in the largest of the two transactions.
“The management of the 11 target companies,” said BDO, “denied the group's [Shunfeng's] directors, and our, access to the books and records and other information of the 11 target companies.”

This initiative is part of the group's plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. For its global corporate operations, this target has already been achieved, the company claims.
Among the suppliers, there are Netherlands-based DSM Engineering Materials, French-Italian semiconductor business STMicroelectronics, Belgian chemical company Solvay, U.S.-based semiconductor provider Alpha and Omega Semiconductor, U.S. flexible component manufacturer Marian, and U.S. chemical companies Chemours Company and Trinseo. “And, in China, 15 suppliers have joined Apple’s program since July 2020,” Apple added.

“A barrier is broken, it is wonderful that we can finally start counting Swedish installed power in gigawatts,” the association's CEO, Anna Werner, said.
The figures showed 2020 was the country’s best for solar deployment, with more than 400 MW of generation capacity added to the grid. The nation had added 287 MW in 2019 and 180 MW in 2018 after connecting 91 MW, 13 MW, 37.6 MW and 36.2 MW, respectively, in the previous four years.
Sweden now boasts around 66,000 PV arrays, with around 22,000 added last year. In the previous year, newly deployed installations had been around 19,000.
Most of Sweden's PV capacity is represented by residential and commercial arrays that are being supported by a rebate scheme that was expected to expire at the end of last year and was then extended to 2021, although only for municipalities and businesses.

A new report, backed by the Indian government, says that solar panel producers (instead of end owners) should be held accountable for PV waste.
The “PV Waste Management in India” report was prepared as part of an EU-India technical cooperation project on renewable energy and energy efficiency in India, with the support of the country's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The National Solar Energy Federation of India and SolarPower Europe, along with European recycling association PV Cycle, also contributed to the report. It makes recommendations based on experience with extended producer responsibility policy approaches for PV modules in several European countries. 
PV modules and inverters are not currently covered by the Indian E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, as such rules only apply to (i) information technology and telecom equipment and (ii) consumer electrical and electronics products. PV modules and inverters are not listed in these electrical and electronic equipment categories.
The report recommends creating legislation for PV modules in India, separately from its e-waste rules. Such a law could make producers responsible for PV modules and other PV system products, such as inverters and batteries. 
The report said that PV waste collection is currently insignificant in India, given that solar PV modules generally last 30 years or longer. It also noted that the nation installed just 570,000 tons of PV modules before the end of 2016. Most PV modules – 2,175,000 tons – were installed in the 2017-19 period.

The Singapore-based consortium behind the AUD 26 billion ($19.7 billion) Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) has filed an application with the Development Consent Authority of Australia's Northern Territory to build a facility that will manufacture Maverick solar array systems, designed by Sydney-based 5B.
The prefabricated, prewired Maverick system has been tapped as the module of choice for the AAPL project – a 14 GW solar farm and approximately 33 GWh battery energy storage system that will be constructed near Elliott, in the Barkly Region of Australia's Northern Territory.
Sun Cable said the first stage of the proposed manufacturing facility will pilot a semi-automated production line, which will provide opportunities to supply other solar farms across northern Australia with the Maverick solar array systems. Phase two of the development will expand the facility to manufacture systems for the AAPL and establish a logistics and distribution center to transport material and equipment by rail to Sun Cable’s proposed 14 GW solar farm site.
“This application is an important step in the ongoing development of the Australia-ASEAN Power Link, a solar energy infrastructure network that will provide Darwin and Singapore with competitively priced, dispatchable, high-volume renewable electricity from 2026 and 2027 respectively,” Sun Cable said.
Sun Cable plans to build the manufacturing facility in Darwin’s East Arm Business Park – a location chosen due to its proximity to the city's port. It and said it will now work with ICN-NT to select a delivery partner for the project.
The proposed AAPL includes a 14 GW solar farm to be developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek. It will be coupled with an estimated 33 GWh of battery storage. The project is expected to supply power to the Darwin region and to Singapore via a 4,500-km, high-voltage direct-current transmission network, including a 750-km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800-km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore, via Indonesia. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
The development application is the latest milestone for the project. The Australian federal government has also included the project on its priority initiative list, while Sun Cable has already signed a project development agreement with the Northern Territory government.
While the outlook for the project is favorable, there has been no indication from the company that any nation has signed up to purchase power from it. However, Sun Cable remains confident, saying that construction of the project will begin immediately after financial close in October 2023, with commercial operations to commence in 2027.
