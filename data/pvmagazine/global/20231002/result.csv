They claim it can significantly reduce the cost of water production.
“The configuration of the device allows water to circulate in swirling eddies, in a manner similar to the much larger ‘thermohaline' circulation of the ocean,” the scientists said. “This circulation, combined with the sun’s heat, drives water to evaporate, leaving salt behind. The resulting water vapor can then be condensed and collected as pure, drinkable water. In the meantime, the leftover salt continues to circulate through and out of the device, rather than accumulating and clogging the system.”
Thermohaline circulation describes how fluid motion occurs due to the buoyancy difference between hot, less dense material rising and cold, denser material sinking under gravity, leading to heat transfer.
The researchers said that if they upscale the system to the size of a small suitcase, it could generate 4 liters to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last for several years before needing replacement components. At this scale and efficiency, the system could produce drinking water more affordably than tap water.
The device comprises a series of compartments with heat exchangers and condensate collectors. The central component is a single-stage unit resembling a slim box covered in heat-absorbing dark material. Inside, the box is divided into upper and lower sections.
Water flows through the top half, featuring an evaporator layer on its surface that utilizes solar heat to evaporate water directly. The resulting water vapor is then directed into the bottom half of the box, where a condensation layer cools it, transforming it into drinkable, salt-free liquid. The researchers positioned the entire box at an angle inside a larger, empty container, connecting a tube from the top half of the box to the bottom of the vessel and allowing it to float in saltwater.
“In this configuration, water can naturally push up through the tube and into the box, where the tilt of the box, combined with the thermal energy from the sun, induces the water to swirl as it flows through,” the researchers explained. “The small eddies help to bring water in contact with the upper evaporating layer while keeping salt circulating, rather than settling and clogging.”
The team built several prototypes, with one, three and 10 stages, and tested their performance in water of different salinity, including natural seawater and seven times saltier water.
“With a 10-stage device, we achieve record-breaking solar-water efficiency of 322%-121% in a salinity range of 0 to 20% by weight, under the illumination of a single sun. Furthermore, we demonstrate extreme resistance to salt accumulation with a 180-hour continuous desalination of 20 wt% concentrated seawater,” they concluded.
They presented the system in “Extreme salt-resisting multistage solar distillation with thermohaline convection,” which was recently published in Joule.

The novel device architecture is claimed to have the potential to reach a power conversion efficiency of 38.39%. “The main objective of this work is to find an efficient combination of non-toxic solar cells with high efficiency so that it saves time and effort before going for fabrication,” the scientists said, noting that the perovskite and materials used for the cell are lead-free.
The proposed solar cell design consists of a top cell using an absorber made of a perovskite material known as CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 and a bottom cell based on CIGS. Their structural parameters are collectively optimized to attain the highest possible efficiency.
The scientists used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells that was developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium, to simulate the performance of the separately optimized bottom and top cells. “The PV cell is modeled in this software as a stack of layers, where each layer's thickness, doping, and other physical properties of the materials that make it up are specified,” they explained.
They built the top cell with a nickel(II) oxide (NiO) hole transport layer (HTL), the perovskite absorber, a zinc oxide (ZnO) electron transport layer, and a fluorine-doped tin oxide (TFO) layer. The bottom cell was built with a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer, a CIGS absorber, an electron transport layer made of titanium oxide (TiO2), and an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer.
The two different HTLs are reportedly able to provide suitable offsets of valence and conduction band distribution.
In order to identify the optimum thickness for the top cell's absorber, the researchers simulated the device by varying the thickness of the absorber from 100 nm to 1000 nm. “It is observed that the efficiency increases gradually from 100 nm to 1000 nm, almost starts to saturate at 800 nm, and then maximizes at 1000 nm with a value of 36.25%,” they stated.
The simulation showed that the top and bottom cells may achieve a potential efficiency of 24.656% and 25.062%, respectively. “For both sub-cells, the current density coincides at around 18.64 mA/cm2, signifying the matching current,” the academics stated. “The results demonstrate that the voltage of the top cell (1.4885 V) and the bottom cell (1.0006 V) add up to yield a tandem cell voltage of 2.48 V, with the upper top cell dominating due to its relatively open-circuit voltage large value.”
In the simulation, the tandem cell achieved an efficiency of 38.39%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.48 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.64 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 83.40%. “The proposed tandem structure's performance matrices outperform those stated in the most recent literature,” the group said.
The solar cell was presented in the paper “Outstanding conversion efficiency of 38.39% from a Perovskite/CIGS tandem PV cell: A synergic optimization through computational modeling,” published in Heliyon. The research group comprises scientists from Southeast University and the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh.
“The steps associated with the designing are generalized, thus, the proposed method is applicable for tandem cells composed of other materials too,” they also said.

Germany has concluded a recent tender for innovative renewable energy projects. The exercise drew 53 bids with a total capacity of 779 MW. The authorities awarded 32 projects with a total capacity of 408 MW.
The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) said the tariffs ranged from €0.077/kWh to €0.0878/kWh, with an average price of €0.0833/kWh.
Bavaria received the most awarded capacity, with 19 projects totaling 258 MW, while other states also secured projects. In addition, 21 projects, accounting for 175 MW, will be built on 500-meter wide strips of motorways or railways, following an expansion of eligible areas under Germany's renewable energy law at the beginning of this year.
“After two weak rounds, the innovation tenders have picked up speed again,” said Klaus Müller, president of the Bundesnetzagentur. “The oversubscription shows what dynamic renewables can have. Now it’s important to maintain the current level of project development.”

Duerte Bello, CEO of Europe and Latin America operations at EDP Renewables, told pv magazine the PV facility in the center-west of Poland is a project that stands as an example of energy transition.
“What is particularly interesting is that Przykona has been built on fields that were once part of an open-pit lignite mine,” he said. “We believe that renewable energy projects can be an excellent recipe for the just transformation of post-industrial and post-mining areas. They confirm that there can be an energetic second life in traditionally coal-based regions, many of which are in both Poland and Germany.”
The large-scale PV plant is 270 ha in size and incorporates 308,000 p-type bifacial solar panels. Bello said the plant’s location was at a “tremendous advantage” for renewable energy generation as it received high solar irradiation during the day and consistent winds. This guaranteed an elevated degree of utilization of the installed capacity, Bello explained.
“Thanks to this solar installation and other clean energy projects nearby Przykona, the region has become the country’s leading center for renewable energy production,” he said. “With this installation, the company has a cumulative solar power capacity of more than 280 MW in the country, accounting for more than 90% of its total solar capacity in Europe.”
Construction on the Przykona project started in September 2022, with the first energy generation occurring in June 2023. The project was financed through corporate financing, Bello said, adding: “We do not disclose the investment made.”
When asked about the possibility of a power purchase agreement, Bello said Przykona landed a 15-year Contract-for-Difference (CfD) in 2020 as part of a suite of contracts granted in a Poland government renewable energy auction. “However, an option exists to opt out of the contract if a more profitable PPA is signed,” Bello said, adding, “EDPR has been exploring this option.”

They said they tested the model with real data, satisfying electricity demand and maximum profit.
“The goal of this study is to develop an hourly mathematical model that allows for the optimal management of grid-connected renewable generation facilities and pumped hydro-energy storage with reversible pump turbine,” the scientists emphasized. “The model can take advantage of opportunities in the electricity market through the purchase and sale of excess energy generated to the grid.”
In the paper “Optimal scheduling and management of pumped hydro storage integrated with grid-connected renewable power plants,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage, the research group explained that the model is based on a mixed-integer optimization problem, which is a type of mathematical problem often used in energy scheduling.
“The model incorporates the purchase of energy through a contract indexed to electricity prices in the wholesale market,” the academics explained. “This assumption allows us to obtain an optimal economic dispatch for every hour. In addition, the model includes the possibility of selling surplus production at a price set in the electricity market every hour.”
The model assumes that evaporation losses do not affect the performance of the system, and that wind and solar power prioritize meeting the electricity demand required by the system each hour.
The researchers have used 2019 generation data from existing plants in Spain’s Ebro Valley. These plants are represented by 860 MW of PV facilities, 456 MW of wind farms and a pumped hydro storage facility with a storage capacity of 5,750 MWh.  The wind farms are estimated to generate 1,352 GWh per year and the photovoltaic plants 2,065 GWh.
In order to analyze the techno-economic performance of the system, the scientists took as a benchmark the hourly prices of the Spanish wholesale electricity market set by the market operator OMIE in 2019. They compared the performance of the pumped hydro-wind-solar complex to that of a reference system without pumped hydro storage and found that the former reduces the cost of purchasing energy in the electricity market by up to 27 %.
“Compared to the case without storage, the integration of pumped hydro-energy storage reduces the amount of energy to be purchased from the electricity market to satisfy the demand by 20%, which implies an economic saving in the operation of the system of up to 27%,” they explained.
In addition, the scientists found that the system including the pumped hydro storage facility may help avoid energy curtailment.
“The application of the proposed model for the optimal operation of electrical systems based on renewable generation combined with large-scale pumped hydro storage helps improve the competitiveness and viability of power systems,” the researchers concluded. “The best decision is made every hour to reduce high energy costs and obtain efficient and resilient management of water use.”

The United States has historically held the position of being the largest energy storage market in the Americas, with anticipated deployment of more than 10 GW in 2023. However, countries such Canada, Mexico, and Chile are actively promoting policies to stimulate energy storage development, positioning Chile to become the second-largest energy storage market in the Americas, as projected by UK consultancy Interact Analysis.
While the first electrochemical energy storage projects in Chile made their debut in 2009 and only amounted to around 300 MW by 2022, Chile's parliament passed legislation in October 2022 to incentivize energy storage and electric mobility development. Furthermore, the government has set an ambitious target of achieving 70% of total energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030.
Consequently, Chile has witnessed a surge in renewable energy generation installations in recent years, creating a pressing demand for energy storage. This summer, $2 billion was allocated for large-scale storage auctions.
In 2023, twelve projects with a combined capacity of approximately 1.3 GW are slated to become operational, with an additional 1 GW planned for installation annually from 2024 to 2026. As of August 2023, Chile has 85 energy storage projects in various stages of development, totaling 6.4 GW.
Among these projects, 60 are in the construction and planning phase, with a collective capacity of about 4.7 GW. Of these, 51 projects are expected to commence operations between 2024 and 2026, with a total capacity of around 3.9 GW.
Electrochemical storage predominates in Chile, accounting for 79 projects with a cumulative capacity of 4.8 GW. These projects primarily focus on large-scale front-of-meter integration of renewable energy, with lithium-ion battery storage serving as the dominant technology. Notably, 31 out of the 79 projects have a continuous discharge duration ranging from 3 to 6 hours, with an average duration exceeding 5 hours.
Additionally, the country hosts five molten salt thermal storage projects, collectively offering 1.6 GW in capacity. Furthermore, a hydrogen energy storage project, developed by HIF Chile, is in the planning stages within the Magallanes-Chile Antarctic Region.

Atlas Renewable Energy has completed the construction of two PV plants in Brazil – the Lar do Sol and the Casablanca facilities. The projects, situated in Pirapora, in the state of Minas Gerais, have a combined capacity of approximately 600 MW.
The Lar do Sol solar plant, with a capacity of 239 MW, will supply power to Unipar, a major producer of chlorine, soda, and PVC in South America. Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB) provided a BRL 407 million ($80.6 million) loan to fund this initiative.
“By opting for PPAs, companies like Unipar and Anglo American demonstrate a long-term commitment to sustainability,” said Atlas Renewable Energy General Manager Luis Pita, noting that the facility is supplying energy to Unipar's Cubatão plant, which produces chlorine used to treat water that supplies water to more than 60 million people.
In line with its sustainability objectives, Unipar has agreed to supply 80% of its operations in Brazil with renewable energy self-production projects by 2024.
The Casablanca solar plant, with an installed capacity of 359 MW, is currently supplying power to Anglo American, a global mining company engaged in iron ore and nickel mining operations in Brazil.
Atlas Renewable Energy and Anglo American have signed a 15-year PPA that aligns with Anglo American's Sustainable Mining Plan. A central goal of this plan is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across all its operations by 2040. The execution of this PPA marks a significant achievement for Anglo American, as it enables the company to establish a 100% renewable electricity portfolio for its Brazilian projects.
Financing for this project was secured through a €150 million ($158.4 million) loan obtained from IDB Invest in 2021. Atlas Renewable Energy currently boasts a portfolio of over 4 GW in contracted projects worldwide, with 2.2 GW already operational. The company's strategic focus revolves around facilitating the transition to 100% clean energy for large corporations.
Furthermore, in April, Atlas announced a partnership with aluminum producer Albras for a 902 MW project in Paracatu, Minas Gerais. Atlas Renewable Energy operates under the umbrella of Energy Fund IV, established by Actis, a private equity firm specializing in energy sector investments.

Among all renewable energy technologies – including hydro, wind and biogas – solar PV was the “fastest-growing” sector and accounted for over one-third of the total renewable energy workforce (13.7 million), the report claimed.
IRENA.
China, home to a majority of the world’s PV manufacturing sector, recorded the most workers with 2.76 million. The country also retained a “commanding position” across the supply chain, from ingots and wafers to cells and modules, IRENA said in the report.
India employed the second largest number of workers, with 281,400 staffers, with on-grid solar estimated to have generated 201,400 jobs and another 80,600 in off-grid settings, the report stated. The US comprised the third-largest solar PV workforce in 2022 with 264,000 employees.
“Increasing solar PV installations in Brazil boosted employment in this industry to 241,000 jobs. Japan added less capacity in 2021 than the previous year. IRENA estimates its workforce at 127,000,” IRENA said in the report.
Europe accounted for roughly 11% of the solar PV industry’s total workforce with 540,000 workers in 2022. The report stated that the European Union experienced a “surge” in PV imports in the first half of 2022 due to the Ukraine crisis and subsequent efforts to reduce reliance on oil and gas imports. “However, installation rates trailed due to shortages of inverters and skilled labor, which subsequently slowed imports during the second half of the year,” according to the report.
Female representation in the solar industry was higher than any other renewable energy in 2022, with 40% of the workforce being female – twice as much as in wind, oil and gas sectors, the report claimed. However, women’s participation still falls “somewhat short” of the share of women employed in the overall economy.
Women’s employment in the industry was “uneven”, with females mostly hired for administrative positions (58%) followed by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (38%) and non-STEM technical positions (35%). Women accounted for 30% of managerial jobs and only 17% of the total senior management.

More “effective actions” – such as greater awareness, further national policies and better workplace practices – are needed to ease women’s entry into the industry and improve their career prospects, the report stressed.

Brazil-based Fortlev Solar has developed Lastro Solar, a patented polyethylene mounting structure for ground-mounted PV plants.
Eduardo Nascimento. Fortlev Solar's engineering manager, claimed that the technology can cut assembly times by 50% compared to metal-only structures.
“If compared to a metal-only structure, the Lastro Solar can reduce the assembly time by 50%,” Nascimento told pv magazine. “For example, the average installation time of a 100 kW array, with 185 modules, is 14 days. With Lastro Solar, this time is reduced to half of the time.”
Nascimento said that for a 100 kW array with 185 modules, the average installation time of 14 days can be halved with Lastro Solar's tech. The product weighs 15 kg, can be equipped with a tilt adjustment system, and is best suited for clear and rugged terrain.
The structure's mobility allows for relocating solar panels, offering flexibility in a dynamic business environment. Lastro Solar is constructed entirely from 100% polyethylene, a material used in Fortlev's water tank production. With over 30 years of experience in the market, Fortlev Solar aims to expand the accessibility of solar applications in Brazil.
The engineer in charge of creating Lastro Solar, Maurício Ouriques, said he tried to design a straightforward product that would be easy for anyone to install, by simplifying the process for customers as much as possible.
“Fortlev is one of the main manufacturers of water tanks in Brazil, which makes us specialists in the production of thermoplastics,” said Ouriques. “We are not adventuring. We believe in a quality product with the credibility that our group offers.”

Australian solar panel prices started to fall in June, but solar research firm Sunwiz says that the full consequences of the global supply glut have yet to become evident. Adding to this situation is the fact that major manufacturer Tongwei Solar, which mostly sells in Australia under the TW Solar brand, has blazed into the Australian market this year, shifting former market share dynamics.
Although Tongwei is an established company, it formerly had no presence in the Australian market and was largely focused on upstream solar manufacturing. It began seeking out Clean Energy Council approval for its own brand of panels in 2020, but has significantly ramped up its presence in 2023.
“Definitely the entrance of TW Solar in the market has shaken things up,” Sunwiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston told pv magazine Australia.
Despite being competitive in its pricing, it appears that TW Solar has actually carved out most of its market share from the premium side, said Johnston. Premium panel market share was previously sitting at around 20% and is now down around 10%, he noted.
However, Tongwei are “not the only ones knocking on the doors of Australians,” Johnston said, noting a recent uptick in manufacturers expanding into the Australian market.
“So there’s super cheap panels that are coming through and everyone will have to adjust their prices accordingly,” he said.
