And this is particularly true for materials in the organic PV space, where complex interactions within the material often hold back the performance of what could develop into low-cost, high-performance cells made from cheap and abundant materials.
A group of scientists led by Imperial College London has been hard at work on such methods for several years, first introducing its technique to generate “fast X-rays” back in 2018. More recently, scientists at the university began to apply this technique to research in the solar cell space, seeking to observe how individual particles behave as light hits them.
The insights gained from observations like these could open up new pathways for further investigation, and lead to rapid improvements in performance of organic PV (OPV) cells.
“OPVs are cheap and flexible alternatives to silicon-based photovoltaics, and so are an attractive prospect for use in future solar energy generation infrastructure,” said Imperial College physicist Jon Marangos. “This work demonstrates the power of our new time-resolved X-ray technique, which can now be applied to a wider range of materials and may provide the understanding needed for making more efficient OPV devices.”
The full details of the laser technique and observation of organic PV cells can be found in “Direct observation of ultrafast exciton localization in an organic semiconductor with soft X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy,” which was recently published in Nature Communications. The group fired a laser lasting 15 femtoseconds at the material to begin the mechanism by which it converts light into electricity, and followed this with a tiny x-ray pulse, lasting just a few attoseconds (millionths of a billionth of a second), which served to measure the changes in the material caused by the laser light pulse.
Their initial results show that changing the distance between chains of molecules in the material may be worth pursuing in future research, as well as demonstrating the technique’s effectiveness.
“This sensitivity of the time-resolved x-ray method to the initial electron dynamics occurring directly after excitation by light paves the way for new insights into the photophysics of a wide range of organic optoelectronic and other materials,” said Artem Bakulin, a scientist in Imperial College’s Department of Chemistry.
The group now plans to apply the technique to different organic PV modules known to have potential for much higher efficiency than has been achieved so far.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/16/battery-metals-how-quickly-can-supply-ramp-up/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 16, 2022",Battery metals: How quickly can supply ramp up?,"At the end of May, US investment bank Goldman Sachs rattled battery metal stocks, forecasting that the price of three key battery materials – cobalt, lithium, and nickel – are heading for a drop over the next two years, as investors have piled in too quickly.
The electrification of the transportation sector caused severe shortages in the lithium-ion battery market last year, leading to soaring raw material prices. But in its report, Goldman declared the battery metals bull market “over for now.”
It went on to explain that the surge in investor capital into supply investment, tied to the long-term EV demand story, has resulted in trading a spot-driven commodity as a forward-looking equity. “That fundamental mispricing has in turn generated an outsized supply response well ahead of the demand trend in focus,” the bank said.
Goldman expects current lithium prices of just under $54,000/ton to plunge to $16,372/ton in 2023. Meanwhile, cobalt prices will go down from around $78,500/ton now to an average of $59,500/ton next year. As for nickel, prices should remain relatively flat, going from $31,000/ton now to $30,250/ton next year. Over the rest of this year, however, Goldman expects a rally in nickel prices to $36,500/ton, after which it will head south.
Between 2022 and 2025, the analysts expect lithium supply to grow on average by 33% year on year, reflecting the ramp-up of new projects in Australia, China and Chile. Cobalt will rise by 14% year on year and nickel by 8% year on year, against annual demand growth rates of 27%, 11% and 7%, respectively.
Pushing back
But some industry observers, including London-based consultants Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, are loudly pushing back. They argue that Goldman’s forecast that a flood of new production will fill the supply deficit is far from likely. Instead, Benchmark believes that lithium market will remain in structural shortage until 2025.
“As the market wrestles between long-term supply security to fuel the lithium-ion economy, and increasingly market-led pricing mechanisms to incentivise supply growth, the era of lithium market volatility is likely just beginning,” Benchmark said in response to Goldman’s research note.
The consultancy goes on to outline five reasons why it feels Goldman’s call is wrong:
High waste
But regardless of the speed of expansion in the battery supply chain, there is a consensus that global cumulative capacity is set to grow at an unprecedented pace throughout the decade. According to US analyst Wood Mackenzie, global cumulative lithium-ion battery capacity could rise more than fivefold to 5,500 GWh between 2021 and 2030.
However, according to WoodMac's base case scenario, supply will not keep pace with demand until some point in 2023. One way to relieve pressure from the supply deficit of battery raw materials is recycling both scrap and end-of-life batteries.
According to WoodMac, current demand for key battery raw materials stands at 97 kilotonnes (kt) for lithium, 186 kt cobalt and 3,014 kt nickel. By 2030, these are expected to grow to 318 kt, 264 kt and 4,273 kt, respectively. However, supply from recycled materials are expected to reach 130 kt for lithium, 112 kt cobalt and 377 kt nickel by the end of the decade, the analyst finds.
Not easy
However, the challenges of recycling battery raw materials seem inhibiting at present. Firstly, recycling the cathode, which is rich in critical metals, is no easy business as it is overpackaged with pack materials such as casings, interconnects, cooling channels and others. Coupled with an industry push to use lower value materials, the move towards larger-sized EV packs is also a deterrence against recycling due to lower throughput, according to WoodMac.
Secondly, EV packs have long warranties and lifetimes. In addition, the emergence of second-use applications, like residential or industrial energy storage, will also keep end-of-life EVs from entering the recycling system.
As such, WoodMac believes recycling production scrap will be the main source of recycled material this decade. Globally, the analysts expects battery manufacturing capacity to grow 3.5 times to more than 4,621 GWh by 2030, with China leading the way. This presents an increasing market for production scrap.
“At the end of the day, the amount of production scrap or EVs coming to end of life will never be able to meet demand while demand continues to increase. There needs to be a push in expanding virgin sourcing while maximizing the recycling sector to ease the deficit,” says WoodMac research analyst Max Reid.

The decision aims to bring Ireland into line with the EU Solar Rooftops Initiative by making solar rooftop installation shorter and simpler. The proposals also pertain to certain non-domestic buildings, such as community and educational buildings, places of worship, health buildings, libraries and farms. 
“These draft regulations will help facilitate the rollout of rooftop solar energy across the country,” said Minister of State for Planning and Local Government Peter Burke. “They will enable individuals, communities, businesses and farms to play their part in creating a future fuelled by renewable energy and acting against climate change. They will help people and businesses to reduce their energy bills and increase Ireland’s energy security, a major challenge given developments in Europe and the need to rapidly reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels.”
The proposals 
Under the draft proposals, solar installations will be able to cover the entire roof of a house without planning permission, except for solar safeguarding zones. Wall-mounted and free-standing solar panel installations are also exempt from the requirement of obtaining planning permission, subject to a 25-square-meter area limit. 
“Houses, regardless of location, will soon be able to install solar panels on their roofs without any requirement for planning permission, which I know will be very welcome to many homeowners,” said Burke. “Draft proposals for community/educational/religious buildings will also give institutions such as schools a greater opportunity to reduce their energy bills. By proposing these increased exemptions, we are bringing exemptions into line with our renewables ambitions and helping people to play their part in climate action and to reduce their energy bills.”
The move will support Ireland's target of generating up to 380 MW of solar microgeneration (approximately 1 million panels) as part of the country's overall target of 2.5 GW of solar by 2030. 
In state-owned Eirgrid‘s “Shaping our electricity future” report, published in November 2021, the volume of small-scale, household and business solar arrays needed this decade was revised up from an initial estimate of 200 MW to 400 MW for the whole island, to 500 MW in EU member state Ireland and 100 MW in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.
The report stated that Ireland currently draws on renewables for around 40% of its electricity. It said the 70% target for 2030 is a minimum ambition, and could ramp up to 80%.
As part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, a public consultation is now open and will run until July 13.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/16/recycling-process-promises-better-than-new-silicon-wafers/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 16, 2022",Recycling process promises ‘better than new’ silicon wafers,"As the solar industry comes of age, dealing with the growing volume of products reaching end of life is already a research priority at universities and institutes the world over. Many different approaches are on trial, though experts are waiting until later this decade when the volume of products is expected to grow significantly, giving them room to experiment with processes at large scale.
Processing and purifying silicon from end-of-life cells back to a state where it can again be inserted back into the PV supply chain to make new cells has proven a major challenge here. It requires high levels of energy and a complex understanding of tiny impurities left in the recycled silicon that differ from brand new material.
Some already say that diverting this silicon to applications with lower purity requirements is the best solution. However, a group of scientists led by the Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion at the Chinese Academy of Sciences may have come up with an alternative – one that cuts out the energy-intensive ingot production stage entirely.
“Skipping the process of Si ingot production and wafer cutting can save approximately 40% of the cost of PV module production,” the group explained in its research. “Nonetheless, there is still a major challenge for the current technologies: regenerated solar cells from recovered Si wafers tend to exhibit a decreased conversion efficiency, which is not acceptable for the current competitive PV market.”
Recovery and upgrade
With this in mind, the group sought ways to recover silicon wafers suitable for production of high efficiency cells and modules. They demonstrated a series of chemical treatments that are shown to both purify wafers and improve their surface characteristics, making them suitable for use in new, high-efficiency cells. The process is described in full in “A systematically integrated recycling and upgrading technology for waste crystalline silicon photovoltaic module,” which was recently published in Resources, Conservation and Recycling.
The group took advantage of a process previously used by wafer manufacturers to reduce surface reflectivity and produce “black silicon” wafers.
“Through this technology, desirable and highly pure Si wafers with intact structure, minimally reduced thickness and excellent light-trapping ability are successfully obtained,” the group explained. “The properties of the reclaimed Si wafers are characterized and evaluated for new solar cell manufacturing and packaging, which encourages regenerated solar cells with higher power conversion efficiency than that of new commercial solar cells.”

The country generated 3,337 GWh of electricity, with solar production accounting for 8.2% of the total – the highest level ever recorded in the country.
However, solar still performed below its full potential in Portugal, taking fourth place among the most productive renewable energy sources. Wind was the leader, accounting for 25% of total generation, followed by hydro at 13% and biomass at 9.8%.
Renewable energy accounted for 56,3% of total electricity production, or 1,902 GWh, down 4.2% from May 2021. The decrease was mainly due to a decline in wind and hydro production, said the Portuguese Association of Renewable Energy (APREN). Renewable energy generation saved Portugal an estimated €274 million ($285.8 million) in natural gas imports in May, equal to or €215.20/MWh, according to APREN.
The impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the electricity market are also being felt throughout Portugal. The average price on the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) was €213.40/MWh between Jan. 1 and May 31 – four times higher than in the same period last year. Portuguese electricity consumption was fully powered by renewable energy for 56 non-consecutive hours during the first five months of 2022.
In May, the country’s electricity consumption was fully covered by renewable energy for 4.3 non-consecutive hours, and the average MIBEL price of electricity fell to €209.40/MWh. This was influenced by the joint policies of the Portuguese and Spanish governments to limit natural gas prices.

Tata Power’s solar EPC and manufacturing unit, Tata Power Solar, has commissioned a 66 MW solar project at an undisclosed location in India for Vibrant Energy.
The PV project is expected to produce 110,029 units of electricity per year. It is spread over 191 acres and features 127,268 solar modules. It was completed within nine months.
“The team established a two-level pooling substation on the undulating terrain, and the hard rock land was earthed to ensure the structural stability of the entire EHV (extra high-voltage) system,” said Tata Power. “Materials were directly unloaded at the workplace to avoid delays caused due to multiple shifting and to enable immediate regularization.’
The completion of the project brings Tata Power’s total utility-scale solar portfolio to 9.7 GWp.

AEMO suspended the spot market on June 15 from 2.05 p.m. (AEST) in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. The moves follow weeks of soaring prices, as price caps went into effect and generators withdrew massive amounts of capacity, plunging the national grid into mayhem.
It is the first time such a measure has been deployed across the national market. The decision was made after a crisis meeting between energy ministers, companies and regulators. AEMO said it had “determined that it is necessary to suspend the spot market in all regions … because it has become impossible to operate the spot market in accordance with the provisions of the [National Electricity] Rules.”
The suspension will be reviewed daily for each region. In terms of the economics of what happens now, AEMO said that generators will be offered a predetermined pricing schedule for each region. This amounts to one compensation scheme and it is expected to simplify things after the operator was forced into the more chaotic market direction mode this week.
AEMO CEO Daniel Westerman said the market operator was forced to direct 5 GW of generation through direct interventions this week. It was no longer possible to reliably operate the spot market or the power system this way, he added.
“In the current situation suspending the market is the best way to ensure a reliable supply of electricity for Australian homes and businesses,” said Westerman. “The situation in recent days has posed challenges to the entire energy industry, and suspending the market would simplify operations during the significant outages across the energy supply chain.”
The energy crisis that has descended across Australia’s east is the result of a number of events which have compounded one another. Firstly, fossil fuel prices have been soaring globally, pushing up the cost of generation. Likewise, a number of Australia’s aging fossil fleets have recently failed and are now out of action.
Fossil generators, which still dominate Australia’s electricity system, have benefited from the disparity between supply and demand as it has driven up prices. It has led a number of analysts, including Victoria Energy Policy Centre Director Bruce Mountain, to believe that generators have widely been “gaming” the system, or withholding much-needed capacity to fetch even higher prices.
New South Wales Energy Minister Matt Kean welcomed the move from AEMO.
“This decision will help prevent energy companies from putting energy reliability at risk by unnecessarily withdrawing supply,” Kean said. “This comes after the Australian Energy Regulator yesterday reminded generators of their obligations under the National Electricity Rules. I expect power companies to do the right thing by their customers and the country.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/16/solars-happy-place/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SPONSORED,CHINA",,"JUNE 16, 2022",Solar’s happy place,"While homeowners may feel the impact of rising energy price spikes, for businesses it is an ever-present concern. One Guangdong-based producer of stainless steel and alloy precision castings, which uses around 600,000 kWh of energy a month to run its processes, is just such a business exposed to rapidly rising electricity prices in the China market.
The real crunch for the manufacturer occurred last summer when, due to grid electricity shortages, it was only allowed to operate its factory three days a week, thereby reducing its production by more than half. Given these conditions, the company’s access to a substantial rooftop area made installation of a large solar system a no-brainer.
With the assistance of local engineering, procurement and construction specialists, Guangdong Weiyang Technology, the manufacturer, which prefers to remain anonymous, decided on a 2.6 MW system of Longi modules and 21 Growatt MAX 125KTL3-X LV inverters.
“A solar plant this size can generate an annual power output of about 2.8 million kWh, which accounts for one-third of the total electricity consumption of our factory,” the company told pv magazine.
The Chinese government modestly incentivizes PV installations by reducing limits on energy that a partly solar-driven commercial or industrial producer can draw from the grid. The combined effect of self-generation and a little boost in accessible grid power now allows the casting factory – which also produces metallic, plastic and rubber components, as well as molds for other manufacturers – “to restore production and run on a normal schedule,” said a company representative.
The use of high-quality solar equipment made upfront system costs a little higher than normal, but the owner says it’s worth it. “Longi is an international first-tier brand, and Growatt is both a local Guangdong enterprise providing outstanding service and a global leader in distributed solar inverters – these things provide us certain assurances.”
Engineered for large commercial and utility installations, the new Growatt MAX 125KTL3-X LV three-phase PV inverter features 10 fuse-free maximum power point trackers (MPPT) across 20 strings. It offers ultimate flexibility of system design and installation, taking into account partial shading where it occurs, and accommodates various module orientations, to achieve the highest energy yields. MAX by name and by design, its wide MPPT range of 180 V to 1,000 V means it can start work earlier in the day than many other inverters and finish later in the afternoon, maximizing daily output.
In this case, the solar installation is split across buildings, with conventional solar installed at an inclination on some existing roofs and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) used on three buildings.
The owners of the casting business inquired as to whether part of the installation might use a building integrated PV (BIPV) solution to enable extra warehousing space above the factory floor. Waterproof BIPV effectively creates a second roof on three of the buildings, which provides the company with storage in the space between the old and the new roofs.
“It was a special challenge,” said Zhanheng Lin, Guangdong Weiyang Technology’s project manager of the BIPV component. “It took a lot of time and communication between the project design team and the construction team.”
Aside from sometimes running into overtime to meet its quarterly production schedule, the manufacturer generally operates during the day – a production schedule that coincides with the available solar resource. Its solar system is intended to run on a self-generation for self-consumption basis, however surplus solar energy – as generated on holidays or on occasions when the manufacturer’s power consumption is lower than usual – can be exported to the grid.
“In southern China, the grid purchases electricity generated from solar at a relatively high price, currently CNY 0.453 ($ 0.071)/kWh,” said the manufacturer.
The combined effect of the feed-in tariff (FIT), the overall reduction in high-cost electricity purchased from the grid, and a restored production schedule, is that the company expects the sizable system to pay for itself in around five years.
Lin says that such C&I system sizes are not unusual in the southern manufacturing hub of Guangdong. He told pv magazine that 2.6 MW is considered medium-sized in the region, since many other companies have already switched to solar.
The third quarter of 2021 also marked the moment when Guangdong and several other provinces raised electricity prices by as much as 25% during peak hours. Shortages of coal to feed China’s coal-fired generation plants, combined with pressures to meet government emissions reduction targets are said to be behind the electricity rationing imposed on the country’s manufacturers.
Widespread rationing is designed to encourage the C&I sector to go off peak or go solar. “Given the current high electricity price and a power supply limited by the grid at peak times during summer, solar plants installed for self-consumption pay off even without government subsidies,” Lin said.
Our manufacturer has its own carbon-reduction ambitions, and says the 2.6 MW rooftop solar installation will reduce its annual emissions by about 2,700 tons of carbon dioxide – icing on the cake for a company that is essentially back in business after several challenging months.

The volume of grid-scale energy storage installations in the United States increased four times over that seen in the first quarter of 2021, setting a new record in the first quarter 2022. According to Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association’s (ACP) latest US Energy Storage Monitor report, grid-scale installations total 2,399 MWh.
“Quarter one of 2022 was the largest first quarter on record by far for grid-scale installations, a notable milestone since installations are typically back-weighted to the second half of the year. The West Coast and Southwest regions continue to dominate for both standalone and hybrid systems,” said Vanessa Witte, a senior analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team.
The record-setting growth occurred despite significant challenges in the industry. And those risks remain, including supply chain disruptions caused by the anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) solar tariff investigation initiated by the Department of Commerce (DOC) when the DOC said that it was launching an antidumping investigation into solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
“The Biden administration’s recent decision to pause AD/CVD solar tariffs for two years restores predictability to both the solar and energy storage markets. With well over 50% of utility storage projects being paired with solar farms, this important executive action will help the energy storage market continue to accelerate,” said John Hensley, vice president of research and analytics at ACP.
As battery costs drop and the need for resiliency amid grid fluctuations, residential storage was also on the rise, having its strongest quarter to date. The report estimates that 334 MWh were installed in the first quarter, improving on the previous quarterly record of 283 MWh in Q4 of last year. By 2026, the residential storage segment is forecast to grow by 5.7 GWh annually, driven in part by adoption in California in reaction to the proposed Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0.
“Despite challenging supply conditions continuing to suppress residential storage, the segment saw over 20,000 installations in a single quarter for the first time and we’re seeing large and small installers forge new vendor partnerships to help meet rising customer demand,” said Chloe Holden, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie.
AD/CVD-related procurement delays have slowed the non-residential storage market, which has been downgraded and predicted to grow 1 GW annually by 2026. “A meaningful share of residential solar-plus-storage projects not yet procured are being pushed to 2023, which has impacted paired storage,” Holden added.
Overall, the US energy storage market added 955 MW and 2,875 MWh across all segments in the first quarter of 2022.
“California continues to dominate the sector, with the Valley Center and Slate projects taking the top two spots for largest projects installed in Q1. We also saw more than 90 MW of storage come online outside the top seven states, including projects in Oregon and Alaska,” Witte said.
