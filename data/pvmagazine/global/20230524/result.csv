Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Joe Biden have signed a formal agreement that will see the two nations collaborate to develop solar, wind and storage technology, co-ordinate critical minerals supply, develop new battery technologies, and support emerging hydrogen markets. The pair signed the Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact during a bilateral meeting held on the sidelines of the annual Group of Seven Summit in Japan on the weekend.
“Australia and the US will deliver sustainable, resilient and secure critical minerals and clean energy technology to the world,” the two leaders said in a joint statement. “We intend to identify areas where Australia and the US can coordinate the development of our respective clean energy industrial bases, including but not limited to solar, wind, storage, and clean hydrogen materials and technologies.”
Albanese said the joint initiative is the “largest action by any country” to deal with climate change and to direct investment into the clean energy transformation. “And if we think about industries like hydrogen, without that support, there would be a massive incentive for hydrogen-based industries to be based in the US,” he said.
Albanese said the agreement will open up new opportunities for Australian manufacturers and suppliers and help address concerns that the impressive subsidies offered by the US Inflation Reduction Act will disadvantage Australian companies.
“So the big risk with the Inflation Reduction Act … is that you would see capital leave Australia to go to the United States. This is about addressing that. This is about creating an enormous opportunity for Australia,” he said.
A climate change action plan is to be developed by the end of the year and new ministerial-level dialogue will be established between Australia and the United States to encourage stronger industrial collaboration and accelerate progress towards net zero emissions.
Biden hailed the agreement as a “huge step forward” in the fight against the climate crisis, saying climate and clean energy has become the “third pillar” of the Australia-US alliance, alongside defense and economic co-operation.
“This contract can enable the expansion and diversification of clean energy supply chains, especially as it relates to critical materials,” said Biden.

The overall record for perovskite-silicon tandem cell efficiency is currently held by Stefaan De Wolf's group at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, which achieved 33.2% on a device measuring 1cm².
Translating high efficiencies to larger device sizes, produced using industrially compatible techniques is a key step in the commercialization of this technology. “Our latest efficiency achievement of 28.6% is more than 1.5% above our record set last year and exceeds our own roadmap plan of 1% annual increases,” said Chris Case, Chief Technology Officer, Oxford PV.
Oxford PV, founded in 2010 as a spinoff of Oxford University, produced the cell at its integrated production line in Brandenburg an der Havel, Germany, the same line where its 27% efficiency devices are made, the company said in a statement.
According to David Ward, Chief Executive Officer, Oxford PV, the milestone showcases the company’s technology and talent but efforts toward commercialization continue. “While we continue to innovate on our perovskite-on-silicon technology on small research-sized solar cells, much of our focus has been on improving our commercial-sized cells for the market, ramping up production, and working with our solar module partners to prepare them for assembly into solar panels,” says Ward. “Our team has made excellent progress during 2023 and our innovative solar cells are close to being in the hands of our module-manufacturing customers.”

LevelTen Energy says it will offer PPAs through a series of auctions, with the aim of making such deals faster and easier to finalize.
PPAs typically take 12 months to execute, and the longer the process, the higher the risk of deal failure, according to LevelTen. In 2022, 20% of PPAs being negotiated failed to materialize, based on a survey of European developers.
Seattle-based LevelTen aims to streamline the PPA process by connecting experienced developers and motivated buyers. Developers can initiate a PPA auction by working with LevelTen to establish PPA terms that align with current market conditions.
LevelTen's network of buyers, including corporations and energy advisors, will have access to the PPA offerings. Developers can also invite their own buyer networks to participate.
Buyers show their interest by submitting an offer, along with key details like credit rating and PPA experience.
Once an offer is selected, the parties can proceed to close the deal. Disagreements over price and contract terms were cited by developers as the main reasons for failed deals, according to Flemming Sørensen, vice president Europe for LevelTen Energy.
In 2022, European companies contracted 6.6 GW, equivalent to 11% of new solar and wind capacity. LevelTen's platform, including the LevelTen Energy Marketplace, offers access to over 4,500 power purchase agreement price offers across 28 countries in North America and Europe.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/24/tongwei-solar-launches-new-breakthrough-tnc-and-thc-modules/,"SPONSORED,CHINA,WORLD",,"MAY 24, 2023",Tongwei Solar launches new breakthrough TNC and THC modules,"The solar industry is presently experiencing turbulence due to variations in silicon wafer sizes, module types, and technological approaches, and in this context, n-type modules are rising in popularity. Recognizing this technology’s improved performance value, Tongwei Solar has unveiled two new products: the TNC-182 module with optimized size and rectangular silicon wafer cell technology and the silver-free 210-THC module. Both new arrivals will enjoy higher power along with lower balance-of-system (BOS) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
Tongwei’s existing pilot-scale production line for its independently developed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) TNC (Tongwei N-passivated Contact Cell) technology has achieved an efficiency of 25.7%. In terms of mass production, the conversion efficiency of the TNC cells has exceeded 25.5%. The TNC cells feature high bifaciality, ultra-low attenuation, improved temperature coefficient, and an enviable weak light response. Tongwei Solar's current 182 mm, 72 half-cell module has a power of 588 W, which is 25-30 W higher than PERC, and 10% higher in bifaciality. The company’s new TNC-182 innovates on the 182-72 version and designs for optimal cell and module sizes. The power of the new module versions is further increased by 25-30 W and can now exceed 600 W.
Tongwei Solar has been working on THC technology since 2018, and by March 2023, the mass production efficiency of Tongwei's first GW-level production line in China had reached a level of 26.18% (certified by ISFH). The newly unveiled 210-THC modules feature multiple technological breakthroughs, including the adoption of silver-free technology, ultra-thin silicon wafer technology, bifacial microcrystal technology, high-performance target doping, and light injection. The substitution of silver with copper electroplating further narrows the cost gap with PERC modules. Tongwei Solar’s new 210-THC module series enjoys a lower temperature coefficient and higher bifaciality, which can further increase power generation and achieve lower LCOE. Tongwei is expected to realize large-scale production of its THC modules soon.
In line with the global goal of “carbon neutrality,” Tongwei Solar is further expanding its production capacity and shipment targets, striving to achieve 300,000 tons of high-purity crystalline silicon shipments, 70 GW of cell shipments (including self-use), and 35 GW of module shipments.
Tongwei Solar’s module manufacturing capacity is expected to reach 80 GW by the end of 2023.

Last year, China exported 154 GW of modules, with Europe remaining the top market, accounting for a 56% share. Chinese modules were also 57% cheaper than those produced in the United States and the European Union, according to Wood Mackenzie.
The upward trend continues, with Europe importing approximately 29.5 GW of Chinese modules in the first quarter of this year, based on information obtained by pv magazine. Wafer shipments rose 44% to 41 GW, while solar cell exports exceeded 24 GW. Southeast Asia secured 31% of the cells manufactured in China.
“US tariffs on Chinese-made modules have driven module production to Southeast Asia, where many manufacturing facilities import cells from China,” said Wood Mackenzie.
The report's authors noted that the cost advantage of Chinese companies challenges offshoring policies in the United States, the European Union, and India. China's wafer and cell export capacity is expected to surpass 230 GW by 2026, exceeding global demand outside of China. By 2026, China's available module export capacity is projected to gradually increase to 149 GW.
“The US is counting on the [Inflation Reduction Act], which will allocate at least $41 billion to stimulate domestic manufacturing. But costs still favour imported modules, and even as more local module production comes online in coming years, there will be persistent dependence on imports of components from Asia,” said Alex Whitworth, research director for Wood Mackenzie. “In Europe, the EU is advocating trade restrictions to secure local PV manufacturing but lacks specific policies to propel capacity build‑outs and displace imports. India also has great ambitions to expand its PV manufacturing, but financial support is insufficient to reach aggressive targets.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/24/five-junction-iii-v-solar-cell-with-35-1-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 24, 2023",Five-junction III-V solar cell with 35.1% efficiency,"Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have successfully developed a five-junction (5J) solar cell using an inverted metamorphic (IMM) design. The cell incorporates subcells made of aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP), aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs).
Junhua Long, the corresponding author of the research, expressed optimism about the commercial viability of the cell's configuration. “We haven't estimated the cell costs yet, but its configuration may be suitable for commercial production,” he told pv magazine.
Utilizing metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), the researchers fabricated a 12 cm2 device featuring an AlGaInP-AlGaAs-GaAs-InGaAs-InGaAs structure. Each subcell possesses a specific bandgap energy, with values of 2.0 eV, 1.67 eV, 1.42 eV, 1.18 eV, and 0.83 eV, respectively.
The scientists highlighted the cell's surface root-mean-square roughness of 13.5 nm, explaining its significance in reducing dislocation slip obstacles and minimizing defect density in the active region.
“So the lower the epilayer surface roughness, the better the quality of mismatch growth epilayer,” they saud.
To address stress-related issues, the Chinese researchers employed low-temperature bonding techniques, effectively reducing stress-induced defects on the epitaxial materials. Furthermore, they applied an anti-reflecting coating (ARC) composed of titanium oxide and aluminum oxide (TiOx/Al2O3) using electron beam evaporation.
The 5J solar cell, evaluated under standard illumination conditions, achieved notable performance metrics. It recorded a power conversion efficiency of 35.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 4.727 V, a short-circuit current density of 860 mA/m2, and a fill factor of 86.38%.
The scientists attributed the exceptional performance of the large-size 5J solar cell to the low number of mismatch dislocations in the material and the simplicity of the flexible device's fabrication process.
They introduced the solar cell in “The fabrication of flexible and large-size inverted metamorphic five-junction solar cells,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The team includes academics from the University of Science and Technology of China and Chinese company Tianjin San'an Optoelectronics.
“The successful fabrication of the large-size flexible 5J IMM solar cells not only promotes the further improvement of the photoelectric conversion efficiency of multi-junction solar cells but also can further expand the possible application,” they concluded.

Oregon-based Origami Solar won the grand prize in the US Department of Energy’s American-Made Solar Prize 2022 competition. The patent-pending steel frame is said to lower costs and improve module performance. The company says the frames are made of “green” recycled steel.
Origami Solar was founded by Eric Hafter and Jack Patton to try to bring innovation and cost reduction to solar module production. The founders noticed that in 20 years, the cost of other module components had come down, but not that of the aluminum frames, which had become a significant part of the cost.
Hafter and Patton were also concerned about the greenhouse gases that result from aluminum manufacturing, so instead they looked at recycled steel. According to Origami Solar, using aluminum for module frames contributes more than ten times the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than its steel frames. The company said emissions are 14 kg of per 1 kg of aluminum, whereas steel production results in about 1.2 kg of GHGs for every 1 kg of steel. Recycled steel produces even less GHGs.
“Our Gen 2 frames are lighter, stronger and ideally suited to provide superior support to the new large-format modules coming to market,” said Gregg Patterson, CEO of Origami Solar. “In collaboration with steelmakers and precision roll formers, we have designed the Origami steel module frame to match the fit, form and function of industry-standard frames, making the transition from aluminum to steel seamless for module manufacturing and field installation.”
After working on the process for 12 years, Origami Solar developed a patent-pending frame design that is manufacturable using a steel roll forming process. The company reports that the frames meet structural requirements and have a projected module lifespan of 30 years.

This notion is wrong. Solar PV, wind, and other renewable energy technologies are available for large-scale electricity production with low or no direct GHG emissions. The transport sector, which is responsible for 23% of GHG emissions, is almost entirely based on fossil fuels, and has fewer alternatives.
Transportation represents some 27% of the world’s secondary energy consumption (21% of primary), grows by 1% per year on average, and is almost exclusively fueled by petroleum. Could biofuels play an important role in addressing both the GHG emissions of transport and the dependency on petroleum?
Currently marketed, first-generation biofuels represent only around 3% of global road transport fuels and therefore cannot be regarded as a transition technology. This limited penetration of first-generation biofuels is due in part to the potential competition with food crops and market prices (sugar versus ethanol prices in international markets).
Concerns that these technologies are falling short of expectations have led to the development of second-generation (cellulosic ethanol, biomass-to-liquids, pyrolysis oil, dimethyl ether) and third-generation biofuel technologies (algal-biodiesel, biofuels from third-generation processes), which still need to be scaled up in order to become cost-competitive.
With the exception of sugarcane ethanol, traditional biofuels have severe disadvantages that are related to the feedstock. The current costs of rapeseed biodiesel and ethanol from cereals or beets are much higher than the costs of gasoline and diesel, and substantial subsidies are needed to make them competitive. These high costs are a result of the low net energy yield of most annual crops (100–200 GJ/ha per year in the long term), the high-quality agricultural land required, and the intensive management requirements. For comparison, typical insolation is 50,000 GJ/ha per year and typical solar PV panel electrical output is 10,000 GJ/ha per year. The very low energy productivity per hectare of biofuels, coupled with their high requirements for fertilizers, pesticides, and water, severely limits the well-to-wheel reduction of fossil energy use, which in turn limits the environmental benefits. The net energy of perennial crops (220–550 GJ/ha per year), grasses (220–260 GJ/ha per year), and sugar cane (500–650 GJ/ha per year) is somewhat higher (but still miserable compared with solar PV).
Brazil has been a world leader in promoting biofuels for over 30 years under its Proalcool program. Mandates for large-scale blending of biofuels into vehicle fuels have appeared in several other countries in recent years, nationally driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, but probably also reflecting the desire of agricultural companies for production subsidies.
In the long term, however, it can be argued that biofuels will play a transitional role toward electric vehicles, decarbonization, and solar electricity generation. In terms of energy conversion efficiency, biofuels for transportation can be largely disregarded as a transition technology. A direct comparison between sugar cane ethanol coupled with flex-fuel cars, and sunlight-to-electricity (PV) conversion + electric cars is illustrated in the following figure.

A 1 ha (100 m x 100 m) sugar cane plantation will yield from 7,000-8,000 L of ethanol per year, allowing a medium size flex-fuel car to drive about 54,000 km/year in a best-case scenario. If the same area is covered with a dense array of low-tilt commercially available solar PV modules at 20% conversion efficiency and a moderate 1,500 kWh/kWp per year energy yield, the electricity produced over 1 year on the same 1 ha will allow the electric version of the same medium-size car to drive over 18 million km/year (about 350 times more!). The reasons for this overwhelming difference are the fact that solar PV conversion is 50-100 times more efficient than typical photosynthesis efficiency, and also the fact that the efficiency of electric motors is about three times more than internal combustion engines.
Global battery electric vehicle sales (excluding hybrids) are about 10% of light vehicle sales and growing by about 50% per year. This points to the likelihood that half of vehicle sales will be battery-electric by 2026, and that most vehicles on the road will be battery electric by 2040 as the current fossil-fueled fleet grows old and retires. Vehicles fueled by biofuels and hydrogen have a negligible market share.
In the low-moderate latitude countries of the sunbelt, where 80% of the global population lives, rooftop PV can supply most of the electricity needs of dwellings on an annual basis. Rooftop PV can also cover the additional electricity needs represented by a new fleet of electric vehicles. A kilowatt-rated rooftop PV system can drive an electric vehicle about 8,000 km per year.
Biofuels suffer from irredeemably low conversion of solar energy into useful energy, as well as competing with food production for land, water, pesticides, and fertilizers. Basic physics and economics doom the notion that bioenergy can play a significant role in global energy systems.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/24/pvel-releases-ninth-edition-of-pv-module-reliability-scorecard/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 24, 2023",PVEL releases ninth edition of ‘PV Module Reliability Scorecard’,"PVEL, an independent test lab for the downstream solar industry, has published its “2023 PV Module Reliability Scorecard.” This year’s edition names 250 model types of PV modules from 35 manufacturers as “top performers” in PVEL’s testing – the most in the company’s history.
The report summarizes results from the PV Module Product Qualification Program (PQP), a testing regime established by PVEL in 2012 to provide empirical data for PV module benchmarking and project-level energy yield and financial models.
Now in its ninth edition, the report provides more than just module testing, while its current iteration includes additional factors such as frames, glass, cells, backsheets, encapsulants and junction boxes. In the backsheet category, for example, 24 backsheet models were tested, 47% of which used a backsheet and 53% used rear glass to cover and protect the back of modules.
In terms of module technologies, p-type PERC is still the dominant technology across the “top performers,” TOPCon is also rising to the top. This year there are 37 TOPCon model types listed as “top performers,” up from just one in 2022. Heterojunction (HJT) is also on the rise, with nine HJT modules rated as a Top Performer, compared to just two last year.
“Solar technology and the manufacturer landscape continue to evolve rapidly, and with module supply issues persisting, buyers need guidance on how to procure the best possible modules for their projects,” said Tristan Erion-Lorico, VP of sales and marketing at PVEL. “Our 2023 Scorecard features a truly global list of module manufacturers. For buyers worldwide looking to understand the critical differences across cell technologies and module designs, our Scorecard provides many key insights and an easy way to search through the best commercially available options for developers.”
