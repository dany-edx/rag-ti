https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/03/perovskite-stability-and-the-effects-of-defects/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,SPAIN,SWEDEN,SWITZERLAND",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 3, 2021","Perovskite stability, and the effects of defects","Perovskite solar cells are well known for their high-efficiency potential and low-cost production. Solving the issues of long-term stability and sensitivity to moisture and other ambient atmosphere conditions, without hampering efficiency, will be a major step towards improving solar cell and module performance, and scientists have presented a wealth of different approaches to achieving this.
Many of these rely on additives to the perovskite precursor materials that serve to strengthen the crystalline structure, but in some cases can also harm its efficiency in generating energy. Now, a group of scientists led by the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2), and Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne discovered an organic compound known as 3-phosphono propionic acid (H3pp), which served to greatly improve device stability with no observable effects on its solar performance.
The group fabricated complete perovskite solar cells based on a mixture of methylammonium, formadinum, and cesium, as well as lead and iodine. These cells achieved initial efficiencies of around 21%. When tested for 1,000 hours under “one-sun” illumination, the cells fabricated with H3pp retained close to 100% of their initial performance, while control cells without the additive suffered more than 20% performance loss.
Further analysis of the cells showed that the additive served to passivate ‘shallow’ defects in the material – creating strong hydrogen bonds that essentially block ion migration that can cause degradation in the material. Deeper defects that assist in cell performance, meanwhile, were left untouched. “The H3pp additive strongly bonds to the perovskite… via two types of hydrogen bonds (H.IandO.H), passivating shallow point defects,” the researchers explain. “Given that the passivation does not occur through deep defects, the non-radiative recombination is not mitigated, and the device performance (Voc and efficiency) remains unaffected by the presence of the H3pp additive.”
The devices and methods used to characterize them are described in the paper Decoupling the effects of defects on efficiency and stability through phosphonates in stable halide perovskite solar cells, published in Joule.
Beyond demonstrating this impressive device performance, the group hopes its research will help to improve understanding of different defect types that exist in a perovskite material, the characteristics they are responsible for, and ways to influence one without affecting another. Halide perovskites are “soft” ionic electronic conductors with a strong ionic component, which now, thanks to the results of this work, can be associated to shallow point defects. “This research provides new relevant information about the impact of defects in halide perovskite solar cells that will certainly help disentangle the effects of distinct defects on the different properties of the devices,” the group concludes.

French renewable energy developer GreenYellow, a unit of the Casino Group, has been awarded a €21 million loan by Dutch development bank FMO for its solar power plant in Nagréongo, Burkina Faso.
The money will be given in three tranches of €7.9 million, €7 million, and €6.1 million, by FMO's Fund for Access to Energy. “We look forward to contributing to a substantial increase in production capacity from renewable resources in Burkina Faso, at lower costs,” said Huub Cornelissen, director of energy at FMO.
This project is the second of four solar power plants that FMO is financing in Burkina Faso. The two partners want long-term collaboration for future projects on the African continent or in other geographies. “The signing of this project with FMO supports our ambitions in Africa, a strategic market in renewable energies where we continue to strengthen our presence in the IPP segment,” said Robinson Alazraki, Africa director of GreenYellow.
Launched last fall, the Nagréongo power station, located about 30km northeast of Ouagadougou and scheduled for commissioning at the end of 2021, will have an installed capacity of 30 MW. With an annual production of 50 GWh, it will save 27,500 tons of CO2 per year.
Initiated within the framework of public-private partnerships signed with the state of Burkina Faso in 2019, the solar power plant will supply all the electricity it produces to national utility Sonabel. Entirely developed and built by GreenYellow, which will operate and maintain it, this plant will be the largest in GreenYellow's portfolio.
Burkina Faso had only 62 MW of solar generation capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. However, large PV projects are taking shape in the West African state, such as the 30 MW plant that Axpo Group business Urbasolar began constructing near Pâ in February and two solar plants totaling 30 MW under construction by Engie.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/03/giant-electric-boiler-energized-by-wind-and-solar-in-the-netherlands/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 3, 2021",Giant electric boiler energized by wind and solar in the Netherlands,"Swedish energy company Vattenfall has announced it has secured a building permit and subsidies granted by the Dutch government under the SDE+ program, for a 150 MW electric boiler planned to be located at an existing gas power plant in Diemen, near Amsterdam.
“The final investment decision is scheduled for mid-2022, after the recently initiated tender has been completed,” the company said in a statement.
The huge boiler, which Vattenfall described as a sort of kettle, will convert electricity into heat and supply water to households in Amsterdam and its surrounding areas. “The E-boiler only switches on if the electricity mix is sustainable, with a lot of electricity from solar and wind,” the company said, without specifying the threshold of solar and wind production above which the mix would be considered sustainable. “When there is insufficient green energy, the gas-fired power plants in Diemen are still needed to produce electricity – power plants that also supply heat very efficiently.”
The boiler will also be able to store heat in a special buffer included in its design, which the company described as a large thermal flask. “In this way, we prevent additional use of the installations [of] natural gas and, therefore, unnecessary emissions of CO2 and nitrogen,” Vattenfall further explained. The heat buffer is 50 meters high, 26 meters wide, and has a volume of 22,000m3. Hot water up to 125 degrees Celsius can be stored there under pressure and then used for district heating. 
The dimensions of the boiler building are approximately 20x30m and the maximum height of the building will be approximately 15m. One E-boiler will have a diameter of approximately 3.5m and a height of 6.5m. The building will have room for three e-boilers.
The electric boiler should supply approximately 15% of the heat in the Amsterdam region, according to the Swedish group. “However, the number of hours that the E-boiler can run will increase in the coming years, given the growth in the number of wind and solar farms in the Netherlands,” it further explained, noting that the facility may also provide support to the electricity grid by keeping the supply and demand of electricity in balance.
Several attempts are currently being made in the Netherlands to link excess solar and wind power with heating applications. The Dutch association of national and regional electricity and gas network operators, Netbeheer Nederland, is leading a plan to deploy up to 2 million hybrid heat pumps by 2030.
Furthermore, Dutch transmission system operator Tennet, which also serves Germany, said in January, it was planning to create flexible electricity demand and reduce grid congestion by promoting the use of smarter heating systems and heat pumps that can also be powered by solar and wind energy.

The Kahone Solaire SA and Kael Solaire SA plants have capacities of 35 MW and 25 MW, respectively, and are located in the regions of Kaolack and Diourbel, in the central part of the country.
Both projects were built under the Scaling Solar program led by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is a member of the World Bank. The Scaling Solar initiative aims to create viable markets for solar power in the developing world with the IFC as principal transaction advisor.
Engie built the projects with French investment firm and asset manager Meridiam, and Fonsis, Senegal’s sovereign strategic investment fund, which have 40% and 20% stakes, respectively, in the special purpose vehicle owning the two facilities, with Engie owning the remaining 40%.
The two plants will sell power to the local grid under a 25-year PPA at a price of XOF25/kWh ($0.046).
Including two more 30 MW solar parks, called Senergy and the Ten Merina, the three companies own and operate four solar plants in Senegal totaling 120 MW, which they claim represent more than 50% of the country’s solar capacity.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the African country had approximately 155 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020.

The latest edition of the annual report cites figures which demonstrate non-state-owned fossil fuel companies are pulling away from exploration in favor of exploiting their existing reserves. With companies such as BP, Total, Shell and Eni pledging to ramp up clean energy spending to placate activist investors, market developments accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic appear to point to the fact the oil and gas majors could be on the retreat from fossil fuels.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth
The International Energy Agency (IEA) study notes the reserves held in the Middle East will enable state-owned players there to pick up the slack – and market share – in the short term, as demonstrated by ambitious liquefied natural gas investment plans announced by Qatar. Even in Qatar, though, the effects of the energy transition are acknowledged by the fact plans to develop new deposits have been accompanied by a big commitment to invest in carbon capture, use and storage, in a year the IEA predicts could be pivotal for the as-yet unproven technology, which would offer fossil fuel majors more time to adapt.
Back on the solar beat, the IEA document said the technology was eclipsed by the progress of rival intermittent renewable power source wind last year, with the volume of annual generation capacity added almost doubling from 60 GW in 2019 to 114 GW last year, with 70 GW of the fleet arriving in China and more than 15 GW in the U.S.
Solar companies can take solace from the IEA's prediction PV spending will surpass wind investment this year, with a rise of more than 10% in China, the U.S. and Europe, following a year which saw new PV generation capacity deployment rise almost 25%, to nearly 135 GW.
Even in markets where large scale solar retreated, there was an uptick in small scale installations, with the IEA pointing to Vietnam, where the winding down of a large scale incentive program was counterbalanced by rooftop arrays – with 9 GW added.
With the report estimating total energy spending will rebound almost 10% to $1.9 trillion this year – including $530 billion for new generation capacity of which 70% will be devoted to clean power – the IEA said record levels of sustainable debt and green bond issuance last year mean there is plenty of cash available for renewables, but not enough high-quality projects or dedicated channels to ensure it translates into panels – or turbines – on the ground.
The document reported battery storage investment rose almost 40% last year, to $5.5 billion, with grid scale facilities accounting for a 60% rise as the U.S. and China added 1 GW of capacity. The report did not give a megawatt-hour volume for the new capacities deployed, but did note battery costs fell an average 20% during 2020.
Low-carbon hydrogen spending also hit record levels last year with the report stating $70 million worth of electrolyzers came online although the majority of them will “run on grid electricity, at least initially.”
Storage and green hydrogen also accounted for a healthy chunk of the venture capital funding which flowed into start-up energy companies, notably in the U.S. and Europe. The fact more cautious institutional investors are starting to have exposure to such innovative companies in their portfolios, according to the IEA report, could be another indicator of lean times ahead for the fossil fuel industry.
The message from the IEA on energy sector R&D investment, though, was the same as for overall global spending levels: While there are encouraging signs in the nascent post-Covid recovery, not nearly enough is being done to keep the world on track for less than two degrees Celsius of global heating, let alone sub-1.5 C.
This copy was amended on 08/06/21 to incorporate IEA clarification the volume of wind capacity added almost doubled from 2019 to 2020, rather than the cumulative global capacity.

The solar plants will be built near the municipalities of Wognum, Abbekerk, Medemblik, and Middenmeer. They are being developed under the Regional Energy Strategy Noord-Holland Noord (RES) energy-transition program. The four on-ramps and off-ramps of the A7 will be the first to host PV installations, the agency said.

Rijkswaterstaat said the solar parks will be installed on residual spaces along the highway, larger areas near the road, and within junctions and connections. It did not provide any additional details about the projects.
It also plans to build a large-scale solar plant along Highway 35 in the northeastern Netherlands, and a solar park along the A37 in Drenthe province. Shell also plans to install 48 MW of solar capacity near Rijksweg 59, a highway that spans the provinces of Zeeland, South Holland and North Brabant.

The potential for Dutch highways to host solar has been highlighted since October 2017, when construction contractor Heijmans announced plans to install noise barrier-integrated bifacial solar modules along several major roads. Its first project, finalized in February 2020, was a 400-meter stretch of the A50 near the town of Uden.
In July 2017, the Rijkswaterstaat announced plans to develop clean energy capacity on bodies of water and public land. In September 2018, it also revealed plans to test the feasibility of solar roads as an alternative to conventional ground-mounted solar projects.
“Finding space for the generation of solar energy requires creativity,” the agency said at the time.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/03/albanias-first-floating-pv-plant-is-now-operational/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ALBANIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 3, 2021",Albania’s first floating PV plant is now operational,"Norwegian energy company Statkraft has completed construction on the first 500 kW portion of a 2 MW floating PV project it is developing in Albania.
The first section of the plant was built with 1,536 solar panels, provided by an unnamed manufacturer, and floating membranes supplied by Norwegian specialist Ocean Sun.
“The main technical challenge has been the unorthodox and revolutionary installation method,” Ocean Sun CEO Børge Bjørneklett told pv magazine. “PV installers have always learned not to step on the panels and that is, of course, true when the panel is fixed with the typical four-point clamps and walking on them creates big deflection and mechanical stress in the cells.” According to him, when this happens it may lead to micro-cracking and premature degradation, especially for modules with a polymer backsheet that has relatively low stiffness.
Bjørneklett also explained that, when the panels rest flat on the membrane, it is possible to walk on the dual glass modules since the load is evenly distributed across the surface and there is very little stress on the glass and cells. “The stress localization is completely different, due to the hydrostatic pressure on the back side of the module,” he added. “We have conducted a lot of tests checking power output over time but also more elaborate testing with electroluminescence imaging in the lab.”
Ocean Sun also conducted a detailed, non-linear, finite element analysis of dynamic walking on the panels and the special cooling effect that is obtained via direct heat conduction through the membrane. “This is definitely more effective than the normal air cooling,” Bjørneklett stated.
According to Statkraft, the project is expected to continue its second implementation phase during the second half of 2021, when three more 500 kW floating units will be installed. “After the start of commercial operations of our Banja and Moglice hydropower plants, we are looking into further optimizing these renewable assets,” said Rigela Gegprifti, Statkraft’s country head in Albania. “The Banja Floating Solar Plant is a concrete example for further integration of different resources of renewable energy.”
The 2 MW floating project is being built at a reservoir linked to the Statkraft Banja HPP 72 MW hydropower plant. It will likely sell power to the grid under a regulated tariff. PV projects up to 2 MW in size capacity are eligible for a feed-in tariff under Albanian regulations. However, it is unclear under which criteria the ministry is approving projects.

The New South Wales Government announced on Thursday the registrations of interest (ROI) process for the planned 8 GW New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) was open with proponents of new wind, solar and energy storage capacity urged to register their interest.
Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean said the State Government has committed $78.9 million to support the development of the New England REZ, with the northern NSW city of Armidale at its centre, set to become Australia’s largest renewable energy zone.
“The New England REZ is a fundamental part of our Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap and we expect it will deliver up to 8,000 megawatts of new capacity, $10.7 billion in private investment, around 830 operational jobs and 1,250 construction jobs to the local economy,” he said in a statement.
“Now is the time for all energy infrastructure proponents to register their interest as we take the first vital steps to deliver the New England Renewable Energy Zone.”
The New England REZ is one of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW Government’s electricity Roadmap, which is forecast to support more than $32 billion of private investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, Illawarra and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.
The Central-West Orana REZ, which is tipped to deliver 3 GW of renewable energy, was the first of the REZs to be launched with the call for registrations of interest last year attracting 113 registrations, totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion.
The New England region has already attracted a host of large-scale wind and solar projects, including the Walcha Energy Project, a 4 GW wind, solar and pumped hydro energy storage hub put forward by Energy Estate and its partners.
Joint venture UPC/AC Renewables Australia has achieved financial close for the first 400 MW stage of the New England Solar Farm while Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) is progressing with the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm.
Member for Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall welcomed the launch of the ROI process, claiming New England has some of the best natural energy resources in the country.
“The ROI will help ensure the design and delivery of the REZ reflects the unique features of our region, and protects our precious local assets, such as our highly productive agricultural land,” he said.
The ROI is expected to provide vital information for the planning of the New England REZ including the estimated investment value, location and types of projects looking to connect. Early forecasts indicate it will deliver 6,300 construction and 2,800 ongoing jobs, mostly in regional NSW.
“The registration of interest process will help the government understand the scale, location and types of projects considering joining the New England renewable energy zone,” Marshall said.
“The information provided will support technical design, planning and further market engagement on the zone.”
The call for registrations of interest in the New England REZ will close on July 16, 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/03/nano-micro-scale-cooler-technique-for-solar-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GREECE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 3, 2021",Nano-micro-scale cooler for solar modules,"Scientists from the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH) in Greece have developed a solar module cooling technique based on radiative cooling and micro-scale patterning.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from its environment and less than the energy it radiates. When this happens, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
Presented in the study Combined nano and micro structuring for enhanced radiative cooling and efficiency of photovoltaic cells, published in scientific reports, the novel system consists of a thin glass radiative cooler designed in nano- and micro-scaled periodic patterns. This device, according to the researchers, can be placed on top of a solar cell to reduce its operating temperature and, at the same time, achieve high optical transparency and high thermal emission.
The coating is based on a two-dimensional subwavelength nanostructured grating, which is imprinted in soda-lime glass and has enhanced mid-infrared emissivity, and a micro-structured grating. “The microscale patterning enhances cooler’s performance in the atmospheric transparency window while the nanopatterning further enhances the optical radiation absorption,” the academics explained. “The combined enhancement is possible because the emissivity enhancement provided by the micro-grating in the thermal wavelengths is not affected by the nano-grating and vice versa.”
The two gratings can be manufactured through laser-induced structuring. “Due to the nature of laser-processing technology, the patterned surfaces can be easily scaled up to large areas that could be used to enhance the light-harvesting in solar cells,” the research team emphasized, adding that the gratings can be realized not only as binary devices but also with appropriate structures of different shapes.
A silicon nitride (Si3N4) anti-reflective coating was also placed on top of the wafer to increase absorptivity. “When we place the nano-micro-grating coating on top of this structure, it results in a higher Si solar absorption of around 0.92%,” the academics further explained. This was achieved, according to them, without increasing the complexity of the cell design.
When the thin radiative cooling coating was placed on top of a silicon wafer, sunlight absorption in silicon increased by around 25.4%. “Temperature reduction and efficiency enhancement was also achieved when we applied the proposed cooler in realistic Si-based solar cells,” the Greek team added.  The temperature decrease provided by the nano-micro-grating coating compared to the bare doped silicon was found to be approximately up to 5.8 degrees Celsius.
When it was tested on a commercial solar cell, the cooling technique was found to improve its yield by around 3.0%. “Thus, our findings can significantly impact the PV industry, as well as other radiative cooling applications,” the scientists concluded.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from France's Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon (INL), the Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/03/ihsm-clean-energy-insights-high-module-prices-and-shipping-costs-jeopardize-2021-installation-outlook/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JUNE 3, 2021",IHSM clean energy insights: High module prices and shipping costs jeopardize 2021 installation outlook,"IHS Markit currently maintains its 181 GW installation forecast for 2021. Our down case scenario for 2021 is 156 GW (down case still 9% growth Y-o-Y) with demand spill over to 2022 and uneven impact of higher costs across different markets.
The current environment poses a significant threat, but it is too early to tell what the consequences will be since the solar industry has faced other crisis before (e.g. COVID-19 in 2020) and showed extreme resilience and continued growth despite all challenges.
The price on module raw materials started to rise in July 2020 and has significantly impacted module costs from Q4 2020. Market expectation was that production costs would decline from the second quarter of 2021, dropping module quote prices, but we have seen just the opposite. The supply chain is experiencing further price peaks for some materials in Q2 2021 including polysilicon, copper, or steel, among others. The rise of raw materials is putting additional pressure on module makers who are only passing part of this higher cost into customers and adjusting utilization rates to control the rise of materials due to an overheated market.
In this high-price PERC environment, we are seeing a revival of demand for multicrystalline BSF, a technology that was being phased out, and that has seen its demand and prices increase in some utility markets (e.g. India, Middle-East) and even in C&I applications. The IHS Markit view is that this increase in demand and prices for BFS multi is a short-lived phenomenon triggered by extraordinarily high PERC prices and multi will continue its phasing out in 2022, remaining a product for some niche markets due to lower efficiencies.
While the trade imbalance between China and Western markets is not a new phenomenon, the rapid surge in goods demand in Western markets from very low demand during lockdowns to high demand during relaxations of COVID-19 restrictions and reopening of economic activity has caused serious challenges to logistics. Freight costs have increased 3-4 times in the last 3 quarters for shipments from China to Europe or the Americas and IHS Markit projects the situation will not dramatically improve this year.
This is a global phenomenon that is impacting all industries (semiconductors, automotive, consumer electronics…). The most recent IHS Markit global survey of manufacturers found that the stretching of supply chains in the last quarters has extended delivery times to the highest level in more than 20 years of data availability with delays being most pronounced in Europe, United States, and Taiwan. Solar PV is one of the most impacted due to the high concentration of manufacturing in China. Freight costs and long lead times might challenge solar project completions in 2021, delaying projects to 2022. Higher freight costs are also impacting other system components like trackers, which are a high-weight and low-value component, with final impact on total system CAPEX.
In this high-price environment that started in Q3 2020, international developers are putting off procurement in the hope that equipment and freight prices will be lower in 2022. Extreme volatility in raw materials, module prices and freight costs are not helping manufacturers nor developers to close contracts whose terms change on a weekly basis.  Given long lead times, if procurement is delayed beyond the summer, the risk to the 2021 installations outlook will become a reality.
In previous years, if demand slowed down around the summer and inventories grew, this triggered a price decline that quickly reactivated the procurement process. This year, however, even if inventories start growing and manufacturers would be willing to scarify margins, this would still have a small impact on the total module cost for a developer. Module costs for a developer will still be high due to the unchanged high cost of freight that will remain flat or could even increase in the second half of the year with the reactivation of economies in Europe and the United States.
High component and high freight costs are having a direct impact on CAPEX and project IRRs, which is expected to continue in H2 2021. This could be the first year where global average solar CAPEX might not decline after major Y-o-Y reductions in the last decade. Although developers are trying to delay procurement as much as possible, there is a significant part of the project pipeline under PPA contracts or schemes that require completion in 2021. In some cases, developers are accepting lower IRRs than originally forecast. In others, EPCs might decide to pay penalties for project delays – which could represent a lower cost than proceeding with building on time in the current price environment. The final decision depends on a variety of factors (company type, contract terms, possibility to lower other CAPEX contributors, etc) and cannot be generalized.
IHS Markit forecasts that Europe and India are the regions that are at a higher risk of underperformance. Europe faces the highest risk of being the most impacted by high component pricing, costly shipping, and long lead times since regional market growth hinges on the progression of the highly sensitive utility-scale segment and many contract negotiations and shipments are now paralyzed. The US market is at a lower risk since it is less price sensitive, but it is also being impacted by long-lead times and the surge in freight costs and higher prices that could push some project completion to 2022.
Finally, despite a low-connection first quarter, mainland China—unburdened by shipping challenges—should stay on course to grow on a Y-o-Y basis. However, IHS Markit remains cautious that additional module price increases, some recent bidding prices reached higher than 1.70 RMB/W, could put at risk the 2021 installation forecast that is strongly skewed to the second half of the year.

Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm said she expects the U.S. company to invest heavily in Australian lithium, nickel and other critical minerals to make its batteries. However, she also said that Australia should start developing its onshore refining capabilities to maximize the value of resources needed for the clean energy transition.
“The opportunity for Australia is extraordinary, and now is the time to seize it,” Denholm told a Minerals Council of Australia event in Canberra on Wednesday. “Australia has the minerals to power the renewable energy age throughout the world in the coming years.”
Denholm said Tesla already sources three-quarters of the lithium it uses from Australia and more than one-third of its nickel. She didn’t specify a dollar figure for the current spend, but said it is expected to increase as the automaker continues to expand its renewable technology offerings, including residential and grid-scale battery energy storage systems.
“We expect our spend on Australian minerals to increase to more than $1 billion per annum for the next few years,” she said.
Denholm said Australia supplied almost 50% of the world’s lithium ore last year. However, it supplied none of the refined product required for batteries, she noted.
“If it was processed onshore in Australia, the value would have been more like $1.7 billion,” she said. “It will require massive innovation. We need to scale up at an extremely fast pace and mining needs the same kind of innovation as the industries it supplies.”
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has also urged Australia to focus on adding value to the supply chain. Its Critical Energy Minerals Roadmap estimates the metal value of the energy transition’s top technologies to globally reach more than $5 trillion by 2050.
Jonathan Law, CSIRO’s mineral resources director, said that Australia is well positioned to benefit. However, it can significantly increase the value of its mineral exports, enable more local manufacturing and strengthen global supply chains, he said.
“Rather than just extracting the minerals and shipping them away to be refined and turned into products, Australia has a real opportunity to operate all the way along the energy value chain, from extraction to processing, separating, refining and manufacturing high value materials and products,” Law said. “Connecting our mining and manufacturing sectors can create an investment ecosystem that supports domestic supply chains and resource circularity for our critical minerals.”
The Minerals Council of Australia recently said that demand for critical minerals is set to increase dramatically in the coming years, as the world’s transition to renewable energy accelerates. In its newly released Commodity Demand Outlook 2030 report, the council predicts that demand for Australian-mined lithium will rise rapidly.
Denholm said global uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) will accelerate as nations target net zero emissions.
“Electric vehicles account for less than 1% of vehicles globally at the moment,” she said. “To reach net zero emissions, that needs to be much closer to 100% within 30 years. So that’s at least a 100-fold increase ahead, just for vehicles.”

California startup Enteligent HAS launched the SolarUp Rapid Shutdown Module, a rapid shutdown device (RSD) with module-level power electronics (MLPE) for efficient power optimization. The company said the device will be available in August and adds the benefit of power optimization at a price that is competitive with standalone RSD.
Enteligent said its MLPE solutions offer system-level interoperability and simplified solar rooftop placement while maximizing generation. This enables installers to deploy more modules on suboptimal roof planes. The design also is a boon to homeowners who have rooftop mounting areas that absorb marginal solar irradiance and who are looking to increase their energy offset.
In full sunlight, SolarUp has among the highest energy outputs in the rooftop market. In shaded conditions, the panel-level Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) optimization engages. Rather than continuously optimizing output, SolarUp only enables its MPPT when needed, which results in an improvement in power loss when compared to other optimizers.
The Sunspec certified device allows for easy installations and servicing, housing both RSD and MLPE in a single location. SolarUp Single provides module-level shutdown and optimization across two panels, while SolarUp Dual allows for shutdown at module level with independent module optimization for two panels.
Enteligent said it soon will release a residential EV Quick Charger. The device charges directly from solar to deliver what the company said will be as much as 13% more electricity from panels than traditional EV charging. After sunset, the charger pulls from storage or the grid. This product will ship in the second quarter of 2022.
