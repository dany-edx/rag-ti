Untethered ‘inductive' charging – which involves power being transferred from a magnetic coil to a receiver coil in electric cars, buses and trucks – has been widely tipped to be the future of EV charging, Tesvolt said in a press release today, although the best inductive product on the market at present has only 3.2 kW of charging power.
Wittenberg-based Tesvolt did not reveal how much it has invested in Bavarian firm Stercom – described in the press release as a “thinktank” – nor what proportion of the inductive charging business it now holds.
Quoted in the press statement, Tesvolt joint founder and commercial director Daniel Hannemann said Stercom's silicon carbide technology operates inductive charging at 95% efficiency and enables charging with up to 20cm between the transfer coils. The latter, according to Hannemann, is “something no other provider on the market has been able to do.”
In the “medium term” it may be possible to offer inductive supercharging at up to 200 kW, according to fellow Tesvolt founder, and chief technical officer, Simon Schandert. That level of performance would also mark a step change in performance for solar cars which top up battery reserves while the vehicle is in motion.
The Tesvolt release said carmakers Audi and BMW are already installing inductive charging receiver coils in models and added, trial sections of road in Italy, France and Sweden have been fitted with sub-asphalt magnetic charging coils. BMW, said Tesvolt, has predicted blanket coverage of inductive charging – including in shopping mall forecourts, multi-storey car parks and at home – this decade.
While the short, fast bursts of charging offered by inductive transfer would mean EV batteries need only be half their current size and weight – according to Stercom founder and CEO Robert Sterff – such recharging places heavy demands on battery lifetimes.
As a result, said Sterff, extensive research is being made into the application of solid-state batteries, especially in Germany, with that technology said by the Stercom boss to be “particularly well suited” to inductive charging.
This copy was amended on 07/07/21 to include the statement Tesvolt had acquired a significant minority stake in Stercom.

A press release issued by a PR company to announce the pending arrival of ‘EBA250 Academy' skills training in France stated the courses – for battery technicians, engineers and researchers – would train 150,000 people in France by 2025.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The training program, which also offers face-to-face training where required, has been devised by the InnoEnergy operation of EU research body the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and has already been introduced in Spain.
Today's media release said the program – which addresses topics including electromobility, residential and grid scale storage, recycling and data science – will be deployed across other European nations this year and added, “any engineer or executives working in energy can apply.”
EIT InnoEnergy is in charge of coordinating the industrial work of the European Battery Alliance of industry and government bodies working to establish a sustainable battery supply chain in the EU. The alliance supplies the initialism in the name of the EBA250 Academy, which also refers to the €250 billion battery industry ambition the industrial grouping hopes to achieve by 2025.
Today's statement said local training providers would offer the courses and that set-up may explain why the press release referred to the initiative as a public-private partnership. pv magazine has asked for clarification of the private sector aspect of the program.
European Commission VP Maroš Šefčovič, who launched the EBA in October 2017, welcomed the training initiative. Quoted in today's press release, Šefčovič said 2021 “could be another defining year for the European Battery Alliance – also thanks to our resolute collective action to address the fast-emerging skills challenge. The new battery industry requires a new set of skills. Re-skilling and up-skilling programs, such as the EBA250 Academy, will, therefore, help match skills with labor market needs as well as reinforce the social dimension of Europe’s recovery. In this context, I am glad to see that Europe continues to be a global hotspot for battery investment. By 2025, we are set to manufacture enough battery cells each year to power at least six million electric cars.”

Despite the travails the company has endured this year – with trading in GCL stock still suspended on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange pending publication of its overdue 2020 figures – GCL said yesterday it would hand over an initial RMB219 million (US$33.8 million) this month and two further payments of RMB500 million each by the end of September and December, to acquire the 5.835% of the Suzhou GCL subsidiary it does not already hold.
Tomorrow's print edition of pv magazine will offer an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, pv magazine has been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
The Suzhou unit owns most of GCL's remaining 2.7 GW of solar generation capacity in China and, with the poly maker selling off projects left, right and center to reduce debt at its GCL New Energy solar project operation, the parent company yesterday said the Suzhou GCL stock purchase would ensure “Suzhou GCL New Energy can maximize its autonomy to manage its operations, streamline the decision making process of Suzhou GCL New Energy (including, among others, disposals of operational solar power plants in order to achieve an asset light model) and enhance the profit return of the operational solar power plants indirectly owned by Suzhou GCL New Energy.”
The holder of the minority stake in Suzhou GCL is private equity investment fund Sumin Ruineng which, according to yesterday's update is “sponsored and managed by Sumin Investment,” an entity in which the chairs of GCL-Poly and GCL New Energy Holdings both have an interest.
At the top level of a complex ownership chain, Sumin Investment is 10% owned by GCL Capital Management. Below that, at level two, GCL Capital is 60% owned by GCL Group and 40% owned by Taicang Port GCL Power Generation. At level three, GCL Group is held 48.86% by GCL (Liaoning) Industrial, which itself, at level four of the chain, is wholly owned by GCL-Poly chairman and director Zhu Gongshan, the father of GCL New Energy Holdings chairman and director Zhu Yufeng.
Going back up to level two, Taicang Port is 72% owned by the Zhu family trust, of which Credit Suisse Trust Ltd is a trustee and Zhu Yufeng and his family – including his father – are beneficiaries. The same family trust also owns the Asia Pacific Energy Fund Ltd which owns the Concord Group which holds the 51.14% balance of shares in the level-three entity GCL Group not held by GCL (Liaoning) Industrial.

The Danish renewables investor – which is more well known for wind power projects and lists pension fund PensionDanmark as a major backer – opted for Exus to oversee the project, which will be constructed in Vulcan County, Alberta. The management contract had been tendered using a competitive bidding process, according to a press release issued by a PR company on behalf of Exus yesterday.
pv magazine in September reported a delay to construction of the project, which had been due to start in 2019, and also reported Travers would have a generation capacity of only 400 MW, helped by an investment of CA$500 million (US$403 million) from Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners in February last year.
The press release described the Travers facility as ‘Canada's largest solar farm.'

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/07/longi-moves-to-reverse-dutch-court-decision-permitting-seizure-of-pv-panels-at-rotterdam/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,EUROPE,NETHERLANDS",MAX HALL,"JULY 7, 2021",Longi moves to reverse Dutch court decision permitting seizure of PV panels at Rotterdam,"Chinese manufacturer Longi Solar is attempting to challenge an order granted in the Dutch court system permitting the seizure of a shipment of its solar modules at the Port of Rotterdam.
A source close to the matter told pv magazine Korean solar manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells was granted permission, on June 11, to seize an unspecified volume of Longi products in order to prevent their distribution in suspected infringement of Hanwha patents.
The patent dispute relates to a decision by the Dusseldorf Regional Court in June last year that Longi, and Chinese co-defendants JinkoSolar and REC Solar, had infringed Hanwha's patented passivation solar cell technology. That decision, which is being appealed by the defendants, came after Hanwha had lodged patent infringement claims against the trio in the German court in March 2019.
As a result, pv magazine‘s source said yesterday, Hanwha secured permission in the Dutch legal system to seize the shipment last month as a “measure for preserving evidence.” The Korean company persuaded lawmakers the panels might be distributed in markets where its European patent applies.
Hanwha is understood to have offered to restore the panels to Longi upon receipt of proof they would not be distributed in markets where the Korean company's patent is in force. pv magazine‘s source said Longi is understood to have written to customers in the U.K. and Germany, as well as in Poland, stating their panels will be delayed as they have been seized by Hanwha.
With Longi said to have been preparing to put its case in the Dutch court system yesterday, Hanwha is thought to be likely to request a cross-border injunction which would seek to preserve the legal decisions made in one European nation being breached in neighboring states.
This copy was amended on 20/07/21 to reflect the fact the panels were seized to prevent their distribution in nations where Hanwha’s European technology patent applies, rather than in nations where the ruling in Dusseldorf has force, as previously stated, as the Dusseldorf ruling applies only in Germany. The date of permission being granted to make the seizure was June 11, not June 16, as previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/07/tata-power-vows-to-exit-coal-by-2050/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 7, 2021",Tata Power vows to exit coal by 2050,"From pv magazine India
Praveer Sinha, the CEO and managing director of India's Tata Power, has unveiled ambitious plans to transform the energy company’s generation portfolio toward “clean and green” sources, in order to reach carbon neutrality before 2050.
Tata Power’s generation mix is dominated by coal-based thermal power capacity, even as it makes impressive gains in expanding its renewables assets. As of March 31, it had a total power generation capacity of 12,808 MW. Thermal accounts for 69% at 8,859 MW, followed by 1,762 MW of solar, 932 MW of wind, 880 MW of hydro and 375 MW of blast-furnace gas waste-heat recovery capacity.
To switch to clean energy, the company will avoid developing new coal-based capacity and will not acquire coal-based stressed assets. Its existing thermal fleet will be retired upon the end of plant life or the expiry of power purchase agreements, Tata Power has said.
As a staging post to net zero, the company intends to have 80% of its generation assets ‘clean and green’ this decade, up from 31% at the end of March, with Tata considering its gas-related waste heat capacity under that definition.
The Mumbai-based electric utility – part of the Tata Group – said it will add 2 GW of solar and hybrid-technology capacity every year to hit 25 GW within this decade, up from 4 GW three months ago. Microgrids will be an important part of the strategy, with Tata having commissioned 161 of them to date.
The company also plans to develop a portfolio of renewables technologies, including hybrid clean energy plants, offshore wind, floating solar, and hydrogen fuel. In addition, it has said that it will strengthen its battery storage partnerships.
Tata Power’s current renewables activity encompasses utility and rooftop solar EPC services, floating solar, microgrids, and hybrid systems. It also makes solar products such as pumps, modules and cells, and reverse-osmosis water purification devices.
Its Tata Power Solar Systems unit is India’s largest utility-scale solar EPC service provider. It has a presence in 11 Indian states and an order book of more than 2.8 GW.

Australia’s federal government has allocated AUD 5 million ($3.7 million) to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to support hydrogen research. The national science agency will use the funds to support research exchanges, the development of collaborative tools, and the sharing of knowledge about research on hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia.
Speaking at the Australian Hydrogen Conference in May, CSIRO Chief Executive Larry Marshall described Australia as being at the “forefront” of hydrogen. In recent years, the agency has quadrupled its hydrogen investments and has focused massive amounts of research capacity on the future fuel.
Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said the program will help to promote strong relationships with research agencies in partner countries such as Germany, Japan and Singapore to accelerate the development of a global ‘clean’ hydrogen industry.
The Australian government continues to use the term ‘clean hydrogen’ to muddy the difference between renewable ‘green’ hydrogen and hydrogen made with fossil fuels (blue hydrogen) which claims to offset its production emissions with carbon capture and store technology (CCS). The federal government claims to have invested AUD 1 billion to support Australia’s ‘clean’ hydrogen industry, but the amount allocated to actual renewables projects is far lower.
“Investing in R&D and building connections with international partners are critical to Australia building and growing our own globally competitive industry. We recognize the important economic and job opportunities becoming a major global hydrogen player will deliver, while also lowering emissions,” Taylor said.
Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Christian Porter said the research and development program will grow Australia’s hydrogen capacity.
“This program will also improve our understanding of future hydrogen supply chains and markets, and help us to harness the potential for an Australian clean hydrogen industry to grow our economy and create Australian jobs,” Porter said.
He added that the new program will “build on and intensify recent collaborative efforts” between his department and the CSIRO in developing an Australian hydrogen researcher network.

Q Cells and Samsung have signed a “zero energy homes” deal under which they will combine their hardware and software platforms to provide comprehensive energy services, including generation, energy storage, power consumption, and intelligent energy management.
The “zero energy home” concept involves the efficient use of energy directly produced on-site to enable energy independence and reduce emissions. This is achieved via “active technology” –generation resources – and “passive technology,” or energy efficiency measures.
The role of Q Cells in the partnership will be to provide solar modules and energy storage systems (ESS) to customers, as well as its Q.ONNECT home energy management system. The platform features an optimized ESS operation service that uses expected charge amount data and local weather forecasts.
When linked to Samsung Electronics’ SmartThings platform, the data will give homeowners control to optimize home energy use. The platform can link to Samsung and non-Samsung devices for centralized appliance management. The service is intended to give homeowners a clearer view of how energy is consumed by heat pumps and appliances, letting them set up a more sustainable energy management plan.
In addition, the two companies plan to cooperate on joint sales, mainly in the U.S. and European markets.
