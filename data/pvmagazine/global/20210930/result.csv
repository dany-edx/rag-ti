The second quarter of 2021 was a record Q2 for U.S. solar development with 5.7 GW installed. This marks the 4th largest quarter ever for solar development in the United States.
Sector-by-sector growth was strong. It was a near-record quarter for residential (974 MW), commercial solar was up 31% year over year (354 MW), and there was 177 MW of community solar developed. Perhaps most impressive, 4.2 GW of utility-scale solar was developed, and 9 GW of utility-scale solar was procured.
Despite these growth figures, presenters from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie who spoke at this year’s Solar Power International warned of bottlenecks and cost increases ahead. While the market is set to grow, it is “not all unicorns and rainbows,” said Xiaojing Sun, head of solar research at WoodMac.

Australian Vanadium Ltd. (AVL) has appointed Western Australian-based engineering group Primero, a subsidiary of NRW Holdings, to begin the process of constructing a vanadium electrolyte manufacturing plant, which will importantly include negotiating its precise location within Western Australia.
In July, AVL secured a AUD 3.69 million ($2.7 million) federal government grant to design, build and operate a AUD 7.4 million commercial vanadium battery electrolyte plant, as well as vanadium redox flow battery prototypes for off-grid and residential settings. Conditions of the grant dictate that the manufacturing project must be fully completed by March 31, 2024.
Shortly after obtaining the grant, AVL signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with specialty chemical producer U.S. Vanadium LLC (USV) for the supply of vanadium oxides. This, the company says, will simplify the design, construction, and startup of its future manufacturing plant. The goal with the plant, AVL Managing Director Vincent Algar said, is to “cement” AVL’s downstream processing capability in Australia.
While this plan has only just entered its first stage, the company is far more progressed with the vanadium mine it is establishing in Gabanintha, almost smack bang in the middle of Western Australia. The Australian Vanadium Project, as its called, has been awarded Major Project Status by the federal government.

This compares to 434.9 MW in July this year and 409.2 MW in August 2020.
In the first eight months of 2021, developers connected 3.61 GW of solar to the grid, compared to 3.2 GW in the same period a year earlier. The country's cumulative solar capacity topped 56.1 GW at the end of August.
Around 294 MW of the deployed capacity comes from projects not exceeding 300 kW in size, under the feed-in tariff scheme. Only a few rooftop projects over this power threshold were installed in the country in August, which shows that the regulatory changes introduced with the new renewable energy law have had a negative impact on this market segment. Projects ranging between 300 and 750 kW, on the other hand, have the option to participate in tenders or secure a halved feed-in tariff.
Another 140 MW comes from PV plants with a capacity of over 750 kW that were selected in Germany's tender scheme for large scale renewables.
The Bundesnetzagentur also published new compensation rates which will begin in October. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4% while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0714/kWh and €0.0543/kWh, depending on size.

The smaller of the two promises significant gains in module performance without requiring a major redesign of other system components, while the larger promises even larger energy yields, but taking into account the larger size and different electrical characteristics of these modules, taking full advantage will require much more disruption in system design, shipping and elsewhere along the value chain.
This is further demonstrated in a new white paper published by Chinese module producer JA Solar, in cooperation with TÜV Nord. Early in 2021, the two set up a test field in Yinchuan, China to compare JA Solar’s DeepBlue 3.0 modules, which utilize the 182mm wafer, with others from an unnamed manufacturer utilizing the 210mm format promoted by Zhonghuan Semiconductor.
Initial results from the project were published earlier this year, and now a second white paper offers results based on six months monitoring the modules in the field. The two module types are installed at a site in Yinchuan, China. According to JA Solar, this site is an arid environment with an average temperature of 8.5 Celsius degrees and up to 3000 hours of sunshine per year. Single-sided modules amounting to approximately 7 kW for each type are installed on fixed-tilt racking at a 40 degrees angle one meter above the ground. Both module sets are connected to a 20 kW inverter. The study only uses data from a DC side meter, to avoid measuring the effects of the inverter as well as the modules.
Based on the operational data from February to August 2021, the project found that JA Solar’s module average daily energy yield reached 4.88 kWh per kW, placing it around 1.9% higher than the 4.77kWh/kW achieved by the 210mm modules. The data also show that on days with higher solar irradiation, from May to July in particular, the gap in average energy yield between the two module types widens to 2.5%,” the manufacturer said.
JA solar attributes the lower yield from the larger modules to issues stemming from the higher currents they produce. “Theoretically, as the internal resistance loss of 182 modules is relatively lower, differences in power generation performance of the two types of modules is caused by the difference in the internal resistance loss and its resulting difference in operating temperature,” they explain in the white paper.
Delving further into the performance data, they found that the average operating temperature of JA Solar’s module was 1.7 Celsius degrees lower than the 210mm module. “…the difference in operating temperature mainly stems from radiation intensity,” they explain. “This demonstrates that the advantage of 182 modules in power generation from May to July is from the widening gap in operating temperature between the two kinds of modules.”
The comparison test site is set to run for a full year, and JA Solar says it will publish a complete analysis of the full-year performance data.

The Silk Pro Red module is made with 120 half-cut, monocrystalline, multi-busbars cells and can be manufactured with a customized frame color. It is available in four versions with a power output ranging from 230 W to 245 W and a power conversion efficiency spanning from 12.63% to 13.45%. Its open circuit voltage is 40.21-40.81 V and the short-circuit current is 7.27-7.48 A.
The new product has a size of 1,755×1,038x35mm and weighs in at 19.7kg. It relies on a backsheet made of composite multi-layer film and an anodized aluminum frame with mounting and drainage holes.
FuturaSun offers a 15-year product guarantee and the operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius. The degradation in the first year is claimed to be 3% and the 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87% of the nominal output power.
The maximum system voltage is 1,000 V and the maximum reverse current is 20 A.
The red panel is part of a new series of colored products which includes silver and orange modules. The silver product has wattages ranging from 280 W up to 295 W and the orange module from 240 W to 255 W.
“These colored panels are well suited for conservative buildings, for renovations that need to be installed on traditional roofs with tiles and brick tiles, or for use flanking historic architecture in town centers, where it is necessary to ensure overall harmony,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “They are ideal for use on pitched roofs but also for compositions on facade elements in innovative contexts, also in terms of light and color.”
The company is headquartered in Cittadella, in the Padua province of northern Italy, and operates a 1 GW factory in China. The company's Italian staff, said FuturaSun, focus on R&D in areas such as inter-digitated back-contact (IBC) cells, cylindrical ribbons, glass-glass solutions and modules with independent sections.

The facility will sell power at an undisclosed price to French power utility EDF. “The price of CEOG electricity is competitive with diesel power plant[s] in French Guiana and this, without including the negative externalities of … fossil [power] plants,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
The equity for the project will be provided by French investment firm and asset manager Meridiam, which owns a 60% stake in the project, and SARA, a refinery based in Martinique and supplying the French Antilles and Guiana. The non–recourse project financing will be awarded by commercial and development banks.
The facility relies on a 55 MW solar unit, a 16 MW electrolyzer, storage tanks and 3 MW of fuel cells. The project is intended at covering the energy needs of 10,000 households of all Western Guiana. The facility will be able to produce a fixed electrical daily output of 10 MW until evening, and of 3 MW during the night.
The CEOG project was launched by developer and French hydrogen specialist HDF Energy in May 2018. At the time, the company said the value of the facility was estimated at around $90 million. The project was originally set to be commissioned last year.

Presented yesterday at Solar Solutions International in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, the propane-cooled 3.5 kW device can be installed on both existing buildings and all-electric new buildings and, the manufacturer claims, in new builds it is suitable for smaller houses and flats of up to 100m2. For larger houses, two devices can be installed in a cascade, through a modular approach.
The 230 VAC heat pump measures 83x48x45cm and weighs in at 50kg. “It can be carried to the attic or basement in two 25kg pieces,” the company said in a statement, noting that it can be deployed into a cabinet without the need for a separate technical room. “Regular heat pumps weigh 100-120kg and it’s not legal to move them without a hoist, according to health and safety laws.”
The device works together with a 230 V, 200-liter water boiler which is activated when the outside temperature falls below zero. According to Triple Solar, this configuration enables up to 80% of gas savings on heating and domestic hot water production.
“A seasonal performance factor (SPF) of 5.6 is feasible for space heating and an SPF of 3.8 for domestic hot water,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, referring to the average coefficient of performance of a heat pump over the full heating season. “This means that, on average over a year, every kilowatt-hour of electricity generates 5.6 kWh of heat.”
According to the company, these values were measured by the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and were recorded in a label-of-conformity statement. “This makes Triple Solar one of the most economical heating systems available,” the spokesperson added.
The installation can be operated with a simple thermostat and monitored via the internet, without the need for wifi or WLAN cables. “The Netherlands and the rest of Europe can start to make heating more sustainable today, instead of having to wait another 15 years or so until all homes are finally suitable for gas-less heating,” Triple Solar CEO Cees Mager said.

Mouloud Bakli, the president of Algerian think tank Club Energia, said the tender might conclude with prices ranging from DZD 5/kWh ($0.036) to DZD 7/kWh.
“Given the latest capex balance-of-system figures in the market and harvesting yield in the North African region, we expect the tender will provide a double-digit internal rate of return,” he told pv magazine. “Several international Tier 1 independent power producers have already expressed their intention to participate in the tender.”
Bakli said he expects the power purchase agreements to adhere to international standards.
“Investors will be able to repatriate dividends in international currency,” he stated, noting that the PPAs will likely be similar to those that international players already use for desalination projects. “The awarded PPAs should have a duration between 20 and 25 years and the tender will be divided into 10 lots ranging from 80 MW to 180 MW each.”
The Algerian Renewable Energy Company (SHAEMS), which is jointly owned by state-owned gas giant Sonatrach and power utility Sonelgaz, will be allowed to take a share of up to 25% in the special purpose vehicles that will own the winning projects.
“This is meant to reassure foreign investors, like for the water desalination scheme,” Bakli explained. “We expect the selected parcels to be mostly developed in the sunny Hautes Plaines, in the northern part of the country.”
Local content requirements will be included in the procurement exercise, but they will not be mandatory for the first tender of the series, as the capacity of the local industry will only just exceed 1 GW by the end of 2022. Solar developers that use locally manufactured PV components may receive additional bonuses on top of the granted fixed tariff.
Another three tenders of the same size will likely be held each year between 2022 and 2024.
In 2019, the Algerian government held tenders for off-grid, hybrid solar-diesel and PV projects. The procurement rounds were part of the country’s plans to deploy 22 GW of clean energy generation capacity by 2030, including 13.6 GW of solar.
Algeria had around 423 MW of total installed solar capacity by the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

In a record year for the United States, 10 GW of utility-scale solar reached commercial operation date in 2020. The projects accounted for nearly 60% of all new PV capacity added last year.
Declining costs have been a chief driver of utility-scale solar growth, which has extended its reach beyond the sunny southwest to more northerly regions. Prices negotiated through power purchase agreements (PPAs) have fallen to new lows, and solar PPAs are now less costly than wind in many regions. As solar increases its share of the capacity on the grid, its wholesale value reduces.
However, this observed decline in value has kept pace with declining prices, meaning that solar has remained competitive. The growth prospects for utility-scale solar look strong, with interconnection queues adding 170 GW last year alone.
Those insights were shared by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory during this year’s online Solar Power International event. The Department of Energy laboratory drew its results from its database of 983 projects that have at least 5 MW of capacity, totaling 40.5 GW.
Downward trend
Falling costs remained the most significant driver of utility-scale solar deployment in the U.S. median installed costs have fallen  in the last decade, down nearly by 75% since 2010.
Lower capital costs and higher capacity factors, along with reduced operating expenses, longer design life, and improved financing terms have driven down the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) over the past 10 years. LCOE is a measure of the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generating plant over its lifetime.
LCOE has fallen 85% since 2010, to $34/MWh. If the federal investment tax credit of 30% is included, LCOE currently averages $28/MWh for utility-scale solar. PPA prices have followed LCOE reductions, falling about 85% since 2010. Most projects in the CAISO (California) grid and the non-ISO West are priced around $20/MWh. Elsewhere in the continental U.S., prices range from $30/MWh to $40/MWh.
Value erosion
While prices have fallen, the value of solar has also eroded over time. This is due in part to wholesale electricity market prices declining overall, largely driven by declining natural gas prices. Solar-specific causes such as location, generation profile, and curtailment have driven this decline as well.
Despite the decline in wholesale value, declining PPA prices largely have kept pace, maintaining solar competitiveness in the market. The loss of value in solar has shown some correlation with the resource’s overall share in the wholesale energy market. For example, in 2020, in CAISO (California’s grid) solar made up 21% of capacity and netted an average value of $25/MWh on the wholesale market,  30% below the average wholesale price. In contrast, solar was valued at $51/MWh where it made up less than 1% of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) grid-control region (Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma).
Steady growth in utility-scale solar is expected to continue. About 460 GW of solar was in interconnection queues at the end of 2020, 170 GW of which were entered into the queues that year. Nearly 160 GW of the total queue include co-located battery energy storage, about 34% of the total. CAISO had the largest attachment rate in-queue, with nearly 90% of projects opting to include batteries.
What’s more, data reported by the Energy Information Administration showed that of the 14.5 GW of battery storage power capacity planned to come online in the United States from 2021 to 2024, around two-thirds will be co-located with a solar photovoltaic power plant.

The potential of single-walled carbon nanotubes and other nanostructures as a medium for storing hydrogen has been investigated by the scientific community over recent decades but this technology has so far failed to reach commercial maturity as hydrogen becomes a gas at -252 degrees Celsius, which makes its storage at room temperature using bare carbon nanotubes impossible.
The main issue for this kind of hydrogen storage is that the interaction energies between adsorbed molecules and the nanotube walls are not high enough to store big quantities of hydrogen at room temperature and relatively low pressures. “The interaction between hydrogen and its storage material is simply too weak to persist at room temperature,” the Japanese group stated. “This makes the design of storage materials crucial to achieving the goal of bringing hydrogen energy into daily use.”
The scientists focused their analysis on carbon nanotubes made of silicon carbide, a substrate material that is extensively used in the electric vehicle (EV) industry and the PV sector, which uses silicon carbide in next-generation inverters.
Through diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) analysis, the academics created a model that accounts for Van der Waals forces in the simulation. The Van der Waals forces define the attraction of intermolecular forces between molecules. “Most conventional models consider the interactions between hydrogen and silicon-carbide nanotubes as a whole, but the DMC method uses the power of a supercomputer to reconstruct the interaction mechanism faithfully by following the arrangement of individual electrons,” they further explained.
The proposed methodology is claimed to have established how much energy would be necessary to dislodge hydrogen from its storage, and how far away the hydrogen was likely to be from the surface of the silicon-carbide nanotube. The results of the simulation were then compared to those achieved by traditional prediction methods based on the density functional theory (DFT), which calculates the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and solids.
The researchers found that the DFT analysis without Van der Waals forces wrongly estimated the energy required for hydrogen storage by 4-14%. The analysis that included Van der Waals forces, by contrast, found storage energy was estimated at 9-29%, a percentage range that the scientists defined as “hardly insignificant.”
“Improving prediction reliability for simulations can help accelerate the development of materials for hydrogen fuel storage and lead to a more energy efficient society,” said JAIST researcher Kenta Hongo. “Although the DMC method is computationally expensive, it can be used to clarify the peculiarities, and tendencies of prediction error, of each prediction method.”
The findings of the research can be found in the paper Importance of Van der Waals Interactions in Hydrogen Adsorption on a Silicon-carbide Nanotube Revisited with vdW-DFT and Quantum Monte Carlo, published in ACS Publications.

Between 2011 and 2021, the South African Government, through its Integrated Resource Plan 2010-2030 (IRP), and managed by state utility Eskom and the DMRE, have successfully launched and completed four bidding windows for the competitive REIPPPP tender, by allowing the private sector and Independent Power producers (IPPs) to invest in the South African renewable energy market.
Looking at table 1, the first three BWs (from 2011 to 2013) each took around six months to close their projects after being announced as preferred bidders, while BW3.5, with its two 100 MW CSP projects (Kathu and Redstone), took between two to six years to close, and BW4 approximately three years.
These delays were due to a refusal from the previous Eskom Management Board to sign new Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in 2015. Despite this, the government issued an accelerated procurement BW 4.5 in November 2015 for 1,800 MW of capacity from all renewable technologies for all the unsuccessful bidders from the previous BWs. The outcome of this BW was never executed, however.
Some interesting facts from Tables 1 and 2 show that between 2011 and 2015 (excl. BW5), 302 bids were submitted with around 30% (92) of the projects receiving approval. From those 92 projects, close to 70% (4.41GW) are already in operation with wind and solar PV projects comprising most of the projects awarded: roughly 86%.
In addition, of the 11.5 GW of total capacity offered, 6.3GW, or 71%, was allocated. Once again, wind and solar PV projects comprised the majority, at 5.65 GW or 89%. While 86% of solar PV projects are located on the Northern Cape and 14% are spread among the other provinces, wind projects are mainly split equally between the Eastern and Northern Capes.
Of the total investment (US$20.5 billion) roughly 80% was raised locally between commercial banks, funds, and development financial institutions (DFIs), showing how strong the financial sector is in South Africa.
Wind projects totaled $8 billion (37%) and solar PV projects $7 billion (34%), which represented around 70% of all projects invested in the REIPPPP. The social-economic and enterprise development impact received around $80 million from the REIPPPP.
The two most important indicators that bidders will fight using all the technical and financial instruments at their disposal can be seen through both the equity Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and reaching the lowest tariff.
We have seen that while the first rounds offered very high average real IRRs (ZAR) of 17% in BW1, the last completed BW4 presented very skewed IRRs that reached around 9.5% on average. On the other hand, the tariff which drives the IRR has seen astounding reductions from each successive BW, giving bidders the herculean task of finding new financing and technical solutions to reach those very slim IRRs and aggressive tariffs.
We can further acknowledge from table three, that between BW 1 to BW Expedited, the average tariff reduction stands at around 52% and 26% for solar PV and wind, respectively. However, if we consider the average from the most recent BWs (BW3 to BW Expedited), the average tariff reduction dropped to roughly 27% for solar PV and 19% for wind, showing that tariff reductions might become more balanced and sustainable.

Based on South Africa's new IRP 2019, the coal decommissioning plan requires 10.5 GW of coal to come offline by 2030 and 35 GW by 2050, thus providing a completely different energy mix from the one currently in place, where over 80% of energy generation comes from coal power plants.
The new IRP will enable the potential development of around 29 GW of new renewable energy capacity that should be procured between 2022-2030 from technologies like onshore wind (14.4 GW), solar (6 GW), cogen, biomass and landfill (3.5GW), hydro (2.5 GW), and storage (2.6 GW).
Under Section 34 Ministerial Determination, a fifth bidding window took place in the third quarter of 2021, allowing any IPP to procure 1,600MW of wind and 1,000 MW of solar.
According, to the DMRE, 102 projects have been submitted under BW5 which represents 38% more solar and wind projects than in BW4. Specifically, IPPs have submitted 3.4 times more wind bids than in BW4 for the capacity offered, which means that around 29% of wind bidders in this round have a chance of success. Regarding the solar bids, there were 4.7 times more project bids than in BW4 for the capacity offered, which means that solar bidders have around a 21% chance of success.
Despite the aggressive stats, there were a couple of key changes in BW5 worth mentioning such as:
It’s no surprise that BW5 has once again been a success story: 38% more project bids were received compared to six years ago in BW4, despite all the delays, tariff restructuring, and the Covid-19 pandemic. The bidders had to strategize on all business fronts and make sure they trimmed all sorts of “fat” if they wanted to have any chance of winning. Some of those strategies included:
Looking at some of the tariffs that have been awarded recently in auctions around the world (i.e., the Abu Dhabi 2 GW solar tender with 1.35 USD c/kWh or Qatar’s 800 MW tender with a tariff of 1.56 USD c/kWh), it is uncertain if BW5 will see a leveling of these tariffs or if they will just continue reducing at a pace of 20-30% per round, depending on the technology, which could see tariffs reaching as low as the 2.5 to 3.5 USD c/kWh (40 to 55 c ZAR/kWh).
However, some of the many key drivers in the REIPPPP such as policy rules and local content compliance, EPC pricing volatility, and Covid-19 uncertainties could halt tariff decreases.
The latest oversubscribed bid has proven the importance of securing a transparent and reliable BW procurement process. Allowing for steady development and investment in local manufacturers and O&M services will see the creation of long-lasting sustainable and wide-ranging skilled jobs for South Africans and further boost renewable investment in South Africa.
If we are to follow the aggressive procurement plan defined in the IRP2019 (BWs 6 and 7 are expected to be launched in the last quarter of 2021, and in early 2022, respectively), the DMRE might have to increase the capacity offered in BW5 and/or overlapping some of the future BWs.
Reforms recently announced by the South African government will also bring more investment opportunities to the private sector for IPPs and their stakeholders. Most importantly, however, will be to close the energy gap that continues to haunt the country through the likes of load-shedding.
Some of those measures include: unbundling Eskom by the end of 2022 into three companies (generation, transmission, and distribution) and finding the best solution to diminish the immense debt Eskom has in its balance sheet; and the new rules from Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act that exempts any developer from applying for any licensing with Eskom up to 100 MW for embedded generation projects. These will stimulate and expand the potential untapped small/medium-scale market (i.e residential and C&I) in South Africa (i.e, for comparison, Germany has half the solar irradiation of South Africa, but over 40,000MW of installed rooftop solar compared to South Africa’s +/- 450MW).
However, despite the renewable market in South Africa opening its wings to a freer market with more intervention from the private sector, one needs to recognize that the financial precarity of Eskom’s balance sheet and the limited South African National Treasury guarantees might dictate a change or the beginning of a new REIPPPP model through a different government regime in the near future.
Heading to a more sustainable market balance will foster mutually beneficial consolidation of IPPs in the renewable space, opening to a new and vaster M&A market in SA, recognize new development opportunities in the C&I space and key investment areas by increasing profit and bankability whilst reducing major risks, and explore corporate PPAs so to assist the best way to structure projects for any corporate buyers.
One thing is for sure, the renewable market in SA looks bright and with strong gusts of wind, and the industry alongside the South African consumer will be the winner with all these new reforms.
