https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/13/the-chinese-pv-industry-brief-tongwei-raises-solar-cell-prices/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"AUGUST 13, 2021",The Chinese PV Industry Brief: Tongwei raises solar cell prices,"Polysilicon supplier and solar cell maker Tongwei announced its new solar cell prices for August. Overall, all the prices for its monocrystalline PV products were raised. The manufacturer priced its PERC 158.75 mm cell at CNY1.12 (US$0.17) per W, with an increase of 3.7%, and its PERC 166 mm cells at CNY1.03 per W, with an increase of 3%. Furthermore, the company increased the price of its PERC 210 mm cells by 2% to CNY1.02 per W. The price of polycrystalline cells remained flat at CNY 0.73 per W.
Chinese-Canadian PV module manufacturer Canadian Solar was able to significantly improve revenue and shipments in the second quarter of the year, despite what its CEO, Shawn Qu, defined as challenging market conditions. The company achieved record sales of $1.43 billion during the period, which is 105% more than it did a year earlier and 31% more than in the first quarter of this year. Quarterly shipments, meanwhile, totaled 3.66 GW, up 26% year-on-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter. “We posted our highest quarterly revenue of $1.43 billion in the second quarter and made significant progress to capitalize on growth in the battery storage market,” said CFO, Huifeng Chang. “We ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, and have raised approximately $110 million to date from our at-the-market equity offering program, which is well on track.” Net profit declined from $23 million in the second quarter of last year to $11 million in the latest quarter. The company attributed this profit drop to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses and said it was also compensated by an unspecified income tax benefit.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/13/the-hydrogen-stream-new-push-from-oman-a-guide-to-produce-hydrogen-from-aluminum-and-more-blue-hydrogen-projects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"AUGUST 13, 2021","The Hydrogen Stream: New push from Oman, a guide to produce hydrogen from aluminum and more blue hydrogen projects","Oman’s Ministry of Energy and Minerals has signed an agreement with Petroleum Development Oman (PDO)’s Training and Development Centre to set up a National Hydrogen Alliance (NHA), reports the official news agency from Oman, ONA. The alliance comprises 13 bodies from public and private sectors including operators of oil and gas, educational and research institutions and port authorities. Among the participants, are heavyweights like BP, Shell and Total, and universities, including German University (GUtech). “Oman is in contact with different countries in the world and occupies a prominent place in the global arena due to its climate, strategic geographical location and expertise in leading the shift towards renewable energy green hydrogen,” said Salim Nasir Al Aufi, Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals and reported by ONA.
Last month, Dusseldorf-based energy company Uniper signed a cooperation agreement with Oman’s green hydrogen project Hyport. In June, Munich-headquartered management consultancy Roland Berger wrote that Oman is one of the most competitive locations globally to produce and export green hydrogen and derivatives. In May, an international consortium announced it is developing an integrated green fuels mega project in Oman, which will use “25 gigawatts (GW) of renewable solar and wind energy at full capacity to produce millions of tons of zero-carbon green hydrogen per annum.”
On Thursday, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) published a practical guide for generating hydrogen using scrap aluminum. “Aluminum metal will readily react with water at room temperature to form aluminum hydroxide and hydrogen. That reaction doesn’t typically take place because a layer of aluminum oxide naturally coats the raw metal, preventing it from coming directly into contact with water,” reads the document. This production method does not emit greenhouse gases. “Using aluminum as our source, we can ‘store’ hydrogen at a density that’s 10 times greater than if we just store it as a compressed gas,” said Douglas Hart, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. According to the researchers, two problems have kept aluminum from being employed as a reliable source for hydrogen generation: the aluminum surface has to be clean, and pure aluminum production is energy-intensive. The MIT researchers do not only point out “promising approaches to hydrogen production from aluminum”. The work, combined with simultaneous developments in North America, also show that U.S. research centers and institutions have the potential to take back the leadership in hydrogen technologies. Earlier this month, a group of Congress members from Pennsylvania introduced the Clean Hydrogen Energy Act, which aims to create a hydrogen program to drive down costs.
U.S.-based hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck company Hyzon Motors said on Wednesday it is shipping its first trucks to European customers, leveraging on the merger with blank-check firm Decarbonization Plus Acquisition. Hyzon is also preparing to start its first customer trials in the United States. “Many customers are getting their hands on the first fuel cell vehicles they’ve ever seen in the next six to 12 months,” CEO Craig Knight said in a press release, adding that fleet conversion will take less time than previously expected. “Whereas, earlier I would have said, it’s a 12-to-18 month process to go from getting your first fuel cell truck and trying it out and then maybe getting a few more and figuring out what fleet conversion would look like over time, and then kicking off that fleet conversion process — I actually think that’s compressing.”
U.S.-based zero-emission vehicle company Nikola has been awarded an approximate US$2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to advance its research into autonomous refueling technologies for future hydrogen fueling stations. “Autonomous fueling is part of the industry’s effort to ensure fast, efficient, and safe fueling of a large onboard storage system to be less than 20 minutes for heavy-duty vehicles,” the company said on Thursday. The grant is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Transportation Office under the recently announced Hydrogen and Fuel Cells R&D FY2021 FOA.“This funding is essential to advance key hydrogen fueling technologies that can improve the overall efficiency of fuel-cell commercial vehicles, while maintaining the safety and reliability standards required,” said Pablo Koziner, Nikola’s president.
The California Energy Commission (CEC) offered a $4 million grant to Equilon Enterprises (Shell Oil Products) for the development of a multi-modal hydrogen refueling station in California. “The multi-modal hydrogen refueling station will serve hydrogen fuel cell powered on-road heavy-duty vehicles and locomotives at the Port of West Sacramento and will support the Sierra Northern Hydrogen Locomotive Project resulting from the same solicitation and previously awarded,” the CEC said.
Japan’s keiretsu Mitsui and CF Industries, a North American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, announced a Memorandum of Understanding earlier this week for the development of blue ammonia projects in the United States. “CF Industries and Mitsui share a belief that blue ammonia will play a critical role in accelerating the world’s transition to clean energy and that demand for blue ammonia will grow meaningfully,” said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings. The two companies plan preliminary studies on the feasibility of blue ammonia production in the United States, with a focus on supply, supply chains and Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) technologies.
BP Australia, the subsidiary of the British multinational oil and gas giant, said on Wednesday that the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia is technically feasible at scale in Australia. “This looks particularly promising in the mid-west of WA, which has existing infrastructure, access to land, and abundant renewable energy resources such as wind and solar. Importantly, our study also confirmed strong demand from potential customers in the hard-to-abate sectors, and for both local and export markets. This has the potential to position Australia as a regional powerhouse of the energy transition,” said Frédéric Baudry, BP Australia’s president. The study, first announced in May 2020, found that distribution could be customized to suit customer requirements, including gaseous or liquid hydrogen or ammonia via pipeline, truck, train or ship. Still, new infrastructure investments (port and water services) will be needed to make green hydrogen production commercially viable.

The 68 MW PV project is part of a cooperation between Bangladesh and China to install 450 MW of solar capacity and a 50 MW wind farm in Bangladesh. China is expected to invest around US$500 million in the projects.
According to the tender documents, bidders must have had a minimum average annual turnover of $100 million within the last three years. Their financial resources less their financial obligations for their current contract commitments must meet or exceed the total requirement of $30 million.
Bidders should also possess at least seven year’s relevant experience prior to the bid submission date and have worked on at least two PV projects of 50 MW (AC) or larger outside of Bangladesh within the past five years.
They must further be able to prove a $1.5 million unconditional bank guarantee by a recognized bank either in Bangladesh or elsewhere.
Bidders have until September 26, 2021, to submit their technical and financial proposals.
A senior power ministry official told pv magazine that Covid-19 has slowed down the rollout of solar power plants in Bangladesh. However, he is confident the construction of several projects will begin after the pandemic situation eases.
He added that a group of EPC contractors, developers, and suppliers recently sought government intervention to receive a six-month commercial operation date (COD) extension without claim of any liquidated damages.
Currently, Bangladesh generates 766.61 MW of electricity from renewable energy of which 532.62 MW comprises solar.

India has reached 100 GW of installed renewable energy (RE) capacity, excluding large hydro. Globally, the nation ranks fourth in terms of installed RE capacity, fifth in solar, and fourth in wind, according to a release by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
The installed RE capacity mix includes solar, wind, small hydro projects (≤ 25 MW), biomass, and urban and industrial waste power. If large hydro is also included, the installed RE capacity increases to 146 GW.
Besides the installed 100 GW, 50 GW of RE capacity is said to be under construction and 27 GW in the tendering stages, according to the government release.
As per the data available from the Central Electricity Authority, solar, at around 44 GW (as of July 31, 2021), accounts for 44% of India's installed RE capacity, and wind close to 40 GW.
India has set ambitious RE targets of 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.
The achievement of an installed RE capacity of 100 GW is an important milestone in India’s journey towards its target of 450 GW by 2030.

The battery is based on a low-cobalt, nickel-rich layered cathode known as NCM88, which the scientists said offers a high energy density and improved stability for the battery compared to commercially available organic electrolytes known as LP30. “In the LP30 electrolyte, particle cracks occur on the cathode,” HIU professor, Stefano Passerini explained. “The electrolyte reacts within these cracks and destroys the structure and thick, moss-like lithium-containing layer forms on the cathode.”
According to the researchers, this reaction negatively impacts the battery stability and is currently the main issue preventing their technical and commercial maturity. In order to address this matter, they used a low-volatility and non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) incorporating two anions known as bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI).
They further explained that the combination of the new cathode and electrolyte favors the formation of a cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer in the electrolyte which protects the NCM88 surface against detrimental reactions with the electrolyte itself, thus avoiding the formation of microcracks. The dual-anion electrolyte is also said to show compatibility with the lithium metal and the high-voltage positive-electrode material used for the device.
“This electrolyte enables initial specific capacity of 214 mAh g−1 and outstanding capacity retention of 88% over 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.94%,” the German group said, noting that the new configuration of the electrolyte significantly reduces the structural changes in the nickel-rich cathode. The Coulombic efficiency is the ratio of discharge capacity to charge capacity within the same cycle.
All the details on the battery can be found in the paper Dual-anion ionic liquid electrolyte enables stable Ni-rich cathodes in lithium-metal batteries, which was recently published in Joule.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/13/blue-is-not-the-new-green/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 13, 2021",Blue is not the new green,"Proponents of blue hydrogen produced with fossil fuels and carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) technologies often present it as a cleaner alternative to hydrogen produced with the steam methane reforming (SMR) process, or so-called “gray hydrogen,” which is now the prevailing generation source globally. Blue hydrogen advocates also view it as a potential partner for green hydrogen produced with renewables in facilitating an emissions-free energy transition.
The blue fuel, however, is not as green as described, according to a new study from Stanford University and Cornell University. The research concludes that the CO2 footprint of hydrogen produced with fossil fuels is more than 20% greater than heat generated by natural gas or coal and around 60% greater than burning diesel oil for heat.
“We emphasize that our analysis in this paper is a best-case scenario for blue hydrogen,” the scientists said. “It assumes that the carbon dioxide that is captured can indeed be stored indefinitely for decades and centuries into the future.”
They said that blue hydrogen emissions include carbon dioxide and unburned fugitive methane and said that their modeling considered the lifecycle emissions linked to the mining, transport, storage, and use of methane. They considered several CCUS techniques for blue hydrogen, including the carbon dioxide released by the SMR process, and the removal of additional carbon dioxide from the gases created by burning methane to provide the heat and high pressure needed to drive the SMR process. They also looked at the carbon dioxide and methane from the energy used to produce electricity for the carbon-capture equipment.
According to their modeling, the carbon dioxide emissions of blue hydrogen were only between 9% and 12% lower than those of gray hydrogen.
“While carbon dioxide emissions are lower, fugitive methane emissions for blue hydrogen are higher than for gray hydrogen because of an increased use of natural gas to power the carbon capture,” the research group explained.
Fugitive methane emissions are estimated at 43 g CO2 equivalent per megajoule of hydrogen produced, the researchers said. They defined the recent bet on blue hydrogen by many fossil fuel companies as a “distraction,” and they argued that it might only delay the much-needed decarbonization of the global economy.
“We further note that much of the push for using hydrogen for energy since 2017 has come from the Hydrogen Council, a group established by the oil and gas industry specifically to promote hydrogen, with a major emphasis on blue hydrogen,” they said.
They described their findings in “How green is blue hydrogen?,” which was recently published in Energy Science & Engineering.

“This product is designed for anybody who wants to take the renewable energy step without having to spend too much money and looking for a fast return on investment,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “It allows people to immediately start producing and consuming their own electricity.”
The device has an output of 315 W and is equipped with a micro-inverter. It measures 170 cm x 108 cm x 12.5 cm and weighs 42.5 kg. The total weight of the module, which includes four 13-liter ballast tanks that can be filled with water, can be raised to up to 94.5 kg if it is used outdoors.
The panel's nominal output current is 1.3 A and the nominal voltage is 230 V. It also comes with a 5-meter cable that can be connected to a socket. Up to three panels can be plugged together through special connecting cables provided by the company.
“The efficiency of the product is around 18%, calculated by multiplying the efficiency of the solar panel and the micro-inverter used,” the spokesperson explained. 
The module features monocrystalline half-cut solar cells provided by Chinese manufacturer Phono Solar Technology. The module frame is Supersola's proprietary design, with some parts being produced in China and some in the United States.
“The assembly process takes place in the Netherlands,” the spokesperson said. “At the moment, we are in the process of scaling our production process and we hope to reach a capacity of 100 modules per week.”
The manufacturer said an average module can provide 370 kWh per year in France, which corresponds to savings of about 15% per year on the average household's electricity bill. In terms of power supply, a single panel can cover the equivalent of the annual consumption of a household's domestic appliances, according to the manufacturer.
The solar module comes with a 15-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty.
“For the entire product we offer a five-year product warranty,” the company said, adding that the panel is currently being sold for €699 ($820), including VAT.
*The article was updated on August 18 to reflect that Supersola is based in the Netherlands and not in France, as we previously reported.

Australian renewables developer Edify Energy and U.K.-based investor Octopus Group have deployed technology provider Fluence’s artificial intelligence-based trading platform to optimize the trading of the 333 MW Darlington Point Solar Farm in southwestern New South Wales.
Darlington Point, which is jointly owned by Edify and Octopus, is the largest solar farm connected to the National Electricity Market (NEM). It features an estimated 1,000,000 solar modules spread over 1,000 hectares and an output equivalent to powering about 115,000 Australian homes.
Octopus has confirmed that U.S.-based technology provider Fluence’s AI-powered trading platform will be deployed to ensure that the project maximizes generation during favorable market conditions. It will allow the installation to respond to market price signals to avoid generation at times of over-supply and negative prices.
“We are always striving to find innovative solutions that will improve asset performance for our investors,” said Octopus Australia Managing Director Sam Reynolds. “Solutions like this will help maximise revenue and investor returns by reducing price volatility, minimising costs and mitigating constraints.”
Darlington Point has a signed power purchase agreement (PPA) with Delta Electricity, the owner of the Vales Point coal-fired power station, for 150 MW, or approximately 55% of its output.
A 100 MW/ 200 MWh lithium-ion battery project is also set to be constructed alongside the solar farm. Earlier this year, the state government announced a AUD 3.2 billion ($2.4 billion), 10-year contract with Edify and Shell Energy. The Riverina Energy Storage System, to be built by early 2023 and operated by Edify, will provide critical dispatchable electricity prior to the closure of the Liddell Power Station.
Australia’s energy market is among the most complex in the world, with energy and ancillary services requiring assets to trade at five-minute intervals, while integrating increasing amounts of variable renewable energy. Renewable energy generation and battery asset operators in the NEM have to deal with exposure to negative prices, physical grid constraints, frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) costs, and managing trading strategies.
Automated bidding solutions are becoming a critical tool for asset owners in the NEM, where renewable energy assets need extremely accurate price forecasting capabilities to navigate “an increasingly volatile market,” said Fluence Chief Digital Officer Seyed Madaeni. “The deployment of our AI-based trading platform at the largest solar farm in the NEM confirms that automated bidding tools are now firmly established as critical tools for operating renewable assets in the NEM.”
Fluence, the result of a joint venture between U.S. utility AES and global power giant Siemens, said that its trading platform analyzes thousands of variables to provide leading price forecasting and optimization using proprietary machine-learning algorithms.
Fluence claims it can increase revenue for standalone renewable energy assets by more than 10% and can increase revenue and operational efficiency for battery-based energy storage by 40% to 50%. It said the software-based trading platform is currently used to optimize about 1.5 GW of wind and solar energy assets bidding into the NEM.
The Australian Energy Market Operator has noted that 30% of grid-scale solar and wind assets in the NEM have started using automated bidding solutions in the past two years. Edify is among the developers that have embraced the technology. It has deployed an AI-backed trading platform at all of its projects to help navigate the increasing price volatility and maximize returns in the NEM.
The list of operational solar farms that the Australian developer manages and partly owns includes Daydream (180 MW), Hayman (60 MW), Whitsunday (69 MW), Hamilton (69 MW) and Gannawarra (60 MW).

Xos Inc., a manufacturer of fully electric commercial vehicles, has announced the release of Xos Hub, a mobile charging station for EV fleets. The tow-behind unit can be deployed in the fleet yard without having to wait for a traditional infrastructure installation, said Xos.
The mobile unit can simultaneously charge up to five vehicles with its CCS1 charge port connectors, and fits in two standard parking spots. It can hold up to 3 MWh of energy storage and has 480 V single-phase and three-phase inputs. Solar panels on the roof of the unit power the cloud-enabled control and safety system.
The company also offers an on-demand infrastructure-as-a-service platform for site evaluation, energy storage development, installation, and energy management services. The announcement of Xos Hub follows a recent business combination with NextGen Acquisition Corp.
As the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden announced its target of a 50% electric vehicle sales share in 2030 for the United States, creative commercial solutions are arising to address the need for rapid electrification. Charging access is often seen as a bottleneck for electric vehicle adoption, and Xos’ solution is one way to alleviate said bottleneck.
Work is already underway at the federal level to address EV charging constraints. Recently, the Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technology Office (VTO) announced a $62 million package for the decarbonization of the transportation sector, for example. The VTO said it will support the expansion of EV infrastructure, partly by hosting community-level EV demonstrations and installing EV charging within multi-unit housing, among other activities.
