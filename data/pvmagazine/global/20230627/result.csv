The French company said the platform started producing offshore hydrogen on June 20. The project will undergo real-world testing on a re-engineered floating platform connected to Central Nantes' SEM-REV offshore testing hub, which is already linked to a floating wind turbine. The compact Sealhyfe platform, measuring less than 200 square meters, has the capacity to produce up to 400 kilograms of hydrogen per day.
The Hydrogen Offshore Production for Europe (HOPE) project consortium has secured a €20 million ($21.9 million) grant from the European Commission. The consortium, including partner Lhyfe, aims to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale offshore renewable hydrogen production and pipeline transport. The project involves constructing a 10 MW production unit off the coast of Belgium in the North Sea by 2026.
RINA and AFRY have conducted an initial study on the feasibility of a direct pipeline linking the Gulf region and Europe for low-carbon hydrogen transportation. The two sides said that the results reveal the Gulf's potential as a cost-effective source of low-carbon hydrogen for Europe. The analysis demonstrates that existing infrastructure can transport approximately 2.5 million tons of hydrogen per year, but expanding the pipeline network would further enhance transport capacity.
Australia has granted approval for a AUD 51 million ($34 million) renewable hydrogen plant in Victoria. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said that the 10MW electrolyzer will be eight times larger than the country's current largest electrolyzer. The project, located in Albury-Wodonga, will use renewable energy from a Victorian wind farm to showcase the compatibility of renewable hydrogen with existing gas infrastructure. The renewable hydrogen will be distributed through natural gas pipelines, blended at up to 10 percent. Construction is set to begin in 2023, with the site expected to be operational by late 2025.
Toyota, Toyota Tsusho, and Mitsubishi Kakoki have agreed to introduce biogas-derived hydrogen production equipment in Thailand. “The hydrogen production equipment to be introduced will be manufactured by Mitsubishi Kakoki and installed in Thailand in November 2023 to produce hydrogen from biogas derived from local chicken manure and food waste,” said Toyota. The companies will collaborate on systems for the compression, storage, and transportation of biogas and hydrogen.
Hydrogène de France (HDF) has signed two deals to accelerate the development of its hydrogen power plants in the Philippines. The initial agreements were formed with the Mindanao Development Authority and the Philippine Department of Energy, while the subsequent one was entered into with National Power Corp., the country's main utility company, said the French company. 
Air Liquide has become an “official supporter” of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, under a partnership to contribute to reducing the event's carbon emissions. The group will supply renewable hydrogen to power some of the official fleet. 
Enapter has secured an order from UK-based Intelligent Energy Ltd. (IEL) to deliver a 1 MW AEM-Multicore electrolyzer. IEL makes lightweight hydrogen fuel cell products and will use the AEM Multicore to generate hydrogen to test its zero-emission fuel cell products. Delivery is planned for 2024.

And as more of these n-type productions make their way into commercial PV installations around the world, the industry is keen to see how well they live up to the claims of higher efficiency, better performance, and lower degradation rates that have driven the rapid switch on the manufacturing side.
The National Photovoltaic Quality Inspection Center in China is the latest to publish results illustrating n-type module performance in the field. The center took 20 PV modules – 10 n-type TOPCon and 10 p-type PERC – from Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar and conducted a test to compare their performance under identical installation conditions.
The modules, all bifacial models consisting of 144 half cells, were first measured in the lab, and then installed on fixed-tilt mounting structures at a 40-degree angle, at a site in Yinchuan, north-western China.

The energy generation of the modules was monitored with a DC meter at 1-minute intervals from September 2022 up until March 2023. Using data from both the lab and outdoor measurements, the group calculated the energy yield per watt for each technology by dividing their cumulative power generation by the average test power times module quantity.
After seven months installed, the results showed that the n-type modules (Group 1 in the chart above) achieved a 3.69% gain in energy yield compared to the PERC products. The modules were also monitored for degradation, going through laboratory characterization tests before and after the seven-month installation period.
These calculations, based on dividing the initial power minus the post-installation power by the initial test power, showed an average annual degradation rate of 0.51% for the TOPCon products, compared with 1.38% for the PERC products.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/27/a-snapshot-of-spanish-solar-as-election-looms/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SPAIN",,"JUNE 27, 2023",A snapshot of Spanish solar as election looms,"Are Spanish renewables-project sale prices tumbling because of the enormous success of solar in eroding daytime energy prices? Could the looming election have a direct impact on renewable energy development? To forecast Spain's future renewables market, it's important to first examine its past.
SES
Thanks to abundant sunlight, well-developed transport infrastructure, and large unused tracts of land, Spain is a natural location for renewables development, particularly solar.
Look back only as far as the 2000s, however, and Spain wasn't an attractive prospect for renewables investment. To attract clean power investors, the Spanish government had introduced subsidies which drove remarkable growth and, by 2010, Spain had become a world leader in concentrated solar photovoltaics (CSP).
Progress was rapid: renewable energy capacity doubled between 2006 and 2012 as the subsidies bill in the later year reached €8.1 billion ($8.83 billion). The overwhelming success of the subsidies, however, led to their downfall – that level of financial support was unsustainable, necessitating a policy overhaul.
In response, the government in 2012 imposed a 7% tax on all electricity and, by 2015, it introduced an even more radical measure – the “sun tax.” This levy targeted solar installations and even affected homeowners using solar panels for personal consumption. Suddenly, solar energy consumers were liable for the same grid fees as other electricity users. Owners of PV systems with a generation capacity of more than 10 kW had to pay a tax based on installed power capacity and the electricity they self-generated and consumed (albeit with some exceptions).
The pendulum had swung back – the heavy tax led to a dramatic drop in appetite for renewable energy investment. Pressure on the domestic and international fronts eventually led Spain to abolish the sun tax in 2019 – just a fortnight before a parliamentary election, many noted.
Since scrapping the sun tax, Spain has returned to rapid growth in renewables, attracting national and international investors at an unprecedented pace. Some argue this solar boom could lead to a significant drop in energy prices and instances of renewable energy meeting 100% of mainland Spain's demand corroborate the argument. Notably, on May 16, Spain achieved a key milestone when it produced enough renewable energy to power the mainland for a continuous nine hours.
Will that mean a drastic drop in Spanish energy prices? Is the nation approving too many renewables projects too quickly? Should taxes be re-introduced if prices keep falling? Only time will tell. Under the country’s National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030, the goal is for renewables to supply 42% of final energy consumption and 74% of power generation this decade, and 100% by 2050. The plan involves installing 30 GW of solar as well as 22 GW of wind, 5 GW of CSP, 3.5 GW of pumped hydro storage, and 800 MW of biomass capacity – a substantial investment.
Last year's geopolitical developments pushed energy policies and markets into new territory, with Spain leading the way by favoring a market-based approach. Investment decisions now depend more on energy consumers than on the government but, to maintain investor interest in a competitive global market, the country must efficiently process permits and licenses to become a top contender for solar energy investment. While the solar ecosystem has experienced rapid transformation, consumers are still catching up – a process that may take years. Right now, they have access to low-cost electricity during the day but this could change quickly, as increasing numbers of electric vehicles hit the road and home energy storage becomes common.
Spain's goal of producing 74% of its electricity from renewables by 2030 underscores its leading role in wind energy. It also relies heavily on nuclear power, however, which accounts for around 20% of its energy supply – and with those plants likely to shut by 2035, the energy landscape could look significantly different.
Such a shift brings opportunities for investment in utility scale batteries and other storage technology, including hydrogen and pumped hydro. The future of the energy market, and particularly its pricing, will be shaped by interactions between producers and consumers in a market that will look very different from today's.
Electricity prices will be subject to fluctuation, largely due to weather-dependent sources. In hydropower-dependent Norway, for example, prices have swung from near-zero during snowmelt to high levels in dry periods. Spain must be prepared for volatility. Alongside other EU nations, the country also needs to enhance transparency and liquidity in long-term contract markets, especially in the power purchase agreements (PPAs) so crucial to hedging energy prices for producers and consumers. Expectations related to spot prices, risk-taking ability, and trading strategies will impact PPA prices.
The current price forecasts are positive and suggest strong investment interest will continue. With the lifespan of projects incorporating 30 years to 35 years, however, investment decisions must be guided by thorough analysis and if expected prices dip below the cost of new plants, investment could stall. At the moment, though, experts predict offshore wind will drive future price levels in Western Europe and they are likely to be higher than solar energy production costs. That bodes well for Spanish solar investment.
As Spain reshapes its energy system, the relationship between producers and consumers must remain efficient. An open and effective market system is crucial to fully realizing Spain's renewables potential. Consumers would benefit from dual-access tariffs offering both long-term fixed prices and spot-market levels. This allows adjustments in energy consumption based on hourly prices and the selling of surplus solar power back into the market.
Having navigated a challenging journey over the past 20 years, Spain seems to have found the right path in terms of renewables. Happily, the snap Spanish election appears unlikely to cause major changes in direction as, having learned from previous policy errors, Spain appears set on maintaining investor confidence and drawing foreign infrastructure support.
As the global shift towards greener energy intensifies, the country’s progress can be viewed as an instructive example. The challenges to renewable energy supremacy are significant but with determination, adaptability, and strategic planning, Spain increasingly appears to be one of the best-positioned countries to achieve it.

It was engineer Geoff Elwood’s experience of lockdown in the Australian outback that inspired him to develop a new range of mobile solar generators, he says. With 7.2 kWh of storage and 6 kW of power, Decarbon Venture says its products are the most powerful mobile generators on the market today and outdo gas rivals.
“They are also much lighter and less expensive to operate than equivalent gas-powered generators,” said Eldwood.
The DCV AirBase ecosystem includes foldable 400 W solar panels which connect to a semi-solid state battery. The storage component is modular and comes in three variations:
The system is designed for car camping, boating, off-grid living, and potentially home backups. This is a highly popular market segment among Chinese manufacturers, with a multitude of such products on display at the Smart Energy Conference in May.
Decarbon Venture, however, emphasizes its Australian-outback readiness – which is a decidedly tough natural environment. The company also says it is the first such product to allow batteries to be removed and replaced with fresh batteries without powering down.
“I wanted to build an evergreen solution that uses modular power cells that can be swapped when needed, and can be scaled up or down,” Elwood said.
Decarbon Venture’s family of AirBase generators will initially be sold through a Kickstarter campaign in late August.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/27/novel-non-contact-soldering-technique-for-ribbon-tabbing-in-solar-cell-manufacturing/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 27, 2023",Novel non-contact soldering technique for ribbon tabbing in solar cell manufacturing,"Researchers at the University of Oulu in Finland have developed a non-contact soldering technique for tabbing the ribbon of PV cells that may reportedly reduce thermal and mechanical stress in solar cell production, thus avoiding the risk of cracks, disconnected wiring, and hotspots.
The scientists said that mitigating thermo-mechanical stress in solder joints is challenging, as it occurs between two types of material at high process temperatures. “The risk of fatigue-caused damages during operation will increase, leading to elevated series resistance losses, which can create a major challenge in optimizing the interconnection soldering process,” they explained.
The newly developed technique consists of an eddy current soldering method that must be applied through a layer of glass. Eddy current, which is produced by anything that causes a change in the intensity or direction of a magnetic field in a conductor, is a non-destructive method that can be performed on conductive materials.
The Finnish group tested this process on a polycrystalline silicon solar cell measuring 52 mm x 19 mm x 0.21 mm and featuring one silver busbar with a width of 1.8 mm on the front and a 1.8 mm continuous soldering pad on the rear. Soldering operations were conducted using a microscopic cover glass slide with a size of 76 mm x 26 mm x 1 mm and with solder-coated copper ribbons made of basic lead solar alloy Sn63Pb37 at a melting temperature ranging from 183 C to 190 C.
“Small weights (34.4 g each) were placed at the end of the glass plate to ensure proper contact between the ribbon and the silver busbar,” the academics said, noting that the heating source used was a Power Cube 32/900 high-frequency generator provided by US-based CEIA, with the heating coil maintaining a distance of around 2.5 mm.
The scientists claim that this setting and the induced eddy currents generate localized heat without any direct contact heating coil.
Through a series of testing and microstructural analyses, they have been able to ascertain that no additional cracks or damages were detected in the soldered cells, with the exception of a few samples. They also verified that a longer exposure time is preferable to avoid microcracks within the solder joint configuration.

They concluded that the new method is technically and commercially feasible, as well as competitive with traditional contact soldering techniques. “In addition to ribbon soldering, the proposed technique is developed for use in the future study of repairing and refurbishing the used solar panel after failure or increased series resistance because of degradation due to passing the time in tabbing wires or busbars connections without disassembling the solar module panel,” they also stated.
The soldering process is described in the study “Eddy current soldering of solar cell ribbons under a layer of glass,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

With this technology, the module has a higher energy yield per square meter and is more resistant to wear and tear than conventional mono-PERC cells.
TOPCon technology will be developed within the Glass-Glass 410-430 W TEN HCD module, combining the efficiency performance of the n-type cell with the highly resistant Smart Vitrum double glass that extends the life cycle of the module and is resistant to extreme weather phenomena.
Solarday Europe decided to invest in the development of this new technology in order to offer its partners an innovative and durable European product. They understood that to satisfy the interests of their partners, they had to first listen carefully to the needs of the final consumers.
The TEN HCD 410-430 module is designed for domestic or small industrial installations. Its dimensions allow high modularity within the available space, along with increased performance and an extended life cycle. This line is designed to meet the energy needs of individuals or companies who, by choosing this module, can obtain great results from small spaces thanks to a reliable, durable, and most of all “Made in Italy” product.
Solarday Europe has also established a premium partner program to support and offer more benefits to loyal installers and resellers. Among the program's major benefits are five-year extended warranties on the entire product range, planned supply, and price stability.
Another interesting aspect lies in the marketing and training services that Solarday reserves for members of the Golden Partner program. The company will offer real support to members of the program, starting with the organization of co-sponsored webinars, intensive product training, shared digital campaigns, participation in targeted customer events and, finally, the possibility of having a dedicated space at international trade fairs within the Solarday stand.

Austria surpassed 1 GW of annual PV installations for the first time in 2022. Developers installed 1,009 MW of solar in Austria, in line with previous forecasts, according to PV Austria. This figure surpasses 740 MW of installations in 2021, 341 MW in 2020, and 247 MW in 2019.
At the end of 2022, the country's cumulative PV capacity reached 3.79 GW. Solar power accounted for 6.6% of Austria's electricity demand last year.
However, PV Austria emphasizes the need for more progress. To achieve a complete transition to renewable energy, at least 13 GW of PV capacity should be installed by 2030. Currently, less than 30% of the required capacity has been implemented. To achieve climate neutrality, approximately 50 GW of installed solar capacity would be necessary by 2040.
Vera Immitzer, managing director of PV Austria, explained that the high cost of electricity prompted individuals and businesses to generate their own solar power, driving significant growth. However, demand is beginning to level off, making it uncertain how the trend will progress.
PV Austria CEO Herbert Paierl said that while progress has been made, there is still a long way to go to achieve the 2030 goals.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/27/impact-of-solar-module-soiling-on-grid-forming-inverters/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SERBIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 27, 2023",Impact of solar module soiling on grid-forming inverters,"An international research group has investigated the effect that solar panel soiling in urban environments may have on the proper functioning of grid-forming (GFo) controlled DC-AC inverters.
Grid-forming inverters are inverters that can support the grid by creating adjustable voltage and frequency and can operate microgrids without conventional synchronous power generators. They can also act as primary mechanisms to improve grid synchronization, especially during low-inertia operating conditions.
The scientists utilized a new approach based on numerically represented I–V curves to assess the impact of soiling on a PV array operating as a hybrid microgrid system with storage and using single-stage GFo inverters.
In the proposed system configuration, two inverters are utilized, with one being the interface between the AC side and 11.2%-efficient PV panels with a power output of 60 W and a tilt angle of 32 degrees, and the other being the connection between the battery and the AC side.
“This kind of grid topology is universal in a certain way because it enables the operation isolated from the main public distribution grid,” the research team explained. “Each of the mentioned inverters is equipped with its own control circuit, which generally functions as a local primary controller, and can possibly be included in the hierarchy of the local energy management system (EMS), as a subordinate.”
The academics analyzed the I–V curves of the soiled photovoltaic panel while also considering irradiation, ambient temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity at the PV testing site located in Niš, southern Serbia, for 168 days. Through these testing operations, the scientists found that solar module soiling has a “significant” impact on microgrid functionality, with power yield being reduced by up to 30%.
“Namely, this leads to potential problems in the micro-grid stability in the case of power disturbances because the critical value of the MPP voltage can be easily exceeded and the entire PV system can enter an unstable operation mode,” they further explained.
Their findings are available in the paper “Performance evaluation of single-stage photovoltaic inverters under soiling conditions,” which was recently published in Ain Shams Engineering Journal. The group includes researchers from the University of Niš in Serbia and the University of Montenegro.
“Soiling is a particularly big problem that must be investigated in more detail in the future, taking into account the fact that the operation mode with GFo algorithms is favored not only in isolated grids, which is the traditional solution, but also in multi-generator grids, which is a modern solution from the aspect of significantly better dynamic performances,” it concluded.

“Designed to accommodate the trending shift towards high-power solar modules, the product supports a 16 A PV input current and is capable of a 1.1 times continuous overload output,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Its low startup voltage of 180 V ensures extended operational hours.”
There are nine versions of the inverters, with nominal power ratings of 4 kW, 5 kW, 6 kW, 8 kW, 10 kW, 12 kW, 15 kW, 20 kW, and 25 kW. They have an efficiency rating ranging from 98.1% to 98.6% and a European efficiency between 97.9% and 98.2%. They measure 465 mm x 335 mm x 200 mm and weigh between 19 kg and 23 kg.
The Chinese manufacturer said the new products come with two or three maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs, with a voltage range of 160 V to 950 V. The maximum input voltage is 1,100 V. The inverters also feature IP65-rated protection and have cooling systems based on natural convection.
They all have an MPPT efficiency of 99.9%, and a night power consumption of less than 100 milliwatts. The manufacturer also offers a five-year warranty.

Rondo Energy, developer of the Rondo Heat Battery, announced it has partnered with Siam Cement Group to expand its factory to a 90 GWh capacity. The Thailand facility currently produces 2.4 GWh of industrial heat batteries and is planned to be expanded to the largest battery factory in the world.
The Bill Gates-backed company developed its heat battery as a way to decarbonize the industrial sector. Rondo’s battery, called the “brick toaster,” is made of readily available materials like oxygen, silicon, aluminum, and iron. The battery stores electric power as heat in refractory brick, a technology that has been used in industrial heat storage for centuries.
The heat batteries transform intermittent wind and solar power into the continuous high-temperature and low-cost heat that the industry demands. This planned production expansion is expected to support a wide range of industries, from mining and metals to fuels to food production, at facilities around the world.
“Electric thermal energy storage can play a useful role in addressing the needs of the industrial sector, which has been slow to decarbonize. And, from an energy security standpoint, it is worth noting that this technology avoids the use of scarce and expensive materials,” said Pavel Molchanov, energy analyst at Raymond James.
The batteries store and dispatch heat without the use of combustibles, critical minerals, or liquids. With a Rondo Heat battery, solar and wind can deliver continuous zero-carbon industrial heat at a lower cost than fossil fuels, said the company.
The batteries can store more than 1 MWh per square meter, a high level of density that preserves area use at industrial facilities. Rondo said the batteries can be integrated into existing process heating equipment, allowing for significant emissions reductions without the need for a factory overhaul. The batteries are expected to operate for 40 years or more with no performance degradation.
Heavy industrial processes have proven to be one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize and account for about 24% of global emissions, according to Our World in Data. The 90 GWh of planned capacity is expected to result in 12 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions abatement annually, equivalent to removing over 4 million gas-powered vehicles from the road each year.
Rondo said its batteries offer continuous power with a 95% annual capacity while operating on input power as low as 15% capacity factor, or four hours of dispatchable power generation per day.
“Our studies of customer facilities are showing 50% to 90% reductions in emissions and reductions in operating costs of 30% or more,” said Jeremey Keller, senior vice president of Rondo Energy.
In early 2022, Rondo Energy announced the closing of a $22 million Series A funding round to support its technology, a renewable energy heat battery aimed at reducing the carbon impact of industrial processes. The funding round was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Energy Impact Partners.
“Over the last few years we’ve seen validation of our founding vision,” said John O’Donnell, chief executive officer, Rondo Energy. “Decarbonizing industrial heat is a trillion-dollar market requiring far more storage than the electric grid. The technology is here now. The demand is here now. This planned expansion means that the capacity is here now as well.”

The group secured a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for the project with Riyadh-based Saudi Power Procurement Co. in an auction held between 2021 and 2022. It offered a levelized cost of energy of SAR0.0700059 ($0.0186920)/kWh. The plant will have a capacity of 119 MW and will be located in Wadi Al Dawasir, in the Dawasir Valley.
Construction is expected to begin in early 2025. Chinese engineering group Sepco has been contracted to build the facility.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.

Researchers from City University of Hong Kong have proposed blockchain-based solar passports as an effective solution to monetize solar PV plant assets in India. It says that such material passports could fill in the data gap during the entire life cycle of PV modules.
The framework would allow verification of the origin, quality, and quantity of materials used in PV panels, thereby boosting recycling investors’ confidence and facilitating the secondary market for PV assets.  The researchers, Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar and Shauhrat S. Chopra, highlight the urgent need for integration of the proposed framework into existing or new policies and regulations in India. 
The researchers project India’s PV waste potential at 1.95 megatons resulting from the grid-connected solar PV facilities installed in the nation before January 31, 2019. The researchers modeled material recovery under three recycling techniques, namely, the standard industrial procedure as the baseline scenario, the thermochemical demanufacturing procedure, and the delamination procedure.
In the baseline scenario, the PV waste is directly subjected to shredding without removing a PV panel’s rear-side junction box. The shredded PV panels are then processed using metallurgical and induction sorting methods to recover materials. 
In contrast, in the thermal and chemical scenario, the end-of-life (EoL) PV panels are treated differently, where the junction boxes at the rear side of the PV module and cables are separated first. Thereafter, the remaining PV waste is subjected to thermal treatment followed by chemical treatment to recover materials. 
Similarly, in the delamination scenario, the junction boxes and cables are manually removed from EoL PV panels. The glass component is then isolated from solar cells during the cutting step of the recycling process, and thermal approaches are applied to recover useful materials from the residual waste.
The analysis indicates that the front glass of the PV module, which constitutes approximately 59.51% of its weight, is the most prevalent component for material recovery. Specifically, for every 1 tonne of PV waste, 595 kg of glass can be recovered, with the potential to recover around 89.6% to 98% of the glass under different recycling scenarios.

Columbia Law School of New York has released its third annual round up of anti-renewable energy legislation filed across the U.S. The report, Opposition to Renewable Energy in the United States – May 2023 Edition, aims to document local and state restrictions on, and opposition to, the siting of renewable energy projects from 1995 to May 2023.
The authors contend that “local opposition to renewable energy facilities is widespread and growing, and represents a potentially significant impediment to achievement of climate goals.”
The report highlights several particularly challenging situations including:
In the most recent version of the report, the researchers at Columbia identified no fewer than 228 local restrictions across 35 states. They also highlighted nine state-level restrictions that are so stringent they could block a renewable energy project, the authors say. Moreover, the team listed 293 renewable projects that have faced substantial opposition in 45 states.
The only states without significant restrictions or controversies, according to the authors’ criteria, were Alaska, Arizona, and Mississippi. For example, Yuma, Arizona, considered one of the sunniest cities in the U.S., has a long history of its power companies stifling the development of solar projects.
Most of the state-level restrictions targeted wind power, with only a few directly affecting solar. Two of these restrictions involved state bodies in Connecticut and Maryland needing to approve relatively small solar projects. In New York, the state government controls the approval of larger solar projects.
Before March 2022, the group had identified 169 unique local renewable energy restrictions. Since then, an additional 59 restrictions have been enacted, marking a 35% increase. Furthermore, throughout the year, 82 projects encountered contentious paths during their respective zoning processes.
This period saw a 39% surge in the number of projects facing ‘serious organized opposition’.
Concurrent with the strong rise of laws limiting renewables, is the fact that solar deployed a record 6.1 GW of capacity in Q1 2023 is set to deploy a record 30 GW of capacity in 2023. And while it is true that tens of projects have been rejected, thousands have been turned on.
