The lackluster results for nuclear compare to 256 GW of newly deployed renewable energy capacity last year, including 127 GW of PV and 111 of wind power.
“Nuclear power is irrelevant in today's electricity capacity market,” the report's main author, French nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider, told pv magazine, noting that power generation from nuclear power dropped by 4%, while non-hydro renewables increased by 13%. 
According to the report, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar PV dropped by approximately 90% over the past few years, while the LCOE of nuclear energy climbed by around 33%.
“We simply don’t have the time to waste attention, intelligence, manpower and funding for fantasy technologies that might or might not work, more likely, some time in the 2030s or 2040s, while affordable concepts from efficiency to renewables are readily available,” Schneider said, referring to the fourth-generation of nuclear power plants that several governments across the planet are presenting as a viable option. “Gen IV designs are PowerPoint reactors – they don’t exist. And the best example is Bill Gates, who started a company in 2006 to develop and promote a new design. Fifteen years later, he has nothing to show – no licensed design anywhere, no site, no prototype.”
Schneider claimed that the recent small modular reactor realizations in Russia and China are perfect demonstrations of the failure of the designs, as the floating reactors in Russia took 13 years to build – almost four times longer than anticipated. The small modular reactors in China also took a decade or more to be built.
“None of these designs are licensed in any Western country,” Schneider explained. “The only design licensed in a single Western country, NuScale in the U.S., is years behind schedule. Construction has not even started and a first unit is not expected to start operating before the end of the decade.”
Stagnating landscape
The report, which analyzes new-build programs in 33 nuclear countries and other potential newcomer countries, notes that 415 nuclear reactors were operating at the end of June throughout the world. That's two less than by the end of June 2020, three less than in 2019, and 23 less than the 2002 peak of 438 GW. The operating plants have a combined capacity of 369 GW, which is 1.9% more than a year earlier. The authors of the report also noted that 278 reactors have been in operation for more than 31 years and that six of them have been operating for more than 50 years.
At the end of June, there were 53 new reactors under construction, totaling 54 GW and up 500 MW from the end of June 2020.
“All reactors under construction in at least 12 of the 17 countries have experienced, mostly year-long, delays,” the report said. “At least 31 of the building projects are delayed.”
The report shows that only five of the 13 reactors that had to come online last year were actually completed. Two of the projects under construction were started 36 years ago. 
Last year, construction began on five reactors – four in China and one in Turkey. In the first half of 2021, construction began on six units, of which three are located in China.
“Over the decade 2011-20, construction began on 57 reactors in the world, of which three have been abandoned. As of mid-2021, only 15 have started up, while 39 remain under construction,” the report said. “Between 1970 and mid-2021, a total of 93 or one in eight of a total of 783 constructions were abandoned or suspended in 19 countries at various stages of advancement.”
A total of 63 reactors were energized over the past decade. The average time between the start of construction and grid connection was 10 years.
The report also shows that total investment in  the construction of the 2020 projects was around $18.3 billion, but for only 5 GW of capacity. A total of $303.5 billion was invested globally in non-hydro renewables over the same time period, including 132 GW of PV and 73 GW of wind, it said.
The LCOE of PV in the United States dropped from $64/MWh in 2015 to $37 in 2020. By contrast, the LCOE of nuclear power rose from $117 to $163 per MWh, said the researchers.
“Over the past five years alone, the LCOE of nuclear electricity has risen by 39%, while renewables have now become the cheapest of any type of power generation,” the report said. “Globally the cost of renewables is now significantly below that of either nuclear power or gas.”
The authors of the report noted that the International Energy Agency (IEA) provides lower figures for nuclear power costs in 2020. However, it recognizes that there won't be any improvements coming for nuclear, but major ongoing cost declines for offshore wind and solar.
“By 2050, solar PV costs are projected to be one fifth of those from nuclear power, across the EU, China, India, and US,” the report said. “In such circumstances, the building of any nuclear power plant would have to be driven by powerful non-market motivations.”
The report also provides insights on individual countries, including an update on the after-effects of the Fukushima and Chernobyl disasters, and the connection between nuclear energy and criminal activities. It also offers an overview of all decommissioning plans across the globe and potential newcomer countries.

The Kubuqi Desert project is planned to start commercial operation by 2025. The giant plant is expected to be connected to a storage facility with a capacity of 300 MW/600 MWh.
Manufacturers Longi, Jinko, Trina Solar and Chint were the winners of a 5.5 GW solar module procurement tender held by the China Energy Investment Corporation. Longi was the biggest winner, securing orders for 2.75 GW of panel generation capacity; followed by Jinko, with 1.4 GW; Trina, with 950 MW; and Chint, with 400 MW. Modules based on 182mm and 210mm wafers accounted for 79% of the orders awarded.
Trading in the stock of solar developer Shunfeng was suspended yesterday morning pending the announcement of a “very substantial transaction.” Shunfeng is selling off its solar farms to pay down creditors and announced a current-assets to liabilities deficit of RMB2.67 billion (US$413 million) at the end of last month.
Independent shareholders in state-controlled glassmaker Luoyang Glass will vote, on October 18, on plans approved by the board to ramp up the capital of two subsidiaries set up to establish solar module glass production lines. Having raised RMB1.98 billion (US$306 million) last month with a non-public issuance of A shares, China National Building Materials Group-owned Luoyang wants to pump RMB800 million (US$124 million) into its CNBM (Tongcheng) New Energy Materials Co Ltd project, and RMB600 million into CNBM (Hefei) New Energy, with the RMB580 million (US$90 million) balance to pay down liabilities and be used for working capital. The company has also announced its intent to take ownership of the TG Fujian Photovoltaic Glass Co Ltd subsidiary owned by a holding business set up by Taiwanese glassmaker Taiwan Glass Industry Corporation to attract investment from Chinese third parties. The value of the acquisition is yet to be determined, Luoyang said on Friday.
State-controlled manufacturer China Glass on Friday revealed its energy saving and new energy glass business unit, which includes its solar panel products operation, contributed RMB233 million (US$36 million) revenue in the first half, of the group’s total RMB1.14 billion (US$176 million). That translated into a new energy business gross profit of RMB79.5 million (US$12.3 million), up from RMB70 million (US$10.8 million) in the first half of last year.
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly on Tuesday denied a rumor, which it said had been carried in “press articles,” that it is exploring spinning off its main Jiangsu Zhongneng Polysilicon Technology Development Co Ltd business unit and listing it separately. GCL said the problematic press articles had arisen after it held a “discussion forum” with investors on September 1.
Power transmission and distribution equipment provider Chint Group yesterday said it will sell installed distributed-generation solar assets with a combined generation capacity of 489 MW to the China State Power Investment Corporation. The value of the transaction is estimated at RMB183 million (US$28.4 million). Around 484 MW of the small scale arrays will be located in Henan province, with the balance allocated for Shanxi province. Chint said a subsidiary will continue providing operations and maintenance services for the PV systems after the sale.

U.K.-based energy company Chariot has signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Mauritania to develop up to 10 GW of solar and wind-powered green hydrogen. “Benefiting from Mauritania’s world class solar and wind resources, Project Nour has the potential to allow Mauritania to produce the cheapest green hydrogen in Africa and to become one of the world’s main producers and exporters of green hydrogen and its derivative products, close to potential, large European markets,” Chariot wrote yesterday, adding Project Nour has secured exclusivity for pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for an onshore and offshore area of around 14,400km.
The U.K. and Welsh governments have approved the £58.7 million ($80.4 million) Swansea Bay City Deal’s Supporting Innovation and Low Carbon Growth program, which comprises seven projects, one of which concerns hydrogen. The latter project aims to enable “a demonstrator to prove [the] commercial viability of carbon-free hydrogen supply to fuel hydrogen vehicles,” and includes Swansea University as a partner. The university this year joined cement maker Hanson UK to install a green hydrogen demonstration unit at the latter’s Regen GGBS plant in Port Talbot, South Wales.
U.K.-based offshore engineering business Aquaterra Energy has signed a partnership with renewable hydrogen producer Lhyfe and offshore drilling contractor Borr Drilling to develop a concept for offshore green hydrogen production in the North Sea. “The organizations behind Project Haldane will develop an industrial scale offshore green hydrogen production concept through the deployment of an electrolyzer system on a converted jack-up rig,” read an announcement last week. The aim is to solve the challenges of grid connectivity to exploit North Sea wind, “providing an off take for the electricity produced in the immediate vicinity of the wind farm.”
Nuclear and renewables are both needed for electricity and hydrogen production, to cut dependency on fossil fuels, power analyst Aurora Energy Research wrote in a report on Saturday. The statement read: “Together, nuclear and renewables can provide the hydrogen volumes needed for net zero in 2050. Deploying large volumes of nuclear alongside renewables is economically efficient, reducing the net present value of total system spend by 6-9% (£40-60 billion [$54.8-82.2 billion]) to 2050.” According to the report, commissioned by British energy company Urenco, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions to 2050 can be reduced by 80 MtCO2e and gas usage in power and hydrogen by 8 PWh.
Swedish–Swiss technology company ABB and China’s PERIC Hydrogen Technologies have signed a memorandum of understanding to accelerate the adoption of hydrogen as an energy source. “Both companies will explore how integration of ABB’s automation, electrification and digital solutions with PERIC’s electrolyzers can help reduce hydrogen generation costs in the future,” ABB wrote today. The aim is for a detailed action plan and specific agreement to be defined within three months. ABB highlighted a focus on automation, electrification, digital solutions, rectifiers, distributed control systems, energy management, advanced analytics, instrumentation and telecommunication.
Saudi Arabian energy company Aramco, U.S.-based Air Products, and Saudi utility ACWA Power have announced agreements for the acquisition and project financing of a $12 billion air separation unit (ASU), gasification and power joint venture (JV) in Jazan Economic City, Saudi Arabia. “The JV is purchasing the ASUs, gasification, syngas clean-up, utilities and power assets from Aramco,” the partners announced yesterday. “The JV owns and operates the facility under a 25-year contract for a fixed monthly fee. Aramco will supply feedstock to the JV, and the JV will produce power, steam, hydrogen and other utilities for Aramco.”

The procurement exercise was once again under-subscribed as the government had initially hoped to assign 2 GW of new projects.
The GSE awarded 297.6 MW of solar capacity across 22 locations. These projects have capacities ranging from 612 kW to 80 MW and are located in the provinces of Sassari; Vercelli; Pavia; Isernia; Reggio Emilia; Trapani; Udine; Cagliari; Siracusa; Foggia; Parma; Nuoro and Caltanissetta; L'Aquila; Savona; Mantova; Palermo; and Latina. Among the selected developers, there are units of Engie, ERG, RWE, and Metka, and a series of special purpose vehicles that are not immediately attributable to well-known players.
Wind power was not the leading source this time, with 295.7 MW allocated across 12 sites.
All developers offered a maximum discount ranging from 2-2.6% from the auction ceiling price of €0.07/kWh. The lowest bid came in at €0.0686/kWh and was offered for a 23 MW wind farm. The lowest bid for PV technology was €0.0685/kWh. All the other bids were slightly higher in value.
In the fifth procurement exercise, finalized in May, the lowest bid came in at €0.0685/kW and was submitted for a 3.4 MW solar project. Overall, only 32 MW of solar were allocated. In the fourth round of the tender scheme, solar secured 20 MW and the lowest bid was €0.06819/kWh.
In the third renewables auction, held in October, the GSE had assigned 95.5 MW of solar capacity across four locations. The lowest bid – submitted for a PV project – was €0.06490/kWh.
In the second renewables auction, only 19.3 MW of PV capacity was allocated, across four projects. The lowest price, of €56/MWh, was offered for a solar project. In the first procurement round, only one, 5 MW solar plant was awarded, along with 495 MW of wind capacity. The single PV project will sell electricity for €60/MWh.
The limited success of solar in these exercises is due to tender rules that exclude projects on agricultural land. The Italian government hopes to allocate approximately 4.8 GW of generation capacity in the auction scheme, which includes smaller procurement rounds for projects under 1 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/28/seia-warns-of-us-solar-industry-death-blow-as-washington-mulls-tariffs/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2021",SEIA warns of US solar industry ‘death blow’ as Washington mulls tariffs,"From pv magazine USA
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has launched an attack against an effort by a group of companies that have asked the U.S. Department of Commerce to consider imposing tariffs on solar equipment imported to the United States from three Southeast Asian countries.
In mid-August, a trio of petitions filed by the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention asked the Department of Commerce to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
In a news conference on Monday, SEIA said that the petitions should be dismissed on their merits. More broadly, the industry trade group said that the tariffs would cripple the U.S. solar industry and affect the country’s plans to tackle climate change. The group said that almost 80% of all solar modules are imported from the countries, which include Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
George Hershman, president and general manager of Swinerton Renewable Energy, said that 90% to 95% of the modules that his company plans to import could be affected. He said that “100%” of the 7.5 GW of projects his company has in the pipeline for this year and next are at risk.
“This is absolutely the biggest risk and issue for our company and the industry,” Hershman said during a press conference hosted by SEIA. Hershman chairs the trade group’s executive committee.
Justin Baca, SEIA’s vice president of markets and research, said that AD/CVD tariffs could result in the loss of as many as 45,000 solar energy workers by 2023. The organization has also said that not enough capacity exists outside the three countries to meet growing domestic demand for solar.
Markus Wilhelm, CEO of Strata Clean Energy, said that the solar energy market is dependent on a global supply chain and is therefore “vulnerable” to possible trade disruptions.
The Department of Commerce has 45 days to initiate an investigation based on the petitions and can issue a preliminary determination at that time. It could decide within days about whether to launch a trade investigation into solar cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.
The group of companies filed the petitions through the law firm Wiley Rein. They asked the Department of Commerce to investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries. They claimed that antidumping duties on Chinese solar products have “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
The group of companies has asked the Department of Commerce to investigate the following Asian companies:
Stalled purchase orders
If the Department of Commerce launches an investigation, it could issue a preliminary determination in 180 days. A final determination could come next summer. Any duties would be retroactive to the start of the investigation, which is why companies are reporting an immediate effect on their business.
Hershman told reporters that the largest solar panel manufacturers have already said they will not deliver product for his company’s projects. “We are not able to issue purchase orders,” he said. He declined to name the panel manufacturers.
One question that the Department of Commerce will need to consider is the extent to which those countries add significant value to the manufacturing process. The petitions claim that little material value is added. Most of the economic and intellectual capital comes from China, where the manufactures are located.
The petitions allege that module assembly  has been located outside of China in an effort to skirt U.S. import duties. In an interview with pv magazine shortly after the petitions were filed in August, Timothy Brightbill, a partner at Wiley Rein, said that the group’s requested action is similar to action taken in relation to cold-rolled and corrosion-resistant steel from China.
After duties were put in place, Chinese companies were found to be sending steel to third countries for final processing before being exported to the U.S. In that case, tariffs were imposed country-wide. The scope being sought by the group of solar companies he represents is more narrowly focused on a handful of companies.
SEIA is arguing that more than two-thirds of the value of solar panels is created during the manufacturing process in the three countries. It said the manufacturing process is capital intensive and requires skilled labor and that “nearly all” of the critical technological processing occurs within the countries.

The IEC/EN61215 and IEC/EN61730-certified panel features 144 half-cells based on M10 wafers and a 10-busbar design. It has overall dimensions of 2,279×1,134×3.5mm and weighs in at 27.8kg.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. It comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.341% per degree Celsius and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, the manufacturer claims.
The module is fabricated with a white backsheet and anti-reflective, highly-transmissive, low iron tempered glass with a thickness of 3.2mm, and a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy and silver.
The Japanese manufacturer said that its half-cut modules feature three small junction boxes, instead of one; all with bypass diodes. These enclosures transfer less heat to the upper cells, which helps to extend the lifetime of panels while improving overall system performance, it claimed.

Developed with the support of the Direction des Services de la navigation aérienne (DSNA), which is the French government agency responsible for air traffic control, communication and information, the Be Greener hydrogen pilot project is intended at powering the site's radio communication antenna, which was previously operated through an off-grid power generator.
The system was built with two fuel cell systems with a capacity of 2.2 kW each, a 5 kW electrolyzer, and lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) batteries with a storage capacity of 23.4 kW.
The 19.8 kW PV system is used mainly to provide power directly to the antenna and, when it produces more energy than needed, the surplus is used to produce hydrogen which is then utilized to produce new electricity via a fuel cell system and provide power to the antenna during a period of up to five days.
If the energy needs to be stored for periods that are shorter than 24 hours, however, excess electricity can be stored in lithium-ion batteries for short-term storage. “The system is expected to reduce non-renewable primary energy consumption by 78% and greenhouse gas emissions by 79% compared to a conventional diesel generator solution,” said Caroline Mazzoleni, deputy director of smart energy at Bouygues Énergies & Services.
The system was constructed at a cost of €680,000, with the electrolyzer and the fuel cell system requiring €110,000 and €180,000, respectively. Partners in the project were, French start-up PowiDian, and BG Consulting Engineers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/28/large-area-perovskite-solar-cell-with-copper-metal-contact/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2021",Large area perovskite solar cell with copper metal contact,"A group of scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai has developed a perovskite solar cell with an active area of 2cm2 and a back contact electrode made of copper (Cu). “Efforts are on to improve stability with new perovskite materials and reduce costs at every possible processing step,” researcher Nikhil Chander told pv magazine. “Our work has focused on reduction of costs by utilizing copper contacts instead of gold.”
The solar cell was fabricated via a two-step spin-coating technique with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate; a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite layer sandwiched between a titanium oxide (TiO2) electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL) made of Spiro-OMeTA; and a copper conducting electrode. A similar device with a gold (Au) conducting electrode was also built, as a reference cell. “Copper or gold contact electrodes were deposited through a metal shadow mask by thermal evaporation to complete the cell fabrication process,” the Indian group specified.
The researchers explained that the copper, silver and aluminum used for metal contacts often lead to instability issues, as the diffusion of these metals with the Spiro-OMeOTAD or the perovskite layer has a chemical reaction that may be detrimental for the cell's performance. “Among others, inexpensive Cu has a comparatively higher work function with decent stability,” the academics said. The work function is the energy needed for a particle to come from the interior of a medium and break through the surface. This effect needs to be considered when connections between dissimilar metals in certain electronic circuits are made.
The scientists built a cell with an active area of 0.25cm and a larger one with an area of 2cm2 and their performance was measured under standard AM 1.5G radiation by using a 300-W xenon lamp as a light source.

The 0.25cm2 cell showed an efficiency of 9.78%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.99 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.82 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 53%. For comparison, the same device with the Au metal contact achieved an efficiency of 10.42%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.94 V, a short-circuit current density of 20.31 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 54%. The device built with the Au contact electrode was also found to exhibit a low leakage current density, which is beneficial for the fill factor.
When scaled up to the 2cm2 size, the cell showed a lower drop in the open-circuit voltage and a significant decrease in photocurrent. “The shunt resistance of both the Cu and Au-based devices decreased when the size of the devices was increased,” the research team emphasized. “It is an indication of increased shunting effects arising due to scaling-up of the device area.”
The cell fabricated with copper metallization showed an efficiency of 5.61%, and that based on gold, 5.92%. These efficiencies were tested over a seven-week period and the gold-based device was able to retain around 74% of its initial performance while the copper-based cell retained only about 35% of the initial efficiency. “After 14 days under ambient conditions, the color of the perovskite film looks even more faded,” it explained. “It is an indication of film degradation under the influence of air and moisture.” This degradation was responsible for a strong decrease in photocurrent values and the resulting fill factor drop.
The main conclusion of the research is that completely eliminating gold will not be immediately possible and, in this regard, the scientists recommend using a metal contact made of a thin layer of Au and a thicker, overlying Cu layer. “This will ensure that the perovskite layer is not in direct contact with copper, and the usage of gold is minimized,” the researchers stated. “In this manner, the usage of gold could be reduced by about 80%,” Chander told pv magazine.
The solar cell is described in the paper Stability study of large-area perovskite solar cells fabricated with copper as low-cost metal contact, published in Energy Research.

Indian state-owned hydropower producer Satluz Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (SJVN) has won 1 GW of the 5 GW of grid-connected solar capacity tendered under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme Phase II.
The recent tender was held by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) under the third tranche of the scheme. SJVN submitted a bid to develop 1 GW and won the full quoted capacity. The project is expected to generate 2,365 million units (MU) of electricity in the first year and about 55,062 MU over 25 years.
“These projects will assist SJVN in achieving its ambitious shared vision of 5,000 MW by 2023, 12,000 MW by 2030, and 25,000 MW by 2040 and simultaneously contribute towards RE capacity addition target of 175 GW by 2022 set by the Government of India,” the company said. 
State-owned power generators are required to develop all capacity under CPSU Scheme Phase II on a build-own-operate basis – either for self-consumption or for use by other government entities – using India-made cells and modules. 
New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) has already agreed to procure 150 MW of solar power from the projects that SJVN will develop under CPSU.

The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has instituted federal court proceedings against Neoen’s 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Big Battery (HPR) – widely known as the “Tesla big battery” – for alleged breaches of the National Electricity Rules.
The AER said the South Australian facility did not provide the frequency control services it was paid for.
“Between July and November 2019, HPR made offers to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and was paid to provide market ancillary services which allegedly it could not in fact provide, including when required to provide those services after a frequency disturbance,” the AER said in a statement. “The services are known as contingency frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) and they are required to keep the lights on following a power system disturbance.”
The AER said the AEMO first brought the matter to its attention in October 2019, when the Kogan Creek coal station tripped in Queensland. The regulator alleges that HPR’s failure to be capable of providing the FCAS in accordance with its offers and AEMO’s dispatch instructions “created a risk to power system security and stability.”
“It is vital that generators do what they say they can do if we’re going to keep the lights on through the market’s transition to variable renewable generation,” said AER Chair Clare Savage. “AEMO relies on accurate information and compliance with offers and dispatch instructions to ensure it can effectively stabilise frequency deviations. Contingency FCAS providers receive payment from AEMO to be on standby to provide the services they offer. We expect providers to be in a position, and remain in a position, to respond when called upon by AEMO.”
The AER is seeking pecuniary penalties, declarations and costs.
Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy opted not to comment on the specific allegations. However, in a brief statement, he said that HPR had repeatedly delivered on high expectations since opening for business in 2017, in terms of “its performance and market impact, positively impacting ancillary service prices and proving itself to be a critical component of the South Australian electricity network … Whilst we are disappointed by the AER decision, we will continue to maintain our collaborative relationship with them.”
The court action comes as Neoen faces potential delays with what will be its biggest battery in Australia, the 300 MW/450 MWh project Victoria Big Battery, following a fire in one of its Tesla Megapacks. The Victoria Big Battery, which is being developed near the Moorabool Terminal Station in Geelong, was due for completion in November.
The new Victorian battery is just the latest storage installation for Neoen. In recent months, it has secured tenders for the first stage of the Goyder South project in South Australia and a big battery in Canberra. The French company has also built the soon-to-be commissioned 20 MW/ 34 MWh Bulgana green power hub in northwestern Victoria.
