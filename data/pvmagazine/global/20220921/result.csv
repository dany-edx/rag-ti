French hydrogen specialist Hydrogène de France (HDF) is moving forward with its green hydrogen project in Swakopmund, a city located on the Namibian coast, in the administrative region of Erongo.
The company said it obtained new permits for the project from the Namibian authorities. “This important step in the authorization process confirms a favorable environment for the project. As a result, HDF Energy is moving closer to building the first green hydrogen power plant in Africa, among the first deployed by HDF Energy globally, “said Nicolas Lecomte, HDF Energy's director for southern Africa.
The facility is planned to sell energy to the Namibian grid. HDF Energy is currently negotiating a power purchase agreement (PPA) with local state-owned utility NamPower Corporation.

HDF plans to set up an 85 MW solar park relying on trackers and a green hydrogen unit based on electrolyzers, fuel cells, and battery storage. It will also construct a transmission line and a hydrogen refueling station. The site should also have a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant and a demineralization plant requiring the installation of a water pipeline.
The project was conceived in 2021, when Namibia initiated the Harambee Prosperity Plan II aimed at diversifying the country's energy mix.
HDF is currently developing the largest hydrogen production complex in the Caribbean – the Renewstable Barbados (RSB) project. The complex will combine a 50MW photovoltaic plant with 128MWh of long-term green hydrogen storage and batteries.
The US$100 million Renewstable Barbados project is a replica of the Centrale Electrique de l’Ouest Guyanais (CEOG) project – a PV park and 128MWh, hydrogen-based storage station in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, in northwestern French Guiana. It was launched by HDF in May 2018.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/21/vehicle-integrated-solar-kit-may-reduce-frequency-of-recharging-by-14/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Vehicle-integrated solar kit may reduce frequency of recharging by 14%,"The new energy technologies and nanomaterials (Liten) branch of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission has developed a vehicle-integrated photovoltaic (VIPV) prototype kit that can be used with any rechargeable electric vehicle.
The kit is intended to be deployed on a vehicle's roof and supply the vehicle's traction battery directly.
“According to our calculations, such a kit could increase the range of the demonstrator vehicle by 800 km per year and reduce the frequency of recharging by 14%, which is not to be underestimated for many uses,” the scientists said. “By way of illustration – in France and according to the 2019 Personal Mobility Survey of the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion – 35.7% of home-to-work journeys are less than 5 km away.”
The prototype kit consists of a 145 W photovoltaic panel, a magnetic rear panel and an MPPT charge controller. It also includes a battery and a micro-inverter that can now be used to inject the stored energy into the grid when the vehicle is recharged. “Tested on a Renault Zoé model, the remote data feedback shows the possible gain up to 4 kilometres per day when the days are very sunny,” the research institute said.
Liten expects to develop the VIPV technology with the support of unspecified relevant manufacturers. “At this stage of development, the kit does not allow the main battery to be powered directly, which is its ultimate objective,” it stated. “The system is non-intrusive to the vehicle so it can be adapted to all rechargeable models.”

The new module series, which will be available from the second quarter of this year, features a power output ranging from 420 to 430W and an efficiency of 21.7% to 22.2%.
The panel's temperature coefficient is -0.26% per degree Celsius and the manufacturer offers a 25-year product guarantee and a 25-year power output guarantee. The panels are reportedly able to operate at 92% of their original performance at the end of the guarantee period.
Furthermore, the Japanese module maker launched a smaller version of the same module in a series with a power output of between 390 and 400 W and efficiency ranging from 20% to 20.5%.
“Both new models are covered under Panasonic’s EverVolt AllGuard All System Warranty when purchased with EverVolt ESS 2.0, which covers solar panels and battery storage when bundled together,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The EverVolt AllGuard All System Warranty covers product performance and labor across all major system components, including 25 years of coverage for Panasonic solar panels; 25 years for the racking system; 10 years for the inverter and 10 years for Panasonic EverVolt 2.0 ESS.”
Panasonic launched its EverVolt storage system in September 2019. The battery has a storage capacity ranging from 5.7 kWh up to 34.2 kWh. The 5.7 kWh ‘mini’ version of the storage system has an average back-up capability of three hours, the 11.4 kWh standard option six hours and the 17.1 kWh ‘plus' product nine hours.

Specifically, the committee comprising eight ministers and vice-ministers, labeled a 200 MW photovoltaic project, set to be developed together with a cluster of lithium-ion batteries totaling 100 MW and a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of producing 16 tons of hydrogen per day, as strategic. The MWh of the battery component was not released.
The project represents a €226.4 million ($224.4 million) investment and is expected to generate 442 new jobs during the construction phase and 24 jobs while in operation, said the government press release. Bluesky300 IKE, the Greek subsidiary firm of UK solar developer Hive Energy, is backing it.
This is not the only green power project Hive Energy is looking to build in Greece. pv magazine learned that the company has at least 250 MW of additional PV capacity under its portfolio in the country that has been labeled as a strategic investment by the same government committee in the past. These projects are not yet built, however.
The so-called strategic investment projects are not new. Investors who believe their projects may be of strategic importance to the country may contact Enterprise Greece, a state agency promoting itself as “the official investment and trade promotion agency of the Greek State, operating under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.”
The agency then processes the investor’s application. Should the project fulfill the strategic investment criteria, it will be brought to the Inter-ministerial committee for approval. This process requires investors to pay a fee to Enterprise Greece for administering an application.
Such a fee tends to be worthwhile because approved strategic projects may be eligible for state funding, although this is not always granted. More importantly, strategic projects may take advantage of faster licensing processes across all stages of the project’s development.
Prior Greek governments have argued that strategic investment projects are necessary for the country to take advantage of investment of capital in key areas of the local economy. However, no government has thus far fully defined what specific factors make a project strategic. For instance, the Inter-ministerial committee has often approved photovoltaic projects that do not combine any innovative elements like hydrogen.
Strategic investments do not only concern energy projects. Last week, the same Inter-ministerial committee labeled the development of a hotel resort facility in Mykonos, one of Greece’s most well-known tourist destinations, as strategic.
* This article was amended on September 22, 2022 at 13.20 CEST. A previous version of the article wrote that strategic investments enjoy priority access to the grid. This is correct only for power projects labelled as strategic by 12 August 2022.

“The S-Series Power Optimizer is designed to accommodate higher power modules and bi-facial modules, which due to the rear-side module mismatch can suffer from even greater potential power loss,” the company said in a statement. “Providing 99.5% efficiency and supporting two high power, high input current PV modules, the S-Series lowers Levelized Cost of Energy thanks to higher yield and enables longer and more powerful strings.”
The optimizers are available in two versions, one for ground mount and carport applications and one for rooftop applications.
The two devices, dubbed S1200 and S1201, respectively, have both a rated input DC power of 1,2 kW, maximum efficiency of 99.5%, and weighted efficiency of 98.8%. The maximum output current is 20 Adc and the maximum output voltage is 80 Vdc.
Both optimizers measure 129 mm x 155 mm x 59 mm and weigh in at 1.1 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and support the connection of two PV modules in series. The maximum allowed system voltage for both products is 1,000 V.
For both products, the manufacturer offers a 25-year warranty.
“The SolarEdge Sense Connect technology joins an expanded range of safety features, among them the SafeDC technology that is designed to enable the PV systems’ DC voltage to be automatically reduced to touch-safe levels (1V DC per module), in grid failures or when the inverter is shut down,” the manufacturer stated. “Adding to these the Rapid Shutdown feature, installers can activate SafeDC at the flip of a switch, discharging the conductors to safe voltage levels within just 30 seconds.”

The cell has a p-i-n structure, which means the perovskite cell material is deposited onto the hole transport layer, and then coated with the electron transport layer – the opposite way round to conventional n-i-p device architecture. Inverted perovskite solar cells typically show strong stability, but have lagged behind conventional devices in terms of conversion efficiency and cell performance.
The scientists built the electron-accepting interlayer with a light-harvesting material known as 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) and carbon black (CB), a 3D cluster compound composed of boron, carbon, and hydrogen atoms. They varied the thickness of the PDI–Cb interlayer from 0 to 3.0 nm.
The Korean group built the cell with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a solution based on poly(triaryl)amine (PTAA), which is an excellent hole transporting and electron blocking material, the perovskite layer, the PDI–Cb interlayer, an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The academics measured the performance of the device under standard illumination conditions and found it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.31%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V, a short-circuit current of 23.81 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.70%. A reference device without the PDI–Cb interlayer reached an efficiency of 19.98%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.1 V, a short-circuit current of 22.86 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 78.74%.
“The devices adopting PDI–Cb interlayer showed enhanced device performance with increasing thickness of the PDI–Cb interlayer and reached peak photovoltaic performance at the PDI–Cb thickness of 2.0 nm,” they explained. “The PDI–Cb interlayer acts not only as a good electron acceptor due to o-Cb unit but also as charge transport due to slip-stacked packing structure.
The scientists said the cell was also able to retain 91.7% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 h under standard illumination conditions.
They introduced the cell technology in the paper “Electron-Accepting PDI–Cb Interlayer for over 22% Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Photo- and Thermal Stability,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/21/work-begins-on-60-mw-150-mwh-rooftop-solar-storage-project-in-australia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Work begins on 60 MW/150 MWh rooftop solar storage project in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Solar Bay has signed a 30-year agreement with Logos to install and operate 60 MW of rooftop solar PV and 150 MWh of battery energy storage to provide network and retail energy services to tenants of the Moorebank Logistics Park (MLP) near Port Botany in the New South Wales capital.
MLP is Australia’s largest intermodal freight facility. The 243-hectare site connects Port Botany with rail terminals and warehousing, acting as a national distribution center for interstate operations.
Logos, which was part of a consortium that purchased the facility in 2021 in an AUD1.67 billion ($1.11 billion) deal, will fund the construction of the 60 MW rooftop solar PV array and 150 MWh battery energy storage system with Sydney-based Solar Bay delivering the ongoing operation of the embedded network.
“This maximizes outcomes for all involved – from Solar Bay as the operator, to Logos as the investment and development manager, to our tenants, with the economies of scale at MLP offering a distinct, market-leading advantage with the amount of renewable energy provided through a microgrid,” Logos Australia and New Zealand head Darren Searle said.
Once fully operational the precinct-wide microgrid, which will operate at a combination of 11 kV and 33 kV, will be capable of supplying 100% of MLP’s energy requirements during daylight hours and will source electricity from an off-site wind farm to supply renewable electricity outside peak solar generation periods.
Solar Bay investment director James Doyle said the rooftop solar and battery storage system will connect into the high voltage network at multiple points, with complementary technology such as megawatt-scale electric vehicle/truck fast chargers also able to be integrated throughout the precinct.
“MLP is a prime example of the convergence between property and energy infrastructure that we’re seeing across Australia and New Zealand,” Searle said. “A precinct-wide microgrid facilitates the on-site installation of utility scale solar and batteries, providing tenants with the ability to access a vast amount of renewable electricity that matches the scale of their electrified operations.”
The combined capacity of the rooftop solar and battery energy will generate enough clean energy to power the equivalent of 40,000 homes, avoiding an estimated 67.2 kilotonnes of carbon emissions each year.
The companies said the impact of the MLP solar and battery microgrid will extend far beyond the site itself and will “play a key role in the state, regional and local economies given its size, scale and influence”.
“With a number of the significant loads at MLP able to be flexed in real time, the site will also interact with the National Energy Market (NEM),” the companies said in a statement. “This will … optimize the consumption of on-site generation and provide services back to the NEM when required, via demand response and the ancillary market.”
While already massive, the rooftop solar system is expected to grow even further. With more than 800,000sqm of roof space at the precinct, the 243-hectare site has the capacity to accommodate up to 130 MW of rooftop solar, capable of generating 183 GWh of electricity per annum.
Doyle said future stages of the microgrid could be used to meet changing needs of tenants, including thermal storage, hydrogen generation and supply, and related low-emission infrastructure.
“With over 800,000sqm of rooftop solar possible we can also assist in the decarbonization of transport and utilize surplus generation to produce low emission fuels such as hydrogen,” he said.

The Abu Dhabi-based organization has updated the analysis it produced in 2016 about the ten countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to map a route to net zero in the region by mid century.
The authors of the report – jointly written by inter-governmental regional body the ASEAN Center for Energy – concluded solar will become the dominant force among new power generation capacity by mid century, even in the most pessimistic business-as-usual scenario, which presumes backsliding in environmental ambitions.
In terms of the energy transition required to prevent catastrophic climate change, the study says Asean nations must have installed 241 GW of solar generation capacity this decade, at a cost of $156 billion, and can then spend $1.08 trillion to reach 2.1 TW of solar in a 90%-renewables energy system by 2050, or $1.25 trillion for 2.4 TW across the ten countries for an all-clean-power grid.
When it comes to adding in the grid upgrades, energy storage facilities and electric vehicles (EVs) and chargers needed to back up such a solar revolution, Irena said, $968 billion must be spent this decade, plus a further $8.77 trillion or $9.11 trillion, depending on whether the region retains a 10% fossil fuel contribution in its power mix – mostly from natural gas.
Factor in the entire cost of the regional energy transition, including other renewables, operations and maintenance expense, and a host of other investments, and the total bill for a 90% clean energy power mix in 2050 would come in at $28.1 trillion, with a renewables grid costing $29.4 trillion.
If those figures appear daunting, Irena says its base case scenario – based on current energy plans in the region – tops out at $28.3 trillion in 28 years' time.
That breaks down as a net-zero need to add 64 GW to 73 GW per year of new solar in Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Indonesia would need to add 24.2 GW per year of photovoltaics, starting this year; Vietnam 17.9 GW; and Thailand 11.2 GW. At the other end of the scale, Brunei would have to contribute just 70 MW annually.
In cost terms, Vietnam offers the lowest levelized cost of energy from solar, at $0.046/kWh, with Irena adding “most” other Asean nations have figures between $0.05/kWh and $0.075/kWh.
The archipelagic nature of the Philippines and Indonesia means mini-grids and standalone clean power kits will have to do some of the lifting, prompting a need for more legislation and incentives to drive their roll-out, the report added.
The 128-page study, published last week, estimated Asean nations will need around 11 million tons of green hydrogen by 2050, to be used in heavy industry, shipping fuels, and to balance out all that solar, along with grid scale batteries.
The region is lagging the sort of progress witnessed in other parts of the world when it comes to hydrogen strategies, according to the report, and what progress there has been is focused on exporting the energy carrier to big regional neighbors such as Japan and South Korea, which have not placed sufficient emphasis on green hydrogen. Producing blue or even, fossil-fuel grey hydrogen for those nations could lock Asean nations out of the global market, warned the report's authors, given the stress being placed on green hydrogen production in the strategies of Australia and the Gulf States.
Another potential energy transition opportunity for Asean nations lies in exploitation of the raw materials critical to renewables and EVs. Indonesia is a big supplier of the world's nickel and copper and the Philippines also has a big slice of both markets. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Myanmar have substantial rare earth element deposits, the report noted.
Going it alone on any of those fronts would cripple the solar revolution required, according to the study's authors, because Asean nations would have to co-ordinate regional interconnection and power supply deals to be able to support the vast number of solar panels that would be required to achieve a net-zero carbon energy mix.
