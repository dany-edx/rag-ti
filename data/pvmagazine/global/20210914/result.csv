Solar prices rose quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in every U.S. market segment, according to the Q2 U.S. Solar Market Insight report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.
The trifecta of price increases was a first since Wood Mackenzie began modeling system price data in 2014. In the latest report, prices were found to have risen the most for the utility-scale segment, about 6% year-over-year. Many solar developers have sufficient inventory for 2021, but will likely begin to see price increases in 2022, the report said.
“Price increases, supply chain disruptions, and a series of trade risks are threatening our ability to decarbonize the electric grid,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper in releasing the report.
Headwinds included recent import enforcement actions on Xinjiang metallurgical-grade silicon and two new tariff petitions that allege dumping by Chinese producers. Taken together, these actions could “significantly exacerbate supply chain constraints and increase solar system prices,” the report said.

Air Liquide said it will take over and operate the 255-tons-per-day TotalEnergies hydrogen production unit in Normandy under a long-term contract. “Connecting the unit to Air Liquide’s hydrogen network will enable [it] to optimize its performance and, ultimately, develop the world’s first low-carbon hydrogen network,” added today's press release. The French companies said they will carry out development studies for a CCS project in Normandy. Air Liquide will capture CO2 and TotalEnergies is expected to transport and store it at two North Sea CCS projects under development: the Northern Lights facility, in Norwegian waters, and the Aramis project, in waters owned by the Netherlands.
Enel Green Power Chile, AME, Siemens Energy, Porsche, Enap and Exxon Mobile joined a ceremony to mark the start of construction of Chile's first green hydrogen plant, in the Magallanes region. Electrolysis will take place in Cabo Negro, north of Punta Arenas. “This plant will produce green hydrogen through the process of electrolysis, powered directly by a wind turbine, which captures energy from the abundant wind in the area,” said Enel on Friday. “This will be the first plant of its kind in the country and one of the largest in the region.” The pilot project is expected to be operational in the second quarter of next year. The Chilean investment is Enel Green Power's first green hydrogen production project. The Chilean government wants 5 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2025 and 25 GW by 2030 and the 1.25 MW electrolyzer used in the pilot facility will be powered by a 3.4 MW wind turbine. Siemens Energy said the plant, in Chilean Patagonia, is expected to produce around 130,000 liters of efuel next year. “The capacity will then be expanded in two stages to around 55 million liters by 2024, and to around 550 million liters by 2026,” stated a a press release issued by the German energy company. Hydrogen from the project is expected to be used by Porsche.
The Indian government invited U.S. companies to bid for green hydrogen and electrolyzer contracts, during a meeting between U.S. special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry and India’s renewable energy minister, R K Singh. The latter “mentioned that huge bids for green hydrogen and electrolyzers are planned in the upcoming months,” read an official statement about the meeting. “Mr Singh requested the U.S. side to send their companies to participate in the bids. He also highlighted India’s upcoming projects in [the union territory of] Ladakh, on green hydrogen and green energy corridors.” The United States and India also launched the ‘climate action and finance mobilization dialogue,' one of the two pillars of the U.S.-India agenda 2030 partnership, which U.S. president Joe Biden and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced at the leaders' summit on climate, in April.
U.S.-based turnkey hydrogen solutions company Plug Power is opening a European headquarters in North Rhine-Westphalia, in Germany. Plug Power chief executive Andy Marsh and Andreas Pinkwart, minister of economics, innovation, digitization and energy for North Rhine-Westphalia, met in Washington DC this week to discuss details and make the announcement. “The initial, 70,000 square foot facility will house an innovation center with engineering labs and technical support; a monitoring, diagnostics and technical support center; a green hydrogen generator with … electrolyzer infrastructure on site; a shipping, inventor[y] and logistics center; and a training space,” said Plug Power in a press release today. “The expansion to Europe will allow Plug to serve new and existing customers while building relevant partnerships with leaders in hydrogen application.” The European base is a part of Plug’s strategy to bank on an expected increase in demand for green hydrogen. “Plug expects to produce more than 500 tons of green hydrogen per day by 2025,” said the company. Around 30 employees will work at the facility, which will open at the start of next year. By mid-2022, the workforce will increase to almost 60 employees.
U.S.-based hydrogen-powered heavy truck company Hyzon Motors has received an order for five, 154-ton trucks from Ark Energy Corporation, the Australian subsidiary of the world’s largest zinc, lead, and silver producer, Korea Zinc. “Under the order, Hyzon is obligated to deliver the zero-emission vehicles to Ark Energy by the end of 2022,” said Hyzon today. “Ark Energy will lease the trucks to its sister company, Townsville Logistics, which will deploy them in triple (three-trailer) road-train configurations as part of their short-haul fleet, operating on a 30km loop from the Port of Townsville to the Sun Metals zinc refinery owned by the group.” The fuel cell trucks, which will replace diesel vehicles, will be assembled in Australia.
U.K. green hydrogen company Protium is expanding its hydrogen personnel with a new board member and two advisory appointments. “The new appointments also coincide with the completion of its latest funding round to support the firm’s growth trajectory and commercialization strategy, allowing the team to accelerate client projects into full scale development,” read a statement by the British company. The material cash contribution could accelerate Protium’s pipeline – the capital expenditure of which already totals more than £1 billion (€1.17 billion) for projects across a variety of industries. Over the last three months, the company has announced its expansion into Scotland and Wales.
HyDeploy, the first project in the U.K. to blend hydrogen into a natural gas network, was hailed a success in a report last week after gas safety checks were carried out in homes and buildings in the trial area. Laboratory tests were also carried out on a range of gas appliances. “HyDeploy is a ground-breaking collaboration and has demonstrated very clearly that consumers can safely receive up to 20% hydrogen blended with natural gas without the need to make any changes to their existing appliances,” said Steve Fraser, chief executive of energy distributor Cadent.
Energy storage and clean fuel company ITM Power has reported a 6% decrease in revenue and project grant funding, despite a 30% increase in sales revenue, while also increasing its contracts backlog 44%. Commenting on figures for the last fiscal year, CEO Graham Cooley said: “2021 has been another transformational year for ITM Power. We attracted a strategic investor, in Snam S.p.A. and, through our fund rais[ing] in October 2020, developed a platform to deliver to market our next-generation product, the 5 MW Gigastack, two years earlier than previously planned.” ITM intends to focus on the production of electrolysis equipment for large scale systems. The ITM Power share price fell, however, after the earnings report.

The Oslo-based data company said a 1.5C world would require the 330 GW of annual solar module manufacturing capacity recorded in the middle of this year to rise to 1.2-1.4 TW within 14 years. The consultancy appears to have joined the commentators preparing to state the Paris Agreement will soon be beyond our reach, as it stated on Friday, limiting global heating to a less ambitious 1.7C would require a more manageable 1-1.2 TW of panel output – by 2045.
Rystad pointed to the rising input costs for module manufacturers which have driven up the price of solar panels and – along with more expensive labor – the cost of constructing solar projects.
With solar panel basic material mono-grade polysilicon having risen in price from $7.60/kg in 2019 to an expected $18/kg this year, Rystad also highlighted the soaring cost of the silver used in panels, with the precious metal having gone up from $550/kg two years ago to $850/kg this year.
The solar industry already consumes around 10% of the world's annual silver supply and Rystad estimated it will need seven times as much for the 1.5C, 2035 module target, unless manufacturers can reduce the amount used in products.
Copper, aluminum, steel and glass were also highlighted as problematic input materials by the consultancy, which said the 84% of annual solar panel production capacity which actually translated into shipments in 2018, had fallen to 71% a year later, and as low as 58% last year as Covid-19 wreaked havoc with logistics and labor, driving down demand for modules.

The price for 166mm, ‘M6' wafers has gone up RMB0.25 (US$0.039) to RMB5.34 per piece (US$0.82) and 158.75mm G1 products will also cost RMB0.25 more, at RMB5.24 per piece. Longi's 182mm M10 wafers will go up RMB0.30 in price, to RMB6.41 per piece. The second price rise since June means M6 wafers will be 64% more costly than in January. The price of the polysilicon used to manufacture wafers resumed an upward trajectory last month after stabilizing in June and July.
Solar panel rack and tracker supplier AntaiSolar has landed a 400 MW order from Ningxia Jiayang Energy Co Ltd. AntaiSolar said its products will be used at two solar plants in the provinces of Ningxia and Gansu. The tracker maker had previously announced a 200 MW order from Ningxia Jiayang. The financial terms of the latest supply deal were not revealed.
Solar developer GCL New Energy yesterday announced the sale of another 198 MW of project capacity, some of which may be in breach of government regulations on the use of forest land. Agreement was reached to sell two project companies which own six solar parks with a combined generation capacity of 198 MW, to state-controlled renewables business Ningxia Hanguang New Energy Co Ltd. The sale will book a net loss of RMB132 million (US$20.5 million) on the projects but will generate an estimated RMB901 million (US$140 million) for GCL, after the RMB2.67 million (US$414,000) cost of rectifying unspecified “engineering and compliance defects” is taken out. The sale will reduce GCL New Energy’s liabilities by RMB816 million (US$126 million). As part of the transaction, the seller may have to compensate the buyer “if any of the solar plants … is partially demolished due to non-compliance of the relevant government notice in relation to the occupation and use of forest land,” GCL New Energy said in an update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. A similar clause was inserted into the sale of 271 MW of project capacity between the two parties last month. The proposed sale will not be voted on by all GCL New Energy shareholders unless it fails to win the consent of 49% investor Elite Time Global and 9% backer Dongsheng Photovoltaic.

The Bio-Obsthof Nachtwey project occupies a surface of 9,100 square meters and covers a third of a plot of agricultural land devoted to crop cultivation for eight different apple varieties. Experts from the two entities explained that apples are currently being grown on the entire plot under four different crop protection systems: a foil roofing that blocks rain; hail protection nets that do not block rain; an agrivoltaic technology with permanent, light-permeable PV modules that blocks rain; and a tracking PV module tech that blocks rain only if necessary.
“Two different types of modules are used, with solar cells arranged either in strips or in a block pattern,” the Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “The aim is to determine to what extent the agrivoltaic systems protect the plants and fruit from harmful environmental influences such as hail, heavy rainfall, sunburn, frost or extreme temperatures.”
The electricity generated by the PV system is used for both upstream and downstream applications related to the production of apples, such as an electric tractor or an irrigation system, among others. The proposed system is also claimed to be suitable for the cultivation of pears, cherries, kiwis and other kinds of crops.
“Researchers will also investigate to what extent different approaches to light management, by way of different PV module configurations, influence plant growth and crop yields,” the Fraunhofer ISE further explained. “Other aspects of the system, relating to landscape aesthetics, economic viability, social compatibility, and plant cultivation parameters will also be examined.”
Baywa r.e. completed a 1.2 MWp array at Rini Kusters’ fruit farm in Wadenoijen, in the Netherlands in March. A first analysis of its performance showed the facility is able to reduce extreme high temperatures on the crop and also shield the plants from damp. The German company has also developed a special monocrystalline solar panel for agrivoltaic projects. These panels are able to absorb some of the incoming radiation and are set up in such a way that the air can pass through them. The natural airflow ensures that the atmosphere under the plants is cooler than ambient conditions, and much cooler than standard foil coverings.
The Fraunhofer ISE recently estimated the LCOE of agrivoltaic projects in Germany and found it currently ranges between €0.07 and €0.12 per kWh, for an average value of €0.093 per kWh.

With renewable electricity generation reportedly able to reduce water consumption by 95% – compared to fossil fueled power plants – a group of researchers from the Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT) has run the numbers through its energy system modeling software and concluded photovoltaics will do the lion's share of helping the nation realize its carbon reduction ambitions.
A paper published on Friday in the IET Renewable Power Generation publication of the London-based Institution of Engineering and Technology, predicted desalination will consume 19% of Pakistan's final energy demand in mid-century, emphasizing how potentially harmful plans for new coal plants could be.
Solar could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. pv magazine’s UP initiative this year shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
The report, prepared by researchers from Finland's LUT, stated Pakistan laid plans for new coal facilities in 2015 – when the generation technology was cheaper than solar and wind power facilities – under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor infrastructure program which is a central part of the former's Belt and Road initiative. With solar now the cheaper option, the water-intensive nature of coal-fired power could strangle conventional power plant options, according to the LUT paper Renewable energy in Pakistan: Paving the way towards a fully renewables-based energy system across the power, heat, transport and desalination sectors by 2050.
The researchers used LUT's Energy System Transition model to estimate the evolution of Pakistan's power, heat, transport and desalination sectors on a hourly basis in five-year blocks from 2015-2050, with no new fossil fuel or nuclear facilities approved after last year.
The result was a projected fall in the levelized cost of energy to €56.10/MWh in mid century, versus an estimate of €70/MWh for the current energy system extrapolated to that date.
The location of Pakistan's most promising wind power sites far from urban areas inclined the researchers to posit solar would meet 92% of total primary energy demand across the sectors in question by mid century, as “solar PV completely dominates the installed capacity in 2050,” according to the paper.
From the diagrams included with open access version of the study, that would appear to equate to around 390 GW of fixed-tilt, large scale PV capacity by 2050 to power the energy and heat sectors, plus around 60 GW of single-axis tracker mounted panels and around 80 GW of small scale installations, with the LUT academics stressing the important role ‘prosumers' would play in Pakistan's shift away from fossil fuels. Residential and commercial prosumers – who install panels and both consume their solar power and export excess to the grid – should be incentivized by a new energy regulatory framework to offer them payment for energy they export, stated the report, which also noted the vital role ever-cheaper battery storage and power-to-X technology could play in Pakistan's energy transition.
Power-to-X, or power-to-gas – the use of solar to generate the electricity to electrolyze green hydrogen from water – could be part of a decarbonized, synfuel-based transport system that would require a further 500 GW of solar capacity by 2050, according to the study, and using solar electricity to desalinate seawater could drive demand for another 460 GW or so of what would be a bonanza for the Pakistani solar industry.
As ever – in a report in which the researchers conceded their division of Pakistan into just northern and southern halves could be made more granular – the conclusion was a familiar one: “The actual challenge in achieving a renewable energy transition is not a technical or financial one, but the required political will to enable the transition.”

The No New Coal by 2021, The Collapse of the Global Coal Pipeline study published today by three environmental thinktanks and lobbyists, has garnered plenty of media attention with its claim there has been a 76% reduction in plans for new coal-fired generation facilities since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
The report, compiled by staff from London-based climate thinktank E3G, cross-city peer and lobby group Ember, and San Francisco-based fossil fuel plant tracker Global Energy Monitor, stated China is home to 55% of the world pipeline for new coal facilities and, together with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey, and Bangladesh, jointly accounts for 82% of plans for new coal plants.
With the report's authors claiming Chinese lenders are behind 76% of Africa's new-coal pipeline, as part of more than 40 GW of coal-fired generation capacity state bodies are financing across 20 nations, the nation is described as “the last remaining major provider of public finance for overseas coal projects.”
On the credit side of the Chinese climate account, the report noted, the nation has cancelled 484 GW of coal plants since Paris, resulting in a 74% retreat in approvals for new coal facilities.
U.K. cabinet minister Alok Sharma has called on policymakers to make history at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November by ending coal-fired generation – although his message has been undermined by the fact colleague Robert Jenrick is due to assess the merits of proposals for a coking coal mine in Cumbria, northwest England.
The global new-coal report has highlighted 16 nations which have plans for just one new coal plant apiece, and who can, therefore, add to the momentum by deciding to phase out the fossil fuel, with Africa supplying nine countries: Ethiopia, Niger, Morocco, Madagascar, Djibouti, Eswatini, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, and Tanzania. The Asian nations of Uzbekistan, Thailand and Cambodia are also on the list, along with Australia and Papua New Guinea, Mexico, and Poland.
However, with five of those countries – Australia, Mexico, Poland, Thailand, and Cambodia – listed among 14 global “laggards” highlighted by the report, there appears to be more lobbying to be done. Elsewhere, the study criticized a lack of progress in Colombia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Brazil, Mongolia, Laos, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.
Some 19 nations were described as “leaders” in the movement to phase out coal, including a rare bit of good PR for the generals in charge of Myanmar, whose regime sits alongside the U.K., Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Egypt, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Malaysia, Brunei, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Senegal, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Ghana, and Namibia.

The manufacturer added that the module was designed to be compatible with next-generation, module-level power electronics (MLPE), and in particular with the IQ7A micro-inverter from U.S. manufacturer Enphase, and the power optimizer P505 from Israel-based inverter maker Solaredge.
“We know our installer partners will appreciate a solar panel that’s easier to handle, transport and deploy,” Alvarez added. “Solaria’s goal has always been to develop a no-compromise panel that offers excellent aesthetics, performance, and reliability.” The module comes with a 25-year product warranty and would be available for sale in North America in March 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/14/antimony-trisulfide-solar-cell-with-5-84-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2021",Antimony trisulfide solar cell with 5.84% efficiency,"Researchers from the Northwestern Polytechnical University, in China, have developed a planar thin-film solar cell based on antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) with a power conversion efficiency of 5.84%. As a way of comparison, most of the antimony trisulfide cells developed to date have efficiencies close to 4%.
This kind of cell typology has, so far, been far from reaching commercial production, due to the low crystallinity and high resistivity of the Sb2S3 film, which affects the device's performance in terms of efficiency. Sb2S3, however, has a good bandgap, ranging from 1.70 to 1.90 eV, and a remarkable light absorption coefficient, and the scientists built their device by applying an additive known as 4-Chloro3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl Chloride (CSCl), which they claim has been able to alleviate these issues.
The additive was spin-coated on a titanium oxide (TiO2) substrate and annealed to crystallization. Spiro-OMeTAD was used for the hole transport layer. “The introduction of CSCl enhances the crystallinity of Sb2S3 film with [a] large grain size,” they explained, in the paper Effective additive for enhancing the performance of Sb2S3 planar thin film solar cells, which was recently published in The Journal of Materiomics. “And the two terminal Cl of CSCl molecul[es] have interaction with Sb atoms, which is conducive to increasing electron density around Sb atoms.”
Furthermore, the scientists explained the use of CSCl did not change the thicknesses of Sb2S3 film and that it raises the Fermi levels of Sb2S3 film, which in turn increases the driving force for the electron transport from the cell's Sb2S3 and TiO2 layers. The Fermi levels define the efficient conversion of the energy of radiation into electrochemical energy.
Tested under a standard illumination of AM 1.5G, two devices with concentrations of 0.5% and 3% CSCl additive showed an average power conversion efficiency of 4.35% and 4.98%, respectively. When the CSCl concentration was set at 1.5%, the cell achieved an efficiency of 5.84%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.62 V, a short-circuit current density of 15.85 mA cm2 and a fill factor of 59.61%. “The Sb2S3 films with 0.5%, 1.5%, [and] 3% CSCl additive show an obvious improvement in the light absorption capacity, which originates from the enhanced crystallinity of Sb2S3 film,” the Chinese group stated.

Residential solar panels are often sold with long-term loans or leases, with homeowners entering contracts of 20 years or more. But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they?
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system used, among other considerations. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel, per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements. When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20 to 30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision.
Degradation concerns
The loss of output over time, called degradation, typically lands at about 0.5% each year, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Manufacturers typically consider 25 to 30 years a point at which enough degradation has occurred where it may be time to consider replacing a panel. The industry standard for manufacturing warranties is 25 years on a solar module, said NREL. Given the 0.5% benchmark annual degradation rate, a 20-year-old panel is capable of producing about 90% of its original capability.
Panel quality can make some impact on degradation rates. NREL reports premium manufacturers like Panasonic and LG have rates of about 0.3% per year, while some brands degrade at rates as high as 0.80%. After 25 years, these premium panels could still produce 93% of their original output, and the higher-degradation example could produce 82.5%.
Some manufacturers build their panels with PID-resistant materials in their glass, encapsulation, and diffusion barriers. A sizeable portion of degradation is attributed to a phenomenon called potential induced degradation (PID), an issue experienced by some, but not all, panels. PID occurs when the panel’s voltage potential and leakage current drive ion mobility within the module between the semiconductor material and other elements of the module, like the glass, mount, or frame. This causes the module’s power output capacity to decline, in some cases significantly.
All panels also suffer something called light induced degradation (LID), in which panels lose efficiency within the first hours of being exposed to the sun. LID varies from panel to panel based on the quality of the crystalline silicon wafers, but usually results in a one-time, 1% to 3% loss in efficiency, said testing laboratory PVEL, PV Evolution Labs.

The exposure to weather conditions is the main driver in panel degradation. Heat is a key factor in both real-time panel performance and degradation over time. Ambient heat negatively affects the performance and efficiency of electrical components, according to NREL.
By checking the manufacturer’s data sheet, a panel’s temperature coefficient can be found, which will demonstrate the panel’s ability to perform in higher temperatures, said SolarCalculator.com.
Heat exchange also drives degradation through a process called thermal cycling. When it is warm, materials expand, and when the temperature lowers, they contract. This movement slowly causes microcracks to form in the panel over time, lowering output.The coefficient explains how much efficiency is lost by each degree of Celsius increased above the standard temperature of 25 C. For example, a temperature coefficient of -0.353% means that for every degree Celsius above 25, 0.353% of total production capability is lost.
In its annual Module Score Card study, PVEL analyzed 36 operational solar projects in India, and found significant impacts from heat degradation. The average annual degradation of the projects landed at 1.47%, but arrays located in colder, mountainous regions degraded at nearly half that rate, at 0.7%.
Wind is another weather condition that can cause some harm to solar panels. Strong wind can cause flexing of the panels, called dynamic mechanical load. This also causes microcracks in the panels, lowering output. Some racking solutions are optimized for high-wind areas, protecting the panels from strong uplift forces and limiting microcracking. Typically, the manufacturer’s datasheet will provide information on the max winds the panel is able to withstand.Proper installation can help deal with heat related issues. Panels should be installed a few inches above the roof, so that convective air can flow beneath and cool the equipment. Light-colored materials can be used in panel construction to limit heat absorption. And components like inverters and combiners, whose performance is particularly sensitive to heat, should be located in shaded areas, suggested CED Greentech. 
The same goes for snow, which can cover panels during heavier storms, limiting output. Snow can also cause a dynamic mechanical load, degrading the panels. Typically, snow will slide off of panels, as they are slick and run warm, but in some cases a homeowner may decide to clear the snow off the panels. This must be done carefully, as scratching the glass surface of the panel would make a negative impact on output.
Degradation is a normal, unavoidable part of a panel’s life. Proper installation, careful snow clearing, and careful panel cleaning can help with output, but ultimately, a solar panel is a technology with no moving parts, requiring very little maintenance.
Setting standards
To ensure a given panel is likely to live a long life and operate as planned, it must undergo standards testing for certification. Panels are subject to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) testing, which apply to both mono- and polycrystalline panels.
EnergySage said panels that achieve IEC 61215 standard are tested for electrical characteristics like wet leakage currents, and insulation resistance. They under go a mechanical load test for both wind and snow, and climate tests that check for weaknesses to hot spots, UV exposure, humidity-freeze, damp heat, hail impact, and other outdoor exposure.
Also commonly seen on a panel spec sheet is the seal of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which also provides standards and testing. UL runs climactic and aging tests, as well as the full gamut of safety tests.IEC 61215 also determines a panel’s performance metrics at standard test conditions, including temperature coefficient, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power output.
Failure rates 
Solar panel failure happens at a low rate. NREL conducted a study of more than 50,000 systems installed in the United States and 4,500 globally between the years of 2000 and 2015. The study found a median failure rate of 5 panels out of 10,000 annually.
Panel failure has improved markedly over time, as it was found that system installed between 1980 and 2000 demonstrated a failure rate double the post-2000 group.
System downtime is rarely attributed to panel failure. In fact, a study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters, the device that converts the panel’s DC current to usable AC. pv magazine will analyze inverter performance in the next installment of this series.

Since 2020, the wafer, cell and module segments have been rapidly expanding, bringing total capacities to 264 GW, 322 GW, and 365 GW, respectively, by the end of the first half of 2021. Each segment is expected to reach 365 GW, 439 GW, and 463 GW, respectively, by the end of this year. The global output of polysilicon is projected to reach 550,000 metric tons this year, which can supply around 190 GW of module production.
The polysilicon business outlook seems good over the short term. However, trade disputes between the United States and China bring uncertainty. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has issued a withhold release order (WRO) against Xinjiang-based Hoshine Silicon Industry, restricting imports of silica-based products related to the company and its subsidiaries. The U.S. Senate also passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act to prohibit the import of all goods produced in Xinjiang. As Xinjiang is a manufacturing hub for silicon metal and polysilicon, considerable discussions on the impacts of the restrictions have begun.
Looming impacts
While the WRO doesn’t restrict polysilicon imports, some module manufacturers face the risk of having their products seized, as their materials may come from Hoshine, the largest silicon metal supplier. According to the ‘Reference Hoshine Frequently Asked Questions’ published by CBP, importers of solar products entering the United States need to provide documents that can trace the supply chain and show that the silica used in the products was not sourced directly or indirectly from Hoshine or any of its subsidiaries.
Downstream manufacturers say it is difficult to provide such information due to the complicated nature of polysilicon production. As of August, modules of some manufacturers are reportedly being seized by CBP officers, with some being released shortly afterward. At present, the CBP scrutiny standard and specific measures remain unclear.
If the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act is approved by the United States House of Representatives and signed by President Biden, the import of all goods produced in Xinjiang will be banned. Polysilicon manufacturers based in Xinjiang including Daqo New Energy, Xinjiang GCL, TBEA and East Hope, as well as manufacturers that use silica from the region, will take the first blow.
Supply/demand forecast
Beyond the U.S., Canada and Mexico are likely to impose similar sanctions. The EU, with several member states having recently passed or drafted laws to tackle forced labor in supply chains, might be next. Australia and Japan have also voiced concern about human rights violations in Xinjiang and may soon follow suit with restrictions on goods from the region.
Xinjiang accounts for 35% to 40% of global silicon production. Hoshine, the world’s largest silicon metal manufacturer, takes up 20%. PV InfoLink estimates that 20% to 40% of polysilicon may be restricted from the U.S. or Europe.
The estimates show that around 20% of polysilicon will not be able to supply Europe or the U.S. if the WRO only applies to Hoshine. However, polysilicon production outside of Xinjiang can supply 82 GW in the second half and 196 GW and 218 GW, respectively, for 2022 and 2023, which is sufficient to fulfil demand from the U.S. and countries likely to impose import restrictions. Having said that, manufacturers should pay attention to whether CBP officers will seize an individual unit of import for investigation. Module supply to the U.S. market may be slightly impacted for the short term.
If the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act is passed, polysilicon produced by Daqo, Xinjiang GCL, TBEA and East Hope in Xinjiang will no longer be usable for the modules that are exported to the U.S. In addition, after deducting around 40% of polysilicon in other regions that use silica from Xinjiang, there will be around 33 GW, 84 GW, and 100 GW of polysilicon available in the second half of 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively – enough to serve the U.S. market.
However, if Europe, the second-largest market, bans imports from Xinjiang this year, polysilicon shortages will immediately occur in regions outside of Xinjiang in the short term. If this happens in 2022, polysilicon supply outside of Xinjiang will be in a tight balance and run slightly short in the high season. Under a 2023 scenario, overall polysilicon supply will be in surplus again after large volumes of new capacity come online.
It appears that both WRO and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act will not affect U.S. demand markedly. Whether solar demand will cause polysilicon shortages due to the Xinjiang issue in the next two years depends on the actions of European countries. Currently, Germany and Norway’s passing of laws combating forced labor in supply chains are variables that may impact solar exports to Europe, although Germany hasn’t come out with measures on import restrictions. Meanwhile, the European Parliament is drafting Xinjiang-related regulation and policy, and polysilicon market trends are subject to their progress and decisions.

The impacts of Xinjiang-related issues on the industry will be less severe after 2023, no matter when specific legislation is passed. Polysilicon manufacturers have made large profits over the past year amid soaring polysilicon prices. Apart from Tier-1 manufacturers that are expanding capacity at a large scale, REC Silicon, CSG Polysilicon and LDK – whose lines have been shut down – are evaluating the feasibility of resuming production. High profitability attracts new players, such as Xinjiang Jingnuo, Lihao Semiconductor, Baofeng Energy and Runergy, all of which plan to expand capacity outside of the Xinjiang region to hedge political risk. If these new furnaces come into operation as scheduled, total polysilicon capacity will far exceed demand, leading to fierce price competition. If Tier-1 polysilicon makers that bring capacity online earlier cause prices to decline due to surplus, new players that enter the competition later, or Tier-2 manufacturers that plan to reopen lines, may turn conservative about their capacity expansion plans.

Two hundred megawatts of solar, 400 MW of wind, and a minimum 600 MWh of battery energy storage – Energy Estate and Renewable Energy Systems (RES) are finally pushing forward with their planned 2 GW Central Queensland Power (CQP) development in Australia. Initial community drop-in information sessions for the hybrid renewable energy hub, known as the Moah Creek Renewable Energy Project, start next week.
“This is what we do,” Simon Currie, principal at Energy Estate, tells pv magazine Australia, explaining that the company specializes in ambitious hybrid projects that engage with all stakeholders, in the heart of industrial regions with good grid connections.
Energy Estate has more than seven renewable energy projects currently in train, including Walcha Link, a privately funded transmission project that will take most of the 4.5 GW of energy produced by its planned Walcha Energy Project (on which it has partnered with Mirus Wind) to the vicinity of the Hunter Valley’s soon-to-retire Liddell Power station. There it will be used to produce green hydrogen, or it will flow through existing distribution lines to pump up industry in the region with low-cost renewable energy.
Moah Creek will follow a similar plan, with the final combination of generation and storage perhaps still to be adjusted in response to consultations with customers such as Rio Tinto’s Boyne aluminum smelters, which employ more than 900 people on Boyne Island south of Gladstone, or a number of green hydrogen projects in the region.
“Have you seen what’s happening with aluminum prices at the moment?” asks Currie. “They’re off the charts, and the question is how to green it while it’s at those highs, so that people keep their jobs.”
Energy Estate and RES have what they believe is a no-fail shared vision for the central Queensland region, Matt Rebbeck, CEO of RES, said in the first edition of the Moah Creek newsletter last week. “The CQP project … is perfectly positioned to create jobs, deliver low-cost clean energy and support the competitiveness of the region’s existing heavy industry to lead in the capture of domestic and export opportunities in the transforming energy sector,” he wrote.
RES itself has delivered more than 21 GW of renewable energy projects around the world. It will take the lead at the community information sessions in Kalapa, Queensland, next week, given that the majority of Currie’s team is still in lockdown in Sydney.
Currie says he’s “a little in love with Gladstone,” because he responds to industrial towns, and the surrounding region is also a drawcard as a major employer, a productivity powerhouse … and a renewable energy opportunity.
“You look at Biloela, which is a cattle and coal town. Rockhampton is an agricultural center, Bundy [Bundaberg] which is traditionally agriculture as well, and then Gladstone. There are phenomenal opportunities,” he says, echoing the beliefs pursued by not-for-profit Beyond Zero Emissions, in its Repowering Manufacturing campaign, which focuses on the Hunter and Gladstone regions, and with which Currie is also affiliated.
He says people in Gladstone and Rockhampton have expressed their support of the Moah Creek project. In discussions with the community and potential offtakers so far, RES and Energy Estate have reminded them that central Queensland has seen it all – including coal and gas extraction – and renewable energy “is not an ideology, it’s just an evolution” of the energy offering.
Currie says the region has the ports and natural resources to take advantage of the energy transition. Where it sits, within the triangle formed by Gladstone, Stanwell and Callide power stations, it also has a workforce that understands energy production.
“I like to build projects close to existing power stations,” he says. “Like we’re doing in the Hunter Valley, because you’ve got the people there who understand power, rather than going out to places in country Australia where no-one has ever run a power station.”
The timeline for the Moah Creek Renewable Energy Project has preliminary ecological surveys under its belt, an indicative site layout, and community engagement is beginning. By late 2022 to early 2023, the partnership hopes to have received a connection to grid offer from Powerlink. And in the 2023-24 period, it anticipates reaching financial close so that construction can commence.
Its message to the surrounding community, expressed in the first newsletter, is that a project of this size will have an impact, not only on regional opportunities, but on the local landscape for decades to come.
“Given that, we are committed to working hard to deliver honest, early, respectful, considered and comprehensive engagement with the host community and all of the other stakeholders,” says Currie.
