The project, which is currently Vietnam‘s second-largest operational PV plant, was built under Vietnam's feed-in tariff scheme and is now selling power at a tariff of $0.0709 per kWh. The annual revenue generated by the solar park, which should produce around 700 GWh per year, is estimated at approximately $49.6 million.
“The owner of the plant is Thailand-based Super Energy,” a Sunrow's spokesperson told pv magazine.
Construction on the facility, which was built with Sungrow's central inverter solutions, had started in May. “Sungrow supplied the updated 6.25 MW turnkey solution, which integrates central inverters, the medium-voltage transformer and more devices in a 40-ft container, minimizing the cost of transportation and O&M,” the manufacturer said. “The solution features off-grid commissioning function, ensuring a shorter commissioning duration.”
Vietnam‘s largest solar power plant is a 450 MW facility completed by Ho Chi Minh City-based construction company Trungnam Group in October.

Daqo said Zhonghuan would make an upfront payment as part of the contract and polysilicon prices would be determined monthly.
TBEA-owned poly peer Xinte Energy is planning to expand its annual production capacity by 100,000 MT with a RMB8.8 billion (US$1.36 billion) factory in Inner Mongolia, northern China. Xinte shareholders will vote on whether to construct the facility after the company yesterday announced its board had backed the proposal
Panel maker JA Solar announced on Sunday its board had approved a plan to invest RMB5 billion in new wafer manufacturing capacity in Baotou city, Inner Mongolia. The planned factory would have a capacity of 20 GW and be built within 24 months from the start of construction. JA Solar said the investment would enhance its vertical integration by including ingot production.
PV glass supplier Almaden achieved turnover of RMB1.8 billion in 2020, according to its preliminary results. Net profit was RMB137 million, up 241.27% on 2019. Almaden said the performance was due to strong market demand for PV glass, especially for use in bifacial modules. The manufacturer estimates it will sell more than 100,000,000m2 of super thin (1.6-2mm) glass this year.
Shareholders in fellow manufacturer Flat Glass will vote, on March 25, on plans to issue 76 million H shares to refill company coffers after extensive spending on new PV-panel-glass production capacity. The business in June raised RMB1.44 billion towards the cost of a production fab in Chuzhou City, Anhui province with a 750,000-ton annual production capacity, and generated RMB2.48 billion in January to bankroll a further 750,000-ton second phase of the facility. The price of the new stock is yet to be determined. The A shares issued in January were offered at RMB29.57 (US$4.57) each.
State-controlled PV glassmaker Irico Group New Energy has held a groundbreaking ceremony on a project to construct 10 solar glass furnaces and production facilities in the economic development zone of Shangrao.

German market research company EUPD Research forecast that around 6 GW of new PV systems may be grid connected in Germany this year. If confirmed, this result would represent 23% growth compared to 2020, when the newly installed PV capacity reached 4.88 GW.
The company's analysts said that, although the business of around half of the German installers was negatively impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, most of them are providing a positive outlook for 2021. EUPD Research project manager Hanna Schmole explained that the pandemic is also having a positive effect as it raises awareness on sustainability issues, which in turn stimulates solar demand.
From the analyst's point of view, investors' motives are quite different, depending on the market segment.
In the residential PV business, the main growth drivers will be an increase in electricity prices and the rising interest in electromobility. In the commercial segment, different developments are to be expected due to the latest amendments to Germany's renewable energy law, the so-called EEG. Under the new rules, in fact, the feed-in tariff scheme for rooftop PV was maintained only for systems with a capacity of up to 300 kW. Under the previous regulatory framework, this size limit was 750 kW.
EUPD Research forecast that the strongest growth will come from the utility scale segment, as many projects selected in public tenders are expected to reach completion by the end of 2021.
As for large scale unsubsidized PV plants linked to power purchase agreements, the analyst expects that around 400 MW could be deployed. In February, Enervis published a market report on the European PPA market, according to which, there is currently a project pipeline in Germany for subsidy-free photovoltaic projects with a volume of 786 MW.
*The article was amended to specify that 4.88 GW of PV were deployed in 2020 and not 2019, as we previously reported.

The United Nations' committee on development policy on Friday recommended Bangladesh no longer be included on the international organization's list of least developed countries.
The UN greeted the recommendation by advising: “Bangladesh should accelerate its efforts to scale back from coal fired power plants and shift to clean and sustainable energy.”
It was a sentiment described as “very appropriate” by Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association.
“Graduation to [the] upper level [of development status] does not mean only raising per-capita income,” Barua told pv magazine. “Quality of life, environment, and health also has to be ensured.” The trade body chief added: “We should lower dependence on fossil fuel and raise power generation from renewables. The UN suggestion came for our survival, for our sustainability. It should be [a] non negotiable goal to us.”
Natural gas dominates Bangladesh's power mix and coal's marginal share has been raised recently by the commissioning of new coal-fired power stations, with more under construction. That is despite the fact Dhaka recently cancelled 13 long-planned coal power stations which had failed to take shape because of the high price of the fuel, as well as environmental considerations. The cancelled facilities, though, will be replaced by liquefied natural gas plants.
Mohammad Alauddin, chairman of government body the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA), said the authorities are already on track to respond to the UN request. He said plans for half the nation's electricity to come from coal generation–outlined in a power sector masterplan (PSMP) in 2010–had been reduced to 35% five years ago, and added: “The PSMP is now under revision again and will cut down coal’s share, considering facts and reality.”
Alauddin said Bangladesh's newly-enacted, eighth national five-year plan–for 2021-25–gives immense importance to the implementation of renewable energy projects.
The SREDA chairman said Bangladesh has 750 MW of clean power generation capacity, led by solar, and multiple PV projects are under construction.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/02/laser-based-p3-scribing-for-perovskite-mini-modules-with-19-efficiency/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 2, 2021",Laser-based P3 scribing for perovskite mini modules with 19% efficiency,"Researchers from HTW Berlin and Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) have investigated the influence of the laser pulse duration for P3 patterning for interconnecting perovskite solar cells, so they can then upscale them into mini photovoltaic modules.
They analyzed the electrical and compositional properties of the scribe lines with the final aim of establishing suitable laser fluence ranges for both nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) lasers, which can ensure robust processes for the fabrication of modules with high average performance.
“The knowledge gained from this study could be directly used in mass production,” researcher Christof Schultz told pv magazine.”This work relies on previous studies that investigated laser-material interaction processes and determined the influence of the laser pulse duration and the laser fluence on the electrical functionality of P2 scribe line.”
The so-called P1, P2, and P3 scribes correspond to the three scribing steps of the process for building the monolithic interconnections that add voltages between cells in modules. The P1 and P3 steps are aimed at isolating the back contact layers of neighboring cells and the P2 step creates an electrical path between the back contact of a cell with the front contact of an adjacent cell.
The P3 step, the academics explained, is often a source of undesired effects such as back contact delamination, flaking, or poor electrical isolation, due to residues that remain in the trench. These issues are likely attributable to interactions between the laser and the material that have not been fully understood to date. According to the scientists, issues with P3 patterning have thus far been reported for both ns and ps patterning.
The German group scribed ns and ps P3 lines on three-cell perovskite solar modules with an area of 2.2 cm2. The P1 and P2 parameters were the same for all the samples. They used surface-analytical techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), to analyze the morphology and composition of the P3 line. They also used spectrally filtered photoluminescence to map the distribution of the lead iodide (PbI2) within the scribe lines. The patterning of the solar module was performed with a commercial laser system, Rofin Baasel Lasertech.
The scientists achieved the highest power conversion efficiency with ps patterning – around 17% – at a fluence of 2.31 Joule/cm2. With patterning with a significantly more cost-effective ns laser, a higher efficiency of more than 19% was achieved with a fluence of 1.36 Joule/cm2. The scientists said these values are representative of a wide range of suitable fluences for successful P3 patterning.
“Fluences below and above the suitable ranges may lead to lower power conversion efficiencies for both ns and ps pulses,” they said. “Too low fluences would result in incomplete material removal and poor electrical isolations of neighboring cells, while excessively high fluences have a high probability of damaging the front contact layer underneath, due to thermal impact.”
The research team also found that ns patterning results in slightly higher open-circuit voltage and fill factor, which improves module efficiency. The analysis of the materials composition within and aside the scribe line showed that ns patterning results in higher amounts of PbI2 within the lines. Moreover, the ns laser favors the formation of a thin bromine-rich layer at the interface between the perovskite and the hole transport layer (HTL). Both the PbI2 and the bromine-rich layer are able to passivate electronic defect states at the edges of the scribe line and block charge carriers in its vicinity.
‘”Our findings apply to all perovskite compounds based on lead and iodide,” Schultz said.
The scientists described the scribe laser technique in “Improved Electrical Performance of Perovskite Photovoltaic Mini‐Modules through Controlled PbI2 Formation Using Nanosecond Laser Pulses for P3 Patterning,” which was recently published in Energy Technology.

Montreal-based start-up Edgehog Advanced Technologies, which has developed an omnidirectional anti-reflective glass for solar panels, has secured US$2.5 million in financial support from Sustainable Development Technologies Canada (SDTC).
“We are delighted to announce the launch of our project to scale up our technology,” the company said in a statement. The special glass is hydrophobic and is claimed to be able to reduce the accumulation of dust and residue, thus reducing the need for maintenance.
Thanks to nanotextures embedded in the glass itself, the glass created by Edgehog is claimed to allow a gain in energy production of 4 to 5% when the solar rays have a normal or perpendicular incidence. Furthermore, at the start and end of the day, when energy demand is greatest, the gain can reach 25%, the manufacturer stated. The technology is also said to eliminate the need for expensive and bulky tracking mechanisms.
The funds were provided by Sustainable Development Technology Canada, a not-for-profit organization that supports development and demonstration projects of new clean energy and sustainable technologies.
“Economic recovery must be built on Canada's leadership in rapidly expanding markets that are driven by the low-carbon economy,” said the government of Canada, referring to the funding awarded to Edgehog.

The CEO of KOSTT, Mustafa Hasani, and the director of Solar Energy Group Europe sh p k, Egbert Schnuse, signed, this week, an agreement for the grid connection of the solar plant, which is planned to be connected to the 110 kV transmission network through a new 110 kV line with a length of about 6.5km, the network operator said in a statement.
The plant is scheduled to begin commercial operations in 2022. No further details were revealed on the project. When built, the plant will be Kosovo's first large scale solar park.
The Kosovar government has made several attempts to support small sized and utility scale solar in the past. These efforts, however, have produced little results to date. In December, for example, Kosovo's State Aid Commission (KNSH) deliberated that the feed-in tariff scheme for PV installations not exceeding 3 MW in size, introduced by the country's Office of the Energy Regulator (ZRRE) in late November, was not complying with European state aid regulations.
Kosovo had just 7 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2019, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The country recently raised its renewable energy target to an additional 400 MW of capacity by 2026. That would be enough to meet a quarter of its power demand and would reduce dependence on aging coal-fired power plants.
Most of Kosovo’s electricity is supplied as imports or from two lignite-fired thermal power plants, the 40-year-old Kosovo A Power Station (with a 345 MW generation capacity) near Pristina, and the upgraded, 27-year-old Kosovo B Power Station (540 MW) in Obilić.

A Tennet spokesperson told pv magazine a “market-based system” would see renewables generators bid to accept payments for reducing output from their plants–peak shaving–or to curtail operations entirely for periods of peak generation.
The latest areas of the Netherlands grid where it is expected the volume of approved solar and wind power generation capacity will exceed network limits are in Noord Brabant and Limburg.
According to a statement made by Tennet last month, the 150 kV grid section in Limburg could be set to face congestion for the next decade. It is anticipated Noord Brabant could face problems for two years as plans are in place to split the Noord Brabant and Zeeland grid sections next year, freeing up capacity, and to further split Noord Brabant in 2026, en route to that grid section eventually being subdivided into five units.
The possibility of introducing incentives to reduce clean power generation is part of an investigation which, Tennet said on February 9, could take “several months.”
Tennet stressed it is also working on introducing new switching stations and connections and expanding and adapting existing switching stations.
The transmission company representative told pv magazine household solar arrays would not be affected as they feed power into the low-voltage grid. He added: “Tennet and the regional grid operators work hard to expand the grid where necessary. Tennet invests €2 billion annually in the Dutch high voltage grid for maintenance and expansion to make the energy system future proof.”

AE Solar says that with an annual capacity of over 1 GW planned by the end of 2021 in Europe, adding to the 500 MW of capacity it already has operating in Georgia, it will be the biggest solar module manufacturer outside of China. Taking into account its third facility, located in Asia, the company will have an overall global manufacturing capacity of 2.5 GW.
The new 1 GW factory, a joint venture between the Tier 1 German manufacturer and U.S.-based Energate Corp, which has more than 15 years’ experience in the energy industry and was founded by American and Turkish businessmen, will allow AE Solar to broaden its distribution network and presence in Turkey. Already, it says it has received huge interest from the market for its modules.
In addition to serving Turkish customers, AE Solar is planning to continue its expansion into the U.S., Europe, South America, the Middle East and North Africa. Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the company says it has experienced particular success, having sold 511 MW of PV modules there since last September.
Since 2003, AE Solar has established itself as one of the leading brands in the renewable energy industry for high-quality new energy products and services. Over the past 18 years, the company has grown steadily, broadening its portfolio and strengthening its presence in international markets. Today, it is operational in more than 90 countries and has been listed by Bloomberg NEF as a Tier 1 manufacturer.
“We are committed to maximizing the value of PV modules and to remain a trusted and reliable global energy supplier for clients’ long-term benefits,” says Alexander Maier, Founder and CEO, AE Solar. The company aims to drive this further by working closely with international partners and using the most responsible and innovative methods of operation.
In 2020, for instance, AE Solar introduced near-field communication (NFC) chips into all of its panels in a bid to protect against piracy in the solar industry. The chips allow customers to check the authenticity of their solar panels, via an app, and within a matter of seconds. This innovation has proved useful, particularly in preventing the sale and distribution of fake branded AE Solar panels.
AE Solar’s elegant Eclipse series of solar panels have been optimized for residential deployment. Delivering outstanding performance and profitability, they are a slick black color, which is an excellent rooftop choice for families looking for a more sophisticated style in their home environments.
“The ultra-black series of Eclipse is the latest evolution in our industry-leading aesthetically and efficiency roadmap,” says Maier. “Most of our customers from Europe want their roof to look chic, classy and sharp. That’s why we have decided to focus attention on producing the new Eclipse series, which corresponds to our premium customer needs.”

The Chinese manufacturer today published an exuberant set of annual figures which featured plans to accelerate new production capacity amid confident predictions the new U.S. administration would join China and the EU in leading the global solar charge.
Having added 1,000-ton-per-day-melting-capacity solar glass production lines in June and August–and with all its furnaces operating around the clock throughout the year–Xinyi said it is stepping up plans to add a new 1,000-ton line each quarter this year. Instead, the first facility was already operating trial runs in late January, the second is expected to be online this month and the other two should be up and running by mid year, the company said.
Despite “a year of challenges and surprises,” in 2020, said Xinyi, “all signs suggest that PV installations will continue to achieve robust growth in 2021.” The Hong Kong Stock Market update issued by Xinyi added: “The market supply of solar glass is expected to remain tight in the near term.”
On that basis, the manufacturer is laying plans for four more 1,000-ton lines in Zhangjiagang, in Jiangsu province, by 2022, with another 12 facilities potentially in the works, including in Anhui.
The global rebound in solar demand after Covid-19 disruption in the first half of the year, plus rising demand for more-PV-glass-intensive bifacial and large-format modules, helped drive up prices in 2020 and appear set to keep supply tight, with Xinyi pointing out it typically takes 1-2 years to bring a new glass production fab to life.
At one point in 2020, solar glass supply shortages drove prices for the material up 70%, although that followed a 17% fall as project development was hampered by the pandemic in the second quarter, to set a year-on-year average price rise of 12% from 2019.
With Xinyi shipping 19.6% more solar glass than in 2019, thanks to its new production lines, the company posted record gross profits of HK$6.58 billion (US$848 million), up 68% from HK$3.91 billion. The HK$9.99 billion revenue generated by the glass business–up 47% from HK$6.77 billion–more than compensated for a slight fall in income from Xinyi's solar project operation, from HK$2.33 billion to HK$2.32 billion.
The resulting profit attributable to Xinyi shareholders rose 89% from the HK$2.42 billion posted in 2019 to HK$4.56 billion, with the company noting the desire for a green recovery from Covid-19 had driven the significant government policy support “of some countries.”
With the company also developing its first low-iron-silica sand mine last year, in response to rising raw material costs, the only discordant note in its upbeat update related to India which, in solar market terms, Xinyi said, “has taken the biggest hit from Covid-19.”

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has released its annual status report on U.S. renewable portfolio standards (RPS). The report describes recent legislative changes, key policy design features, compliance with interim targets, past and projected impacts on renewables development, and compliance costs.
The key trends include the following:
Evolution of state RPS programs: States continue to refine and revise their RPS policies. Among other changes since the start of 2019, eight states enacted higher RPS targets or created new clean-energy/zero-carbon targets (Arizona, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, Virginia, and Washington).
Historical impacts on renewables development: Roughly half of all growth in U.S. renewable electricity generation and capacity since 2000 is associated with state RPS requirements. That percentage has declined in recent years, representing 23% of all U.S. renewable energy capacity additions in 2019. However, within particular regions – the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic – RPS policies remain a dominant driver.
Future RPS demand and incremental needs: RPS demand growth through 2030 will require roughly 90 GW of new renewable energy capacity. Growth also will require total U.S. non-hydro renewable energy generation to reach 17% of electricity sales (compared to 12% in 2019). Relative to projections from the Energy Information Administration, this amounts to roughly one-third of projected renewable energy growth over the next decade.
RPS target achievements: States have generally met their interim RPS targets in recent years, with exceptions generally reflecting unique, state-specific issues.
Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) pricing trends: Prices for New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) Class I RECs rose over 2019, reaching $40/MWh and remaining at roughly that level over 2020. Farther south, PJM Tier I REC prices rose over the course of 2020, reaching $10/MWh by year-end. Prices for solar RECs remained relatively stable over 2020, and continue to exhibit wide variation across states, with the highest prices ($200-450/MWh) in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia.
RPS compliance costs: RPS compliance costs in 2019 averaged roughly 2.6% of retail electricity bills in RPS states, compared to 2.3% in 2018. Costs in most states ranged from 0.5% to 4.5% of retail electricity bills.

Global Energy Ventures (GEV) says it now has the confidence to “rapidly progress” the development of its compressed hydrogen C-H2 Ship to the next phase.
The “world first” vessel design, which has already been patented, will be able to transport 2,000 tons of compressed hydrogen. GEV, a marine transport company based in Western Australia, says the study confirms that it can deliver the ship itself and a full zero-emissions compressed hydrogen (C-H2) supply chain with minimal barriers. It expects commercialization within the next five years.
“The idea is that the C-H2 supply chain will be commercially available before the alternative proposals of large-scale liquefaction of hydrogen or ammonia,” GEV said.
This would mark a significant achievement, as the delivery of green hydrogen via zero-emissions transport options has been front of mind for many potential importers, according to Smart Energy Council consultant Scott Hamilton.
GEV Executive Director Martin Carolan said that C-H2 will become a “game-changing solution” for the hydrogen economy. He expects it to deliver a “timely and energy efficient ‘port to port’ zero emission supply chain for green hydrogen” in Australia, destined for markets throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
The C-H2 Ship can carry up to 2,000 tons of hydrogen in its containment system. The company has said that its design “eliminates the requirement for onsite storage, as the C-H2 Ship is itself the storage.” It has described its push to develop a compressed hydrogen ship as a “natural progression to meet a market requirement for the storage and marine transportation of hydrogen.” 
GEV said the scoping study shows that its compressed hydrogen supply chain is economically “very competitive” compared to shipping liquefied hydrogen or ammonia at distances of 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km). As the company noted, that is roughly the distance between  northern Australia and Singapore. Its C-H2 shipping remains competitive to 4,500 nautical miles, which is the distance from Australia to Japan, South Korea, and China.
The company filed a U.S. patent application filed for its C-H2 ship in December, and is now working on a detailed marketing plan for the C-H2 supply chain as a “competitive and viable alternative for the ‘port to port’ export of green hydrogen from Australia.” The company also plans to develop its own green hydrogen export project to support the construction of a pilot scale C-H2 Ship. If all goes according to plan on the approvals front, the company is confident that it will reach its target of Final Class Approval in 2022.
In terms of technical risk, the scoping study showed that GEV’s compressed hydrogen supply chain has a lower technical risk compared to liquified hydrogen and ammonia.
“The C-H2 supply chain consists of compressors, pipework, loading infrastructure and C-H2 Ship Fleet. Hydrogen compressors (designed for pressure as high as 700 bar) have been in operation for decades with the associated piping and loading equipment having already been developed for various onshore applications,” the company said.
GEV’s scoping study was based on the notion that it would be provided a constant supply of green hydrogen by a third party at a price of $2/kg (AUD 2.6/kg) at a pressure of 20 bar. It also assumed that port facilities at both the supply and customer points will be made available at no cost for all three supply chains.

India added 1.29 GW of solar in the October-December period, with utility-scale PV accounting for 77% (998 MW), according to Bridge To India, noting that 23% (300 MW) of the total was rooftop capacity. 
The new additions brought the country’s total installed PV capacity to 41.6 GW as of Dec. 31. This included 34.2 GW of utility-scale PV, 6.4 GW of rooftop, and 1.08 GW of off-grid capacity. 
Bridge To India noted that fourth-quarter utility-scale additions were marginally below its initial estimates. “Project commissioning was up 55% quarter-on-quarter, but the increase in execution costs slowed down progress,” it said.
A jump in module and inverter prices also drove up engineering, procurement and construction costs. But Bridge to India said it expects construction to pick up in the current year, leading to more than 2 GW of utility-scale solar additions in each of the first two quarters of 2021, according to its estimates. The rooftop solar market is also expected to expand, with 475 MW of anticipated capacity additions in the first quarter.
