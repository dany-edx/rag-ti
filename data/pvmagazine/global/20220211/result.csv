This “breakthrough” would ease current issues with chemical storage and in particular dehydrogenation, the team led by scientists Long Qi and Wenyu Huan said. “The key to its efficiency is the structure of the nitrogen. Catalytic activity can take place at room temperature because of the unique closely spaced graphitic nitrogens as nitrogen assembly which were formed during the carbonization process. The nitrogen assembly catalyzes the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen (C‒H) bonds in LOHCs and facilitates the desorption of hydrogen molecules,” the Ames Laboratory wrote on Thursday. The related article was published on January 28 on Science Advances. 
A team of University of Delaware engineers has demonstrated a way to capture 99% of carbon dioxide from air using an electrochemical system powered by hydrogen. “We demonstrate an electrochemically driven CO2 separator (EDCS) to remove CO2 from the air feed using a shorted membrane that conducts both anions and electrons. This EDCS is powered by hydrogen like a fuel cell but needs no electrical wires, bipolar plates or current collectors, and thus can be modularized like a typical separation membrane,” the six researchers wrote in the article published last week in Nature Energy. The University of Delaware wrote that, as the hydrogen economy develops, this electrochemical device could also be used in airplanes and buildings. The approach tested by the team led by UD Professor Yushan Yan involves internally short-circuiting the device. “It's risky, but we managed to control this short-circuited fuel cell by hydrogen,” commented Lin Shi, a doctoral candidate in the Yan group and the paper’s lead author.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the country is working on attracting new investments in electric vehicles and hydrogen, adding that priority should be given to green hydrogen given the country’s “unique opportunity.” Germany is considered to be a potentially central trading partner. “Over the past year, [the] government has built on its successful Hydrogen SA strategy to make major strides in positioning South Africa as a global leader in this new market. This includes the development of a Hydrogen Society Roadmap for the next 10 years as well as a Green Hydrogen Strategy for the Northern Cape, supporting the development of a green hydrogen pipeline worth around R270 billion [€15.65 billion],” Ramaphosa said on Thursday in his 2022 State of the Nation Address. Earlier this week, the South African president appointed Daniel Mminele as head of the newly established Presidential Climate Finance Task Team. “His experience before the SARB [South African Reserve Bank] included credit-risk analysis, corporate banking, and project and structured finance at private banking institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa,” the government wrote on Wednesday. 
Norwegian consultancy and classification society DNV launched, together with 18 industry partners, a new Joint Industry Project (JIP) to enhance the standardization for hydrogen production systems using renewable energy-powered electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. “We are tackling this challenge by joining forces with major industry partners to work towards a new certification scheme and industry best practice for electrolysers which will facilitate successful water electrolysis projects. We undertook a similar approach for the wind energy industry about 30 years ago which proved to be very successful,” commented Axel Dombrowski, director Innovation & Digitalisation for Renewables Certification at DNV. Partners include BP, EDP, Equinor, Industrie De Nora, ITM Linde Electrolysis, McPhy, Shell, Siemens Gamesa, and thyssenkrupp nucera. The JIP is open for more partners to join until mid-April 2022.
Norway’s Aker Clean Hydrogen has increased its portfolio of projects and prospects currently under development to 2 GW, according to its results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Aker Clean Hydrogen was launched in February 2021. Among its key projects in the last quarter were the completion of the Hegra green ammonia project feasibility phase, the prolonged grid permitting process for the Berlevåg green ammonia project, and some developments at the Aukra project. “Aukra hydrogen hub proving to be technically and commercially viable; initial estimates showing competitive levelized cost of hydrogen,” Aker Clean Hydrogen wrote on Friday.
Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects more technological solutions related to storage and chemical plant design this year, mentioning the case of Haldor Topsoe, who redesigned its ammonia plant to respond to fluctuating hydrogen supply. On the other hand, fewer hydrogen projects are expected to be announced in the next months. “Will we see the same growth rate for the CCUS and hydrogen pipelines in 2022? We don’t believe so. The coming year will be all about maturing projects and securing funding,” the consultancy wrote on January 31. Wood Mackenzie said that translating hydrogen policies into reality will be politically sensitive. On Thursday, for instance, AP news agency reported that a panel of state legislators has rejected a bill that would have provided new financial incentives in New Mexico for hydrogen fuel derived from natural gas.
Boston-based clean energy solutions company Angstrom Advanced wrote that the development of the hydrogen energy industry also depends on the creation of “hydrogen communities.” The idea is to create an integrated energy system based on hydrogen. “At present, a couple of relevant projects have been launched worldwide, including but not limited to Rugao Hydrogen Town, Jiangsu, China; Harumi Hydrogen Town, Tokyo, Japan; and Orkney Hydrogen Town, Scotland,” Angstrom Advanced wrote this week.

MSF plants have high energy consumption compared with other desalination technologies and, at the same time, can be driven by renewable energy with high quality of production. These plants generate about 26% of all desalinated water in the world and, if coupled with BR and solar energy, could be cheaper than reverse osmosis (RO) if the salinity is higher than 10,000 ppm, according to the scientists.
“A MSF plant consists mainly of a multi-flash evaporator, which consists of a heat recovery section and a heat rejection section, to reduce the excess energy from the system,” they explained. This kind of evaporator is commonly utilized for producing fresh water from seawater, well water, or industrial water.
They designed a system planned for the Jordanian city of Aqaba comprising a standard MSF-BR plant coupled with a 30 MW solar array, of which only 15 MW are used to power the desalination facility during daily hours, with the electricity produced by the remaining 15 MW being injected into the grid. At night, the plant is powered by the grid. The proposed project uses Trina solar 325 W, 72 multi-crystalline poly PV panels rated for operation, the research group stated. “The initial design for the project considers that the panels will be installed in a four high land scope orientation on fixed racks oriented south at an inclination of 25.31°.”
The solar modules are deployed in 3 × 5 blocks, with each block having 15 groups. Each group has less than 20 strings, and each string includes up to 22 panels. “The MSF-BR plant consists of 24 stages divided into two parts, as the first consists of the 21st stage, which reflects the heat recovery section, and three stages of the heat rejection section,” the researchers explained, noting that the solar-powered facility is also able to generate 6.52 kg/s of steam at 180 °C by using an electric boiler with high efficiency. This steam is then used through a shell-tube heat exchanger to increase the temperature of recycled brine.
The system design is claimed to be able to provide 5,470 m3 of desalinated water per day. “During the treatment process, the salinity concentration rises from 42,000 ppm to the maximum allowable value of about 68,822 ppm,” the scientists emphasized. “The total area of the heat recovery section is 14,559.8 m2, while the total area of the heat rejection section is 1663.8 m2.”
The proposed system configuration would be sufficient only to meet the demand for drinking water in Aqaba, which does not have much space available to construct larger facilities than that designed by the scientists.
Their findings are presented in the study Performance of dual multistage flashing – recycled brine and solar power plant, in the framework of the water-energy nexus, recently published in Energy Nexus. The research team comprises academics from the University of Perugia in Italy and the Al-Balqa’ Applied University in Jordan.

German start-up Sunfarming Group has developed two new agrivoltaic systems in cooperation with Germany’s Forschungszentrum Jülich and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.
One of the two arrays is an evolution of the company's Sunfarming Food & Energy system type, in which glass-glass modules are placed at a height of 2.5 meters and the mounting system is designed with a large post spacing to enable the use of big agricultural machines.
The second type of installation, the Sunfarming Food & Energy Tracking System, was developed with custom-made solar modules equipped with trackers and a total height of over 6 meters and a headroom of 4 meters. This system is used to research various shading scenarios for the plants as well as more efficient rainwater management in order to make plant cultivation more climate-resilient.
The demonstration plants in Morschenich-Alt Ende, in the North Rhine-Westphalia region, are expected to be completed in February. Their construction began at the end of the year after nine months of development. Comprehensive research work on plant cultivation in agri-photovoltaic systems is set to begin when the plants are completed. The system is expected to produce some 300,000 kWh of solar power annually. The solar power generated will also be used to supply the research site.
“We have been working successfully with the research center Jülich for many years, especially in the field of agrivoltaic systems,” explained David Morr, head of Food & Energy Projects at Sunfarming. The company operates its own research and innovation park in Rathenow, Brandenburg. The knowledge gained there was incorporated into the new developments.
“Based on the requirements of our clients, we were able to build two Food & Energy plant types for Morschenich-Alt, which are suitable for multiple use of space, with regard to the production of solar energy and the cultivation options for berries, medicinal, oil and fiber plants demonstrate new solutions under changing climatic conditions,” he continued.
Sunfarming is also currently realizing an “eco-solar plant” on a former gravel pit about 20 kilometers away from the demonstration plants. According to the company, this is the first photovoltaic system of this type in the Rhineland. Completion is scheduled for April. In addition, further photovoltaic systems are being planned in the district of Heinsberg.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/11/spain-largest-ppa-market-in-europe-last-year-with-almost-4-gw-of-deals/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"FEBRUARY 11, 2022",Spain largest PPA market in Europe last year with almost 4 GW of deals,"From pv magazine Spain
Zurich-based renewable energy consultancy Pexapark expects that the recent hike in electricity prices will put a strain on power purchase agreements (PPAs) of 10 years or more and believes that, at the same time, the current market turmoil heralds the era of short-term PPAs.
In the European PPA Market Outlook 2022 report, company experts stated that the price environment of the fourth quarter of 2021 will be remembered for many years and its true effects will begin to be felt in 2022.
Pexapark estimates the volume of PPAs concluded in Europe in 2021 at 11.1 GW. PPAs for companies represent 6.5 GW, and Spain is once again the leading market with almost 4 GW.
“Spain dominates the flow of agreements for another year, with a total of almost 4 GW of contracted capacity — a third of the year's aggregate capacity — through 34 PPAs that were included in our Tracker. The country surpassed its 2019 record,” the consultancy said. “The state intervention, initially very drastic, once again reminded investors that energy markets have a very political basis, even for projects without subsidies.”
However, many market players are recalibrating their prices. As a result of the fourth quarter price hike, the main approach that utilities use to manage the risk of their PPA portfolio was severely affected and the price correlation between hedges and PPAs was broken.
Due to the current situation, utilities increased their discounts in an unprecedented way, up to 40% and drastic changes are coming. “We have observed that the increase in price discounts for PPAs with remuneration based on production (pay-as-produced) has triggered an increase in the demand for PPAs with shorter terms, as well as for base load contracts,” said Luca Pedretti, director of operations at Pexapark.
This not only represents a strong departure from the typical risk profile of conventional renewable investments, but also has implications for the plant's day-to-day operating model. “In response, renewable funds and investors are creating what we consider to be the next generation of utilities,” explained Pedretti.
Pexapark anticipates that actively managed PPA investments in the short term could dwarf the existing PPA market in the long term, in terms of volume. In short, the consultant foresees three clear trends for this year: the pressure of the long-term PPA market –10 years– will languish in absolute figures; there will be a rise of new utilities led by new and large investment funds in renewables; and there will be an increase in large corporate buyers.
The market is maturing and renewable energy investors and operators will be larger, more diversified in terms of technologies and markets, and will become more expert at managing energy risk.

The company is one of the four listed companies of GCL group and for the past fiscal year it reported a net profit of around RMB5 billion ($786.3 million). Due to its listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, its market value — estimated at around HK$80 billion ($10.2 billion) — is impressively low if compared to its major rivals like Tongwei, Xinte and Daqo.
Module manufacturer Longi announced on Friday it raised RMB7 billion by issuing convertible bonds. The funds will be used to increase the company's solar cell manufacturing capacity by another 18 GW, consisting of a 15 GW factory that Longi’s wholly-owned subsidiary Longi Lerri Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd, wants to build in Xi’An, Shaanxi Province, and a 3 GW facility planned for Yinchuan City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of western China.
Panel provider Suntech announced on Tuesday that it had begun construction of a 10 GW solar module manufacturing facility in Fengyang, Anhui Province. The factory should be completed by the end of October and will produce 182 mm and 210 mm modules.
The General Administration of Customs of China said on Friday that China sharply increased imports of polysilicon in 2021. Total imports reached 114,000 metric tons, with YoY growth of 13.4%. The trade value, however, increased YoY by 114% to USD$2.04 billion due to the high silicon price. Germany ranked number one among top importers, followed by Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan. Together they accounted for about 90% of total imports. South Korea, the top exporter to China in 2017, dropped to number six in 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/11/italys-third-capacity-market-auction-expected-to-open-new-opportunities-for-large-scale-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"FEBRUARY 11, 2022",Italy’s third Capacity Market auction expected to open new opportunities for large-scale storage,"The first two Italian Capacity Market auctions (with delivery in 2022 and 2023) have not met their targets. As a result, auctions cleared at maximum premiums. The third auction, which will take place next week, might hold positive news, as some improvements in the process emerged. 
Some improvements in the process should lead to higher participation, Aurora Energy Research’s Associate Michele Scolaro told pv magazine. For example, the exclusion of the environmental impact assessment, known as the VIA, from the requirements for new projects and a clearer definition of derating factors for different durations of storage that favors longer duration assets are likely to increase interest in the auctions.
Aurora expects larger participation of batteries driven by their increasingly attractive case. Another positive factor is that assets built for delivery in 2024 might already be allowed to participate in the Ancillary Services Market (MSD) from their first year of commissioning, capturing another crucial revenue stream. 
But there is a caveat.
“While these developments seem to point toward larger participation, the timeline of the general procedure was not favorable, especially for new entrants in the market. In particular, the time between auction and delivery (it is called T-4, but the delivery is in less than two years) might be prohibitive. Also the short time between the final discipline — published in November 2021 — and the auction — February 2022 — will prevent many players to participate with assets that would have made the auctions more competitive under a less tight timeline,” said Scolaro. All in all, he expects the third auction to be still more competitive than the first two.
Future Development: MSD
A complete reform of dispatch extending the participation to MSD to new technologies is expected in one to three years.
In general, timing will be crucial for the development of batteries. Scolaro explained that some of the services and locations with the highest value will be cannibalized quickly on the ancillary services market. 
“We expect less cannibalization on the day-ahead and intraday market due to the high RES penetration expected in the coming years that will increase price volatility. The ideal timeframe is to be one of the first assets to be there once batteries are allowed in the MSD, or to then wait for further decreases in the cost of the technology to capture the increase of volatility in the day-ahead/intraday.” 
Future Development: Retirement of Baseload Capacity
Mentioning Enel’s project in Priolo, Sicily, Scolaro suggested that several batteries should already be built in 2024/2025. The key development supporting the case for batteries is the retirement of baseload capacities. 
“Sardinia is very interesting, as the two coal plants, Fiume Santo and Sulcis, will be phased out, leaving a big gap on MSD. The target was to close both in 2025 but it will not be feasible before the Tyrrhenian Link; 2028/2030 is more likely for Fiume Santo. Capturing the gap left behind by coal will be a crucial value driver for battery investments in Sardinia.” 
Currently, there seems to be some interest in the conversion of the coal plant into a gas-powered plant in Fiume Santo. “Its potential realization is closely linked to the methanization of the island that is currently not reached by natural gas,” Scolaro stressed. 
Competition between renewables and gas is indeed set to remain, but the retirement of baseload capacity will most likely open the doors to both investments. 
In the Apulia region, Enel is planning to convert to gas the large coal plant in Brindisi Sud, to be closed by 2025. This currently covers the majority of MSD volumes. Also in Sicily, the phase-out of A2A’s oil plant in San Filippo del Mela is expected in the coming years. The plant currently provides large volumes on the MSD.
For the third auction round, Sardinia is divided into two sub-zones, North and South, to reflect that capacity is needed in both parts of the islands to compensate for coal closures (one plant in the north, the other one in the south) and poor intra-zonal interconnection. “We expect a higher concentration of battery deployment in Southern Italy and the islands.”
Future Development: Future High Volatility
Scolaro explains that, while the current volatility is the result of a shock that we expect to normalize in a couple of years, the high volatility expected in the 2030s is driven by fundamentals, such as more RES and the retirement of baseload capacities. 
“This means that we expect it to remain for a longer period of time. So while single-year revenues might be even higher now than what we expect in the 2030s, these revenues will only be achievable for only a fraction of the battery lifetime, typically around 15 years. In addition to that, the cost of the technology now is much higher than what we expect in the 2030s.”
The general point is that shocks that lead to higher volatility in energy prices make the case for batteries stronger. 
“The current spike of gas and carbon prices led to record-high absolute levels of prices and volatility. The average daily spread was on average €114/MWh in January 2022. These levels are already above what would make the investment in a battery profitable, of course assuming it can capture them for the entire lifetime,” Scolaro said, adding that Aurora expects gas prices to normalize in the medium term. High volatility decreases the need for batteries to resort to revenues from the Capacity Market and the Ancillary Services Market. 
Future Development: Gas, Lithium Prices
“Assuming even higher gas prices than today, and assuming they will remain at those levels for several years, the case for batteries will be even stronger: under that scenario, the limiting factor would not be the economics of the project but simply the speed at which developers can build projects.”
On the other hand, the risk for battery developers due to uncertainties around lithium’s supply is more related to delayed deliveries and shortages rather than battery prices. 
“Battery developers would usually sign contracts with battery producers one to two years before delivery for a fixed price, which would protect them from the price volatility of components. From the manufactures’ perspective, the volatility of components might instead lead to heavy losses on the contracted orders with potential for further reduction of supply capacity and most importantly delays in case of shortages of components.”
Scolaro explained that shortages and delayed deliveries would be detrimental for battery developers: they could, for example, lose a Capacity Market contract in case they are not able to bring the plant in operation within the required timeline. Prices could also be a key element.

Lithium-sulfur batteries, however, tend to lose their capacity very quickly thanks to an unwanted side reaction that occurs between cathode and electrolyte as the battery cycles. This leads to the formation of polysulfides, which cannot be reversed and quickly causes the battery to shut down. Most of the solutions to this suggested by researchers have focused on working with different electrolytes better able to cycle with sulfur, or changes to the separator film keeping the two components apart.
Scientists led by Drexel University in the US instead decided to focus on modifying the sulfur containing cathode to work better with commercially available carbonate electrolytes. “Having a cathode that works with the carbonate electrolyte that they’re already using is the path of least resistance for commercial manufacturers,” explained Vibha Kalra, a professor at Drexel University who led the research. “So rather than pushing for the industry adoption of a new electrolyte, our goal was to make a cathode that could work in the pre-existing Li-ion electrolyte system.”
Monoclinic gamma-phase sulfur
The group’s initial approach relied on embedding sulfur within a carbon nanofiber mesh designed to mitigate the polysulfide reaction. While this wasn’t successful, their cathode performed far better than expected in testing, and they set out to explain why. After a lot more testing, the group was able to confirm that during deposition, the sulfur had crystallized in an unexpected way, forming a variation on the element known as monoclinic gamma-phase sulfur.
“At first, it was hard to believe that this is what we were detecting, because in all previous research monoclinic sulfur has been unstable under 95 degrees Celsius,” said Rahul Pai, a doctoral student at Drexel. “In the last century there have only been a handful of studies that produced monoclinic gamma sulfur and it has only been stable for 20-30 minutes at most. But we had created it in a cathode that was undergoing thousands of charge-discharge cycles without diminished performance — and a year later, our examination of it shows that the chemical phase has remained the same.”
The battery is described in full in the paper Stabilization of gamma sulfur at room temperature to enable the use of carbonate electrolyte in Li-S batteries, published in Communications Chemistry. It demonstrated an initial capacity of 800 milliamp hours per gram (mAh/g−1), which had fallen to 650mAh/g−1 after 4000 cycles.
“While we are still working to understand the exact mechanism behind the creation of this stable monoclinic sulfur at room temperature, this remains an exciting discovery and one that could open a number of doors for developing more sustainable and affordable battery technology,”
The group notes that further investigation of the cathode’s surface, the role of carbon nanofibers and potential additives to the electrolyte would be needed for the technology to reach “commercial-grade performance.” And they hope this work will inspire more research into the fundamental behavior of sulfur in various battery types. “This will enable a deeper understanding of the system facilitating the commercialization of Li–S batteries,” they conclude.

How about solar PV systems that can be moved from one place to another to generate power? And what if the system also lets you generate more power than conventional setups while freeing up a good deal of space for other purposes?
Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) have developed portable solar towers that generate 20-30% more power while requiring only 50-60% rooftop space compared to conventional solutions. These solar towers are portable in that they can be mounted on a truck and taken anywhere to generate power. Use of mirrors alongside solar panels redirects the sunlight to the panels, maximizing the solar power generation.
These space-saving solar towers are designed in mechanical and non-mechanical tracking versions. Both the systems are patented by IIT Delhi and licensed to Banglore and Mumbai-based EP Sunsol for commercial installation. EP Sunsol has already deployed the systems of 3 kW, 4 kW and 5 kW capacities at Chennai, IIT Delhi, and Navi Mumbai, respectively.
The systems are scalable to higher capacity with the addition of more arrays in a tower design and are particularly useful for electric vehicle charging stations, rooftop solar power generation, and power generation for agriculture purposes (agri-photovoltaics), such as solar water pumping, charging batteries for tractors, etc.
“After intensive research, we got success in arriving at the lightweight and cost-effective novel design on mounting solar PV towers along with high reflectivity mirrors to follow the sun's movement,” said Dalip Singh Mehta, a professor at the Physics Department of IIT Delhi and part of the project team. “Both non-mechanical and mechanical solar towers can generate 20-25% and 25-30% more power, respectively, while utilizing only 50-60% rooftop space compared to conventional solutions.”
Mayank Gupta and Virendra Kumar (Department of Physics), Masood Ali (SeNSE), and Sanjay Ambwani (Design Department) were also part of the IIT Delhi research team. The EP Sunsol Team, which did the installation, comprised Mahadevan R and Hitesh Mehta.
In the non-mechanical tracking solar tower, solar panels, along with high-reflectivity mirrors, are vertically mounted at an angle based on the location that these fall in the line-of-sight of the sun during the morning, mid-day and evening hours, hence leading to high-efficiency solar power generation. 
“The mounting methodology helps to generate more power during non-peak hours of the sun, i.e., 9 am – 11 am and 2 pm – 5 pm in addition to peak hours of 11 pm – 2 pm. The mirrors/reflectors deployed in this solution boost the irradiance on solar panels during the entire day i.e., 8 am – 5 pm. The percentage of increase of solar irradiance onto the solar panels is more than 50%, thus maintaining 1000W/m2 from 9 am – 4 pm. Due to this increase in solar irradiance from 9 am – 4 pm, the increase in the amount of power generated is 20-25% compared to the conventional mounting of solar panels,” according to IIT researchers.
In the mechanical tracking version, the solar PV tower with mirror reflectors employs a low-cost programmable electro-mechanical system for horizontal single-axis solar tracking rotation from east to west. Single/double towers are mounted in such a mechanism that the whole system with panels and reflectors follows the direction of the Sun. The panels start the day facing the eastern direction and end the day in the western direction. By the next morning, the panels return to their eastern facing position to start a new day. 
The innovative tracking system developed by IIT Delhi does not require any light-dependent resistance (LDR) based sensors and consumes very low power drawn from the solar tower itself.

The device is claimed to have a weighted average reflectance of 4.2% over the 400–1100 nm spectral range, which the researchers said is almost an order of magnitude reduction compared with a bare silicon surface, and to be able to increase the short-circuit current of a 3 μm three-layer thick thin-film silicon solar cell by over 50%.
The structure consists of a two-dimensional (2D) array of rings and pillars. “It is a periodic structure that can be integrated onto the surface of the top silicon layer of solar cells,” they explained. “To minimize the reflection over a wide wavelength range, it is crucial to find the optimum geometric parameters of the subwavelength AR structure.”
The electromagnetic response of the device was simulated through commercially available finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) tools, which are commonly used for modeling computational electrodynamics. As a light source, a broadband (400–1100 nm) plane wave with a varying angle of incidence to the substrate was used and the typical optical dispersion property of silicon was also considered in the simulation.
According to the research group's calculations, the AR structure would be able to increase the solar cell short-circuit current to 28.6 mA/cm2, which would be 53% more than that of a reference cell without the AR device. “Our simulations show that the averaged reflectance, weighted with the AM1.5 solar spectrum in the 400–1100 nm spectral range, can be reduced from 35% down to only 4.2%,” it concluded. “Besides, we show that the subwavelength AR structures are robust to certain degrees of fabrication errors.”

Concentrated solar power (CSP) uses heliostat mirrors to direct sunlight into a collection tower, storing heat energy in abundant mediums like rocks, sand or molten salt for highly available energy dispatch. High-heat and available energy is a key element in many machine and industrial processes, so the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Department of Energy (DoE) are working on the next generation of CSP facilities.
The Gen3 CSP program targets an energy cost of $0.05/kWh. The DoE has identified opportunities in three material pathways: storing heat in sand-like particles, in liquids like molten salt, and in gases, such as the technology developed by Brayton Energy. The DoE selected particle-based storage as the main method for its funding, but also opened the door for NREL to run a two-year liquid molten salt research program.
Challenges, breakthroughs
NREL’s Craig Turchi, a leader in thermal energy science and technology, said molten salts are a desirable option for heat transfer and storage as they are easy to work with and can be pumped through pipes and heat exchangers. However, there are some practical challenges, which Turchi’s team is currently working on overcoming.
Though molten salts are easy to move, they are also corrosive to their holding tanks and pipes. “We actually solved that problem by and large. NREL and partners did a lot of great science on the salt chemistry—how to purify it, how to make it relatively noncorrosive if you control the chemistry, and we demonstrated that in the lab,” said Turchi.
The next hurdle was finding the right kinds of salts for the Gen3 CSP liquid path. Commercial systems often use nitrate salts, but NREL said these begin to degrade at higher temperatures. NREL targets high temperatures for more efficient energy conversion, so it settled on chloride salts for their higher level of stability under extreme temperatures.
Another challenge is keeping the storage tank hot. The molten salts used freeze at 400 C, so extra insulation is needed. “Our design is a steel tank, but whereas the current tanks are insulated on the outside, our proposed tank was insulated on the inside to protect the steel,” said Turchi. The DoE awarded NREL $2 million to build a prototype tank, which is being built on NREL’s campus in Golden, Colorado.
Kerry Rippy, an NREL expert in inorganic chemistry, and her team explored electrochemical methods to further remove corrosive impurities in molten chloride salt. She is also developing electrochemical sensors to be placed inside storage tanks to monitor the purity of the salts during experimentation.
“There are multiple potential avenues for this research to be valuable. It can be beneficial for solar fuel synthesis; it could enable high-temperature fuel cells, and the nuclear industry is also really interested in this research,” said Rippy.
Solar PV and energy storage are excellent in providing reliable electricity, but some industrial processes require high-heat or large amounts of available energy. This has led to developments in CSP, and in other technologies, which are already being met with commercial success.
Recently, startup company Rondo Energy closed a $22 million Series A funding round to scale its renewable energy heat batteries. The membrane-based battery stores solar and wind energy in solids at temperatures over 1,200 C. The company said it plans to begin manufacturing and delivering systems to customers later this year.
In November, Heliogen partnered with Bloom Energy to create green hydrogen fuel. Heliogen’s CSP creates heat, steam, and electricity from concentrated sunlight. It was paired with Bloom’s solid-oxide, high-temperature electrolyzer to make the fuel. The company said hydrogen can be made 45% more efficiently than low-temperature PEM and alkaline electrolyzers. Electricity dictates nearly 80% of the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis. The CSP method reduces the need for electricity, using heat to aid its operations.

How big is the potential for offgrid solar energy in India?  
Over the last two decades, the Indian offgrid solar market has witnessed a lot of growth. Many players are coming into the picture to sell and distribute a varied range of solar products, domestically produced as well as imported ones. 
The growth in the industry started getting bigger in the late 1990s when the bigger companies took solar home systems and solar lanterns to rural India. At the same time, the Indian government also started supporting Akshay Urjaa (Everlasting Energy) outlets in all areas across the nation. At first, these outlets were under some NGOs and government agencies, and then, from 2002 onward, the government encouraged private entrepreneurs to take over.
In 2010, the industry observed a high demand and that is how the industry started to flourish. The market is growing and that is how the potential of new inventions and sales grow, too.
What have been the major application areas? 
Our major application areas have been the places with low or no electricity. Commercial and industrial areas near highways like farms, flour mills, sugar mills, etc, need our solar installations to minimize and optimize electricity. In the remote areas, we target domestic shops and places where the electricity has not reached.
In the rural areas, where electricity has not reached fully, solar plays an important role in operating the household lighting and modes of entertainment like radio and television. Women and children who stay home most of the time are the ones who need the inflow of light. Be it the household chores or studies, electricity becomes important. That is why the solar market is expanding in the rural areas, letting the manufacturers explore new demands and ways to supply more too.
With the right support by the government in this area, solar energy systems can improve many prevalent issues in rural areas like health care and education, irrigation, water supply for consumption, veterinary services, food preparation and refrigeration, and tourism. 
Before the Modi government, solar’s share in the overall electricity market was 1-2%. Then, the government worked towards making policies around solar, and now, the solar and consumable market has reached up to 15% to 16%. 
However, we still feel we can achieve 85% with the right government policies like Make in India and the entrepreneurial wave in the country that has encouraged innovations and startups across the nation. 
Offgrid solar products remain expensive. What are the alternate success models?
The more advanced the technology, the more the cost. Compared to fossil fuels, solar energy systems are easy to use, low in maintenance, and have less impact on the environment. Therefore, they are also more expensive.
The issue that comes in rural areas, is that many farmers (who earn daily wages) cannot invest in such an expensive product at once. Hence, unaffordability becomes a hindrance in solar energy use too. The product, the batteries, and a backup system – all together become a little heavy on the pocket of a farmer. 
Therefore, there should be a system of better loan providers in the rural areas, better infrastructure to retain such technology, and awareness to use the product too. 
One alternate success model is ongrid solar products. These are battery-free products, so less maintenance is needed. 
What’s the key to survival for solar providers in a rural market that’s price-sensitive and crowded with many players?  
We feel survival depends on innovation and inventions. We are different from the general market of solar brands as we have a different line of products in this segment. 
About 90% of the solar-related companies deal in solar panel installations, and they offer on-grid inverters and other products from Chinese manufacturers. However, we make our products in India, and we are not only about solar panel. We differ from the other companies as we cater to the solar consumer electronics market. 
In the past, we have manufactured unique solar-enabled items that can function with both AC and DC. 
Our inventions are solar air conditioners, freezers, deep freezers, and even compressors, and all of them are less power-consuming products.
To what extent is localization possible in offgrid PV products? What components are yet to be imported?
With an emphasis on Make in India, most of the production and manufacturing has been done in India. We support Make in India and we feel that a lot of dependency on different countries has been minimized now. It has created more employment opportunities, more innovations, and economic growth. However, the concept is new, so there are a few things that we are importing from outside. Right now, we get semiconductors from other countries.
Our focus is on making consumer-driven products that have longevity. We do so to minimize the dependency of our consumers on us all the time.

The former mining town of Jabiru, Australia, is now powered entirely by solar PV. Queensland-based energy producer Energy Developments Limited (EDL) has completed the construction of a AUD 77 million ($54.8 million) offgrid integrated hybrid power plant featuring solar generation and battery energy storage, backed by diesel-fueled generators.
EDL Chief Executive Officer James Harman said the town, which had previously been powered by diesel generators associated with the now-defunct Ranger Uranium Mine, had been powered entirely by solar PV earlier this week as part of the final commissioning of the new hybrid power plant.
“The Jabiru Hybrid Renewable Power Station is now providing the town with stable, reliable energy that is at least 50% renewable over the long term, enabling the community to realise their vision of being an ecologically sustainable tourism and cultural hub for the region,” said Harman.
EDL will own and operate the new off-grid power system, which features a 3.9MW solar farm and a 3MW/5MWh battery energy storage system, backed up by 4.5MW of diesel-fired generators.
Chief Minister Michael Gunner called the commissioning of the power plant a “milestone” for the territory. “For the first time, Jabiru became the first town in the territory to be powered by 100% solar for a day,” he said, adding the renewable energy power plant will provide “better and more reliable services.”
The 100% solar PV milestone follows a similar achievement in the Western Australian town of Onslow. State-owned utility Horizon Power successfully powered the Pilbara community with renewable energy during a trial of the Onslow Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Project. Horizon said electricity was powered by 600kW of utility solar PV and 700kW of rooftop solar, supported by battery technology.
For EDL, the Jabiru Hybrid Renewable Power Station builds on its success with the 56MW Agnew Gold Mine microgrid project in Western Australia’s northern Goldfields region. The Agnew microgrid integrates a 4MW solar array, 18MW wind farm, and 13MW/4 MWh battery energy storage system, backed by a 21MW gas/diesel engine power plant.
EDL has also been contracted to build, own and operate a 4MW solar plant and 4 MW/4 MWh battery energy storage system that will connect to the existing mini-grid at Weipa on Queensland’s Western Cape York Peninsula. The new solar plant and battery storage system will complement the existing 1.7MW solar farm and connect directly to the Weipa electricity network, helping provide reliable power for mining giant Rio Tinto’s Weipa bauxite mine and processing facilities as well as the surrounding community. Construction of the project is expected to be completed later this year.

SunPower has signed a definitive agreement with TotalEnergies, its majority shareholder, to sell its commercial and industrial solutions (CIS) business for $250 million, including $60 million of earn-out, subject to regulatory evolution.
TotalEnergies currently holds close to 500MW in distributed energy generation throughout the world and this acquisition will extend that footprint to the US market. It will also allow TotalEnergies to develop more than 100MW of additional capacity per year.
The sale comes as no surprise, as the company said last November that it would consider divesting the commercial operation, revealing that its C&I projects had contributed an $8 million loss to its third-quarter earnings. SunPower had also previously announced that it would focus on its residential business.
“With this acquisition, TotalEnergies is further investing to grow its distributed generation activity in the US and support its B2B customers in meeting their sustainable development goals. It is a new milestone in our renewable development in the country, where we are targeting 4 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2025,” said Vincent Stoquart, senior vice president of renewables for TotalEnergies. “This will also give SunPower additional resources to focus on the growing residential market.”
The acquisition has been approved by both companies and is expected to close early in the second quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. TotalEnergies reports that its majority ownership stake in SunPower will remain at 50.83%.
