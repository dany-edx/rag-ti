The curtain wall, building-integrated PV, solar products and solar farm business, which belongs to state-owned construction company Shuifa following a bail-out, reported revenue was up last year, from the RMB3.49 billion ($533 million) recorded in 2019 to RMB5.6 billion.
That saw the gross loss of RMB976 million ($149 million) suffered in a torrid 2019 swing to a RMB203 million profit in 2020, for net profits of RMB301 million, after losses of RMB995 million a year earlier.
The PV contribution to the overall figures was muted, with project development revenue falling, year-on-year, from RMB1.5 billion to RMB1.19 billion, and the sale of renewable energy goods down from RMB131 million ($20 million) to RMB120 million. Covid-related solar project delays in the first three months of the year were blamed for the setback in the engineering, procurement and construction services segment.
Revenue from the sale of electricity from Shuifa Singyes' 447 MW solar estate rose, however, from RMB313 million, in 2019, to RMB326 million.
The extent of support offered by Shuifa since the bail-out was reflected by the fact Singyes will have to repay $12.7 million to its parent by August 27 and a further $213 million by the end of the year.
The update which kicked off the annual solar reporting season on the Hong Kong market also noted Singyes had RMB17.6 million of frozen deposits at the end of the year as the result of a civil action to secure monies owed “to certain suppliers.” The company has also had RMB7.4 million of machinery plus RMB25.5 million of frozen deposits since the end of 2019, as the result of a separate civil court ruling.

Germany-based Baywa re is developing an agrivoltaic project in the commune of Saubens, in the French southern region of Haute-Garonne, and is currently looking for partner farmers to settle on the 27-hectare site.
Two partners have already been identified–a beekeeper and a sheep farmer, to exploit 20 hectares–and up to four more are needed to cover the remaining seven-hectare surface, which the company wants to split into two areas that will be devoted to market gardening and red fruits.
One vacant area, of four hectares along the departmental road, is located on the edge of the future solar park. Its location, at the entrance of Saubens, offers good visibility for setting up a direct sales system. The soils, currently intended for field cultivation, are loamy-clay-sandy. The pH is slightly acidic (6.2). The market garden plot is located in an “exceptional-flood”-risk zone and would allow one or two market gardens or a single market garden to be set up, depending on the desired projects.
The second vacant area, of approximately three hectares, is located within the photovoltaic power plant. The PV system and its mounting structures will be specifically adapted to the cultivation of red fruits. The panels, which will be elevated at a certain height from the ground, are transparent and allow part of the light to pass. An irrigation system is already in place on the plot. Depending on the technical knowledge of the cultivation of red fruits of the future partner, Baywa re proposes to take charge of their training. A partnership with a research organization will also be offered to the project leader, in order to carry out precise monitoring of crops under structures.
The land will be made available free of charge for a period of 20 years. Agricultural equipment may be financed, as well as the cost of technical and administrative support and, if necessary, the training of farmers. The profiles sought are market gardeners and young farmers implementing organic farming, permaculture and a biodynamic project and interested in the cultivation of red fruits.
The 20 hectares of solar panels will benefit a sheep farmer, at the rate of seven to eight sheep per hectare, or 150 head. The panels, fixed on steel structures, will be oriented towards the south and inclined at an angle ranging from 15 to 20 degrees, ensuring optimal energy efficiency. The maximum height of the structures will reach 2.6m from the ground and the rows will be spaced at an average of 3m, allowing animals to move freely within the park. BayWa r.e. has already set up this type of partnership on six solar power plants, notably in Fontenet, in Charente Maritime.

South Korea-based solar module manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells has filed another patent infringement suit with the Düsseldorf Regional Court: this time against Astronergy Solarmodule GmbH.
The Korean company filed the lawsuit on March 12 and, a week later, a separate lawsuit with the France Federal Court of Justice.
The legal action against Astronergy follows the patent lawsuit initiated by Hanwha Q-Cells in Germany, the USA and Australia in March 2019, against Longi, Jinko Solar and REC. The latter trio are said to have infringed existing patents held by Hanwha Q-Cells for its passivated solar cell technology.
While Hanwha Q-Cells' patent infringement suit was largely thrown out in the USA, the judges at the Düsseldorf district court ruled in the first instance in favor of the South Korean photovoltaic manufacturer. Jinko Solar, REC and Longi Solar appealed the judgment. Longi said, at the beginning of the year, that the appeal hearing is scheduled for April 22, 2021. Hanwha Q-Cells has now also confirmed that the appeal will probably take place in April, before the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court.
The defendant PV manufacturers claim that the validity of the patents was checked by the European and Chinese patent offices, as well as in the USA. In the proceedings at the European Patent Office, an appeal hearing was planned for 25/26 March, 2021, Longi said. Hanwha Q-Cells is expecting the decision on the appeal hearing against the patent “EP 2 220 689” this month.
According to Longi, in October last year, the European Patent Office published a notice stating that “if the current applications are retained, the patent would be revoked in full.” In the event of a complete revocation, the patent infringement proceedings could be suspended, “with a very high degree of probability,” the Chinese manufacturer said. However, the reference is only an important indicator and not binding for the final decision of the European Patent Office.
The Chinese patent office, which also examined the validity of the patent, has so far only made a provisional decision, according to which the patent CN 1091952971 is to be maintained to a limited extent. Only in the USA were parts of the patent US 9,893,215 revoked, in December 2020. There is still no decision in the proceedings in Australia.
Almost exactly two years ago, Astronergy Solarmodule GmbH stopped production in Frankfurt/Oder. The company, which belongs to China's Chint Group, took over module production from its insolvent competitor, Conergy, in 2014. After the plant was closed, the company wanted to reposition itself as a sales and service center in the region.
Astronergy's managing director Paul Xinhua Ji told pv magazine that he was not yet aware of the lawsuit at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
*The article was amended on March 30 to reflect that a separate lawsuit was filed by Hanwha Q Cells with the France Supreme Court of Justice, and not the Germany Federal Court of Justice, as we previously reported.

In the white paper IHS Markit Top 10 Cleantech Trends in 2021, the analyst said this growth would represent a 27% year-on-year increase compared to 2020 and would materialize in a scenario that the analysts described as characterized by strong demand despite increased module prices, long lead times, and rising freight costs.
“Leading module manufacturers are sold out for the first half of the year,” said Josefin Berg, research manager for clean energy technology at IHS Markit. “There is no indication of price weakness for July shipments yet, manufacturing capacity remains sufficient and no major material bottlenecks have arisen to change our forecast for 181 GW in global solar PV installations.”
Increasing prices for polysilicon, copper and steel will contribute to maintaining PV module prices at current levels, although prices of solar glass may begin declining from the second quarter of the year. Demand, on the other hand, is expected to grow from May, both in China and the international markets.
“The solar supply chain is entering a new phase with a bigger focus on profitability, technology leadership, and consolidation,” IHS Markit stated. “Increasing consolidation on the manufacturing side–approximately 72% of modules were produced by the top 10 companies in 2020, according to IHS Markit research–in addition to high production costs and investors’ pressure to increase profitability, will be major factors in maintaining stable module prices this year.”
Profitability in the PV supply chain remains critical for all major manufacturers, as they require liquidity and capital for new investments in research and development and plans to roll-out the mass production of innovative PV technologies from 2023. “Investments will also be needed to adapt [the] module supply chain to [the] lower-carbon and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards demanded by the market,” said Edurne Zoco, executive director for clean energy technology at IHS Markit.
China is expected to be, once again, the world's largest PV market in 2021, with around 60 GW of newly installed solar power.

The selected contractors will add to those that were pre-qualified by Massader between 2019 and 2020. “Massader will sign a framework agreement with these additional EPC contractors, if successful in the pre-qualification process, [to] be added to the list of already pre-qualified contractors and … invited to submit their proposals for each batch of schools,” the tender document reads.
Interested EPCs will have time until April 15 to pre-qualify for the program.
The average installed generation capacity per school is expected to be 70 kW. “The program has been rolled out in batches of 40 schools with each batch being procured separately on a turnkey basis,” Massader director Mohammed Awartani told pv magazine. “The program is also supported with power purchase agreements signed with local distribution companies, with a percentage of production being allocated to cover the electricity consumption of the public schools.”
The European Investment Bank, in July 2019, loaned the program $18 million. The plan, which envisages the installation of solar arrays at 400 public schools in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, is part of the Noor Palestine solar scheme, which aims to deploy 200 MW of PV capacity by 2025.
Palestine had just 43 MW of solar capacity at the end of 2019, according to International Renewable Energy Agency figures.

Axitec, a German solar module supplier and battery manufacturer, has launched two new modules with power ratings of 410 W and 540 W.
The two half-cell modules feature 182 mm wafers and will be available from the second quarter of this year, the company said. Its AXIpremium XXL HC (silver/white) and AXIblackpremium XL HC (black backsheets/black frame) will be available throughout the world in 108-cell and 144-cell variants. Axitec said it will continues to improve the power ratings of the PV modules throughout the course of this year.
The company said that its AXIpremium XXL HC modules – featuring 108 cells and a glass area of less than 2 square meters – are ideal for installations on top of buildings in Germany. Its 144-cell modules, on the other hand, cannot be installed on rooftops in Germany, but they are suitable for ground-mounted PV systems, it said.
This year, it plans to devote about 40% of its manufacturing capacity to the production of the new PV modules, rising to 80% in 2022, CEO Steffen Wiedmann told pv magazine. He declined to comment on pricing.

Thomas Russ, principle research engineer at South African national research body the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) said the cost of desalinating seawater–regarded as too prohibitive for agricultural or small industrial use–was tiny compared to the cost of powering green hydrogen from renewables, so a hydrogen economy could provide a spur for drinking water production.
“To make hydrogen, you need water to electrolyze,” said Russ. “For water-constrained countries, this can be a challenge. Desalination is seen as expensive for industries such as agriculture or small industries. However, in hydrogen production, strangely enough, the cost of the contribution of desalination is in the order of half to two U.S. cents per kilogram–that is two orders of magnitude smaller than the cost price of the hydrogen. This allows the hydrogen production industry to finance the construction of desalination plants.
“If you are now exporting in the order of hundreds of thousands of tons of hydrogen, the desalination plant can … be built to support that. And if that is over-sized, you are now adding water resilience in those water-stressed countries.”
Jane Olwoch, of the German government-sponsored Southern African Science Service Center for Climate Change and Adaptive Land Management (SASSCAL), told the conference Africa has the potential to be a key exporter of green hydrogen.
Olwoch said the continent boasts the prerequisites needed for a hydrogen economy, including abundant solar and wind power resource, technical and market data generated in the 16 nations which make up the Southern African Development Community, and buy-in from stakeholders ranging from governments to the private sector. With the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research backing the SASSCAL group comprised of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia, Olwoch also pointed to the knowledge sharing, capacity development, and project financing help of European partners.
That rich renewable energy resource highlighted by Olwoch means Africa could supply the import-hungry demands of the hydrogen strategies of nations without such abundant sunlight and wind, said CSIR's Russ.
“Countries like Japan announced way back in 2014 about their de-carbonization strategy and their plan to import 300,000 tons of hydrogen from 2030 onwards,” said the mechanical engineer. “Similarly, in their national hydrogen strategy, Germany plans to import in the order of three million tons of hydrogen for their de-carbonization plans. This places a solid opportunity for renewable-rich countries such as South Africa and Morocco, and various other such states in Africa.”
While some panelists expressed concern about the cost and feasibility of developing hydrogen infrastructure in Africa, Russ said pipelines and the supply chain would follow once purchase agreements were signed.
“I think infrastructure isn’t a limitation,” said the CSIR representative. “I think the limitation is the off-take agreements. First, we require an assessment of the price at which we can produce hydrogen to make investors interested in those countries where the export of hydrogen is viable. You then need an off-take agreement with the country being supplied.
“When there is an off-take agreement, with volumes, it becomes so much easier to then have competitive bidding processes to go and establish the renewable power station–wind and solar–as well as to set up the grid-connectivity to link this power to the electrolyzer capacity–the electrolysis plants–and the conversion facilities, either as ammonia or [a] liquid organic hydrogen carrier.”
And the technology is commercially mature, added Russ, who said: “Alkali electrolysis has been around since the 1920s. PV and wind plants exist and can be rolled out but what is needed is the economic signal, which comes from renewable potential and the understanding of cost analysis.”
For example, said the engineer, CSIR has estimated South Africa will be able to deliver hydrogen to Japan below the target price of $3 per kilogram and before the 2040 deadline set by the Asian nation.
Conference participants said African states would have to work in partnership to develop a hydrogen economy and the support of external partners would also be beneficial. Hydrogen strategies would require skills development, capacity building, and soliciting government support, it was agreed.
The opportunity green hydrogen holds for solar was spelled out by Daniel Pasca, Southern Africa sales manager for Chinese photovoltaics manufacturer JA Solar.
“The reality is that we have to look at technologies such as green hydrogen, in terms of steel manufacturing, chemical production and refineries, the automotive industry, and long-haul freighting,” said Pasca, who said there is greater solar radiation and wind speed in the south of the continent. “I believe it will be fascinating to see the integration or, say, coupling of green energy, through solar and wind, as well as the production of hydrogen.
“Solar integration is a key challenge. There’s only about 2.9 GW of installed solar capacity in [the] entire Southern Africa [region], which is very low compared to the globally installed capacity of 680 GW, as of 2020. By 2030, the world’s cumulative solar capacity should be in the region of 1,500 GW. So I still believe Africa has a bit of [a] push, and a bit of a way to go, in terms of installed capacity for solar.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/29/overview-of-large-scale-and-commercial-storage-systems-diverse-business-models-falling-prices-spur-market-growth/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",CORNELIA LICHNER,"MARCH 29, 2021","Overview of large-scale and commercial storage systems: Diverse business models, falling prices spur market growth","The German edition of pv magazine published an updated market for large-scale and commercial storage systems. The key takeaways were a detailed overview of storage-system providers and their products, as well as a better understanding of the dynamics underlying the market.
In all, 54 suppliers provided details on 198 products, services and projects this year; 17 of the respondents also listed price information for some 50 systems. Of the companies listed, 57 sell their storage systems worldwide, and 70 offer their products throughout Europe.
Check out pv magazine's 2021 market overview of large-scale storage systems for commercial and grid applications.It offers an overall picture of component manufacturers, system integrators, plant managers, and EPCs, with their battery storage solutions for Germany and Europe with capacities of 30 kWh and over.
In Germany, as in many other countries, storage systems are financed primarily through various business models and highly specific applications. Companies purchase such systems to save electricity costs and grid fees, which is why areas of application and business models that could be implemented with the systems were among the topics queried in the market overview.
The desire to increase self-consumption among operators of solar PV systems continues to be a key motivation for the use of storage systems. Some 173 products are either suitable, or specifically designed, for this purpose, according to manufacturers and system integrators.
Self-consumption is a popular application among companies that have loads outside of the sunny hours, such as in agriculture. Around 160 of the products in the overview can also be used to smooth load peaks that occur in commercial operations or absorb generation peaks, and thus facilitate the integration of renewables into power networks.
Many systems are further capable of supplying electricity during power outages or for off-grid applications. Some of the listings cite islands and farms in remote regions as examples of how storage systems can be used to reduce the reliance on diesel generators or replace them altogether.
One business model that was frequently mentioned is peak load capping for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. There were 50 manufacturers that explicitly mentioned this application. Storage systems for this purpose charge slowly to prevent overloading the local grid connection or they store solar power.
Once a vehicle is connected, they discharge at high power into the vehicle, which can then continue on its way quickly following the fast charge. The market players surveyed stated that car dealerships were currently the largest customer group for these storage systems, as they offer fast-charging stations on behalf of vehicle manufacturers.
The prices of listed storage systems larger than 100 kWh with lithium-ion batteries fell by around 4% compared with the previous year. Compared across all storage technologies, prices have actually come down 16%. This is due in part to several redox flow systems that are new to the overview and which the manufacturers claim are very affordable.
The least expensive lithium-ion battery storage systems in the overview now cost €215 per kWhof capacity for sizes over 10 MWh. But even for smaller systems below the 100-kWh mark, this lower limit rises to just €275.
The range is huge, however. For systems based solely on lithium-ion technology, average storage prices range from €443 to €792, from large to small. Prices for systems with second-life batteries are slightly higher than the average. The most expensive unit listed is a complete system that includes lithium batteries, outdoor housing, an inverter, and connections.
The seven redox flow systems are in the lower quarter of the price overview. The lower limit applies to a redox flow system with zinc-bromine solution and a single-tank, electrode-stack design that eliminates the need for an ion-exchange membrane, according to its manufacturer. But, since prices depend not only on capacity but also on performance, this presentation favors redox flow systems, which are generally designed for applications that require lower C-rates.
A third technology offered by two manufacturers in the overview is the saltwater battery. So far, these are only listed in small sizes up to 500 kWh. Their prices fall in the middle range across all technologies.
Guest author Jan Figgener, a department head under the Chair of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage Systems Technology at RWTH Aachen University, has analyzed the growth of Germany's commercial storage market. He drew on data from the master market data register.
According to the register, commercial storage systems accounted for only a few percent of the total storage systems registered with the Federal Network Agency at the end of 2020 – some 1,500 registrations and a cumulative capacity of more than 100 MWh. In total, the Federal Network Agency listed more than 180,000 concurrently registered battery storage systems (with a total capacity of 2,000 MWh and 1,400 MW).
However, the commercial storage market's relative growth has proceeded apace. Whereas 380 commercial storage systems were registered in 2019, the figure rose to 630 commercial storage systems in 2020. Added capacity increased 60% year-over-year in 2020 to 42 MWh and an output of 21 MW.
Figgener only considered storage systems up to 1,000 kWh in size, however, and disregarded large-scale storage systems used for primary balancing power applications. The market overview, on the other hand, also includes projects with significantly higher capacities. One driver for big utility-scale storage systems in recent years has been demand from the grid services segment, such as for primary balancing power.
According to the manufacturers, 60 products in the overview were suitable for this purpose and another 60 could be optionally adapted to it. In addition, some storage systems are advertised as suitable for secondary balancing power and intraday electricity trading.
In addition to power storage systems and projects, storage-system inverters and some component manufacturers are also listed. Among these listings is a company offering a battery inverter that it says will eliminate the need for matching and active balancing of battery cells in second-life storage systems; another offers simulation programs that can help identify the most lucrative business model for commercial storage systems.
Further details can be found in the online database. Among the information it contains are manufacturers' comments on their products, detailed questions on charging and discharging performance, functionalities (increasing self-consumption, peak load capping, peak generation capping, emergency power supply, stand-alone operation, UPS, fast electric vehicle charging, primary balancing power, black start capability, reactive power regulation), unique selling propositions from the manufacturer's point of view, and system scope.

To arrive at their conclusion, the researchers incorporated more data series and metrics into their price calculations. Standard models consider only the price per energy capacity decline (in dollars per kilowatt-hour). The MIT group, however, considered extra data points, including specific energy and energy density figures, to better determine how much lithium-ion technology has improved. The first striking result from their research was that lithium-ion batteries improved at a much faster pace than previously assumed.
For example, from 1992 to 2016, the researchers added energy capacity and energy density to standard cost development considerations. They concluded the annual average cost decline, measured in ‘real price per service', was around 17%, not 13% as previously estimated. The price per service is the dollar figure per energy capacity unit as a function of volume per energy capacity unit. Factoring energy density into the calculation produced the higher, 17% figure.
Measured by standard means, the learning rate for lithium-ion batteries–the rate of cost reduction for each doubling of cumulative market volume–is understood to be around 24% for cylindrical cells and 20% for other cell types. The MIT group, however, factored in extra metrics and observed a bump to 30% and 26%, respectively. The change was partly attributed to the previous estimate featuring a problem in accounting for the number of cells brought to market. That occurred because different cell sizes were produced for different applications, muddying the waters when comparing different devices in a standard price-progress model.
The findings led the MIT group to believe reported improvement rates may have underestimated the battery technology’s fast-paced development. “Moreover, our improvement-rate estimates suggest the degree to which lithium-ion technologies’ price decline might have been limited by performance requirements other than cost-per-energy-capacity,” the scientists wrote.
Collecting data from articles, reports, academic presentations, government publications and business literature enabled the researchers to incorporate additional data points into a more comprehensive cost development model. The group systematically collected, harmonized and combined various data series related to price, market size, research and development, and the performance of lithium-ion technologies.
The analysis syndicated 90 data series related to price, market size, patent filings, cell-level energy density, and the specific energy developments of lithium-ion batteries. The researchers suggested their more comprehensive approach should be used when compiling future datasets.
The research article Re-examining rates of lithium-ion battery technology improvement and cost decline appeared in Energy & Environmental Science.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/29/18-3-efficient-perovskite-solar-cell-for-automatic-light-adjustment/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 29, 2021",18.3%-efficient perovskite solar cell for automatic light adjustment,"Scientists from the Southern University of Science and Technology, in China, have developed an automatic light-adjusting electrochromic device (ECD) powered by a perovskite solar cell (PSC) which they claim can be applied for all-day intelligent-curtains, and advanced electronic displays.
Electrochromic devices are able to reversibly change colors in response to an electric field and generally consist of multi-layer structures with transparent conductors, electrochromic films, ion conductors, and ion storage films. Although these devices are capable of modulating their light absorption under a small driving voltage, the requirement for external electrical supplies causes response-lag.
The researchers sensitized two alkynyl-based viologen gels known as DVP and MPV used them to develop electrochromic materials with stability up to 70,000 cycles. “The characterizations and tests were performed in indoor and outdoor circumstances,” the Chinese group stated. “Among them, DPV-based ECD exhibited transparent [to] deep blue color, as the light intensity changed, and MPV-based ECD demonstrated transparent-blue-magenta colors, depending on the light intensity.”
The two devices are also claimed to have high optical contrasts, excellent light sensitivity, and sufficient energy harvesting and storage.
A perovskite solar cell technology was chosen, the researchers specified, due to its high photoelectric conversion efficiency, low cost, and mature assembly technique. “The cost for producing a cell with an area of a 0.1 cm2 is $0.34,” research co-author Fengyu Su told pv magazine.
The inverted solar cell was fabricated by depositing a perovskite layer on a hole transporting material based on poly(triarylamine) (PTAA). The cell showed an open-circuit voltage of 1.02 V, a short-circuit current of 22.8 mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 78.4%. “The perovskite solar cells generated the voltage and current, making the electrochromic change from transparent to a colored state, indicating the solar cell could power the electrochromic device and the electrical power is stored in the ECD,” the scientists explained.
The perovskite cell, when the sunlight is stronger, is able to drive the electrochromic device into a dark state, which would prevent too much light from entering a building. When sunlight is weak, the installed device is driven into a bright state, which allows more light to enter. “These extraordinary results suggest huge potentials of PSC-powered ECDs being applied for all-day intelligent-curtains and advanced electronic displays,” the academics explained. “However, considering the latent toxicity of DPV and MPV, strict sealing work would be required if PSC-powered ECDs were applied in modern buildings and automobiles.”
The researchers specified the perovskite cell may also be used for other applications. “We are thinking to use the solar cell with a supercapacitor in the future,” Su concluded.
The electrochromic devices and the cell are described in the study Automatic light-adjusting electrochromic device powered by perovskite solar cell, published in Nature communications.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/29/we-need-an-energy-access-revolution-a-new-approach-to-innovation-can-help/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NORTHERN AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"MARCH 29, 2021",We need an energy access revolution: A new approach to innovation can help,"The energy sector is currently undergoing the greatest revolution since the Coal Age gave way to the Oil Age. New technologies are radically transforming the economics of delivering power. Over the past decade, the cost of delivering power to people living off-grid through standalone solar and storage mini grids has decreased by up to 85%.
The World Bank believes mini grids will be the cheapest way to bring power to half a billion people, most of whom live in rural communities and would be considered low-income on any global scale. But although mini grids are already cheaper than the main grid in many areas, they are still too expensive to profitably connect these potential customers.
There is an opportunity for a new revolution in energy access. As governments consider ways to rebuild the global economy, investing in mini grids is critical to driving equitable economic growth and a climate positive future. To achieve this seismic shift, we need to unleash innovation.
Private mini grid companies are working to incrementally innovate the business model. However, it’s not happening fast enough. To speed up innovation and unlock revolutionary change, the Rockefeller Foundation seeded the Mini-Grid Innovation Lab.
The Mini-Grid Innovation Lab is pioneering a new approach to innovation in energy access. Launched in 2018, the Lab identifies the most promising innovations by field testing prototype innovations in an iterative process and evaluating which have the greatest impact on the business model. The Lab is funded with public money and donor funds, and makes its findings public, sharing innovations directly with companies and governments to spread the knowledge.
The Lab consists of 25 private mini grid companies, working in collaboration together. It accelerates the speed of innovation by working through these 25 private actors, combining the strengths of public and private sector innovation.
Every quarter, the Lab convenes these 25 private mini grid companies to identify and design innovations to test within their own businesses and among their own customers. It then funds these private sector companies to test the innovations, on the condition they share the resulting data with the lab to distribute with the entire private sector.
The Lab aggregates the data across all companies and analyses it to determine the impact on the business model. It makes its findings publicly available, for free, to the entire sector, and continually repeats this process of idea gathering, testing, and sharing to rapidly accelerate sector innovation.
In a simple model, innovation can emerge in two ways:
Each model involves trade-offs.
Private sector companies are often the best engines of short-term innovation, because the incentive to survive is highly motivating. These companies are also the best judge of the most relevant solutions given they’re closest to the problems. However, we can’t rely on private companies to scale innovation to other companies in the sector. It’s not in their market interest to do so. In fact, it’s in their interest to stop the spread of innovation.
Apple’s seven-year pursuit of Samsung for patent violations was only settled last year for several hundred million dollars. Every smart phone is slightly more expensive and slightly lower quality than it could be, because each private sector actor is jealously guarding its competitive advantage.
An SSIR article last year raised this issue with private sector innovation in Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) solar, noting “Mutual awareness is low, and meaningful coordination is even more uncommon. This applies to collaboration…between companies and organizations working within the same sector.”
Public sector innovation is, by definition, public. Unlike their private counterparts, public actors make their innovations widely available – they share all information for the market to act on. Public actors can also be more patient and direct large amounts of risk capital towards innovation without a return expectation.
But public actors are typically further from the problem and are also inherently less incentivized to drive toward a ‘product’ or solution that will reach the hands of a customer in need. None of the government agencies working on the technologies behind the iPhone integrated them into a commercial smartphone. Public innovation is shared but is slow and disconnected from end users’ real challenges.
The traditional paradigm of innovation presents a choice. Fast but proprietary and therefore siloed. Or, shared but slow and isolated from the end-user. The lab is pioneering a new model that captures the best of both models. It provides donor funding to private sector actors to test agreed innovations on the condition that they share the results back with all their competitors.
Through this approach, the Lab combines the strengths of private sector innovation – speed and relevant knowledge of the problem – and public sector innovation – patient funding and open dissemination of knowledge. To make this real, it’s helpful to consider an example.
Grain milling is one of the most important productive uses of energy for people living off-grid in rural Africa. Maize is the most commonly produced cereal in sub-Saharan Africa, and grain millers use that maize to produce flour, a key ingredient in staple foods for rural communities.
Powering grain mills with solar mini grids would transform the off-grid energy sector, delivering clean, reliable, 24/7 power to rural businesses. However, diesel mills dominate the rural off-grid market, because no solar-powered electric mill exists that can match them on both cost and performance.
To solve this, the Lab brought together a coalition of private sector and public sector partners to iterate on the off-grid electric mill until it could match its diesel rival. It ran the following process:
The Lab is now applying this innovation approach to other promising tools to drive down capital expenditure costs and drive-up revenues. It is conducting field trials deploying smart inverters, reducing electricity tariffs, bulk procuring hardware, and bundling internet with power across Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia.
The Lab is also partnering with advocacy experts, technology companies, financiers, and on-the-ground implementing partners to scale those innovations proven successful. With Rockefeller’s support, it will share its findings with key governments, donors, and investors needed to accelerate this scale.
The Lab is field testing 10 innovations that together could make mini grids commercially viable by reducing capex per connection from US$1,000 to $500 and increasing average revenue per user (ARPU) from $5 to $17 per month
If these trials are successfully scaled, this new approach will have dramatically accelerated progress towards universal electrification in Africa. It will have sparked a new revolution in energy access, giving poor, rural communities across the continent access to affordable and reliable power for the first time.
We believe the Lab represents an interesting new model of innovation that combines the strengths of both private and public sector innovation. This approach could have a similar impact in other sectors where advancing public good requires private sector innovation.
Donors could support innovation Labs in smallholder farming, microfinance, and transport. Combining the speed and relevance of private sector innovation with the broad dissemination and funding of public sector innovation offers a way to ‘innovate on innovation’.

The DeepBlue 3.0 Light measures 1,722 x 1,134x 30mm, weighs 21.5kg, and features 108 monocrystalline cells. It is available in five versions with power outputs claimed by the company of 390-415 W and reported efficiencies of 20.0-21.3%.
The open-circuit voltage ranges from 36.85 to 37.45 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.61 and 14.021 A. The new product can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius and its operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius.
The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V and its junction box has an IP 68 rating. The manufacturer offers a 12-year product warranty and a 25-year power output guarantee.
JA Solar said that the DeepBlue 3.0 Light modules, due to their relatively low voltage value, enable the deployment of larger PV systems based on a single series string of panels compared to other rooftop modules, which would result in a reduction of balance-of-system (BoS) costs. “For example, on a 13mx5m pitched roof with a 30° angle, the DeepBlue 3.0 Light modules have the largest installation capacity and the highest capacity-to-load ratio compared to other 400W modules applied in distributed PV projects, increasing clients’ revenue by around 5%-10%,” the company stated.
“The module has successfully passed certification testing conducted by TÜV SÜD to the standards for IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 certification,” JA Solar said, adding that the new product, like other panels of the DeepBlue 3.0 series, is manufactured with its PERC high-efficiency cell technology Percium+ and gallium-doped silicon wafers.

The solar industry has seen unprecedented development as one of the top two renewable energy sources with continued growth in 2021. The future of solar technology remains bright, but as a solar business owner, you may be left wondering how to tap into the expanding market in order to grow your solar business.
YouTube videos are becoming a vital part of consumers’ solar-buying journey, providing a unique opportunity for solar marketers. The platform can be used to keep your solar business relevant by creating exclusive content and informational videos that establish yourself as an expert in your field.
Videos can then be used to direct potential clients to your other social channels, website, or both. Consumers are turning to YouTube to understand the process of going solar, and when they are ready to buy, they will turn to the expert they have come to trust – you.
My research into the ins and outs of solar marketing comes through years of placing my focus exclusively on solar, testing strategies for reaching quality leads, and investing time and money as I grew my marketing company.
Multiple leads
There was a time when platforms such as Facebook provided multiple leads for very little cost. But, as time went on, my team and I found both the cost for solar ads and competition on social media was increasing. In 2019, a dramatic shift began to occur as thousands of solar companies began advertising on Facebook in all of the same markets.
Solar companies in California, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona were all directly competing to get leads on Facebook. The cost per acquisition began to steadily increase and at any given time there could be up to 150,000 solar ads competing for the same client base. In addition, Facebook began to increase its prices.
You might have found some success by following a marketing plan founded in Facebook advertising, but we aren’t here to discuss staying stagnant. You are looking to expand your business, and to do so you need to think outside the box. That’s exactly what we did, and our own solar company made the switch to YouTube. Our retention rate grew from 35% to 93%.
We switched our solar marketing clients over to YouTube as well, where their businesses began to grow while other companies were still relying on Facebook for cheap clickbait. But why exactly is YouTube so successful for solar marketers?
The platform has more than 1.9 billion monthly users, and those considering solar projects are turning to YouTube for research. YouTube ads create an optimal balance for high-quality leads and appointments at cost-effective price points. When we switched our marketing clients, we began to see lead costs similar to five years ago because the majority of solar companies are not marketing their brand on YouTube.
Content creation
YouTube is your chance to make your business stand out. The digital market is flooded with many solar companies in any given market, but few are taking the time to educate their consumer base on the ins and outs of solar energy.
Separate yourself from the competition, whose only concern seems to be catching the eye with gimmicks and slogans, by explaining the value of investing in solar. In doing so, you will find high-quality clients ready and capable of spending money. This results in your business growing and profit margin increasing.
A few points that you may want to address with potential customers through your videos include:
There are numerous topics within those categories that provide a foundation for you to generate content. The possibilities are endless: financing options, how panels protect a roof, the effects of solar panels on a home’s value, or whatever your heart desires.
Don’t stop at just a few videos. Make use of YouTube to clearly communicate your expertise and stay on trend with a series of videos. Consumers are seeking bite-sized segments they can watch quickly and understand easily. Create videos separately in subcategories that keep viewers engaged and wanting more.
A series of videos also will help your company take advantage of how YouTube works. Its recommendation algorithms are set up to promote your other videos after a viewer has watched the first one. By creating a series of videos, you are more likely to hold the attention of the viewer once they discover your first video.
Call to action
After creating captivating and educational content, you are ready to start driving highly qualified clients to your social media and website. Making use of all platforms is important, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google listings, a website, email, blogs, and even podcasts.
The goal of marketing on YouTube is to use it as a vehicle to drive traffic to your other social channels. YouTube makes this easy to do by adding highly visible links at the bottom right-hand corner of your channel.
However, it is important to take it a step further and ask your audience to continue to interact with your video channel, otherwise known as a “call to action.” There are several ways you can do this, from asking your audience to click on your video to suggesting they post any comments or questions they may have. It is hard to know which call to action will work best until you give a few of them a try.
Investing in the right marketing plan can pay dividends in the long run. Marketing is the key to every successful brand, business, and organization. If done correctly, it addresses the value of your product in a compelling way. And educating your clients on the benefits of solar energy through YouTube offers a great base for a valuable solar marketing plan.
The time is ripe for those of us in solar energy to break away from door-to-door marketing and embrace YouTube strategies. Before you know it, your business will be thriving through high-quality leads that result in growth for your company.
Rich Feola is the founder of  Solar Exclusive, an advertising company that generates unique, qualified leads and appointments for solar companies, primarily from YouTube and Google. Solar Exclusive works with solar companies in more than 39 states. Feola's work has been featured by Digital Journal, Yahoo Finance, and NBC, among other outlets.

The Independent Planning Commission (IPC) of New South Wales has granted conditional approval for Neoen’s proposed 350 MW Culcairn Solar Farm and 200 MWh battery energy storage system in the Australian state's Riverina region.
The approval brings the total value of the state's approved capital investments to AUD 2.3 billion ($1.8 billion) over the past 12 months. It follows recent IPC approvals for RES Australia’s 100 MW Springdale Solar Farm Project, another 150 MW by Hanwha Energy and Green Switch Australia for the Jindera Solar Farm, and GAIA Australia’s 200 MW Bonshaw Solar Farm and associated 300 MW battery storage project, among other planned installations. All of those projects were referred to the IPC due to strong community objections.
The Riverina region hosts a high number solar projects, despite consistently voiced concerns over the use of agricultural land for large-scale solar generation. For the Culcairn project, there were a number of community objections, including the heat-island effect of solar panels and the difficulty of fighting bushfires in fire-prone areas blanketed by such installations.
In all, the IPC recorded 146 objections to the AUD 636.6 million project, but it ultimately ruled in favor of development. Its decision was based on a number of arguments, including the claim that the project is consistent with national and international aims to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
The IPC noted that the Culcairn project has an electrical grid connection. It also noted that “the project would generate enough electricity to power over 131,000 homes, and is therefore consistent with the NSW Climate Change Policy Framework and Net Zero Plan Stage 1: 2020-2030.”
The IPC commissioners, Andrew Hutton and Zada Lipman, also said that the Culcairn project is “consistent with the Department’s Riverina Murray Regional Plan 2036, which identifies the development of renewable energy as a growth opportunity for the region.”
The planned installation is expected to create 350 full-time jobs and 1,546 indirect jobs during construction, in addition to other jobs throughout its projected minimum 25-year operational phase. In addition, 60% of its development costs will likely be spent within the Riverina region, the IPC noted.

Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd.’s latest 500 MW solar auction has secured a winning bid of INR 2.20 ($0.03)/kWh, from the record-low INR 1.99/kWh recorded in the last 500 MW procurement round in December.
NTPC (150 MW), Sprng Energy (120 MW), Coal India (100 MW), and Tata Power’s TP Saurya unit (60 MW) have picked up an aggregate 430 MW at this rate, while SJVN won the remaining 70 MW of capacity at INR 2.21/kWh.
JMK Research has described the winning bid of INR 2.20 as particularly aggressive, given that the auction was held after the announcement of the basic customs duty levy of 40% on imported solar modules and 25% on solar cells, effective from April 1, 2022.
Analysts have attributed the comparatively lower tariffs to the “good ratings” of Gujarat's state electricity distribution company, the project locations, and rising anticipation that mono PERC module prices will fall by 10-15% to reach the $0.19/Wp range by 2022, excluding duties and taxes.
