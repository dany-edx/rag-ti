(NamPower) has launched a tender inviting consultants to provide services for a range of renewable energy projects in the southwestern African country.
The projects span PV, wind and BESS, and sit under the banner of the Namibia Renewable Energy Scale-Up Support Project, according to tender documents.
Services include an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) for a PV/BESS project at an undisclosed location; and site studies for a PV/BESS project at another undisclosed location. It also includes an ESIA and environmental and social assessment (SESA) for a wind power facility at the Tsau Khaeb national park located in the country’s east; and site studies for a wind power facility at another undisclosed location.
The deadline for applications is Feb. 16, 2024.
In Feb. 2023, the World Bank provided NamPower a $4.44 million grant to help the country become the first net zero emissions nation in Africa while building jobs and resources, according to World Bank documents.
The money will provide Namibia with technical assistance to develop “sustainable and bankable” renewable energy projects. Funds will pay for detailed studies and “risk allocation frameworks” to support public investment and mitigate private sector participation risk.
In July, NamPower launched a tender for a contractor to build a 70 MW solar farm in the southern mining town of Rosh Pinah. Last month construction also started in Namibia on the continent's first decarbonised iron plant powered totally by green hydrogen, reported Reuters.
Just over half (55%) of Namibia’s 2.53 million population had access to electricity in 2021, with 38% of the country's energy derived from renewables but most (76%) being bioenergy, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The country recorded 176 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of last year, according to IRENA’s latest statistics.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/11/new-solar-air-dual-source-heat-pump-design-based-on-blower-fans/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,INDIA,MALAYSIA",LIOR KAHANA,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",New solar-air dual-source heat pump design based on blower fans,"An international research team has developed a novel solar-air dual-source heat pump (SAHP) for water heating applications.
The system's innovation lies in using a blower fan that enables forced convection during partial sunshine and diffuse light conditions. Forced convection, like natural convection in regular solar-air dual-source heat pumps, extracts the ambient thermal source to the refrigerant flow.
“This study contributes significantly to advancing SAHP technology, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable water heating solutions in regions with diverse ambient conditions,” added
The Direct Expansion Modified Solar-Air dual-source Heat Pump (SAHP-MDX) includes a rotary hermetic compressor, an expansion valve, and submerged water-cooled condenser coils. The system's novel evaporator, designed to overcome the limitation of natural convection, is constructed by stacking two roll-bonded bare plates with a blower fan in between.
“The ambient air is forced through the dual source bare plate evaporator in SAHP-MDX by two blower fans with individual motor capacities of 35 W,” the scientists said, noting that the system has a solar collector area of 1.6 m2 and a total evaporator area of 3.2 m2. “The rotary hermetic compressor, with rated input power of 910 W and a heating capacity of 3,500 W, compresses the vapor refrigerant (R410A).”
The novel heat pump has three operating modes. One is the Solar-Air source Natural Mode (SANM) with which the system can work throughout the day when solar radiation is higher, enabling the evaporator to gather solar energy and heat from the surrounding air through natural convection.
The Solar-Air source Forced Mode (SAFM) also works throughout the day, but when sunlight is not fully available, the evaporator utilizes forced convection to absorb heat from the surrounding air, as well as solar energy. When insolation is absent during dusk or night hours, the system uses the Air-Source Forced Mode (AFM), as the evaporator absorbs only ambient thermal energy from the air via forced convection.
The novel system was tested in southern India, during five days of winter 2021 and during another five days of summer 2022. It had five water heating cycles daily to try the full array of operational modes. In each cycle it had to heat 300 liters of water from an initial temperature of 31 C to a final one of 50 C.
According to the results, in the SANM mode the system had a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.62, while the SAFM and AFM achieved 3.37 and 3.05, respectively. The average daily COP of the novel heat pump, throughout the five heating cycles per day was found to be 3.24. The average heating time for the SANM was 163 minutes, 177 minutes for SAFM, and 187 minutes for the AFM.
“Overall, the proposed SAHP-MDX outperforms comparably conventional dual-source heat pumps that exist in practice,” the research group concluded. “It can be used as a feasible substitute for water heating applications in real-world settings with unpredictable weather, ambient air temperature, and solar radiation.”
The scientists described the system in the paper “Optimal utilisation of low-grade solar-air source for heat pump water heating using a dual-source evaporator with forced convection,” which was recently published in International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer. The researchers come from India's Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, Sri Krishna College of Technology, and Malaysia's Sunway University.

The company, now part of the Kiwa Group, said the new tool combines operational data review, field inspections, and on-site measurements with a Python-based tool that merges SCADA data and on-site information.
The new approach is implemented on the ground, where PI Berlin carries out forensic analysis. In addition, PI Berlin technicians interview the operators of PV plants.
“Beyond conventional practices, additional measurements are carried out to examine the operating characteristics of key elements such as capacitors, inductances and printed circuit boards,” a PI Berlin spokesperson told pv magazine. “Particular attention is paid to the evaluation of the actual switching of the IGBTs during operation.”
Researchers analyzed PV plant documentation provided by clients, combining field inspections and SCADA data analysis. They used a Python tool to synthesize field measurements and plot graphs, streamlining the processing of operational data.
Root causes include problems such as defective printed circuit boards and communication failures.
“This procedure is useful for PV plant operators, PV plant owners or EPC companies whose warranty is still active,” the spokesperson said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/11/reconfigurable-series-parallel-photovoltaic-modules-with-high-shading-tolerance/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",Reconfigurable series-parallel photovoltaic modules with high shading tolerance,"A group of researchers at the Netherlands' Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) has developed a new design for reconfigurable PV modules that can reportedly provide a 10% higher energy yield than conventional shade-resilient PV panels with fixed interconnections and six bypass diodes in partial shading scenarios.
“Typically, a reconfigurable PV module consists of two or more blocks of solar cells that are connected to a switching matrix,” the scientists explained. “The switching matrix can dynamically modify the electrical interconnections between the blocks according to the illumination conditions and maximise the module’s output power.”
In the study “Electrical performance of a fully reconfigurable series-parallel photovoltaic module,” published in nature communications, the research group said their work represents the first attempt to validate reconfigurable modules using prototypes installed under realistic operating conditions.
The academics implemented switching matrix with MOSFETs, which they said allows the module to adopt 27 different series-parallel electrical configurations. These are classified as s1p6, s2p3, s3p2 and s6p1, with the first number indicating how many blocks are connected in series forming a string, and the second number indicating how many strings of series-connected blocks are connected in parallel.

The scientists said they could identify the best module configuration by considering illumination conditions via a synchronous reconfiguration algorithm, which measures the short-circuit current of the six blocks of cells.
“When the PV module is uniformly illuminated, configuration s6p1 is chosen since it delivers the lowest current and minimises Joule losses,” they explained. “On the other hand, when the PV module becomes partially shaded, configurations with parallel interconnected blocks will be chosen to reduce current mismatch losses.”
The team compared the performance of a prototype reconfigurable panel with that of a reference panel with fixed interconnections for four months under different shading conditions. “Different bar lengths were used to progressively shade and unshade the blocks during sunrise and sunset,” it said.

The tests showed that, without any shading, the reference panel produced 1.9% more energy than the reconfigurable module due to additional resistive losses in the latter's switching matrix. By contrast, the reconfigurable PV module produced from 4.8% to 13.7% more power than the reference panel under shading conditions, and a higher average yield of 10.2%.
The group specified that the yield of the reconfigurable module doesn't include energy consumed by the switching matrix and the sensing circuitry.”
“During all the shading experiments, about 40% of the energy was delivered by the s1p6 configuration, in which all six blocks of cells are connected in parallel,” the researchers stated.” Although the s1p6 is the most shading tolerant of the 27 possible configurations, it is also the one that generates the highest currents and thus may lead to the highest losses at system level.”
Looking forward, they said they want to test asynchronous algorithms and utilize a microcontroller in the  smart junction box.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/11/multiple-uk-heat-pump-laws-recommended-for-revision/,"HEAT PUMPS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM",ANGELA SKUJINS,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",Multiple UK heat pump laws recommended for revision,"The UK government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero commissioned Montreal-based environmental consultancy firm WSP to assess whether heat pump guidance and planning rules are “fit-for-purpose” for the technology’s large-scale deployment.
In November 2020 Downing Street announced it would deploy 600,000 heat pumps by 2028 and gradually phase out fossil fuel-powered boilers by 2038 as part of its “10 Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution” – an initiative to achieve net zero emissions while creating jobs and fostering the local industry.
Current UK legislation and design features “enable and constrain” England's en-masse heat pump roll-out, WSP found in the report it handed down last month.
Removing size limits for an outdoor compressor unit and ditching the requirement that heat pumps must be at least one meter from the property boundary are two of the eight changes WSP recommended as part of the report's “development guidance and regulatory framework.”
Defining what a “solid barrier” is in the context of a heat pump installation location as well as considering the cumulative impact of air-powered heat pumps in a locality should also be considered, according to the report.
WSP reviewed literature related to planning standards, guidance and consumer perceptions; and conducted a small survey with 139 residents living near a heat pump for the review, titled “Review of Air Source Heat Pump Noise Emissions, Permitted Development Guidance and Regulations.”
According to the responses, heat pump noise complaints were “infrequent” but their impact ranged from being “noticeable” to “affecting sleep patterns” and were described as being a “low hum” to a “rumbling.”
The researchers highlighted the importance of developing better sound quality control if the UK Government wants to install more heat pumps en masse, which could lead to more sound issues. Recommendations for addressing sound issues include considering the “tonality correction” in heat pump noise impact assessments – which would require manufacturers to supply frequency tonality data – and providing guidance around sound power level test operational loads.
The report found noise emissions were a concern for a minority of studied customers, most likely caused by poorly installed heat pumps, with rubber matting or acoustic enclosures a possible fix.
The document will “help inform” future government policy on heat pump planning guidance and standards, the government said online.
UK heat pump group, the Heat Pump Association, states the UK currently has 412 heat pumps per 100,000 people, but the UK market – which sold 55,000 heat pumps in 2022 – is lagging compared to the European Union, with 620,000 heat pumps sold in France over the same period.

Western Australia’s Regional Joint Development Assessment Panel has approved Synergy’s plans to construct a 500 MW, four-hour battery energy storage system near the coal town of Collie and has also provided a green light for infrastructure approvals to support a possible expansion to 1,000 MW/4,000 MWh.
Synergy plans to build the AUD 1.6 billion ($1.05 billion) Collie Battery Energy Storage System (CBESS) approximately 200 kilometers southwest of the state capital of Perth, just north of the existing coal-fired Collie Power Station that is set to be retired by 2027.
The first stage of the proposed development will comprise the installation of two 250 MW/1,000 MWh ‘sub facilities’ featuring 656 battery enclosures, 164 inverters and up to four 330/33kV transformer units.
The CBESS will connect via the existing Shotts Terminal to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), the electricity grid that supplies power to Perth and more than one million homes and businesses between Geraldton and Esperance and east to Kalgoorlie.
Synergy said the battery will help provide the state’s power grid with the capacity it needs to remain reliable and affordable as the state moves towards emissions-free power generation in 2030.
“The proposal is pivotal to Synergy’s energy transition program and represents a generational opportunity to support carbon emissions reduction and secure energy supply,” the application reads.
While no date has been given for the start of construction, Synergy said it is expecting the battery to commence the commissioning process in October 2025.
The Collie BESS is the third grid-scale battery being built by Synergy in southwestern Western Australia.
The government-owned energy generator and retailer has already completed construction of the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana battery energy storage system about 30 kilometers south of Perth and has started work on a new 200 MW/800 MWh big battery being built adjacent to that facility.
French renewables giant Neoen is also in the process of building a 1 GW/4 GWh battery in Collie as the state government seeks to ramp up energy storage capacity to support its planned transition from coal-fired power to renewables.
Neoen started construction of its Collie battery in June, about the same time the company was awarded a contract by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to provide almost all of the project’s first-stage capacity to help smooth the state’s solar duck curve.

“The trustee is continuing the company’s operations with the aim of finding a new owner for the business,” the company said on its website. “The trustee is hoping to find a solution during January of 2024.”
In late November, Nilar gave an update on its financial situation, stating that it “has a significant need for financing over the coming years to achieve the goals set out in the business plan.” It also said that it was evaluating strategic partnerships or a potential sale.
Nilar's battery technology is based on nickel metal hydride electrochemistry with a water-based electrolyte, which provides high safety while allowing the components to be recycled and reused.
Thanks to the chemically stable electrolyte, heat-generating reactions cannot occur between the electrodes. This means that Nilar batteries cannot spontaneously explode or even short circuit internally. There's also no risk of heat propagation from one cell to another. The Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE) has confirmed the safety of Nilar batteries.
Nilar’s water-based electrolyte can be regenerated. By adding a controlled amount of oxygen, the same battery’s capacity can be restored once it starts to wear out. According to the manufacturer, its battery is able to operate at full capacity at least three times.
Inside Nilar's battery module, battery cells are stacked horizontally on top of one another with a metal bi-plate in between. The outer plates act as current collectors for all cells in the module, which reportedly offers a volumetric density advantage of 10%.
Nilar developed the electrodes through a patented technique for the compression of dry powders and used a separator that acts as an electrolyte reservoir. The biplates are used to seal the cells and provide electrical contact between the cells themselves.
“In the Nilar bi-polar design, the current is perpendicular to the electrode and bi-plate surface, making the whole biplate area used for current transfer between cells,” the company said. “This substantially reduces resistance and optimizes uniformity of current distribution over the biplate and electrode surface.”
In the ReOX system configuration relased last year, each battery pack contains up to 12 modules and every module contains 10 battery cells. The battery packs can be utilized with a maximum nominal battery voltage of up to 600 Vdc.
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
The battery cells’ flat design is formulated to simplify reuse and recycling. According to the company, nickel, the main constituent active material, is easily recyclable without loss of quality and any residues are sent to the metal industry for reuse.
While too heavy for EV application, Nilar’s battery technology was developed as an alternative to lithium-ion in the stationary storage sector. It is primarily designed for the residential and commercial and industrial customers who are looking to combine multiple functionalities, such as time shifting, peak shaving, backup, frequency regulation, islanding, or uninterruptible power supply.
Nilar is based in Gävle, Sweden. Since 2012, it has developed and produced all of all its batteries in its Gävle facility, which is powered by 100% renewable energy.
In 2020, Nilar was the “Megawatt Winner” in pv magazine’s Energy Storage Highlights.

Vast Renewables has announced it will partner with EDF Renewables to deliver multiple long-duration storage and green fuels projects in Australia featuring Vast’s CSP technology that uses mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers before generating heat and dispatchable power during the day or night.
The Sydney-based developer said its CSP 3.0 technology allows plants to be configured with four to 16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW, providing clean, dispatchable renewable energy for utility-scale power, industrial heat and clean fuel production applications.
Vast founder Johnny Kahlbetzer said EDF’s capital commitment, which remains subject to a number of conditions including Vast completing a NASDAQ listing through a merger with a United States special purpose acquisitions company, is a “fantastic” validation of the company’s 14-year journey.
Vast Chief Executive Officer Craig Wood said the partnership will bring together Vast’s CSP 3.0 technology and EDF’s track record of developing, designing, delivering and operating clean energy projects.
“As one of the largest energy utilities in the world, EDF operates gigawatts of renewable projects and has world-leading expertise in the use of sodium as a heat transfer fluid,” he said. “We look forward to working with EDF Australia to deliver long-duration storage and green fuels projects.”
Vast’s proprietary CSP technology relies on mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers. The heat is then transferred via liquid sodium and stored in molten salt. The stored energy can then be used to heat water to create steam to drive a turbine and produce electricity, or the heat can also be used directly to decarbonize some industrial processes.
The technology is on show at Jemalong in regional New South Wales where a 1 MW pilot plant, which was constructed adjacent to a 50 MW solar PV project, has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018.
Vast is also developing a 30 MW plant with eight hours of full-load storage near Port Augusta in South Australia.
The VS1 project seeks to demonstrate the technical and operational performance of Vast’s modular CSP technology at utility scale. The grid-connected facility is expected to become operational in 2025. Vast will also build a 7,300-tonnes-a-year green methanol plant next door that will be partially powered by the 30 MW plant.
EDF Australia Country Manager James Katsikas said the partnership with Vast aligns with the company’s plan to deliver a portfolio of clean energy projects across Australia and said the group is uniquely placed to accelerate the commercialisation of cutting-edge technologies like Vast’s CSP 3.0 technology.
“With our knowledge and experience, we are well-equipped to successfully execute multiple projects within the clean-energy value chain,” he said. “We look forward to collaborating with Vast and believe this arrangement has the potential to accelerate the nation’s transition towards clean energy production and consumption.”
