The plan includes a first network of 25 high-capacity hydrogen stations connecting Antwerp, Rotterdam, and the Ruhr metropolitan area (Duisburg). DATS 24 currently has one hydrogen station in Belgium; Air Liquide is making investments in hydrogen assets in South Africa, and Taiwan. “We are convinced of the pivotal role that hydrogen will play in the energy transition, especially for heavy-duty applications,” said Diederick Luijten, Vice President Hydrogen Energy Europe for Air Liquide.
German steel companies thyssenkrupp Steel and HKM teamed up with the Port of Rotterdam to set up international supply chains for hydrogen to be used in steel production instead of coal. The two steel companies have been traditionally importing coal, iron ore, and other raw materials, transporting them from their own terminal in Rotterdam to their blast furnaces in Duisburg via inland barges and rail. “The Port of Rotterdam is already investigating the import of hydrogen from a large number of countries and regions all over the world,” reads a note released by the Port of Rotterdam on Tuesday. The biggest European port is betting on green and blue hydrogen. “Rotterdam is also setting up a carbon transport and storage system, Porthos, which is also being considered as a CO2 storage site for the production of blue hydrogen.”
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) conditionally approved three projects under its Renewable Hydrogen Deployment Funding Round, which was increased from an initial AUD 70 million (€45.1 million) to over AUD 100 million. The aim is to fund projects to decrease costs and reach “H2 under $2” – the threshold to make green hydrogen commercially attractive. Engie Renewables Australia has been awarded AUD 42.5 million for a 10 MW electrolyzer project with Yara Pilbara Fertilisers in Karratha, Western Australia. In this case, the renewable hydrogen should be converted into ammonia for export. Australian Gas Networks Limited (AGIG) has been awarded AUD 32.1 million for a gas blending project with a 10 MW electrolyzer at AGIG’s Murray Valley Hydrogen Park in Wodonga, Victoria. ATCO Australia has also been conditionally approved for AUD 28.7 million. The project in midwest Western Australia includes a 10 MW electrolyzer project for a gas blending project.
Fundación Chile, a public-private organization meant to support Chile's energy transition, is raising money to invest in green hydrogen projects that are two to three years away from being profitable. According to its website, the launch is planned for next year, with the aim of investing in 12 to 15 companies. Fundación Chile will focus on raising money from potential buyers, such as mining companies. Currently, around 30 projects have been identified. The goal is to demonstrate that they can operate at competitive prices.
French automotive supplier Plastic Omnium signed a technological partnership with McPhy, a specialist in hydrogen production and distribution equipment, to collaborate on filling protocols and interfaces between hydrogen stations and high-pressure tanks. “This technological collaboration will in particular aim to improve the performance and connectivity of high-pressure vessels, by analyzing and mining the data generated by the interface at the filling station,” reads the note released on Thursday.
The Danish Energy Agency has granted permission to two power-to-X (PtX) specialists for the development of innovative projects which will be exempt from the country’s energy legislation. The decision is part of an upcoming pilot scheme to support new clean energy technologies, including green hydrogen. GreenLab is developing an industrial and energy park in which the renewable electricity produced will then be used for several PtX facilities, including green hydrogen production. Brande Brint is setting up a green hydrogen production facility in partnership with Spanish power electronics specialist Gamesa, a unit of German conglomerate Siemens. The project at Siemens' Danish headquarters in Brande, western Denmark, includes a 3 MW wind power plant and a 400 kW electrolyzer.
A team of researchers at PIK Potsdam underlined the risks related to hydrogen, saying that the gas should be used in sectors such as aviation or industrial processes that cannot be electrified. “Universally relying on hydrogen-based fuels instead and keeping combustion technologies threatens to lock in a further fossil fuel dependency and greenhouse gas emissions,” reads a note released on Wednesday by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK Potsdam). According to lead author Falko Ueckerdt, hydrogen should be used in a restricted number of sectors: long-distance aviation, feedstocks in chemical production, steel production “and potentially some high-temperature industrial processes”.
Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research IAP is working to find solutions for private customers to produce hydrogen. “The intention is to design the wind turbine small enough to allow private individuals to have a system like this in their garden,” said Holger Seidlitz, Head of Polymer Materials and Composite PYCO research at the Fraunhofer IAP. “The hydrogen will be generated in-situ in a small electrolyzer and stored in the tank. It can then, for example, drive a fuel cell inside the house that produces heat and power at the same time. And owners of hydrogen-powered cars will, in the future, be able to refuel their vehicle at home.” Fraunhofer IAP has recently acquired an industrial 3D printer to make a plastic mold for producing their rotors for weak winds.

The design of the stacks in redox flow batteries, on the other hand, is complicated by the presence of a number of parameters that can influence the performance. The German group said it developed the stack with an electrically conductive plastic so that it remains flexible and can be welded.
“The stack that has been developed, the heart of any redox flow battery, is 40% more cost-effective in terms of material costs,” said researcher Christian Doetsch, adding that it weighs 80% less than a conventional stack and is only about half the size. The device was fabricated with plastic in the form of pellets, which was then made into powder and mixed with 80% graphite at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius.
The powder was then processed through a system comprising several rollers heated to different temperatures and working at different speeds. “The powder is briefly melted between the rollers at moderate temperatures and low pressures,” the scientists explained. “It is then kneaded, rolled into an ‘endless sheet' and finally rolled up.”
The resulting flexible material is claimed to have thermoplastic properties and to be easy to weld. “The stack uses no gaskets whatsoever, and even screws are unnecessary — the cells are simply welded together,” the scientists stated. “Bipolar plates up to several square meters in size can be manufactured without problems.”
In a second step, which the research team described as crucial to further reduce production costs, the plates can be produced as an endless roll through a powder-to-roll process, which is said to require much less material. “Very thin plates can be produced in this way,” the researchers concluded. “In the injection molding process, the plate thickness is limited to several millimeters due to the production method, but in the powder-to-roll process it can be between 0.1 and 0.4 millimeters.”
Fraunhofer Umsicht's spin-off Volterion GmbH was also involved in the development of the new stack design and will be responsible for making it into a commercial solution.

Module manufacturer Longi has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with French energy giant Engie. Under the terms, Longi will provide the French company with at least 600 MW of solar PV panels in 2021. Furthermore, the two companies agreed to jointly develop PV projects in major solar markets including India, France, and Italy, among others.
China-based power transmission and distribution equipment provider Chint Group announced in its annual report that it has become China's largest private owner of solar power generation assets. At the end of 2020, the company was operating 550 solar plants with a combined capacity of 5.7 GW in China. The second-largest PV plant owner at the end of last year was GCL, which operated a total PV capacity of 4.83 GW. The company had to sell several PV projects during 2020 in order to restructure a difficult financial position.

And this is particularly true for batteries incorporating lithium or other transition metal anode materials, which tend to quickly lose performance due to the formation of dendrites – branch-like structures that grow into the electrolyte and even across to cathode side, causing short-circuiting. Solid-state batteries currently appear the most promising commercial route to solving this problem, however, several other approaches have also caught the attention of researchers, among them lithium-oxygen batteries.
A group of scientists led by the UK’s University of Liverpool (UoL) has found that careful control of the electrolyte composition can effectively “switch off” the reactivity of certain components and minimize the appearance of unwanted side reactions that happen during battery cycling, including the growth of dendrites.
“The ability to precisely formulate the electrolyte using readily-available, low volatility components enabled us to specially tailor an electrolyte for the needs of metal-air battery technology that delivered greatly improved cycle stability and functionality,” explained UoL research associate Alex Neale. “The outcomes from our study really show that by understanding the precise coordination environment of the lithium-ion within our electrolytes, we can link this directly to achieving significant gains in electrolyte stability at the Li metal electrode interface and, consequently, enhancements in actual cell performance.”
The group worked with varied formulations of solvent, salt, and ionic liquid, and found that adding an ionic liquid allowed them to achieve much better stability results. “It was exciting to see through the use of both calculations and experimental data we were able to identify the key physical parameters that enabled the formulations to become stable against the lithium metal electrode interface,” said Pooja Goddard of Loughborough University, who collaborated in the research.
Their optimized electrolyte solutions are described in full in the paper Design Parameters for Ionic Liquid–Molecular Solvent Blend Electrolytes to Enable Stable Li Metal Cycling Within Li–O2 Batteries, published in Advanced Functional Materials. The optimizations allowed them to demonstrate battery cells with 94% Coulombic efficiency as well as more than 900 hours of cycling with no increase in overpotential. “This work exemplifies a useful electrolyte design strategy for Li-air batteries underpinned with excellent science within a great collaboration,” added Enrico Petrucco of Johnson Matthey PLC – a London-based chemicals company that partnered with UoL on this research. “This moves us another step closer towards practical routes to overcome complex Li-air challenges.”
The group says that the electrolytes could be even further improved through specific tailoring of the lithium salts and ionic liquids to achieve lower viscosity and that the careful introduction of a fourth element, a non-solvating thinning additive, to the electrolyte mix would also be worth investigating.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/07/italy-could-double-pv-capacity-by-2025-says-pi-berlin/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 7, 2021","Italy could double PV capacity by 2025, says PI Berlin","Italy could double its solar PV plant capacity in the next three years, said Giuseppe Farinato, new Business Development Manager for Italy at PI Berlin, a technical advisor for PV plants based in Germany. “Currently there are around 21 GW of photovoltaic plants in operation. The estimate that 40 GW could be reached in the next three years seems reasonable.”
Farinato said that between mid-2019 and 2020, operators submitted applications to build new PV plants with an aggregate capacity of over 10 GW. According to him, the Italian PV market registered a “strong interest” from national and international operators for the development of large size market parity plants, mainly connected to the High Voltage grid (i.e. 150-380 kV).
He also mentioned the key role of smaller plants: “Other operators, hoping for a smoother and more agile process, have focused on developing smaller plants above one MW, but connected to the Medium Voltage grid (i.e. 15-30 kV),” he told pv magazine.
Farinato, who sees in the so-called “super bonus” for building renovation projects another reason for the likely boom, expects growth to slow down after 2025. “By 2030, PV installed in Italy could be around 50-55 GW in total, including the current 21.6 GW in operation.” The 110% tax break is being offered to building renovations and energy re-qualification projects, which may also include the installation of a rooftop PV system, and is an income tax (IRPEF) rebate.
According to Farinato, Italy does not only possess ideal irradiation, but also favorable wind conditions, which allow the cooling of solar modules, reducing losses due to the thermal effect. This is the case for Sicily, Sardinia, and also the Viterbo province, which is becoming a solar energy hub due to the presence of several operational large-scale PV plants and an increasing number of projects under development.
From a technical perspective, the Business Development Manager sees investors choosing mostly single-axis trackers. On the other hand, no clear preference can be registered in terms of inverters. For modules, the engineer expects the national market to prefer monocrystalline products. “The trend for the future seems to be clear,” he said. “As we know from the countless warranty claims in the past, the quality of modules can be variable, so in my opinion, the only way to limit this risk is to use independent quality assurance consisting of audits and supervision.”
According to him, the most frequent problems with PV systems in Italy are related to the effects generated by the quality of modules, such as potential induced degradation (PID), hot spots, micro-cracks, and chalking. Apart from these issues related to the production process, other issues can arise because of poor maintenance and installation. “An example of this is a PV plant deployed in industrial or mining environments where other oxide deposits on the glass reduce the efficiency of the modules,” he said.
Limited ventilation is another recurring problem in Italy, “especially in the summer months.”
“We are seeing more and more European players investing in solar development across Italy,” Steven Xuereb, PI Berlin’s Director of Sales and Project Delivery, told pv magazine. “The existing number of operational PV plants in Italy is only second to Germany – there are a lot of older plants that are looking to be repowered in the coming years.”

China National Building Materials (CNBM), the parent company of German module manufacturer Avancis, has signed an agreement with German PV production equipment provider Singulus for the supply of several vacuum coating systems.
This time, however, the deal is not about the production of copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS) thin-film panels, but the manufacturing of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film modules. Singulus has been supplying photovoltaic equipment to CNBM for years.
The Chinese group wants to significantly increase its production capacities for both technologies in the coming years and is planning further investments at several unspecified locations in China. According to Singulus, the new CdTe panel production may have an annual capacity of over 1 GW. The new vacuum coating systems are intended to further reduce production costs, while increasing cell performance and production output.
“Our vacuum coating machines are a key step for the entire production process,” said Singulus CEO, Stefan Rinck. “In addition to machines applying sputtering technology, we are also offering machines working on the principles of thermal evaporation.”
The Chinese conglomerate currently operates CIGS production facilities at four different locations.  One of them is located at a factory in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province. CNBM was the first of several organizations to bring large-scale CIGS production online in China.

The patented technology, which the company acquired from the Purdue University in February, consists of a process to separate pure rare earth metals and critical elements from coal byproducts, recycled permanent magnets, and lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles or power plants based on renewable energy.
The technique is described as a two-zone ligand-assisted displacement chromatography (LAD) that is able to produce metals with high yields and purity of over 99%. Displacement chromatography is a preparative technique that is commonly used to place a sample onto the head of a column and then displace it through a solute.
The system is based on a zone-splitting method and is claimed to have an overall production capacity that can exceed 100 kg of rare earth elements per m3 per day. It requires three chromatography columns, an extractant, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and other unspecified environmentally friendly chemicals.
Compared to conventional acid-based methods, which make use of two-phase liquid–liquid extraction processes, the LAD is said to have no detrimental environmental impact. Traditional techniques, on the other hand, have also difficulties in separating rare-earth metals, due to their high similarities in chemical and physical properties, according to the researchers.
“Collectively, our process chain of technology and feedstocks enables us to help restore the domestic supply chain of these critical materials in the most sustainable and environmentally friendly and beneficial ways ever developed,” said American Resources Corporation CEO, Mark Jensen. “The team at Purdue is an important part of this, and we look forward to pushing aggressively forward with commercialization of the technology and showcasing the low cost and environmentally sensitive technology.”
In 2019, other scientists at the Purdue University developed a process to extract pure carbon from plastic waste and turn it into anode material for lithium-ion batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/07/the-best-radiative-cooling-tech-for-pv-arrays/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 7, 2021",The best radiative cooling tech for PV arrays,"Researchers at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have conducted a review of the possible combinations between radiative cooling (RC) techniques and solar energy systems of different kinds and have found that a series of challenges must still be addressed to bring this combination closer to commercial maturity. “We are examining the feasibility of employing radiative cooling to reduce PV panel temperature and thus increase PV power generation,” the author Dr. Tao Ma, told pv magazine. “On the other hand, radiative cooling could also be used for other solar energy systems, such as solar thermal installations or concentrated solar (CPV) systems.”
Dr. Ma also explained that the cost of a radiative cooling system was not considered in the study.” But generally, it is very cheap, and some scientists are developing some radiative materials with low price and high performance.”
In the paper A review on the integration of radiative cooling and solar energy harvesting, published in materialstoday Energy, Dr. Ma and his colleagues explained that, compared to conventional cooling techniques, radiative cooling is more environmentally friendly as it does not dump the waste heat into the atmospheric air or local water bodies, and, as a passive technique, does not take require any input energy.
“It can be observed that individual RC systems and solar energy systems, both undergo similar challenges in terms of insufficient output energy gain, economic issues, and limited working time,” the Chinese group explained. “It would be of particular interest if the functioning of individual systems could be integrated into a combined system that could provide enhanced output energy and function during both day and night.” Under this configuration, the two systems would not only become able to produce a higher energy gain per unit area but also increase their respective useful working time.
In their review, the academics analyzed all studies that investigated the combination of the two systems from different perspectives and identified five major system typologies based on functionality and working time. They also analyzed the possibility of replacing the modules' glass cover with highly emissive RC materials and different types of materials including nanoparticle-based polymers, multilayered film stacks, and micro/nanopatterned structures.
“Solar energy and radiative cooling systems have great potential and promising applications, but the major challenges to large-scale development include low cooling power and heat transfer, non-uniform operating conditions, and variation in supply and demand,” the scientists stated.
RSC occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from the Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.

French renewables developer Arkolia is currently building three anaerobic digestion units in France.
At one of the sites, in Ludiès, southern France, the company has commissioned a new kind of anaerobic digestion unit linked to a 100 kWp photovoltaic system. Designed entirely for self-consumption, the PV array will continuously power the anaerobic digestion and biogas purification process, which the company said will improve the profitability of the installation.
“In 2018, we wanted to find an alternative and make our farm more sustainable, and we wanted to store manure in winter,” said Maxime Durand, a spokesperson for SARL Ariège Biométhane. “With an approach for sustainable agriculture approach, we have chosen anaerobic digestion, as we wanted to reduce our dependence on nitrogen fertilizers and also control weeds.”
The plant produces 83 Nm3/h of biomethane by injection, supplied by 45 tons of agricultural deposits per day. The company operates another 93 KW rooftop PV array to power a building used for the storage of manure.

“Selenium (Se) is a suitable wide-bandgap absorber with a reported direct bandgap of 1.83–2 electronvolts for its crystallin trigonal allotrope,” the researchers explained, adding that the semiconductor has low toxicity and the potential for a low-cost fabrication process.
For the proposed cell, the Danish group used trigonal selenium that has a higher bandgap of 1.92 electronvolts and is semitransparent on both sides. 
The cell was developed in four variants: Two cells both with a thickness of 300 nm and with a monofacial and bifacial design, respectively; and two devices cells both with a thickness of 500 nm and with a monofacial and bifacial design, respectively. For the backside contact, the academics used indium tin oxide (ITO) instead of gold.

The 300 nm bifacial device, which delivered the best performance among the four cell types, showed a power conversion efficiency of 5,2% on the front side through an n-type contact and 2.7% on the rear side through a p-type contact. Its short-circuit current was 10.96 mA for the front side and 7.40 mA on the backside, and the respective open-circuit voltage values were 0.91 and 0.88 V. The 300 nm thickness is claimed to enable an optimal fill factor of 52.6% on the front side and 41.4% on the rear side.
“It was shown how the performance from back-side illumination is more strongly dependent on the architecture of the device and also in particular on the selenium thickness,” the scientists further explained. “This is an important step toward a future Se-incorporated tandem, where it will be advantageous to invert the typical single-junction device structure before/when incorporating it into the tandem device.”

“We have made a model that uses satellite-derived wind data and the shape of the lake to calculate the fetch in multiple directions and locations in order to calculate the wind waves,” Glint Solar COO, Even J. Kvelland, told pv magazine. “Glint Solar has used the algorithm and the model with several customers like the World Bank to calculate waves on potential project sites.”
The technique is based on an algorithm that considers the geometry of the water surface and 40 years of data on wind conditions and is claimed to be able to automatically calculate wave heights and wind directions. “Given the importance of high-quality data in the early phases of floating solar projects, we are now able to help developers and consultants better understand the potential risks at individual sites as regards waves,” Kvelland further explained. “Waves of course greatly impact the technical feasibility of a site and what type of floating solution one can use.”
The tool is said to drastically speed up the analysis process and to be able to take into account multiple factors. “When we talk about waves, it’s not only the height that matters but also the direction, wave periods, significant wave height, and 50-year wave height that are important to understand when assessing potential project sites,” the COO specified. “We see an increase in new solution providers who are making more and more robust floating solutions that can withstand higher waves.”
According to him, companies like Ocean Sun, Oceans of Energy, SolarDuck and Moss Maritime are all introducing solutions that can withstand rougher weather, including higher waves. “Some of them are designed to withstand waves up to 3-4 meters,” he added.
The NGI has a long experience in wave analysis for the aquaculture sector and the oil and gas offshore industry. “However, this is the first time the institute is automating its technology and hence giving the wave analysis instantly,” Kvelland stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/07/on-site-and-off-site-community-solar-options-whats-right-for-you/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 7, 2021",On-site and off-site community solar options: What’s right for you?,"From pv magazine USA
In an earlier article, we reviewed the three most typical models available to businesses for buying solar power: customer-owned on-site, third-party on-site, and community solar.
Now, let’s dive a little deeper into some key differences between on-site options and the off-site community solar option. Just like last time, we’ll think of community solar as the only off-site option, given its broad availability for many consumers.
Let’s start out with one of the largest demising lines for most businesses: do you own the property, or are you a tenant? If the answer is tenant, in many cases this can nearly end the discussion and take on-site solar off the table.
There are several reasons why this may be the case for renters. For example, electric utilities often don’t hold these discussions with anyone but the owner. Or, the potential for dispute arises when property damage or loss occurs should a leaky roof result or loss of generation occur due to maintenance work not being performed.
Of course, everyone’s situation is different, and maybe you have a great relationship with the landlord, you plan to be in your location for the long haul, and the utility company is willing to work with you. But in most tenants' situations, it doesn’t work out.
If you are a building owner, one consideration for going on-site with your system, and one that may require a conversation with your accountant, is the available state and federal incentives. These incentives can significantly offset your system installation price if you qualify and if you are in a taxable position to take advantage of them.
While state programs vary wildly, the US federal Investment Tax Credit for solar in 2021 can offset your tax burden by 26% of the installation costs. That credit alone can make payback calculations look much more attractive. And if you are already talking to your accountant, it may be a good time to bring up things like depreciation of assets relative to the solar installation, and maybe even the potential increase in property value related to solar energy measures you are considering installing.
Remember O&M
One important factor in deciding between on-site and off-site models is its maintenance and ongoing performance monitoring to make sure you are getting your money’s worth. Theoretical payback calculations go out the window if a system isn’t operating as it should.
While some of us might enjoy reading monthly reports from a data acquisition system, comparing them to expected generation based on actual weather, and making sure production meters and utility meters are generally in agreement, I’ll say that most people don’t have the interest or time to devote to such a task.
When comparing financial models for on-site and off-site options, make sure you are capturing costs for third-party monitoring and/or maintenance for an on-site system. It also is prudent to make some assumptions for periodic capital costs to replace inverters or other components that can fail over time.
If any or all of these things don’t appeal to you, then that may be a check mark in favor of community solar; in that model, maintenance and performance are taken care of by the system owner.
Other factors have to be weighed into your decision, but these are some major points that should help narrow down your choice. As always, it’s never a bad idea to speak with a knowledgeable professional if you can, and take advantage of their insight and, most importantly, their knowledge of things that haven’t gone well in the past relative to your situation. That way, you can learn from the mistakes of others.

Climate change affects the technical, operational, and financial specifications of projects. However, a new study by World Resources Institute shows that decentralized solar installations in India’s energy-scarce states are poorly designed for climate resilience. 
The researchers analyzed 14 decentralized solar energy systems (standalone or minigrid-sized installations) installed in community-level health care, education, and livelihood facilities in climate-vulnerable regions across three states (Assam, Jharkhand, and Rajasthan) of India. The primary climate risks in the states are listed as floods, waterlogging and extreme precipitation in Assam, thunderstorms in Jharkhand, and extreme heat and water scarcity in Rajasthan.
The researchers said that none of the decentralized solar installations covered in the case studies specifically incorporated predictions of future climate change into their project designs. Climate considerations were even less evident in operational and financial designs. 
The researchers found that only a limited number of case study installations had operational clarity over roles and responsibilities during and after a climate-related event or have funding arrangements to deal with the aftermath of an event. Furthermore, the clarity that some possess stemmed from learning through experience and not from the project design. 
The researchers acknowledged that many renewable energy projects adapted their designs considering specific local conditions. These considerations, however, didn’t suffice to manage climate-related risks over the project lifecycle. For example, in Assam, to deal with waterlogging and flooding, installations are designed to withstand higher water levels, either through raised platforms or through technologies such as floating solar installations. Jharkhand is prone to thunderstorms and lightning, and a few pilot implantation projects in the state have installed lightning rods, surge protectors, and chemical earthing. In the desert state of Rajasthan installations are designed to withstand extreme temperatures and strong winds, and include insurance of structures in project design.
The researchers identified additional considerations for decentralized solar energy installations in climate- vulnerable regions. Technical considerations include understanding the current and future climate risks in a region, how they affect demand and supply of electricity, and what technology options, codes, and guidelines exist to ensure that energy systems remain useful and functional. The implementing agencies and vendors should also consider whether project timelines include climate risks through the four stages of the project life cycle and whether the technical designs consider the market availability of spare parts if disruptions occur.
Organizational considerations include whether the contractual and non-contractual responsibilities of all participants are laid out in the event of climate-related disruptions and whether they have adequate capacity to execute them. Users and implementing agencies should account for local capacity building, contingency communication, or response plans under contractual obligations that can be activated during climate-related events. Energy project planning should consider a local community’s expectations, including the role played by energy in a community’s current and future coping mechanisms to manage climate-related risks.
Economic considerations include a realistic estimate of whether finance for a project incorporates climate resilience as a critical element of project planning. Funding agencies, implementing agencies, and users should collaborate on project plans that are flexible enough to integrate innovative financing options to hedge against short- and long-term uncertainty.

As few would disagree, large-format modules are the talk of the solar industry at the moment and many are asking whether bigger is necessarily better. However, there is one thing that is getting bigger in Australian solar that few would complain about, and that is the size of small-scale systems themselves. 
According to the Australian Energy Council’s (AEC) quarterly Solar Report, the average solar system size for residential and small businesses has increased from 2.65 kW in January 2012 to a peak of 8.86 kW in December 2020. Of course, it is worth noting that the average size of system installations peaks every December, followed by a seasonal fall in January.

Of course, similar increases of scale are being seen in the large-scale sector, increasing by 5.4 GW across 69 solar farm projects in that time. In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the report shows 450 MW of newly grid-connected solar capacity. This includes the 132 MW Glenrowan West Sun Farm in Victoria, which went live in February, the 200 MW Kiamal Solar Farm, the  106 MW Yatpool Solar Farm, and the 12.5 MW Robertson Barracks Solar Farm in the Northern Territory. 

AEC Chief Executive Sarah McNamara said the quarterly report also shows that the “number of new monthly installations are likely to exceed 85,000 for the January to March 2021 quarter. New South Wales continues to lead the states with more than 24,400 new installations and 194 MW of total installed solar capacity added in the first quarter of 2021.”
McNamara also noted the growing uptake of battery storage. “Almost 1,400 units installed in 2021 so far. When comparing the uptake of battery installations with rooftop solar by state South Australia (SA) and NSW lead, accounting for around 25% and 23% of total installations,” she said. 
Queensland seems to be the state lagging behind in the solar+battery installation figures. It only accounts for 11.8% of total solar+battery installations. This may be due to the state government’s incentive scheme drying up in 2019, underscoring the need for subsidies when it comes to batteries, which are still on the expensive side. 

The AEC has also done some number crunching on what is probably the biggest talking point in Australian solar as far as end-users are concerned – export charges. As South Australia has shown, unless grid upgrades are made by electricity distributors, solar exports will be limited. And this will have a resounding impact on the solar industry, on wholesale energy prices, and of course, most importantly, on emissions reductions. 
As the Australian Energy Market Commission has outlined, there are two paths forward. We do nothing, and watch electricity prices and emissions rise. Or we upgrade the distribution network and incur extra costs in the meantime. But such costs can be offset with solar.
