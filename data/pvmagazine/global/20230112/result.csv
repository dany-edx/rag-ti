The move comes after the US Department of Commerce (DoC) determined in December that solar cell and module imports from Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand were circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders on cell and module imports from China.
The DoC preliminarily found that Trina Solar was attempting to bypass US duties by processing its China-made solar cells and modules in Thailand before importing them to the United States. Its US subsidiary said it expects the wafers, cells, and modules imported from the new factory in Vietnam to “receive an exemption from circumvention.”
“Prior to the DoC preliminary AD/CVD determination in December 2022, Trina worked to expand production locations, arrange business operations, and diversify supply chains to comply with US regulations and minimize tariff impact on its products,” said the manufacturer. “Trina’s ongoing process already includes polysilicon sourced outside of China and manufacturing modules and cells in Southeast Asia. The wafer facility is a further step in Trina’s supply chain diversification.”
Solar cells and modules from Vietnam are also affected by the DoC’s preliminary findings, but companies operating in the Southeast Asian country are “permitted to certify that they not circumventing the AD/CVD orders, in which case the circumvention findings will not apply,” according to the DoC website. The same applies to Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand.
Trina Solar's new facility in Vietnam is expected to start operations in the middle of this year.

Butagaz has announced a new acquisition in the PV sector, about one year after acquiring two French installers, Soltéa and Solewa. In its latest transaction, the oil and liquefied gas supplier has agreed to acquire Sys EnR, an installer and operator of solar power plants on rooftops and shade structures, based in Essonne, France.
The company did not reveal the financial details of the deal. It said the new subsidiary will continue to offer design, construction and maintenance services for solar PV and thermal installations.
“These energy solutions of the future, economical and low-carbon, are added to the other services and energies such as biopropane, biomethane, green electricity, wood pellets, and others offered by Butagaz to help its customers consume less and better,” the group said in a press release.
Sys EnR, which focuses on the commercial and industrial segment, as well as self-consumption projects, should benefit from Butagaz's customer portfolio. The company claims to have completed around 500 installations since its creation in 2017, for a cumulative installed capacity of 300 MW.
“For the time being, our joint commitment will make it possible to deliver new projects more quickly, with the technical competence of the historical teams and the robustness of the Butagaz group,” said Franc Raffalli, managing director of Sys EnR. “We are going to anchor our fundamental commitments in favor of the technicality and safety of installations in the context of strong growth.”
Since 2015, Butgaz has been a subsidiary of DCC, an Irish utility company.

Mytilineos has now reached financial close on three Australian PV projects, two in Queensland and one in New South Wales (NSW), with a combined generation capacity of 238 MWp as it continues to develop its solar pipeline in the country.
The portfolio includes the 110 MWp Moura Solar Farm being developed near the town of the same name in central Queensland. Mytilineos said construction of the solar farm has already been completed and the asset is now undergoing hold-point testing and expected to begin generating power in 2023.
Also included in the portfolio is the 53 MWp Kingaroy Solar Farm, also in Queensland, and the 75 MWp Wyalong plant being developed in the NSW Riverina region. The company said construction of the Wyalong Solar Farm is “substantially progressed” with the project expected to be completed in the first half of this year. Early works have begun on the Kingaroy project, with main works expected to be carried out during 2023.
The financing package, from backers ANZ and Westpac, is structured as a combination of term facility, construction facility and ancillary facilities totaling AUD 234 million ($156 million).
Mytilineos Renewables Executive Director Nikos Papapetrou said the new funding will enable additional projects to be financed and constructed in 2023 and beyond, further consolidating the company’s position in the wider Australian and Pacific market.
“Australia is a key market for Mytilineos’ global renewables development strategy, extending across the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Latin America regions,” he said. “We are pleased with the trust given to the company and to our vision in the region and we look forward to many more successful financings for our future projects”.
According to the company, its Australian portfolio totals 400 MW and is part of a worldwide pipeline of solar and energy storage projects under various stages of development that exceeds 4 GW.
Once completed, the Moura, Kingaroy and Wyalong solar farms are expected to produce about 500 GWh of renewable energy annually.
Mytilineos said the majority of that power has already been sold in a series of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). More than half of the output of the Moura Solar Farm has been allocated through a long-term PPA with Queensland government-owned generator CS Energy while Smartest Energy, an electricity retailer owned by Japanese investment company Marubeni, has an offtake agreement in place for power produced at the Kingaroy installation. Publicly owned telecommunications company NBN Co has inked a deal to acquire about half of the output from the Wyalong Solar Farm.
This is Mytilineos’ second project financing in Australia, having reached financial close on three 40 MWp solar farms in NSW in late 2021.
ANZ Corporate Finance Executive Director Mark Clover said Mytilineos’ expansion in Australia is “encouraging” for the renewable energy market and aligns with the bank’s goal of funding and facilitating $100 billion in sustainable solutions by 2030.
ACEN corporation
Philippines-based energy company ACEN Corporation also plans to capitalize on Australia’s “unparalleled renewables potential” after securing a $191 million loan facility which it says will be accelerate the delivery of an 8 GW clean energy portfolio that includes solar, wind, battery storage and pumped hydro. The loan will form part of the $414 million ACEN hopes to raise in order to grow its renewables capacity in Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030.
ACEN, which claims to already have approximately 4 GW of attributable capacity across the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India and Australia, said it has more than 1.5 GW of projects across the Australian states of NSW, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia “under construction or at an advanced stage of development” and the new loan will allow it to advance those projects.
“The funds will be allocated to finance the development and construction of ACEN's project pipeline in Australia encompassing solar, wind, battery storage, pumped hydro power and energy storage,” the company said in a statement.
The first of these projects, the New England Solar Farm, is expected to be in operation by the middle of 2023 after the project was granted formal registration to send power to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
ACEN said energy production from the 400 MW first stage of the New England Solar Farm is now underway after the project generated and delivered 5 MW of clean renewable energy into the NEM.
Construction of the first stage of the solar farm and 50 MW/50 MWh battery energy storage system commenced in early 2022. The estimated $530 million project will eventually see a 720 MW solar farm co-located with battery energy storage. There is potential for the energy storage system to be scaled up to 200 MW/400 MWh.
The company has also commenced construction of the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project being developed near Dubbo in the NSW central west. ACEN Australia this week awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract to PCL Construction with notice to proceed already having been issued.
ACEN Australia Construction Manager Tim Greenaway said all major contracts are now in place, including the connection agreement with infrastructure service provider Lumea and the execution of PV module supply contracts.
“It is exciting to finalise the EPC with PCL Construction for the development of the Stubbo Solar project,” he said. “We look forward to working with them over the next several years to deliver the project and help support the transition to a low emission generation supply in NSW.”
Other projects in the company’s Australian portfolio include the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project also in NSW, a share in the 250 MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300 MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia, and the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in Victoria, which may also come to include a battery energy storage system. ACEN is also pursuing wind projects in NSW and Tasmania.
The new loan facility is backed by the Bank of China (BOC) in Manila and Hong Kong, CTBC Bank in Manila and Singapore, and Standard Chartered Bank in Australia. ACEN said Bank of China was the green loan structuring bank, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia served as the agent for the loan facility.
ACEN Australia Chief Executive Officer Anton Rohner said the loan facility is a follow on from several transactions completed last year.
“This syndicated green term loan facility continues to build on the funding secured at the end of last year, and will be mobilised into our Australian portfolio,” he said. ‘With Stubbo 520 MWdc project reaching notice to proceed late in 2022, ACEN continues on the journey in decarbonising Australia. It is exciting to work with quality financial institutions, and the appetite for quality investments is real.”
In August 2022, ACEN Australia executed a $100 million loan facility with DBS Bank Australia. The following month, ACEN executed an agreement with the Sydney branch of global financial group MUFG for an up to $140 million loan facility and secured a $52 million green debt facility with the Australian government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/12/israels-behind-the-meter-storage-market-to-hit-turning-point-in-2023/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ISRAEL",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JANUARY 12, 2023",Israel’s behind-the-meter storage market to hit turning point in 2023,"Israel introduced a new electricity pricing policy from Jan. 1 that stops fixed prices for large electricity consumers, which means higher evening prices for Israeli companies. Residential consumers, meanwhile, have been given the option of choosing between a fixed single tariff or a variable tariff based on the time of electricity use; thus far, very few have chosen the variable tariff.
Eitan Parnass, the founder and director of the Green Energy Association of Israel, told pv magazine that the new regulation “will push storage economics.” It will encourage commercial consumers to store self-generated solar power at noon, when electricity tariffs are low, and use it or even trade it in the evening, when retail prices are higher.
This will more naturally concern net-metering users. Feed-in tariff (FIT) contracts in Israel have a duration of 25 years, offering long-term financial stability for rooftop FIT systems. However, net-metered users will see their income plunge in the new year unless they manage to combine their projects with behind-the-meter storage units, to shift the time of use of their self-generated power.
The Israeli government recently scrapped the net-metering scheme for new systems, so the owners of about 380 MW of installed net-metered solar capacity will have to explore new options. In fact, this is already happening with a number of shopping malls, factories, and electric vehicle stations, as big consumers have started looking into arbitrage storage system solutions.
Market liberalization
On Jan. 1, a new regulation was enacted to allow the establishment of new electric utilities without their own generation assets, as long as they buy electricity from fossil fuel generators. However, new utilities will also be able to purchase green electricity from Jan. 1, 2024.
Opening the market to retailers without their own generation assets is the result of Israel's 2018 electricity market reforms, said Parnass. The reforms aim to liberalize the electricity sector and facilitate competition between electricity generators and electricity retailers.
As part of those reforms, about half of the generation assets of state-owned Israel Electric Corp. (IEC) were sold to private investors. Until the end of last year, Israeli consumers could buy electricity from the IEC or other independent power generators (mainly gas generators). But the government hopes the new policy changes introduced in 2023 and 2024 will encourage new utilities to enter the market, regardless of whether they own generation assets.
It is clear that Israel’s electricity market is belatedly undergoing structural changes, and one of these changes relates to the fuel mix. According to the 2018 reforms, coal production will cease at the end of 2025, so it can be replaced by natural gas and renewable energy. Israel has plenty of domestic gas and solar resources. On this basis, the government aims to generate 70% of its electricity from gas by 2030 and the remaining 30% from green sources such as photovoltaics, supported by 10 GWh of energy storage.
It is under these strategic parameters that Israel’s Electricity Authority launched competitive tenders in 2020 for the procurement of new solar-plus-storage capacity. It awarded about 777 MW of PV capacity alongside four-hour battery systems. Shai Baharav, co-founder of the Israeli storage supplier and developer BLEnergy, told pv magazine in November that about 400 MWh of battery storage will be installed in the next few months at these sites, along with 2.5 GWh in the next two to three years.
The key priority for Israel is to establish a clear energy storage policy framework that allows front-of-the-meter and behind-the-meter storage projects. However, the market for grid ancillary services is non-existent, for example.

The pilot installations are designed to improve fruit quality through research on plant health, growth, and production, while reducing waste due to plastic foil, the company said in a statement.
BayWa r.e. and its Dutch subsidiary, GroenLeven, built two agrivoltaic projects with capacities of 105 kW and 125 kW in the villages of Enspijk and Randwijk, the Netherlands. The cherry and pear pilots will be monitored by Fruit Tech Campus and Wageningen University and Research, respectively.
In Austria, the developer and its local subsidiary, GroenLeven, completed a 340 kW project for stone and pome fruit cultivation in Graz. The Haidegg research facility will monitor the fruit growing under the PV panels.
In Germany, Baywa r.e. and solar company MKG Göbel finished building a 115 kW raspberry agri-PV pilot in Oedheim. The project has a light transmittance of approximately 70%, according to the developer.
“We are experiencing a great demand for our agri-PV solutions, because it brings PV expansion in line with agriculture and nature conservation,” said Stephan Schindele, head of product management agri-PV at BayWa r.e. “For these synergies to be leveraged between the sectors, technical adaptation of the PV generator is required, resulting in higher costs. Unfortunately, in many markets, the political course has not yet been set to serve this potential and demand. In collaboration with the scientific community, we will demonstrate that it is socially, environmentally, and economically worthwhile to support agri-PV.”
The Dutch government, the federal state of Styria in Austria, and the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in Germany funded the pilot “fruit-voltaic” projects.
BayWa r.e. developed and installed 15 agri-PV projects in the European Union by the end of 2022. In 2023, the company plans to build the first agrivoltaic projects outside the EU. It also aims to introduce agri-PV projects combining animal husbandry for cows and sheep to its portfolio.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/12/from-300-gw-to-3000-gw-per-year-a-utopia/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CHINA,EUROPE,GERMANY,INDIA,SPAIN,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"JANUARY 12, 2023","From 300 GW to 3,000 GW per year – a utopia?","From pv magazine 01/23
At the “Forum New Energy World” conference hosted by Conexio in Berlin in September, 2022, one session posed a provocative question: “Three thousand [GW] instead of 300 GW of solar additions – crazy idea or hard-hitting reality?”
Ten years ago, pv magazine and the forum – at that time, both part of renewable energy consultant Solarpraxis AG – suggested a similarly utopian figure by launching a campaign to reach 300 GW of annual global PV additions in 2025. Back in 2012, talk in Germany concerned solar taxes, over-subsidization, and the 52 GW solar capacity ceiling. Nevertheless, Solarpraxis founder Karl-Heinz Remmers called for Germany to hit 200 GW of cumulative PV by 2025, alongside the global 300 GW annual goal.
Since then, the German government has adopted a goal of 215 GW of solar this decade and the world will probably see 300 GW of new solar installations this year. It is now widely accepted that an increased solar ambition is required to address climate change and energy security. With the electrification of heat, transport, and other sectors opening up potentially huge markets for solar, what should the target be?
In my remarks in the forum session I provided the international context and tapped our global network of reporters to shed light on the situation and outlook of key PV markets.
I drew upon trade body SolarPower Europe’s “Global Market Outlook 2022-2026,” and the world’s three biggest solar markets – China, the United States, and India – were assessed by Vincent Shaw, Anne Fischer, and Uma Gupta, respectively. Pilar Sanchez, in Valencia, provided an update on Spain, Europe’s second-biggest PV market, after Germany.
China, the United States, India, and Spain contributed 54.9 GW, 27.3 GW, 14.2 GW, and 4.8 GW of new solar capacity in 2021, respectively. The global total in the year was 167.8 GW, 21% more than was posted in 2020, when the pandemic hit. If the industry maintains the 25% average growth rate recorded over the past decade, an annual addition of 3 TW per year could be achieved within 10 years.
SolarPower Europe expects continued strong growth and its most ambitious scenario predicts more than 300 GW of solar this year. “No single energy technology ever in history has grown as massively steeply as photovoltaics,” said Christian Breyer, professor of solar economics at Finland’s LUT University, in reference to the PV learning curve in the past 20 years.
As a result, institutions underestimate solar’s growth potential, even SolarPower Europe itself, as executive advisor Michael Schmela admitted in Berlin. Breyer pointed to frequent failures by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to anticipate the meteoric rise of PV. In view of the proven dynamism of the industry and pressing need to address climate change, it is incomprehensible how IRENA can expect annual global PV installations to plateau at around 440 GW per year of new solar from 2030 to 2050.
As Silicon Valley venture capitalist-turned solar entrepreneur Bill Nussey explained in his 2022 book “Freeing Energy,” “economies of volume” are at play in the solar and semiconductor industries. In the US alone, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is expected to lead to the installation of 950 million solar modules. This massive scale drives solar’s exponential growth. By comparison the global number of coal- and gas-fired power plants is tiny and this fundamental difference makes forecasting PV adoption all the more complicated.
Solar, though, needs suitable conditions to flourish and help cap the rise in average global temperature this century at 1.5 C. As LUT’s Breyer points out, it’s not just a matter of replacing fossil-fuel power plants with renewables but also of electrifying – and thus, decarbonizing – sectors including transport and industry, as part of renewables-driven power-to-X. For such a vast undertaking, 3 TW per year of solar may be too little. That’s why Breyer ventured even further in the 3,000 GW session by asking the audience whether 3 TW is “crazy, realistic, necessary, or maybe even too low.”
Breyer added, 15 to 20 years ago the world did not have 5 TW of power plant generation capacity, full stop. No-one then was mulling power-to-X and decarbonizing supply chains.
The IRA addresses the upstream solar industry of component manufacturing as well as the downstream market of PV installations. Previously, US solar manufacturing was marked by ugly bankruptcies such as Solyndra or German business Solarworld’s Oregon subsidiary, as American companies followed in the footsteps of their European peers.
The IRA introduces a ten-year investment tax credit of 30% with “adders” to raise the credit even further, such as an extra 10% for using American components. Upstream companies can claim advanced manufacturing production credits. For example, European module maker Meyer Burger will receive $0.07 per watt for each module from its new Arizona plant. The IRA – which also opens doors for Canadian and Mexican manufacturers – creates perfect conditions for a long-term PV boom.
Similar efforts are needed in Europe and elsewhere to tackle the climate crisis and reach, or even exceed, 3 TW of annual additions.

Japan was the region in which the number of new hydrogen patents rose at the fastest pace throughout the 2011-20 period, with compound average growth rates of 6.2%. The United States is the only part of the world in which the number of patents decreased over the same period.
South Korea and China accounted for around 6% and 4% of total patents, but they showed solid growth, with average annual growth rates of 12.2% and 15.2%, respectively. South Korea, in particular, is focusing on emerging end-use applications for hydrogen.
The European chemical industry, mainly in Germany and France, dominated innovation in established hydrogen technologies. However, the new hydrogen patent heavyweights are primarily Japanese and Korean companies in the automotive and chemical sectors. Such companies tend to focus on electrolysis and fuel cell technologies.
“About half of international patent families (IPF) in hydrogen technologies in the period 2011-20 were related to hydrogen production,” said the IEA and the EPO. “The other IPF were split between end-use applications of hydrogen and technologies for the storage, distribution and transformation of hydrogen.”
Patenting has shifted away from fossil fuel-based tech to low-emission methods. The report notes the increase in electrolysis technology innovation. Japan led patents in alkaline and PEM technologies between 2011 and 2020.
“The EU 27 and other European countries are active in both patenting and manufacturing – notably in SOEC technologies – while also making significant contributions in terms of PEM and alkaline technologies,” said the IEA and the EPO.
The two institutions have called for strong policies to make low-emission hydrogen more cost-competitive. They have noted that technology improvements across the value chain will be needed for hydrogen to play a “major role” in the energy transition.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/12/first-attempt-to-build-solar-cells-based-on-gold-halide-hybrid-perovskite/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 12, 2023",First attempt to build solar cells based on gold polyhalide hybrid perovskite,"Researchers at the Research Institute of Sweden (RISE) have proposed the use of gold polyiodide compounds as the active layers in monolithic solar cells.
“We are seeking to build solar cells based on non-toxic gold, which opens up other application areas, such as consumer electronics, flexible electronics and indoor applications, where the price is not always the most critical factor,” researcher Allan Starkholm told pv magazine. “These areas do not necessarily require super high efficiencies. More importantly, the ideas behind these new materials could be used as concepts for new materials and in conventional perovskites as well to possibly boost efficiencies.”
The research group proposed to use, in particular, two pseudo-2D gold polyiodide compounds known as [DodMe2S][AuI4][I3] and [Et3S][AuI4][I5], which yielded optical bandgaps of 1.40 and 1.25 eV, respectively.
“These narrow bandgaps are akin to some recently reported gold perovskite-type compounds and indicate suitability for photovoltaics,” they said.
The academics used polyiodide ionic liquids (PIL) as a precursor solution for the deposition of the compounds as thin films. They said high vacuum and high temperatures should be avoided when assembling solar-cell devices involving the above-mentioned compounds.
They built lead-free solar cells based on the two compounds as the absorber layers using a device structure consisting of a tin oxide (FTO) substrate, titanium oxide (TiO2) films, a zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) interlayer, a nickel(II) oxide hole transporting layer and a carbon electrode.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the champion solar cell developed by the scientists achieved a power conversion efficiency of 0.052%. “The reference measurements show that there is great potential for improvement using that device structure in ambient conditions,” Starkholm stated.
“Our work did not really include an in-depth cost analysis but one of the raw materials are based on gold, which is relatively expensive compared to the lead used in the conventional perovskite solar cells,” he added, when asked about the cell costs. “It depends a bit on the application area also, but it would likely be more expensive than the conventional ones.”
The scientists described the new perovskite cell tech in “Gold Polyiodide Hybrid Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.
“The current results demonstrate a possible route toward new design strategies for lead-free, organic–inorganic complex metal-halide/polyiodide materials and the possibility of assembling stable monolithic solar-cell devices based on materials that usually are considered too sensitive to harsh processing conditions,” said the scientists.
*The article has been updated on January 12 to reflect that the cell efficiency is 0.052%.

The Winture Planet Cube machines have capacities from 1,000 liters per hour to 50,000 liters per hour. The size of the solar array needed to power these machines is a function of three factors: their capacity, the salinity of the water, and the depth of the borehole which water is extracted from. The technology uses seawater, wastewater, brackish water, or surface area as inputs.
“On average, a machine of 2,000 liters per hour needs a PV array with an installed capacity of 11 kW, for most projects we developed in Sub-Saharan Africa,” Hamed Beheshti, CEO of Boreal Light told pv magazine. Other projects include a 15,000 liter per hour machine in Iraq using a 90 kW PV system.
Boreal Light oversizes the solar arrays to sidestep the need for using batteries.
“We are extremely against using batteries because it brings a lot of extra costs, transportation, and maintenance. Instead of storing electricity from the solar panels, we produce more water and store it – it is way cheaper,” said Beheshti. “The machine in the Iraq project, for example, needs a maximum of 49 kW of electricity.”
The excess water is usually used for fish farming, irrigation, and sanitation. The company also uses the electricity excess for charging electrical cargo bikes used for distributing water, and for charging battery banks of nearby schools.
The solution uses 460 W monocrystalline silicon PV panels from DAH solar. The water desalination machines employ a low-pressure reverse osmosis membrane with a lifetime of three to five years and are built to last 25 years, according to Beheshti. Their production cost of water from direct seawater is €0.50/m3. For brackish water, the price decreases to €0.28/m3. Depending on capacity, the machine can cost from €20,000 to €1 million. The company’s clients range from aid organizations and NGOs to businesses, farms, and hospitals.
The Winture Planet Cube is connected to the internet via a SIM card, which allows Boreal Light to perform remote monitoring and control the machines from Berlin.
“We can read 36 sensors in the machines from Berlin. We can also give orders and update the machine software with a click. Such remote controlling for us is part of making the operation simple in remote parts of the world,” said Beheshti.
The company claims that 80% of the machine’s maintenance can be performed by a standard plumber using only a wrench and a screwdriver. It currently has projects in 14 countries across Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

The Chinese company says the X1-Mini G4 inverters are compatible with heat pump systems and home EV chargers.
There are eight versions of the single-phase inverters with nominal power ranging from 0.6 kW to 3.3 kW. They can work with maximum PV system input capacities of 1.2 kW to 6.6 kW.
“The low starting voltage of 50 V ensures that X1-MINI G4 can generate electricity for a longer time, bringing more profit to customers.” the manufacturer said. “Additionally, it supports Modbus for the extendable parallel solution as well as DataHub for mass management and extension solution.”
The inverters feature efficiencies of 98% and a European efficiency rating of 96% to 97%. They have maximum MPPT input currents of 16 A, an MPP voltages ranging from 40 V to 550 V for 2.5 kW, 3 kW and 3.3 kW. The inverters weigh 5.2 kg and measure 290 mm × 206 mm × 120 mm. They are also equipped with IP66-rated protection and a cooling system based on natural convection.
“X1-MINI G4 is designed for high reliability since it is equipped with built-in AC/ DC Type II SPD and export control function,” said Solax Power. “It also supports I-V curve diagnosis, external Rapid Shutdown Device (RSD), and optional ARC detection (AFCI) to guarantee overall protection during operation.”
The Chinese manufacturer recently released its X1-Boost G4 inverters, designed for residential applications, with nominal power ratings of 2.5 kW to 6 kW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/12/india-could-potentially-add-45-gw-of-corporate-renewables-by-2027/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 12, 2023",India could potentially add 45 GW of corporate renewables by 2027,"From pv magazine India
Bridge to India says corporate renewables deployment will likely grow by 22% per year over the next few years, reaching 45 GW by 2027. Open-access PV and rooftop solar will remain the dominant sources of renewable power for corporate consumers.
“Renewable energy certificates (RECs) have had a complex trading history because of frequent and unclear regulatory provisions. Further, corporates are not keen to incur extra costs for renewable power obligation (RPO) compliance,” said Bridge to India. “Green power trading on the exchange commenced in August 2020 but the volumes are very small due to limited availability of untied capacity.”
The report estimates that India had installed 16,099 MW of overall renewables capacity for offtake through open access and 8,269 MW of commercial and industrial rooftop solar as of September 2022.
Open access is a mechanism under which consumers can buy electricity directly from power producers, rather than electricity distribution companies (discoms).
“Utility-scale private-sector developers are bullish on the open-access market primarily to diversify offtake risk away from state discoms,” said Bridge to India. “Most of them have exited the rooftop solar business due to small scale and intensive management effort.”
Bridge to India expect the new renewable additions for corporate offtake to remain geographically concentrated.
“Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka remain the most attractive markets. Under-penetrated markets in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh are also expected to see more growth,” it said. “Other states like Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Punjab with a history of regressive policy actions are expected to see limited growth but could open up with favorable policies.”
