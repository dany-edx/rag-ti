“We need to deploy around 1.1 TW of renewable energy capacity per year by 2030. Every technology that provides a reduction in CO2 emissions is good, but technology neutrality may not be the solution, as only renewables ensure the necessary speed and scale to achieve the proposed targets,” said IRENA President Francesco La Camera, in reference to the slow pace at which nuclear energy is currently driving the global energy transition.
According to the official documents, 123 national governments and supranational blocs, including the European Union, have signed up to triple the world’s installed renewable energy generation capacity to at least 11 TW by 2030. The signatories also vowed to double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements, from 2% to 4%, until the end of 2030.
La Camera noted the importance of creating a workforce for the energy transition. He also discussed the need to create incentives to foster the emergence of a green hydrogen market and to develop grid infrastructure and interconnection sea cables for global energy trade.
In the Tracking COP28 Outcomes report, IRENA said that annual investments in renewable power generation must surge from $570 billion in 2023 to $1,550 billion on average between 2024 and 2030. The report also said that the proposed COP28  target will not be reached without urgent policy intervention.
“G20 nations, for example, must grow their renewable capacity from under 3 TW in 2022 to 9.4 TW by 2030, accounting for over 80% of the global total,” said IRENA.
The organization also said that wider international cooperation, as well as the strategic use of public finances, will be key to achieving the COP28 goals.
“This requires structural reforms, including within multilateral finance mechanisms, to effectively support the energy transition in developing countries,” it stated.

GUVNL has started accepting proposals to set up standalone BESS pilot projects connected to the Indian grid, for an aggregate storage capacity of 500 MWh (250 MW x two hours), with two complete charge-discharge cycles per day.  It will use the BESS on an on-demand basis, according to the requirements of state distribution companies during peak and off-peak hours.
GUVNL will sign battery energy storage purchase agreements (BESPA) with the successful bidders.
BESS developers selected by GUVNL will set up their project on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. The objective is to make the energy storage facility available to GUVNL for charging/discharging of the BESS on an on-demand basis.
GUVNL has also launched a tender to procure 500 MW of solar from projects to be set up anywhere in India, with a greenshoe option of additional capacity up to 500 MW without energy storage. Bidding closes on April 22. The bidders selected by GUVNL will set up solar power projects on a BOO basis.
“Projects under construction, projects which are not yet commissioned and projects already commissioned but do not have any long-term PPA with any agency and selling power on short-term or merchant plant basis will, however, be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other Central or State Schemes and do not have any obligations towards existing buyers,” said GUVNL in the tender document.

4,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/19/who-maintains-the-chargers/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,2024-03-19,Who maintains the chargers?,"As the transportation sector sprints towards a more sustainable future, charging infrastructure bears the weight of powering America’s burgeoning interest in EV.
As the private and public sectors collaboratively work toward meeting the White House’s goal of half of new cars being electric by 2030, there is also a need to provide the increasing number of charging points required.
Analyst McKinsey & Co. estimates the United States e-mobility revolution will require 1.2 million public and 28 million private charging points. What is not being discussed is the fact that those millions of chargers will not only have to be installed, they will also have to be reliable.
Data and analytics company J.D. Power has estimated EV chargers currently suffer a 20% failure rate, leading to concern among drivers about whether they’ll be able to charge at a station when they need the service most. For daily commutes, long family road trips, and delivery fleets, an unreliable charger can be catastrophic. The continued growth of EV adoption relies on drivers feeling confident in chargers that can withstand issues such as power outages, which themselves are becoming increasingly frequent. As more EV chargers are deployed, it is essential to increase not only the quantity of chargers but also their resiliency.
One way in which this need for resiliency can be met is by equipping charging stations with an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) system to provide electricity whenever grid power is unavailable – for example, during periods of high grid demand or outages. During such events, the UPS system can kick in, providing immediate power for the charging station to ensure this critical service can continue being met.
When installing UPS systems for EV chargers, there is an additional opportunity to ensure the set-up is as sustainable, safe, and resilient as possible. This can be done by looking into the battery chemistry relied upon to power the UPS system. For example, compared to lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries, nickel-zinc (NiZn) backup power batteries enhance the resiliency of EV charging stations as they can perform under varying weather conditions, thanks to their wide range of operating temperature.
Additionally, NiZn batteries boast an operating life up to three times longer than a lead-acid battery, and the failure of a single cell won’t stop these batteries from discharging.
When selecting a battery chemistry for an EV charger’s UPS system, some options can also eliminate the threat of thermal runaway, as safety is paramount when it comes to EV. A successful system should also have a small environmental footprint to align with the role EV play in helping mitigate climate change.
Beyond UPS systems, EV charger reliability can also be improved by the use of programs that train the emerging EV infrastructure-maintenance workforce more thoroughly. One such effort is a program that is being organized by EV charger maintenance company ChargerHelp! and the Sustainable Mobility Solutions division of standards body SAE International. The initiative will help more than 3,000 trainees from under-privileged backgrounds by providing them with access to good-quality, unionized jobs while also expanding the trained EV charger maintenance workforce.
It is also encouraging to see the United States Department of Transportation’s efforts to standardize chargers so that troubleshooting is easier, regardless of charger brand and type. The new standards, published in February 2023, ensure that chargers, no matter what their operating network, function in a consistent manner and offer a reliable EV charging experience regardless of the driver’s car model or the state chargers are installed in.
The reliability of EV charging infrastructure is of paramount importance to the widespread adoption and success of less-polluting vehicles. Ensuring a seamless charging experience requires not only well-engineered hardware and software systems but also a well-trained maintenance workforce and robust backup battery systems. EV charger deployment does not simply require charger installation.
By making sure steps are taken to make chargers safe, reliable, and sustainable, EV adoption cane be made more enticing to ensure a true impact on the clean energy transition.

Envertech, a power electronics manufacturer, has developed a new microinverter for PV systems on balconies and rooftops.
The company said its new EVT800 microinverter is available in different versions: Type R, Type P and Type B. They all have different connections and communication paths.
Type B for balcony systems comes with an AC connection for normal voltage. Type R comes with an additional AC string connection. This means that several microinverters can be connected to form a string. Type P also comes with an additional AC string connection and the option of Wi-Fi, as well as power line communication.
For balcony installations, for example, Wi-Fi is the easiest way. With a rooftop installation, the connection via Wi-Fi can also cause problems due to the greater distance to the home router.
All versions of the product come with a maximum DC input power of 1,100 W, distributed over two inputs. Accordingly, two modules with a maximum of 550 W per module can be installed. The maximum current at the MPPT input is 14 A. The short-circuit current of the inverter is 25 A and the voltage output is 220 V. The user decides via the app whether 600 W or 800 W are emitted.
The manufacturer said the inverter has a maximum efficiency of 96.8%. The microinverters are protected against moisture and weather with IP class 67 and should be able to work in a temperature range between -40 C and 65 C. They are guaranteed for 15 years, with an option to extend it to 20 years.

In the pipeline is coverage of India and Southeast Asia.
Published in the form of infographics and data tables, the supply chain reports are free.
“We have been observing supply chain trends and movements for years and years, for example also witnessing the gradual growth of manufacturing in Southeast Asia, which is why we have nowadays quality engineering teams on-site at the factories in that region,” Sinovoltaics CTO Niclas Weimar told pv magazine. “This new type of report is basically putting our observations into report form, starting from this year onwards, helping to visualize the distribution of manufacturing capacities across different jurisdictions.”
The analysts expects the information to be used by solar developers and other buyers to locate manufacturers in relevant regions, assess the scalability of the supply chain for larger projects, or to source modules for projects more efficiently with an eye on reducing transportation costs and carbon emissions.
“The solar industry needs the most up-to-date module purchasing information,” said Dricus de Rooij, co-founder and CEO of Sinovoltaics in a statement. “Every four months, solar developers will have critical and dynamic data that will enable them to stay informed about emerging PV suppliers and the latest developments in global solar manufacturing.”
The supply chain reports cover current and planned manufacturing activity from 2023 to 2027 for producers of modules, cells, wafers, ingots, polysilicon, and multigrain silicon. It notes capacity at each of a manufacturers’ factory locations. There are also symbols indicating if a company is now bankrupt, or a manufacturing site is closed or on hold.
The first edition of North American report covers 81 sites in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, while the European version lists 91 sites across the region, including companies located in Kazakhstan and Turkey.

The Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK) has allocated €135 million for solar rebates in 2024.
Austrian agency OeMAG is distributing the incentives under the nation's EAG legislation. PV systems with a capacity of 35 kW to 1 MW are eligible for the scheme, while PV systems under 35 kW are not, as such installations have benefited from a value-added tax (VAT) exemption since January.
The funding is awarded in a bidding process, with bidding windows opening from April 15 to April 29, from June 12 to June 16, and from Oct. 7 to Oct. 21.
In 2023, the Austrian government devoted the record breaking sum of €600 million to the rebate program.
The new provisions also establish how much capacity should be tendered for large-scale renewable energy projects in the 2024-25 period. The Austrian authorities aim to assign 1.85 GW of PV, 1.08 GW of wind power, around 500 MW of hydropower capacity, and 40 MW of biomass.
The market premium awarded by the tender will compensate for the difference between the marketing revenue and the maximum price determined by the tender itself. The first tenders are scheduled to start in May.
Austria installed around 2 GW of new PV capacity in 2023. Its cumulative installed solar power reached around 5.9 GW at the end of December.

“Our system is a first attempt for short-term demonstration, we plan to change the designs as per our new upcoming research,” the research's lead author, Dharmesh Hansora, told pv magazine. “The unique advantage of our system is integrating several components in a single PEC device to avoid extra use of PV components, which minimizes the system complexity and reduces the system cost.”
The system utilizes a photoanode consisting of two PV cells made of a perovskite material known as formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3). The photoanode is encapsulated in a nickel (Ni) foil and an electrocatalyst based on Ni, iron (Fe), and hydroperoxide (OOH).
The solar cells used for the photoanode have a p-i-n structure and are based on a substrate made of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). They also rely on an electron transport layer (ETL) made of titanium dioxide (TiO2), the perovskite absorber, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The team also applied silver (Ag) paste as an ohmic junction metal between the FAPbI3 layer, and a passivation layer made of a Ni metal foil with a thickness of 25 μm. The foil was used to completely block the permeation of the electrolyte.
The researchers then deposited nickel–iron oxyhydroxide (NiFeOOH) as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co-catalyst on the Ni foil by drop-casting Ni and Fe precursor solution. “This metal-encapsulated FAPbI3 photoanode records a photocurrent density of 22.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23  VRHE and shows excellent stability for 3  days under simulated 1-sun illumination,” they stressed, noting that its performance is comparable to that of PV devices based on organic and inorganic metal halide perovskite (PSK) materials.
“We optimized this photoanode using different metal foil and studied the in-depth catalyst-electrolyte interactions,” Hanshora explained, noting that photoanodes with sizes of 0.25 cm2, 7.68 cm2, 30.8 cm2, and 123.2 cm2 were built and tested in a single reactor system.
The research group then constructed the PEC water splitting system prototype by using the photoanode and a platinum (Pt) wire as a cathode. They immersed the anode and the cathode in the electrolyte inside the PEC reactor, while installing another FAPbI3 PV cell outside of the electrolyte in a parallel side-by-side connection.
“These small-area and scaled-up photoanodes recorded STH efficiencies of 9.8% (0.25 cm2), 8.9% (7.68 cm2), 8.5% (30.8 cm2) and 8.5% (123.2 cm2),” said the researchers, noting that photoanode was scaled up by increasing the unit cell size, the number of cells (multi-cell) and the number of reactors.
“Such results demonstrate the possibility that the high STH efficiency of small cells can be maintained in large-cell photoanodes,” they stated, while also acknowledging that the achieved efficiency values are still insufficient for practical PEC hydrogen production.
“We plan to improve further the efficiency and stability of the PEC system by integration of photoelectrodes and the selection of a more efficient and durable catalyst,” Hansora said.
The system was presented in the paper “All-perovskite-based unassisted photoelectrochemical water splitting system for efficient, stable and scalable solar hydrogen production,” which was recently published in nature energy.

The model uses weather big data and also accounts for the effect of transmittance change caused by snow, which is calculated by taking into account snow depth, as well as its melting rate.
“Snow-induced loss might be a small proportion for low/mid latitude,” the researchers said. “However, for the high-latitude areas where the winter seasons are generally lengthy, the snow effects play an important role so that exclusion of snow effects would significantly influence the reliability of the results.”
The novel method couples an optimal PV installation angle model to maximize PV power generation with a simplified snow-PV yield model (SPYM). The PV angle model is executed with angles ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees with 0.1-degree intervals, finding the optimal position based on total global solar irradiation on the PV system, which is given by the sum of direct, diffuse, and reflection irradiation.
The adjusted irradiation is yielded from the SPYM model, which is based on snow depth, air temperature, and irradiation. While the temperature can predict whether the snow on the panel is melting or covering the module, the snow depth determines its transmittance.
“The calculation of this snow loss factor refers to the transmittance model from Perovich,” the academics said. “The transmittance drops sharply from 1 to 0.1 when snow depth increases from 0 to 2 cm. Then, the decrease becomes smoother, and the value reaches 0.01 when the snow depth increases to 12 cm. When the snow depth is thicker than 12 cm, the value is assumed to be 0.”

Following the development of the model, the scientists used Solcast historical meteorological data for 2012-2021 for the Swedish city of Hammarby Sjöstad as input. Optimal calculations were made for one year, five years, and ten years. In their case study, they assumed PV modules with 19.2% efficiency and an output of 430 MW.
Then, they compared and used their novel model for three scenarios. The first case was a base case with no snow conditions, considering only historical irradiation and temperature data. In the second scenario, snow effects were calculated with the assumption that it melts after 12 hours. The last scenario assumed removal agents, which shortened the snow removal time to one hour. All the results were compared to the commercial insulation angle of 15 degrees and the geometric angle for Sweden, 40.7 degrees.
“The PV system with the annual optimal angle outperforms the one with a commercial angle, resulting in an approximate 4.8% increase in power generation,” the research group stated. “The optimal PV installation angle decreases when considering snow conditions, with the difference dependent on local weather conditions each year, reaching up to 7.8 degrees.”
In addition, the scientific group found that snow conditions lowered power generation conditions by 14.7%. They also found that applying removal agents can improve PV performance by 0.1%–2.3%.
Their findings were presented in “A new optimal PV installation angle model in high-latitude cold regions based on historical weather big data,” published on Applied Energy. The research was conducted by academics from Sweden’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.

“In order to adapt to market changes and improve organizational efficiency, Longi is optimizing its workforce,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The expected job reduction rate is about 5% of total employees, and the information circulating online about our company's ‘30% layoff' plan is false.”
The statement refers to an article published by Bloomberg on Monday, citing “people familiar with the matter” as a source. The outlet reported that Longi was planning to cut around one-third of its staff to reduce costs and regain competitiveness in an industry plagued by overcapacity.
This is not the first time layoff rumors have emerged in relation to Longi. In December 2023, reports surfaced suggesting a significant reduction in expatriate laborers and management trainees, alongside a halt in social recruitment activities.
According to the company's latest annual report, it employed 60,601 people at the end of 2022. It was expected to have grown to around 80,000 employees by mid-2023.
The March edition of pv magazine is dedicated to energy storage and considers sodium-ion’s chances of toppling lithium-ion, takes a look at compressed air technology, and asks whether big or small is the best approach for African solar and storage.
Longi is the world's leading vertically integrated solar enterprise. It recorded CNY 94.1 billion ($12.6 billion) of operating revenue in the first three quarters of 2023, up 8.55% year on year. Net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies also saw an uptick, reaching CNY 11.694 billion, up 6.54% year on year.
However, Longi has also encountered significant challenges, due to escalating overcapacity in the PV sector and the continuous decline of module shipping prices.

The novelty of the research consisted of integrating for the first time a wide energy bandgap Se cell in a PV device with a tandem configuration. This simple tandem device is unique as it is based on single-element absorber materials.
“The Shockley-Queisser limit for such a tandem solar cell comes out at more than 40% efficiency,” the research's corresponding author, Rasmus Nielsen, told pv magazine. “Therefore, this tandem solar cell has the potential to increase the power conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells at a very low cost, given that selenium needs to be processed at temperatures below 200 C.
The new cell, according to its creators is a potential alternative to perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells.Its pros include that the semiconductor is inorganic, consists only of one element, and is very good at absorbing light, on top of having low toxicity and being earth-abundant.
Using the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, the researchers identified a critical transport barrier for this kind of tandem cell at the interface between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the recombination layer, which they said restricts the flow of charge carriers and reduces the cell's power conversion efficiency.

They showed that this issue may be addressed by replacing zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) with a layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) for the n-type contact in the selenium top cell.
“The integrated short-circuit current densities of the individual subcells show that the selenium top cell is limiting the overall current of the tandem device,” they explained. “By applying a reverse bias to the top cell using the accessible third terminal, the collection efficiency significantly improves.”
For the bottom silicon cell, the scientists used a customized n-type TOPCon device with an indium tin oxide (ITO) recombination layer and a silver (Ag) metal contact on the backside. The top device was fabricated directly on the ITO layer, using an n-type contact based on either zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) or titanium dioxide (TiO2).
The scientists found that the ZnMgO-based tandem device reached an open-circuit voltage of 1.68 V, but a low efficiency. The best overall performance was achieved using the TiO2 n-type contact reaching an efficiency of 2.7%, which is 10 times higher than with the ZnMgO. The still significant losses from the selenium top cell were analyzed in depth, and strategies to further improve the tandem solar cell were proposed.
“By replacing the electron-selective transport material, we achieved a promising tenfold increase in efficiency, albeit compromising the ideal band alignment at the p-n heterojunction,” they stated. “This highlights the importance of optimizing the heterostructure interfaces, where the inclusion of surface modification layers should be considered.”
They introduced the new cell concept in the study “Monolithic Selenium/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells,” published in PRX Energy.
Looking forward, the research group said it intends to invert the device structure, so that the n-type and p-type contacts of both the top and bottom cells are swapped around. “We also suggest replacing the ITO layer with another recombination layer that is more compatible with ZnMgO thin films,” Nielsen explained. “Finally, a lot of series resistance losses should be addressed.”

A move toward more solar is partly an attempt to diversify Albania’s electricity sources. In “Evaluation and integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in Albanian energy landscape,” which was recently published in Solar Compass, the scientists said that solar is an adaptable and affordable alternative, given Albania’s sunny climate.
There are already incentives in place to bolster PV development in Albania across three mechanisms: net metering for PV systems up to 500 kW, feed-in tariffs (FiTs) for projects of up to 2 MW, and an auction scheme for large-scale solar facilities.
However, these programs have thus far failed to bring big growth volumes for solar and renewable energy in the country. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the nation had just 29 MW of cumulative PV capacity at the end of 2022.
The scientists said that the FiTs for PV up to 2 MW have been particularly unsuccessful due to “feasibility gaps.” They said the auction scheme based on contracts for difference (CfD) could deliver more growth, but to date only a few of the projects selected in auctions have come online.
The academics presented a series of socio-technical, economic, policy and management barriers to solar development in Albania. They said that investor fear is brought on by hard administrative processes for licenses and permits, non-transparent regulations, difficult funding access, grid connection challenges, and grid stability issues.
The academics said it is necessary to invest in grid infrastructure, streamline laws, maintain policies, raise public awareness and improve access to funding.  They said it is particularly important to resolve land use issues and grid integration problems for the implementation of large-scale solar.
“Coordinating energy policy, fostering transparent regulations, and involving the private sector will maximize Albania's PV integration potential,” they concluded. “Community engagement and public awareness are vital; informed citizens are more likely to support and take ownership of renewable projects, ensuring long-term success.”

Green roofs are the roofs of buildings that are partially or fully covered with plants.
Its new K2 GreenRoof Vento System is due to hit the market in the spring. The company said the mounting is made of aluminum 6063 T66, stainless steel A2-70, and polyethylene.
“The K2 development team took care to minimize disruption to the greenery with small feet so that even low-growing mosses and succulents continue to receive light and water,” the company said in a statement. “At the same time, the system naturally guarantees a firm stand and is statically optimized.”
The system supports modules in portrait or landscape configuration, with an elevation of 10 degrees to 15 degrees. It can hold modules with lengths of 1,400 mm to 2,400 mm, width of 950 mm to 1,350 mm, and height of 30 mm to 50 mm.
“This win-win situation on roofs is gaining wide acceptability as more and more local authorities are subsidizing the combination of green roofs with PV or solar thermal systems through funding programs,” said K2 Systems co-CEO Katharina David.

A team of researchers from the University of Adelaide’s School of Chemical Engineering have designed a carbon and cobalt-zinc catalyst that when used in lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries allows for very fast charging, as well as an improvement in the performance of the batteries.
Professor Shizhang Qiao, chair of nanotechnology at the university, said the breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize energy storage technologies and advance the development of high-performance battery systems for various applications.
“Our research shows a significant advancement, enabling lithium-sulphur batteries to achieve full charge/discharge in less than five minutes,” he said, noting that when the electrocatalyst is used in Li-S batteries, the resulting battery “achieves an exceptional power-to-weight ratio.”
Li-S battery technology is popular among researchers and commercial developers, with the potential for the metallic lithium and sulfur combination to deliver more energy per gram than the lithium-ion batteries that currently dominate the energy storage sector.
The high-power capabilities of these batteries make them well-suited for applications requiring rapid charging and discharging, offering enhanced performance and reliability for both consumer electronics and large-scale energy storage solutions in grid applications.
The technology does however have its limitations. Typically, Li-S batteries suffer from low charge-discharge rates, typically requiring several hours – typically from one to 10 hours – for a single full charge-discharge cycle.
To address this, the University of Adelaide team examined the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) which is the pivotal process governing the charge-discharge rate of Li-S batteries.
“We investigated various carbon-based transition metal electrocatalysts, including iron, cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc during the SRR,” Qiao said. “Reaction rates increased with higher polysulphide concentrations, as polysulphide serves as the reactive intermediates during SRR.”
The team eventually settled on a nanocomposite electrocatalyst comprising a carbon material and cobalt-zinc (CoZn) clusters.
The team’s study, which is published in Nature Nanotechnology, reveals that when the electrocatalyst was used in a sulfur-based positive electrode, the corresponding Li-S battery was able to be cycled for 1,000 cycles at 8 C. The battery also demonstrated a discharge capacity retention of about 75%, corresponding to an initial specific power of 26,120 W kg.
Qiao said the high-power capabilities of the batteries make them well-suited for applications requiring rapid charging and discharging, offering enhanced performance and reliability for both consumer electronics and large-scale energy storage solutions in grid applications.
