The TBEA-owned poly manufacturer stated, in its 2019 report, its annual production capacity was due to hit 80,000 with the addition of 36,000-tons worth of manufacturing lines in 2020. The company's latest annual report confirmed that extra production capacity had successfully been commissioned.
Solar module manufacturer Longi has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with oil and gas giant China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation Group (Sinopec) for the joint development of hydrogen, solar and renewable energies. The deal was signed by Longi board chairman, Li Zhenguo,  and Sinopec president, Zhang Yuzhuo.
Shareholders in glassmaker Flat Glass will vote, on May 20, on a proposal to invest RMB5.8 billion (US$889 million) in six PV glass production lines with a daily melting capacity of 2,400 tons. Under the proposal tabled by the board, RMB3.8 billion would be spent on four lines at Fengning Modern Industrial Park, in Fengyang county, Chuzhou, in Anhui province, and RMB2 billion would be invested in two lines at Xiuzhou district, in Jiaxing, Zhejiang.
Cell and module manufacturer Solargiga yesterday published unaudited first-quarter figures which showed shipments of ingots, wafers and modules rose 49% on the same period of last year, from 1 GW to 1.49 GW, raising revenue from production operations 27%, from RMB818 million to RMB1.04 billion. Revenue from the company’s solar project business more than quadrupled by the same comparison, from RMB2.8 million to RMB11.7 million.
Fuyao Glass reported an unaudited rise in first-quarter net profits, from the RMB380 million back in January-to-March last year to RMB813 million this time around, even after foreign exchange losses of RMB70.3 million in the opening three months of this year.
This copy was amended on 19/04/21 to indicate Xinte Energy is thought to have 80,000 tons of annual polysilicon production capacity, rather than the 66,000 previously stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/16/unsubsidized-solar-may-reach-57-gw-in-italy-by-2040/,"MARKETS,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"APRIL 16, 2021",Unsubsidized solar may reach 57 GW in Italy by 2040,"Oxford-based power analytics provider Aurora Energy Research expects unsubsidized solar PV capacity will reach 57 GW in Italy by 2040. According to the company, power purchase agreements will be the main tool used to mitigate risks and obtain financing.
On the demand side, stakeholder pressure will be the main driver. “Corporate and utility PPA demand may reach almost 60 TWh in 2030, exceeding the generation coming from the grid-parity solar and onshore wind capacities,” said Matteo Coriglioni, market lead at Aurora Energy Research.
The number of deals grew significantly over the last year. “Italy now accounts for close to a third of all European PPA offers on our marketplace,” said Flemming Sørensen, vice president of Seattle-based LevelTen, the world’s largest marketplace for PPAs. “They have raced past Spain, Germany, and the UK. It has been in the lead in Europe for the last two to three quarters.”
Italy’s share of total European PPAs was 11% in Q2 2020.
In terms of prices, after dropping between Q2 and Q3 of 2020, Italian solar PPAs have remained stable through Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, in the 41-42 €/MWh range, according to data from LevelTen.
As the Italian solar industry grows and supply goes up, it is likely that prices may register decreases in the next two years, following a similar trend in Spain, but for different reasons, Sørensen said.
“The recent renewable energy auction in Spain has contributed to even more competitive pricing for corporate and utility PPAs. And this is likely to continue,” Sørensen told pv magazine.
The Italian government should have issued the decree to establish the market platform for the negotiation of PPAs almost two years ago. The GME, the company managing the electricity market, has carried out the public consultation but has not launched the platform yet.
“This massive build-out is driven by two main reasons,” noted Aurora senior analyst Michele Scolaro. “On the one hand, improving economics with rising power prices and decreasing technology costs. On the other hand, the current subsidy scheme does not allow solar plants built on agricultural lands to participate in the auction for subsidies, leaving these plants with no alternatives other than going merchant.”
Grid-parity projects face significant risks, exacerbated by Italian geography — namely, the mismatch between solar radiation and electricity demand. Significant infrastructure upgrades will be needed in the next five to 10 years to increase the interconnection capacity between the different zones.
The pressure on the grid will increase, and the limited capacity will result in higher cannibalization of capture prices for the plants in the south and on the islands. This is a risk that developers of merchant assets need to consider and hedge against, explained Scolaro.
“Even accounting for the planned upgrades of the grid infrastructure, we expect capture prices in the southern regions to be 10 to 15% lower than in the northern ones already by 2030,” Scolaro told pv magazine. “This effect will be particularly intensified in Sicily, where developers are currently focusing their attention.”
With regards to the contracts, the majority of tenures has been between zero and five 5 years, “which is unusual with respect to other European markets, and not great for the financing of merchant projects,” said senior analyst Carlotta Piantieri, explaining that 67% of the PPAs in Italy are from solar PV.
“More recently, we have seen more PPAs with longer tenors (seven to 10 years), as well as more corporate off-takers, such as Amazon and Sofidel,” Piantieri told pv magazine.
Small power retailers will also play a key role in the future. “Since the economic fabric of Italy is composed of several SMEs, poolings of off-takers might emerge in the coming years,” he further explained. “Poolings would also be a tool to address off-takers’ creditworthiness issues, that are important to be able to realize a PPA contract, especially in difficult economic times as today.”
According to Pianteri, as the market is maturing, off-takers should “get more comfortable with signing longer tenors. This will have implications on the PPA price, not only due to the value of energy, but especially since the higher value at risk on the off-taker’s balance sheet.”

The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) has launched a tender for the development of 1.2 GW of hybrid wind-solar power projects on a build-own-operate basis.
Selected projects will sell power to SECI under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA).
“Projects under construction, projects which are not yet commissioned and projects already commissioned but do not have any long-term PPA with any agency and selling power on short-term or merchant plant basis will also be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other Central or State Schemes and do not have any obligations towards existing buyers,” specified SECI in the tender document.
The rated installed project capacity of either energy source should be at least 33% of the contracted capacity. Developers are required to set up the link to the transmission network with a minimum voltage level of 220 kV at their own cost.
A project's PV unit may be sub-divided into a number of ‘blocks’, set up at multiple locations if required. The minimum voltage level for a single block shall be 33 kV.
The minimum project size is 50 MW.

The change in plans seems to indicate that hydrogen could emerge as an alternative to LNG. “In October 2020, a market test to show binding interest proved that there is currently not enough interest in the LNG sector in terms of booking large, long-term capacities for LNG regasification in Germany,” the company said Wednesday. The new concept envisages an import terminal for green ammonia to be equipped with an ammonia cracker, connected to the planned hydrogen network. “A 410-megawatt electrolysis plant is also planned, which – in combination with the import terminal – would be capable of supplying around 295,000 metric tons or 10% of the demand expected for the whole of Germany in 2030.”
RWE Supply & Trading, a subsidiary of German energy company RWE, and Australian hydrogen project developer H2U signed a memorandum of understanding to develop hydrogen trading between Australia and Germany. “The planned LNG Terminal in Brunsbüttel, where RWE intends to book capacity, can be an ideal location for the future import of hydrogen into Germany,” the German company said Thursday. H2U develops several hydrogen projects in Australia and New Zealand, such as the 75 MW Eyre Peninsula Gateway Project electrolysis plant. “In a second phase of expansion throughout the 2020’s H2U wants to extend the capacity to 1.5 gigawatts of electrolysis.” RWE has some 30 hydrogen projects, mostly located in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK.
Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy approved €52 million in funding for the €300 million Norddeutsches Reallabor (North German Physical Laboratory). The five-year project will investigate a “holistic transformation of the energy system”, with five geographical centers in Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. Additional funding from the environment and transport ministries is expected. The funds will be used to implement 25 sub-projects, focusing on sector coupling and the use of green hydrogen as an energy carrier for industry, heat and transport.
The City of Hamburg launched its bid to become a major hydrogen location during the Hannover Messe industrial fair, taking place digitally this week. “Decarbonising industry, developing a green hydrogen economy, and promoting smart mobility are among Hamburg's top priorities,” Hamburg Minister of Economic Affairs Michael Westhagemann said. According to the OECD, northern Germany has strategic advantages, both on the generation and sale sides.
Stuttgart-based Bosch industrial conglomerate and Chongqing-headquartered Qingling Motors established the Bosch Hydrogen Powertrain Systems joint venture in China to develop, assemble and market fuel cell systems for the Chinese market. Small-scale production is scheduled to start this year, the engineering and technology company said. “Also in 2021, a test fleet of 70 Qingling trucks equipped with Bosch's Fuel Cell Power Module will hit the road. The market launch of the fuel cell system is planned for 2022/2023,” reads a press note published on Wednesday.
Germany’s gas transmission system operator OGE signed a letter of intent to collaborate with US and Italian vehicle companies Nikola Corporation and Iveco with the aim of establishing a “business structure” for transporting hydrogen via its pipeline network to fueling stations supporting fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). “The collaboration is being launched with the intent to further define and formalize the roles and responsibilities of the parties and the required collaboration governance to enable execution of objectives to be stated in definitive agreements,” OGE said in a statement Wednesday. Nikola is a manufacturer of heavy-duty commercial battery-electric vehicles and FCEVs; Iveco is a subsidiary of Italian-American corporation CNH Industrial; OGE owns and operates a 12,000 km natural gas pipeline infrastructure network in Germany.
The European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative has proposed a hydrogen network of 39,700 km by 2040, with further growth after 2040. The grid could ship hydrogen between 21 European countries. “Some 69% of the proposed hydrogen network consists of repurposed existing natural gas grids,” OGE, one of the TSOs involved in the project, said in a statement Tuesday. “The remaining 31% newly built pipelines are needed to connect new off-takers and are located in countries with small gas grids today, yet with high expected future hydrogen demand and supply.” The estimated total investment will range between €43 and €81 billion, it added. Twelve European gas TSOs from eleven European countries have joined the EHB initiative.
Jordanian government officials have met with a delegation from Australian iron ore company Fortescue Metals Group to discuss investment opportunities in green hydrogen and ammonia. So far this year, Fortescue has announced deals with South Korea and Brazil. Fortescue grew on the back of iron ore, but it has now become vocal about embracing a green future. It recently set up Fortescue Future Industries, which wants to build a renewable energy portfolio of more than 235 GW.
Baden-headquartered Axpo, the largest energy company in Switzerland, unveiled plans to produce green hydrogen. “A hydrogen production facility at the Eglisau-Glattfelden hydropower plant in Switzerland is the first of several that Axpo will commission in the coming years,” reads a press note released on Thursday. According to the company, the facility is scheduled to go onstream in autumn 2022. “The 2.5-megawatt hydrogen production facility will produce about 350 tonnes of green hydrogen annually,” the company said, adding that it could double its output in case of growing demand. Axpo shelved a similar plan presented in 2015 because of low sales volumes.
Oslo-headquartered Hydro is exploring the potential of developing and operating hydrogen facilities to meet internal and external demand. Hydro aims to strengthen its position in low-carbon aluminum while exploring new growth opportunities. “We can … build and develop a complete value chain for green hydrogen in Norway,” Hydro President and CEO Hilde Merete Aasheim said earlier this year. Hydro said it would offer more details on April 27.
EDF Energy, part of French conglomerate EDF, became a member of UK’s Hydrogen Taskforce. The company is investigating ways of producing hydrogen using energy from nuclear power and renewables. “The Taskforce will include representatives from Sizewell C, EDF’s proposed nuclear power plant in Suffolk. The project hopes to use hydrogen produced from power supplied by neighboring Sizewell B to lower carbon emissions during construction,” reads a note released on Wednesday. Sizewell B is the UK’s only commercial pressurized water reactor (PWR) power station. “Once built, the power station [Sizewell C] could also produce hydrogen flexibly while supplying low carbon electricity to millions of UK homes and businesses.”
Ontario-headquartered electrolyzer manufacturer Next Hydrogen has acquired Canadian hydrogen service company CleanFuel Systems, which managed the installation, operation and maintenance of Canada's first two on-site hydrogen generation projects. “This is the first of many exciting growth milestones for this year as we lay the groundwork to scale, and position ourselves as a leading one-stop solutions provider for our valued customers,” said Next Hydrogen President and CEO Raveel Afzaal.
The Indian government will spend $200 million to promote the use of hydrogen, Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi, the top official at India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said on Thursday, as reported by Reuters. The news agency also wrote that oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan wants to use hydrogen blended with compressed natural gas (H-CNG) as a transportation fuel. “We are looking forward to introducing H-CNG as an intermittent technology in a big way for both automotive and domestic cooking applications,” Pradhan said on Thursday.
The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) has called for public support for hydrogen from Australia, Brunei Darussalam, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and Thailand. “Increasing hydrogen consumption with governmental support such as a Feed-in-Tariffs (FIT) is politically essential,” reads the note released on Wednesday. The ASEAN-focused think tank also reported that some meeting participants “suggested there may be merit in setting a preliminary target to start co-firing gas-hydrogen power generation at existing gas power plants beginning with 5% around 2030.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/16/amorphous-silicon-solar-cells-still-niche-market/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 16, 2021",Amorphous silicon solar cells still niche market,"pv magazine: In “Solar Cells and Modules,” which was recently published by Springer, you dedicate a long chapter to amorphous silicon solar cells, which is very much still a niche technology reserved for specific applications. Why hasn't this technology been deployed in rooftop PV arrays?
Arvind Shah: The main problem of this technology is the low conversion efficiencies that have so far been attained. Commercially, only about 7 % module stabilized efficiency was reached with a single junction. On a rooftop, space is limited. Therefore, wafer-based crystalline silicon solar modules with over 20% commercial efficiency are preferred.
Hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers are used to manufacture highly efficient heterojunction solar cells, but when they are used for amorphous silicon solar cells, they result in cell efficiencies of just 7%. Are these low efficiencies not sufficiently balanced by lower production costs and simplified manufacturing processes?
Potentially, the production costs of amorphous silicon solar panels could indeed be lower than those of wafer-based crystalline silicon solar modules. But this would only occur once high enough production volumes would be reached.  We should take note of the fact that the main factors influencing the production costs of any solar module are the cost of electricity and the investment costs. Now, around 2011, when Chinese manufacturers took over the photovoltaic solar market, they were doing this based on exceedingly low electricity prices, not available anywhere else in the whole world, and interest-free loans from their government. No wonder that they were able to sell solar modules at prices not attainable anywhere else in the whole world.

With technological improvements and cost reductions, what kind of efficiencies can be reached in the future? What is the maximum theoretical efficiency these cells could reach?
My own institute, the PV Lab Neuchâtel, founded by me in 1984, was in 2011 working in close collaboration with a company called Oerlikon Solar. The latter had attained module efficiencies around 12% for large-area modules, albeit with a much more complicated structure called the Micromorph structure, involving both amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon. Oerlikon Solar was not a module producer, but a provider of equipment for manufacturing modules. The companies that made modules with the equipment from Oerlikon Solar had initially a small volume, hence relatively high production costs. These companies were unable to compete in the global market with crystalline silicon moving faster than expected, and they all had to stop activities within a few years. As for the maximum theoretical efficiency these cells may reach, this is a very difficult question. The answer depends on the assumptions you make. If you make realistic assumptions, the limit you can reach is around 16 % for a triple-junction cell. For such a cell, the production costs could be low if you find a way to decrease the cost of equipment and to accelerate the deposition rate of the microcrystalline layer, which are both real challenges.
Amorphous solar cells have big problems with stability and suffer from the “Staebler–Wronski effect” (SWE), which consists of a particular form of light-induced degradation. Is there room for improvement here?
No. During the years 1980 to 2000, there have been numerous attempts to improve the stability of amorphous silicon, by using purer gases, by modifying the deposition parameters, by avoiding/reducing the incorporation of oxygen, iron, and other foreign atoms into the amorphous silicon layer, or by using a totally different deposition process. None of these approaches were successful.
How do amorphous solar cells compare to perovskite solar cells in terms of instability?
It is true that both types of cells suffer from stability problems. However, there are important differences. Amorphous silicon solar cells show initial degradation and their efficiency stabilizes after about two years of normal exposition to sunlight, Furthermore, the decrease in efficiency observed in amorphous silicon is fully reversible – the original state can be recovered through annealing at about 200 C. Moreover, the instability observed in amorphous silicon solar cells depends on their operation temperature – if the latter is high, let's say around 70 C, as commonly encountered in tropical countries, the degradation is much less pronounced. Finally, the degradation in amorphous silicon is a purely physical process, no chemical changes are involved. In contrast with this, we observe for perovskite solar cells that their degradation process, once initiated, apparently continues until the cell is fully degraded. In addition, only a part of the degradation processes observed in today’s perovskite cells during long-term operation is reversible; degradation also depends here on the operation temperature, but it is accelerated, not reduced at higher operation temperatures. Finally, in perovskite cells, the irreversible degradation phenomenon is associated with chemical changes.
In your book, you explain that amorphous silicon does not have a real bandgap. Can you explain what this means?
Yes, I can explain this, but a precise explanation will need concepts from solid-state physics, which readers will, in general, be unable to understand. I will therefore attempt to give an intuitive and approximate explanation here. In crystalline semiconductors, there exists a clear bandgap between the upper edge of the valence band and the lower edge of the conduction band. Within this bandgap, there are practically no electronic states at all. In amorphous semiconductors, such as amorphous silicon, what was previously a real bandgap is now a region filled with electronic states such as bandtail states, due to the amorphous, chaotic nature of the material, and midgap states, due to dangling bonds or broken bonds. Therefore, no real bandgap exists in amorphous silicon.
Unlike other solar cells, amorphous silicon cells have a “p-i-n” structure. How does this structure influence their behavior and performance?
The “p-i-n” structure, used for amorphous silicon solar cells, consists mainly of an intrinsic layer. This layer extends over more than 90% of the whole solar cell, whereas the doped layers – the p and n layers – make up less than 10% of the cell. Intrinsic layers of amorphous have a far better quality than doped layers. Furthermore, within the whole i-layer of the p-i-n structure, there exists an internal electric field – a field that helps in transporting and collecting the carriers. All this contributes to obtaining for amorphous silicon solar cells, a reasonable efficiency of about 9-10% efficiency at cell level, whereas with the traditional pn-structure, like those used in all other types of solar cells, one would not attain more than 1%, in the case of amorphous silicon.
The deposition process in the manufacturing of these cells is made mostly through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Will this process remain the only option for technology developers in the future?
Yes. Many other deposition processes have been tried out. No other process has produced results as good as those obtained with PECVD. At some moment, in the early 2000s, there was a lot of hope for hot-wire deposition. But this process has not created an advantage, although it is at present nevertheless used by some companies for making heterojunction cells.
What kind of improvements are needed in manufacturing processes to open up more commercial possibilities for this technology? How big could this niche become?
Personally, I do not see any improvements here. Japanese and European researchers tried very hard in the early 2000s to find new, alternative materials to be included in multijunction thin-film silicon cells, such as silicon-germanium alloys and special, elaborated forms of silicon-carbon alloys. They did not succeed in finding any viable options.
Do you exclude the possibility that amorphous silicon cells and panels may be used for rooftop or off-grid applications in the future?
No, fundamentally I do not exclude that possibility. However, I very much doubt that anybody will invest massively in this technology today. I will give you here some examples, where amorphous silicon cells and panels would be the ideal choice: windows with selected grades of transparency, greenhouses. Amorphous silicon will also continue to be used for energy scavengers (Internet of Things, watches), because of its high efficiency in indoor conditions and its facility of patterning. Finally, most of the know-how developed for amorphous silicon has now allowed the emergence of valuable and cost-effective manufacturing processes for silicon heterojunction solar cells. My successor, Professor Ballif, who took over as head of the PV Lab in 2005, now concentrates on developing the “solar module of the future,” for the period 2030 to 2040. A module based on a crystalline silicon heterojunction bottom cell and a perovskite top cell. The goal is to reach commercial module efficiencies of 30% at module prices well below €0.30 per watt. In these modules, amorphous interface layers will be a key factor. These modules will constitute a basis for the renaissance of the European photovoltaic industry.
In another interview in this series, Professor Shah spoke to pv magazine about the future of heterojunction PV modules. “Solar Cells and Modules,” published by Springer, was written by Shah and co-author Sylvère Leu. The book includes other contributions from Christophe Ballif, Adinath Funde, Detlef Sontag, Alessandro Romeo, Alessandro Virtuani, Mauro Pravettoni, Urs Muntwyler, and Stefan Nowak.

Augsburg-based power provider Lechwerke (LEW) announced it is testing two small pilot vertical agrivoltaic systems with an output of 3 and 6 kW, respectively. The systems are located next to existing solar parks in Biessenhofen and Gersthofen, in Germany's southern state of Bavaria. The bifacial solar modules are installed vertically at a height of almost 3 meters.
With these projects, LEW wants to gain initial experience with agrivoltaic systems and compare their performance with that of conventional ground-mounted projects. The company plans to use the data for a larger project in the Unterallgäu region, which is already being planned.
In the case of the vertically installed systems, the approximately 1-meter-wide strip of meadows under the modules should remain uncultivated. In this way, they could be laid out as flowering areas and create ecological micro-habitats, LEW stated.
“With the test systems we would like to gain knowledge about the power generation of such systems — in particular how much power the special modules can deliver in direct comparison to conventional modules and that over the course of the day and year,” said LEW project manager Sigrid del Río. “There are already individual projects of vertical agrivoltaic systems, but unfortunately hardly any findings on comparability with south-facing PV systems,” she explained. “We want to use the data obtained from our test systems for future projects.”
LEW and the LandSchektivenEnergie consulting network are currently examining various areas for the larger pilot plant in Straubing and the Unterallgäu district.
The pilot project is also to be scientifically monitored in order to find out how the combination affects the usability of agricultural machines, the agricultural productivity of the area and the microclimatic influence of the agro-photovoltaic system on the area.

The TrinaTracker Agile 1P Dual Row was conceived as a multi-drive, dual-slewing system that is claimed to have improved overall stability compared to other products and to show a reduced aeroelastic effect. This design, according to Trina, improves load transmission efficiency, avoids rotation error and enhances the overall structure.
“The spherical bearing can minimize the structure stress and deformation and further improve reliability and adaptability in complex terrains,” the manufacturer stated. “In addition, Agile 1P is equipped with sophisticated stow strategy, preventing the tracker from structural failure in gusty wind and strengthening system reliability.”
The tracker has a length of 72 meters, which the company says creates room for 120 modules per tracker. As a result, according to Trina's estimations, the capacity of a project can be increased by 15.6% under the same layout. “The intelligent SuperTrack algorithm can increase the Agile 1P's total power generation by up to 8%,” it stated. “With the cleaning robot effectively eliminating sands and dust on modules, system power generation can be enhanced by more than 10%.”
The new product can also reduce the number of trackers in a 1 MW project by 33% compared with conventional single-row one-in-portrait (1P) trackers, which in turn helps reduce the use of DC cables by 9%, the manufacturer added. The spherical bearing of the TrinaTracker features the self-alignment with an angle adjustability of 30%, which can correct the installation deviation and reduce failure rate as well as operation and maintenance costs,” the company said. “Furthermore, an innovative upgrade to the installation process that integrates the patented Trina-Clamp diminishes installation time by 50%.”
The product went through a series of comprehensive wind tunnel tests, including dynamic and static as well as full aeroelastic, the company added, without providing more technical details.

The result was confirmed by the CalTeC laboratory of the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH). “This means that the Jülich TPC solar cell still ranks slightly below the best crystalline silicon cells made in laboratories to date,” the scientists said. “But simulations carried out in parallel have shown that efficiencies of more than 26 percent are possible with TPC technology.”
The device passivation was achieved through ultra-thin transparent layers that are claimed to be effective in preventing recombination events. “In this process, negative and positive charge carriers that have already been generated combine and cancel each other out before they could be used for the flow of solar electricity,” the German group explained. “This effect can be countered by special materials that have a special property — passivation.”
The manufacturing process is based on wet chemical processes, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and a sputtering technique. The prototype was fabricated with a double layer of tiny pyramid-shaped nanocrystals of silicon carbide and a transparent layer of indium tin oxide which were both deposited on a thin layer of silicon dioxide.
The academics also claim that, on top of providing the desired passivation, the transparent layers reduce the incidence of light and have high electrical conductivity. “No other approach so far combines these three properties — passivation, transparency, conductivity — as well as our new design,” said researcher Kaining Ding, noting that the passivation technology may be easily scaled up for commercial production. “We expect solar cell manufacturers to show great interest in our technology,” he stated.

The Goderich A-CAES facility is in Ontario and is contracted by Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator for peaking capacity, ancillary services, and full participation in the merchant energy market. The facility has a 1.75 MW peak output, 2.20 MW charge rating, and up to 15 MWh of storage capacity.
“Hydrostor has a variety of projects under development, as well as a pipeline of large-scale A-CAES projects representing over 6 GW and over 65 GWh of deployment potential in the USA, Canada, Chile and Australia, with significant global project potential across many other markets,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, adding that the capex range for similar projects is between $175 and $250/kWh. “Additional cost reductions are possible today where infrastructure can be repurposed plus additional reductions in technology over time.”
The company explained that its technology utilizes renewable energy or excess grid energy to compress air, which is then funnelled into underground caverns, displacing water and creating storage capacity. Hydrostatic compensation is used to maintain the system at a constant pressure during operation.
The heat created by this process is stored and then used to reheat the compressed air when energy is needed. This adiabatic process is claimed to increase overall efficiency and eliminate the need for fossil fuels during operation. The hydrostatic pressure pushes the compressed air to the surface, where it is then recombined with the stored heat and expanded through a turbine to generate electricity on demand.
“Hydrostor's key breakthroughs rest in our adiabatic thermal management system, which eliminates the need for natural gas, and our purpose-built underground storage caverns, which permit siting flexibility by simply using water and gravity to cost-effectively increase energy density and system size,” the spokesperson further explained.
The Canadian company is also developing the Rosamond A-CAES Project in California, northeast of Los Angeles. That project will provide 500 MW of on-demand peaking capacity for 12 hours of duration once it becomes operational in 2024. “The proposed facility will provide 500 MW of capacity, turning California’s growing solar and wind resources into on-demand peaking capacity while allowing for the closure of emitting fossil fuel generating stations and maximizing transmission system utilization,” the company said.

pv magazine has previously reported Greece’s €54.5 billion Covid recovery plan includes at least €10.4 billion for upgrading energy infrastructure, with a green energy transition in mind. 
The EIB will help Greece identify high-impact investment plans with an emphasis “to be placed on climate action, energy transition and digital transformation,” according to a press release issued by the lender.
The ‘Greece 2.0' plan will be financed by the bloc's Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), which was agreed by EU leaders in July. The European funding pot will offer €673 billion, in loans and grants, to support reforms and investment undertaken by member states aiming to boost economies in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
EIB technical assistance is important as the national recovery plans submitted by EU member states to secure RRF funds will undergo due-diligence vetting to help identify high-impact investments and projects, and to ensure the most effective use of the funding streams. 
Greek finance minister Christos Staikouras said the agreement signed this week by his ministry and the bloc's lender will ensure “our country will benefit from the EIB’s technical, economic and financial expertise in identifying high-impact projects and effective structures, which will significantly contribute to making the best use of the Recovery and Resilience Facility. Furthermore, the EU bank may offer financing, alongside the Recovery and Resilience Facility resources, for some of the projects that will be examined and appraised by its experts.”
The recovery plan drafted by Athens comprises around €31 billion of RRF funding plus a further €26.5 billion of private-sector cash, with policymakers hoping most of the EU grant and loan money will be match-funded by non-state actors.
EU member states wishing to draw down funds from the RRF pot must submit their national recovery plans to the European Commission this month. At least 37% of the proposed spending must be targeted on climate-related investments and reforms.

Juwi Renewable Energy has signed an agreement with energy infrastructure specialist APA to construct a 13 MW solar PV farm at the Gruyere mine site in Western Australia, where it will be integrated into the existing 49 MW gas-fired power station.
APA will also back up the solar and gas hybrid microgrid with a 4.4 MW/4.4 MWh battery energy storage system that will provide reliable electricity for the mine, which is a 50:50 joint venture between Gold Road Resources and global miner Gold Fields Ltd.
“We look forward to assisting APA and the mine owners … to help reduce the overall carbon intensity and cost of power supply to the Gruyere gold mine,” said Dave Manning, Juwi’s global hybrid director.
The solar farm is expected to be operational later this year. The hybrid facility is expected to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 16,000 tons per annum.
The project is the latest in a string of deals juwi has announced in recent months, including plans to construct a solar farm as part of global energy producer Energy Developments Ltd.'s solar-diesel hybrid power station at Jabiru in Australia's Northern Territory.
Juwi said in February that it will build a 3.9 MW solar farm. The project will be coupled with a 3 MW/5 MWh battery and 4.5 MW diesel power plant to deliver at least 50% renewable energy to the township.
In March, Juwi said it would construct a 3.4 MW solar farm. It will be coupled with an existing 12 MW diesel-powered station at Iluka’s Jacinth-Ambrosia mine in South Australia.
The project developer has also signed a deal with Contract Power, a Pacific Energy subsidiary, to build a hybrid renewable energy project that will power the town of Esperance. The project will feature a 4 MW solar farm alongside two 4.5 MW wind turbines integrated with a lithium-ion battery system and gas generators.
The latest projects build on Juwi’s early successes, with three hybrid projects already completed. They included the DeGrussa project, a 10.6 MW solar array and a 6 MWh battery, integrated with existing diesel generation to supply Sandfire’s copper and gold mine site in Western Australia. The facility became fully operational in 2016 and at the time was the world’s largest diesel-solar hybrid system, and the largest off-grid PV system in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/16/geospatial-approach-to-evaluation-of-potential-solar-sites/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 16, 2021",Geospatial approach to evaluation of potential solar sites,"From pv magazine USA
A research team has used geospatial analysis to identify optimal sites for solar in a county in the U.S. state of Maryland. The approach could help other communities as they consider where to site new solar capacity.
Chesapeake Conservancy’s Conservation Innovation Center (CIC) presented its report to the St. Mary’s County Solar Task Force. The county sits due south of Washington, D.C., on a peninsula bounded on one side by the Potomac River and on the other by Chesapeake Bay.
The analysis results showed that the county offers multiple opportunities for solar in locations that would minimally impact the natural landscape or prime agricultural land. The sites included rooftops of commercial and residential buildings, above parking lots as solar canopies, on capped landfills, around a wastewater treatment facility, and on county-owned properties.
High-resolution land cover data allowed the study group to do a detailed analysis down to individual parcels in order to determine how much area is available in optimal and preferred sites. The team also calculated the energy generation potential from these locations.
The study set out to identify all potential solar sites, including those that met legal (zoning) and technical criteria. It ranked county parcels on a range of environmental, equity, and efficiency criteria. It also identified a second tier of locations – preferred ground-mounted sites – that would avoid land-use tradeoffs and conflicts with agriculture or environmentally valuable lands.
These sites met a range of criteria. They had less than 50% total tree canopy in the parcel, had more than 5 acres of “solar opportunity area”– defined as a sum of low vegetation, barren, and herbaceous high-resolution land cover classes. They had less than 50% prime agricultural soil, and less than 75% soil of statewide importance. In addition, they were not in designated no-go zones (defined as protected, or legally restricted, areas) or within designated intensely developed areas of the critical area.
Sites that were within a mile of an existing transmission line were defined as “preferred.” Sites that met the criteria but were farther away were tagged as “other opportunities.”
Based on the analysis, St. Mary’s County has the potential to generate 4,097 GWh per year of electricity from solar energy from 4,431 acres of optimal sites such as degraded lands and landfills, rooftops, parking lot canopies, and publicly owned lands. Another  4,026 GWh per year of potential was available from 2,614 acres of preferred ground-mounted sites less than one mile from transmission lines. The report said these numbers “well exceed” the 331 GWh per year estimate for St. Mary’s share of solar compared to the rest of the state.
Maryland is one of 30 states with a renewable portfolio standard. Maryland’s mandate requires 50% of electricity sold by utilities to come from renewable sources, with 14.5% from solar. The Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO) that serves St. Mary’s County is excluded from the 14.5% carve-out, and instead is required to reach a solar carve-out of 2.5% of retail sales. Even so, the report said that land in the county still could be used for solar installations to meet statewide goals.
The results are displayed in a web app that is open to the public.  The full report is available here.
