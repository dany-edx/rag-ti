France's energy regulator, the Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie (CRE), has released FITs for rooftop PV installations up to 500 kW in size for the second quarter of 2023.
The new tariffs range from €0.2395/kWh for installations below 3 kW in size to €0.1268/kWh for arrays ranging in capacity from 100 kW to 500 kW.
The CRE said the new tariffs are up to 3% higher than those released in the second quarter, when they ranged from €0.2242/kWh for installations below 3 kW in size to €0.1228/kWh for arrays with a capacity of 100 kW to 500 kW.
The CRE also set tariffs for surplus power at €0.1339/kWh to €0.o803/kWh, depending on system size.
The French government raised the size limit for PV projects that can qualify for fixed tariffs from 100 kW to 500 kW in October. In order to boost development in the rooftop segment, the government also decided to reduce the degression rates planned for the FITs.

German startup Clever-PV has developed an app that could become an alternative to classic energy management systems.
The Bavarian company said that the new app was originally developed as a novel solution for charging electric cars with excess electricity from photovoltaic systems and that it can now be used as a manufacturer-independent technology to synchronize photovoltaic systems, charging stations, heat pumps, heating rods and other smart devices via an Internet connection.
The app can be downloaded free of charge from the relevant stores for iPhones and Android.
According to Clever-PV, no additional hardware is required such as expensive control boxes or gateways. The energy management is set up directly on the mobile phone and the connected consumer devices would then be optimized depending on the generation of the rooftop PV system or the photovoltaic balcony modules.
Users could save several hundred euros a year and also reduce their CO2 footprint, the company claims, noting that the app was developed in close cooperation with the first test users, and that it now has more than 10,000 registered users already.
“We are already working on the development of additional functions and the integration of further devices,” explained Danny Klose, managing director of Clever-PV. “We originally developed Clever-PV for ourselves. Photovoltaic surplus charging is normally only possible with expensive hardware. With our solution, customers have more freedom in selecting their devices and don't need an installer to set it up.”

In the study “Experimental and numerical analysis of a CO2 dual-source heat pump with PVT evaporators for residential heating applications,” published in Applied Thermal Engineering, the Italian group described the system as a 5 kW direct-expansion solar-assisted heat pump (DX-SAHP) operating with CO2 as the refrigerant and a transcritical cycle to produce hot water at the gas cooler (GC).
It consists of a compressor, a gas cooler, a throttling valve, an internal heat exchanger, two water tanks, and the above-mentioned two evaporator technologies, which the team said can work alternatively.
The finned coil has 22 ranks and 4 rows and is coupled to a fan driven by a 0-10 Vdc signal to modulate the rotation speed. The PVT system used includes an aluminum plate with a thickness of 0.5 mm glued below a polycrystalline PV module. The aluminum plate is connected to an 8 mm external diameter copper serpentine. The gas cooler is a brazed plate heat exchanger made of 28 plates with external dimensions of 379 x 79 mm.
“After the gas cooler, the refrigerant enters an internal heat exchanger (INT), where the CO2 is cooled down,” the researchers explained referring to how the heat pump works. “Subsequently, it is expanded into an electronic expansion device (EEV) that operates as a back-pressure valve to control the pressure at the gas cooler.” The CO2 is conveyed then to the low-pressure receiver tank (REC), where the vapor phase is extracted from the top and pushed to the compressor through the internal heat exchanger.
The heat pump extracts cold water from a dedicated tank called Tank1 and sends it via a water pump to the gas cooler, which heats the water before it is stored in a hot tank dubbed Tank2. “In Tank1, four variable electrical resistances, capable of producing up to 4.5 kW each, allow controlling the tank’s temperature and, consequently, the water temperature at the inlet of the gas cooler,” the academics explained. “The refrigerant circuit and the water loop are thermally insulated to limit the heat losses towards the external ambient.”
Through the TRNSYS software, which is used to simulate the behavior of transient renewable systems, the researchers conducted a series of experimental tests alternating both evaporator technologies. They found that, when operating with the PVT system, the PV panel achieves an 8% increase in photovoltaic power production due to the cooling effect of the refrigerant evaporating in the collectors.
They also found, however, that, when working in the solar mode, the simulated coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump is 2.58, 2% lower than the value estimated through the experimental tests. “In conclusion, the validated model is a useful tool for performing seasonal simulations of a CO2 heat pump operating in solar and air modes,” they stated. “Future works will focus on developing a control strategy to select the thermal sources to maximize the benefits of a similar dual-source system.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/26/how-big-must-hailstones-be-to-damage-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JULY 26, 2023",How big must hailstones be to damage PV systems?,"From pv magazine Italy
The recent hail storms that occurred in northern Italy have drawn attention to the damage that these sudden and violent atmospheric events can cause to photovoltaic systems. Several system owners have posted photos of damaged plants on social networks, clearly demonstrating the violence of the hailstorms and, above all, the size of the hailstones, which in some cases even reached 20 cm in diameter.
But how big do these grains have to be to damage a photovoltaic system? What can be considered a critical threshold beyond which the damage becomes significant?
pv magazine Italy tried to answer these questions by dusting off a 2019 report by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) which had investigated the insurance damage data of a historic hailstorm that occurred in June 2016 in the Netherlands.
According to the conclusions of the Dutch researchers, damage to solar panels occurs primarily with hailstones with a size exceeding at least 3 cm. “Larger hailstones (more than 4 cm) cause more damage on average than smaller hailstones, but they also show greater variety in the amount of damage to solar panels,” they explained in the paper “The vulnerability of solar panels to hail.”
Starting at 3 cm, both invisible and visible damage can occur, but starting at 4 cm, the percentage of visible damage increases significantly.
The smallest cracks (microcracks) do not form in the front glass layer but in the silicon, resulting in no reduction of the initial yield. After a few months, however, the damaged areas may begin to show a rapid drop in power, and after about a year the micro-cracks also become visible on the outside of the panel. All damage then reduces the lifespan of a solar panel.
The orientation of the roof relative to the direction of the hail can greatly affect the damage caused by hail to solar panels, the researchers explained, noting that this factor could be even more decisive than the size of the hailstones.
Then there is some empirical evidence – on the other hand, not too significant – that even the angle at which the solar panels are installed can influence the damage to the solar panels. A greater inclination, according to the conclusions of the scientists, would help to moderate the damage.
The study also shows that the frequency of hailstorms is increasing in Europe and the Netherlands, as is the damage caused by hailstorms. This indicates that exposed items, such as solar panels, could become more vulnerable in the future.
“Hail risk and the vulnerability of solar panels to hail should be included in risk models and climate adaptation strategies,” the Dutch researchers concluded.

However, their widespread adoption has been plagued by severe zinc dendrite growth, which often induces poor reversibility.
Now, a research team led by scientists from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science in China has found that the addition of serine cations to the electrode/electrolyte interface in the aqueous zinc-ion battery would obstruct the rampant growth of the Zn (100) plane.
Namely, high-activity facet is often prone to side reactions, including deterioration of the zinc anode and declining stability of the battery. Therefore, tailoring the zinc deposition behavior is vital to prevent dendrite growth.
The researchers conducted a (100) facet-termination engineering strategy employing serine (Ser, C3H7NO3) as the interface structure conditioner into a zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) system.
This endowed the Zn anode with a long cyclic life of more than 800 h for Zn//Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 5 mA cm−2 and 5 mAh cm−2 for Zn//Cu batteries.
When assembled with commercial vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), the full battery delivers a high capacity of 345.1 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 with retention of 74.1% over 2000 cycles.
According to the researchers, their findings provide a promising strategy for improving the zinc anode and are expected to be applied to other metal anodes with poor stability and reversibility.
They discuss their results in “Facet-termination promoted uniform Zn (100) deposition for high-stable zinc-ion batteries,” published in Advanced Energy Materials.

This is the main conclusion of a study by researchers from the University of Toronto, investigating the technical feasibility of solar-powered high-rise nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs), specifically residential and commercial buildings that have very low primary energy requirements that are to be met to a significant extent by renewable sources.
In such buildings, the total sum of annual energy use is approximately equal to the total sum of the renewable energy produced on-site. “Net-zero energy performance in all-electric buildings will offset the emissions associated with any energy drawn from the electricity grid and hence achieve net-zero emission status,” stated the Canadian researchers.
The scientists pointed out that most net-zero energy buildings are either single-family homes or low-rise buildings, noting the difficulty of high-rise buildings in achieving NZEB status, due to their large floor area-to-surface ratio, which reduces the space available to deploy solar energy systems. “In a survey of 32 nearly zero energy buildings in Europe, only 4 had five or more stories, with the tallest one having seven stories,” they reported.
The group conducted its analysis by using as a main parameter the maximum energy use intensity (EUI), which is calculated in kWh/m2. They investigated different solar system configurations, including both the PV and photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) technologies, evaluating various geographical areas and building geometries.
For their assessment, the academics assumed a 40-floor building with a 40 m2 × 40 m2 floor area, a 3.8 m ceiling height, and a window-to-wall ratio of 50% on all the walls. “To cover a wide range of locations, climates, and solar potentials, 16 metropolises in North America are studied,” they explained, noting that they considered both PV and PVT collectors under two different scenarios.
In the first scenario, the whole roof area is covered with PV systems and all the walls are equipped with building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panels. In the second one, all the available areas on the roof and walls are covered with PVT panels. “This study assumes that all the available areas on the roof and the walls, including the north-facing wall, are covered with PV or PVT panels,” the scientists specified, adding that their analysis also does not consider the shadow coming from the urban environment. “This assumption can be impracticable in many cases, especially for the roof, as other systems in a building, for example HVAC, require some of the available areas.”
The analysis showed that, under the first scenario, the maximum EUI permitted for net-zero energy performance ranges from 16.5 kWh/m2 to 24.2 kWh/m2. In the second scenario, the EUI is between 18.6 kWh/m2 and 27.8 kWh/m2. “Switching from PV to PVT collectors improves the EUI by 8 to 44% due to PVT being significantly more efficient,” the academics said. “Changing the building's orientation to a non-square floor shape improves the EUI by up to 52% in PV and 63% in PVT scenario.”
They concluded that, in order to become NZEBs, buildings should not exceed an EUI of 50 kWh/m2a, which they said corresponds to a maximum of 10 floors.  “Conversely, if an energy intensity reduction to only 75 kWh/m2a can be achieved, the building height should be limited to 5–6 floors if it is to be NZEB,” they added.
Their findings can be found in the paper “Feasibility of achieving net-zero energy performance in high-rise buildings using solar energy,” which was recently published in Energy and Built Environment.

As they made the switch, manufacturers promised more electricity and longer lifetimes from the new products. And as they make their way into more projects, we can see how these claims play out in the field under various climate conditions. Many studies have been carried out already, and the signs so far are good for n-type.
One such study confirms a 5.69% gain in normalized energy yield (energy generated per unit of capacity) over a three month period. German company TÜV Nord carried out the study at a test installation in Selangor, Malaysia.
Three module types were installed at the site: A 545 W n-type TOPCon module and a 540 W p-type PERC module, both using 182 mm half cells and both manufactured by JinkoSolar. A third module, also bifacial PERC, with 210 mm cells and a 645 W power rating and from an unnamed manufacturer, was also included in the test. The test installation comprised two modules of each type, installed on fixed tilt racking 1 meter above the ground and connected via micro inverters.
Performance of each module was carefully measured over the first three months of 2023. During the period, Jinko’s TOPCon module generated 205.32 kWh, while its PERC counterpart reached 192.42 kWh, and the PERC module based on 210mm cells generated 227.89 kWh.
Thanks to its higher power rating and larger size, the 210mm module generated the most energy during the three-month period. However, when normalized based on each module power rating, the n-type module achieved a yield 5.69% higher than the 182 mm PERC module used as a baseline, while the larger module was 0.97% behind.
Jinko’s n-type module also achieved the highest performance ratio of the three. Performance ratio compares the actual energy yield to a calculation based on the power rating and weather conditions. TÜV Nord measured a 96.03% performance ratio for the n-type module, with the other two trailing slightly behind.
Separately, TÜV Nord also compared JinkoSolar’s TOPCon module with a conventional PERC product in accelerated reliability testing: two modules were subject a series of laboratory tests, going beyond the standards outlined by the IEC. Modules were subject to thermal cycling, extended damp heat, mechanical load, humidity freeze and ultraviolet light.
Additional test stages designed to detect susceptibility to light induced degradation (LID) Light-elevated temperature induced degradation (LETID), and potential-induced degradation. In all of these test stages, the n-type module showed significantly better performance.
In LID testing the n-type module lost 0.26% of its initial performance, compared to 1.92% for the PERC module. LETID testing told a similar story, with a 0.09% loss for the n-type module, and 1.17 for PERC. And in UV testing, which has emerged as an area of concern for some TOPCon modules, JinkoSolar’s n-type product lost only 0.60% performance, compared with 2.21% for the PERC product.

India installed 6,794 MW of solar power capacity in the first half of 2023, which is about 19% lower than the same period of the previous year.
According to a new report by JMK Research, around 2,294 MW of rooftop solar capacity was added in the first half of 2023, which is higher than the entire rooftop PV installations in 2022. Wind power installations surged 166% year on year to 1,878 MW in the same period.
JMK Research said that “the installed capacity in wind in the first half of 2023 has already surpassed overall calendar year 2022 installation figures. Removal of reverse auctions and declaration of annual 50 GW tendering trajectory by the government will further reinvigorate the wind sector.”
According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India’s cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy generation reached 129.6 GW by June 30, 2023. Solar energy accounts for around 54% of the total installed renewables capacity.
Gujarat led with 1.6 GW capacity installed in the first half of 2023 in terms of state-wise solar installations. Due to its attractive wind-solar hybrid policy, Gujarat also leads in wind capacity installations with 1.039 GW installed during H1 2023.
JMK analysts expect India to add 7 GW to 8 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of wind in the second half of 2023. The analysts said that “significant fall in solar module prices over last few months as well as relaxation in ALMM implementation until fiscal 2024 will be the key drivers to augment solar capacity addition in second half of the year.”

Alaska is warming faster than any other US state, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The state has unique energy needs due to its size, diverse landscape, and remote, rural nature, and energy costs are high.
In fact, Alaska has some of the highest electricity rates, according to the Energy Information Administration. A cost of living study by Anchorage Economic Development Corp. revealed that utility costs in some cases are 33% higher than the national average.
Due to its size and rural nature, the state is not connected to large interstate energy grid like other states. Instead, Alaska has two larger transmission systems and more than 150 small, isolated systems serving remote communities.
Known for its oil reserves, Alaska relies on fossil fuel-based power. The state gets roughly 30% of its power from renewable energy, including wind, solar and water. While it has an insolation value close to that of Germany’s, Alaska has not embraced solar energy in a big way. With 18 MW of solar installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the state is ranked 49 in terms of total deployment capacity.
While one deterrent to relying on solar may be the lack of sun in the winter, particularly in northern areas, they also have an equal number of days of sunshine. To fully embrace renewables in Alaska, energy storage would have to play a key role.
Scientists are looking at ways of integrating zero-carbon energy sources into the electric grid on a larger scale and are seeking cost-effective ways to store that energy to provide constant power. At the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory researchers studied the potential of pumped storage hydropower as an efficient way to store large amounts of energy and improve grid resiliency throughout Alaska.
Scientists at both labs collaborated on mapping and geospatial analysis to identify locations for pumped storage hydropower. According to “The Prospects for Pumped Storage Hydropower in Alaska” report, about 1,800 sites in Alaska are suitable for the development of closed-loop pumped storage hydropower projects and many more are suitable for open loop pumped storage hydropower projects.
In contrast to conventional hydroelectric power, the way pumped storage hydropower works is it generates electricity when water is released from an upper reservoir through turbines into a lower reservoir. At night, when electricity is cheaper and abundant, the turbines are reversed to pump water back up into the elevated upper reservoir. Power is stored and released when needed.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
“In Alaska, pumped storage hydropower has the potential to integrate more wind and solar into the power grid by storing excess renewable energy to balance intermittent periods of weather,” said Vladimir Koritarov, director of the Center for Energy, Environmental and Economic Systems Analysis (CEEESA) in Argonne’s Energy Systems and Infrastructure Analysis division. “We are not assuming that projects will be developed on all 1,800 sites, but there are plenty of locations available for potential development.”
The study focused on the pumped storage hydropower potential in Alaska’s integrated Railbelt system, which is an interconnected power grid made up of five regulated public utilities that runs from Fairbanks through Anchorage to the Kenai Peninsula. Currently about 80% of the Railbelt’s electricity comes from natural gas.

The new SunDay 10+ Wave modules feature 144 monocrystalline half-cut cells based on M1o wafers and busbar technology. SDN claims that they are currently the world's most efficient solar modules for floating PV.
The manufacturer offers three versions of the panels, with nominal power ratings of 590 W to 600 W, and power conversion efficiencies ranging from 21.11% to 21.46%. The open-circuit voltage is between 53.79 V and 54.11 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.92 A and 14.05 A.
The panels measure 2,465 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and weigh 35.9 kg. They are built with 2 mm tempered anti-reflective glass and aluminum alloy frames. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and a maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panels have a temperature coefficient of -0.40% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 12-year warranty and a 30-year performance warranty. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 83.5% of the nominal output power.
SDN operates a panel factory in Gwangju, South Korea. It also plans to build a 1 GW manufacturing facility in Gwangju that will produce solar panels based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) technology, as well as modules featuring an unspecified tandem technology.
The company is active in the distributed-generation PV segment and large-scale solar project development. It has built solar arrays in Bulgaria, Japan and South Korea. Its shipbuilding division also supplies outboard motors for fishing and leisure boats.

Vaulta said the modular nature of the 48 V 5.12 kWh residential battery, which features lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, means it can be easily scaled up to increase capacity, and seamlessly integrates with most 48 V inverters.
The company said the battery has a nominal voltage of 48 V and can deliver 4.86 kW of continuous power. It operates in temperatures ranging from -20 C to 55 C. The battery measures 933 mm high x 357 mm wide x 251 mm deep and weighs less than 55 kilograms.
Engineered and assembled at Vaulta’s Brisbane facility, the battery features the company’s patented no-weld battery case which allows for internal cells to be removed, recycled and reused, and for new cells to be added as battery technology continues to evolve.
The launch of the residential battery follows the recent announcement that Queensland-based clean energy investment firm ReNu Energy had completed its third tranche investment in Vaulta.
Valued at AUD 250,000 ($169,157.2), the tranche follows two earlier rounds of funding in January and April that form part of an investment worth up to AUD1 million in total. Vaulta has also attracted support from international investors with Turkish-based Niocycle, which is focused on making lithium-ion batteries more circular, investing in the company.
The company said the latest investments will enable it to scale its manufacturing capability and target additional sales domestically and into the Asia Pacific and North American markets.
