https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/08/spains-prodiel-epc-is-looking-for-a-new-partner-plans-to-enter-new-pv-markets/,"FINANCE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,EUROPE",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JULY 8, 2021","Spain’s Prodiel EPC is looking for a new partner, plans to enter new PV markets","From pv magazine Spain
At the end of May, Spain’s Prodiel announced it would evolve from being a single entity to a holding company comprised of three business units with independent teams: engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC); energy marketing; and PV project development.
Ángel Haro is now the president of the holding company, while Mario Serrano, has taken on the role of general director of the EPC. For the project development business, Prodiel has established DVP Solar – a 50% joint venture with Everwood.
The new company has PV projects in Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Colombia, and Peru, and manages 5 GW worth of grid connected PV capacity. A further 2 GW of solar projects are said to be in the initial development phase, while there are plans for another 3 GW in the coming years.
In a statement to pv magazine Spain, the Sevillian renewable energy firm and the third largest PV specialist of its kind in the world, according to IHS Markit, says the new EPC division aims to end 2021 with the arrival of a new investment partner to help it grow further. Santander, BBVA, and Lazard are all helping in the search.
Already, there are several conversations ongoing with potential investors; the goal is to not relinquish more than 51% of the company.
Prodiel is also looking to enter other solar markets such as northern Europe, in addition to those it is already focused on, which include Spain, Portugal, and Italy – currently comprising 90% of its business – and Chile, Mexico, and Colombia, in Latin America, which account for the remaining 10%.
Looking back at 2020, Prodiel told pv magazine that despite a project slowdown resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, it managed to consolidate and match its turnover (€580 million) with that of 2019. EBITDA, meanwhile, was €20 million, representing 3.5% of the turnover.
The financial projection at the end of December 2020 for the next four years was slated to be €1.8 billion; however, this has been increased to €2.4 billion as of June 30, 2021. To realize this ambitious goal, the Sevillian multinational employs over 900 direct and 3,000 indirect workers.
“In 2022 and 2023, we are going to have a number of simultaneous projects. To be prepared, we have launched Progra + Talento, where 14 persons with high potential have been selected both inside and outside of the company to carry out a high-performance and multidisciplinary itinerary (theoretical and practical) with the objective to fill positions of responsibility in future Prodiel projects,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
They added, “For us, the growth of the company must go hand in hand with the growth of society in general. We have developed a Corporate Social Responsibility plan to favor initiatives in all the communities where we carry out our projects, which revolve around the field of health, the environment, education, local industry or culture.”

With Agora Energiewende executive director Patrick Graichen today stating renewable-fired hydrogen would not be cost competitive with its fossil fuel-powered equivalent even at a European carbon price of €100-200 per ton, a study produced by the two bodies has called for carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs) for industry; a liquid e-fuels mandate for aviation; auctions for hydrogen-ready combined heat and power (CHP) plants; policy support to drive demand for decarbonized goods; and hydrogen supply contracts.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out today. The print edition offers an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, pv magazine has been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
Calling for hydrogen to initially be deployed in “uncontroversial and no-regret applications,” including the production of steel, ammonia and basic chemicals; long-haul flight and shipping; long-term power storage; and residual heat load in district heating systems, the authors of the report spelled out the potential benefits of the five policies outlined in their publication Making renewable hydrogen cost-competitive: Policy instruments for supporting green H2.
CCfDs involve carbon certificate producers setting a carbon strike price at auction and receiving the difference from public funds when the EU carbon price is below that figure, and refunding the difference when carbon allowances trade above the strike price. Introducing such a system would incentivize industry to fund the green hydrogen systems which would generate carbon certificates, according to the report’s authors.
Demand for green hydrogen would also be driven if the EU mandated a minimum 10% of jet fuels contain liquid e-fuels, and CHP facilities could be encouraged to be developed hydrogen-ready by offering fixed feed-in premiums for each unit of electricity they generate from clean hydrogen, said the study.
Carbon content labeling of items such as steel, plastics and the components used in cars, construction and packaging would further encourage manufacturers to invest in green hydrogen use, said the report, and hydrogen supply contracts at supply and demand levels, would use auctions to establish the minimum price at which renewable-powered hydrogen could be produced and the maximum level users would be prepared to pay, assuaging any fears the new technology would not have robust initial demand.
The study also recommended hydrogen not be used, at least initially, for applications where the direct use of electricity offers better energy conversion performance, such as in non-heavy-goods electric vehicles or for space heating.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/08/interview-corporates-climate-commitments-open-doors-for-massive-renewable-energy-deployment/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",BECKY BEETZ,"JULY 8, 2021",Interview: Corporates’ climate commitments open doors for massive renewable energy deployment,"Image: RE-Source
Hannah Hunt, Impact Director at RE-Source: RE-Source’s Introduction to Corporate Sourcing of Renewable Electricity in Europe introduces the different types of business models available to European companies. Corporates can adopt a variety of different approaches, both on-site and off-site, to procure renewables, depending on their unique needs, goals, and risk appetites.
We are living in an incredibly exciting time in corporate sourcing, with corporate climate commitments opening doors for massive renewable energy development. More than 300 companies across the globe are now part of RE100, committing to 100% renewable electricity supply, with a combined electricity demand greater than either the UK or Italy.
More than 15 gigawatts (GW) of corporate power purchase agreements (cPPAs) have now been signed across Europe, including a record-breaking 4 GW in 2020, and we are continuing to see a greater diversity of companies make renewable energy investments.
To date, most cPPAs in Europe have been signed for physical PPAs, which provide physical energy delivery. Virtual PPAs, also known as financial PPAs, are an alternative contract structure recently growing in popularity. Virtual PPAs are financial contracts that do not include physical energy delivery; rather, the price for the underlying electricity is settled through a contract-for-difference (CfD) structure. In Europe, companies may also seek to sign a cross-border PPA to access renewable energy outside their given market.
On-site renewable electricity generation and storage also plays a large role in corporate sourcing strategies. In the last five years, the annual rate of installing commercial and industrial (C&I) on-site solar reached 2-3 GW per year, and future installation potential is much higher than that.
Companies will need to carefully consider which type of business model is right for them according to their unique risk profile and needs. For example, corporations that use significant amounts of baseload power in a single location – like data centers or energy-intensives – might prefer a physical PPA, while companies consuming lower amounts of electricity across multiple locations might find virtual PPAs a better fit.
Despite the global pandemic and recession, corporate purchases of clean energy are booming. In recognition of this, the UP Initiative will spend Q3 2021 investigating sustainable electricity supply. In the upcoming August edition of pv magazine, we will look at the evolving global business model landscape. You can also read our already published coverage, including an interview with RE100, and a BNEF Op-ed on 24/7 RES and net zero goals.
Corporates can choose to build and own their own renewable energy projects either on-site or off-site. RE-Source’s On-site Renewable Electricity and Storage for Corporates report provides more information on the on-site owner model, which can be done by individual companies or through collective self-consumption. For the off-site business model, the electricity produced by the off-site project is sold into the wholesale market, with the corporate often cancelling the Guarantees of Origin (GOs) from the renewable production on their own behalf.
A corporate investing in and owning an off-site project will see this as a long-term investment that hedges against their long-term electricity consumption costs. However, this business model often requires significant capital investment and will be pursued by a select number of companies. Ikea (Ingka Group) owns multiple wind projects in Europe and other global markets. German chemicals company BASF made an exciting announcement last month that it plans to own a significant stake in a 2 GW offshore wind farm being developed by RWE.
In Europe, energy attribute certificates are called Guarantees of Origin (GOs). These certificates validate the consumption of renewable electricity and are therefore critical to demonstrating the use of renewable electricity. GOs can be purchased through an “unbundled” contract, i.e., separate from the underlying electricity, or through a “bundled” contract, i.e., together with the underlying electricity.
GO purchases help support the income of renewable energy projects, but new capacity is unlikely to be deployed solely due to the purchase of GOs. RE-Source advocates for a well-functioning framework for GOs across Europe. All renewable energy producers should be allowed to receive GOs for their generation, and GOs should contain an increased level of information to support consumer needs. A harmonized framework for GOs across Europe is critical to the development of corporate renewable energy sourcing.
As the corporate renewable PPA market in Europe matures, we are indeed seeing a greater diversity of companies enter the market, including smaller buyers. The RE-Source Platform offers a template contract to help bring down transaction costs and facilitate the negotiation process for smaller, newer buyers. The standard contract, developed by EFET jointly with RE-Source, allows for both physical and financial PPAs. The agreement is translated into multiple EU languages to ease its uptake across Europe.
Smaller corporates can also benefit from business models like aggregated (“multi-buyer”) PPAs as described in our report. Aggregated PPAs allow smaller buyers to combine expertise, resources, and electricity demand with other buyers. In some cases, smaller buyers may pair with larger, more experienced buyers to leverage their comparative expertise.
In the next five to 10 years, we expect to see more and more companies call on their supply chains, particularly their energy-intensive partners, to purchase renewable energy and decarbonize their operations. We also see forward-thinking companies like Google and Microsoft revising their 100% renewable electricity ambitions upward.
These companies aim to match their electricity consumption with renewable production on at least an hourly basis. The benefits of doing so include increased transparency of corporate sustainability claims and carbon accounting, acceleration of electricity grid decarbonization, facilitation of new business models and technologies, and more. The journey to 24/7 renewable electricity will require many steps, but we are excited to see pilot project successes already taking place.
One specific challenge to corporate renewable energy sourcing is shortages in renewable energy supply across Europe, primarily due to lengthy and complex project permitting procedures. Article 16 of the Renewable Energy Directive requires that Member States shorten and simplify the permitting process for new and repowered projects.
Despite this, very few Member States specify measures to reduce permitting burdens. This delays the deployment of new renewable installations in Europe, hampers achievement of EU 2030 and 2050 climate targets, and restricts corporate access to cost-competitive renewable supply. The EU Commission must develop guidelines on permit-granting procedures, using a benchmark system that is measurable and against which Member States can weigh their performance.
To grow the market further, it is also necessary to reduce the complexities associated with signing cPPAs. This will grow the market for both energy-intensive industries and smaller buyers. Our tools in the Renewable Energy Buyers Toolkit aim to help address these challenges.
European countries can also take steps like setting up financing and credit de-risking facilities like in Norway, where energy-intensive companies and buyer consortiums can benefit from a public guarantee scheme supported by the Norwegian Export Credit Guarantee Agency. We also recommend looking to the Spanish government, which recently announced a financial support scheme for corporates seeking corporate PPAs that will include credit risk guarantees to help drive investment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/08/china-solar-pv-demand-could-surpass-100-gw-in-2022-massive-production-overcapacity-predicted/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",BECKY BEETZ,"JULY 8, 2021",China solar PV demand could surpass 100 GW in 2022; ‘massive’ production overcapacity predicted,"In a note issued today, the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory Co. Ltd (AECEA) says China’s PV industry may be on track for a bumper solar year in 2022, following a potentially “flat” year in 2021.
The “substantial” price increases for various raw materials that have been witnessed since the start of this year have seen PV projects either delayed or cancelled, writes director Frank Haugwitz. Consequently, just 9.91 GW of new solar capacity was deployed by the end of this May, comprising 5.76 GW of utility-scale projects and 4.15 GW of residential PV systems, the latter of which is said to represent a more than three-fold increase on the previous year.
“Due to the current high price ecosystem, which is anticipated to only marginally soften in the coming months … a larger share of projects originally scheduled to get connected to the grid by December, could actually be shifted into 2022,” he says.
In addition to the price increases, the country’s National Energy Administration (NEA) recently announced in its 2021/2022 wind and solar PV policy that projects approved in 2019/2020 but which are not connected by the end of this year will be automatically included in next year’s quota – 90 GW for solar – and will not be subject to a new competitive bidding process. Previously, it was understood that these project approvals would be revoked.
While there is still no official confirmation, recent provincial governmental announcements including in Hebei, Shaanxi, and Gansu Province, state that the deadline for forthcoming and already approved projects is December 2022, according to AECEA.
“If having effectively granted another year, China’s demand in 2021 could in the best case be just flat YoY, whereas in AECEA’s view demand could effortlessly surpass the 100 GW mark in 2022,” says Haugwitz.
According to AECEA, China’s over 260 PV module manufacturers exported 35.4 GW of product between this January and May, representing a 34% year-on-year increase.
Overall, global PV module capacities in 2020 reached around 320 GW. This represents an annual increase of almost 47%, of which China comprised 245 GW, having added over 90 GW of new capacity, and which is more than double last year’s global PV installations of 120 GW, says AECEA. In terms of actual output, these figures translate to 164 GW globally, and nearly 135 GW in China.
Looking to PV wafer production, the analyst says that of the around 248 GW of global capacity in 2020, 240 GW were in China. These manufacturers were said to have produced almost 162 GW last year, out of a global total of 168 GW.
The polysilicon situation is slightly different in that between 2018 and first half of 2020 hardly any new investments in polysilicon were made, which resulted in a “fairly tight” supply situation and price increases of up to 160%. This has led to both established and new manufacturers announcing plans to add new polysilicon capacity; thus China’s 2020 China’s polysilicon production capacity of around 420,000 tons is expected to reach an annual output of up to 1.6 to 1.8 million tons “in the foreseeable future.”
“Looking ahead, taking wafer production as an example, an estimated 110-130 GW shall be added in 2021, and possibly another 170-190 GW next year, thus amounting to up to 560 GW, dwarfing by then the estimated 450 GW cell production capacities by almost 25%,” continues Haugwitz.
“In comparison, by the end of 2021 China’s module production may reach 390 GW; that means module production capacities may increase by a staggering 60% YoY. However, this in stark contrast to a projected global demand estimated to be btw. 160 to 240 GW this and next year.”
As such, AECEA predicts that “another industry-cycle featuring massive over-capacities” is on the horizon.
Another reason for increased production capacities is due to the fact local governments are starting to see the renewable energy industry as an area of future growth, says the analyst, on the back of China’s 2030 and 2060 climate change targets and because “substantial” rule-making authority was granted to them by the central government in the first quarter this year.
Haugwitz writes: “An increasing number of provincial jurisdictions have endorsed local development policies requiring PV power plant developers seeking official project approval to substantially investment into local manufacturing, calling it ‘local economical contribution’. The latter is not necessarily limited to manufacturing, although preferred, the construction of buildings or schools would equally be accepted, provided it meets the respective economic targets.
“Consequently, such a practice, which at present is rather the norm than the exception, drives up costs for ground-mounted utility-scale projects considerably. It therefore, does not surprise that just 5.76 GW of utility-scale were deployed during the first 5 months this year, whereas 4.15 GW of residential PV systems, representing a more than three-fold increase YoY.”
China’s distributed solar PV market is on track for significant growth, says Haugwitz, not least because the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has identified distributed solar PV combined with electrical energy storage as its second most important project under the Circular Economy Development Plan for the 2021-2025 period.
In late June, the NEA also announced a pilot program designed to ramp up the deployment of distributed solar PV under which it requested provincial offices to nominate counties where a trial program to push blanket rooftop solar could be carried out by July 15.
The goal is to have at least 20% of all residential rooftops equipped with solar, as well as at least 30% of commercial and industrial structures; 40% of non-government public buildings, such as hospital and schools; and half of the roofs on the government estate.
This push has led the Energy Research Institute, which is affiliated with China’s NDRC, to estimate a national rooftop potential of up to 800 GW, including around 200 GW in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu; and 55 GW in the Guangdong Province. Overall, industry representatives are said to believe that the pilot program could see up to 250 GW of future demand.
According to AECEA, 23 provinces and municipalities have already announced their plans to participate in the trial. “In AECEA’s opinion, till the end of this year, we may see a doubling of up to 10 GW vs 2020. However, anticipating the pilot program will be successful and thus converted into a full-blown multiple-year program, this could trigger an annual demand of 20+ GW from 2022 onwards,” says Haugwitz.
This year, it predicts that demand for residential PV may reach 16 GW, up from 10.12 GW in 2020, due to the RMB 500 million worth of subsidies issued. Even without subsidies, the analysts expect this demand to remain going forward, because of China’s “rural revitalization strategy”.
“Overall, in the mid-term distributed solar PV is expected to make up an ever larger share of the overall market,” concludes Haugwitz.

MEM provided engineering, design, and construction services, alongside its Filipino partner, Sidcore Consulting.
“The Gigasol project is another step toward AC Energy’s goal of reaching 5,000 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2025,” said Anabele Natividad, Vice President of Development for AC Energy. “The project started just prior to the pandemic. While this added some complexity to the project, we had a great team; Modern Energy was instrumental to the success of this project in the design and construction phases to bring us into operations.”
Overall, AC Energy plans to install half of its 5 GW renewable energy capacity goal in the Philippines. The remaining capacity will be rolled out in other, unidentified, Southeast Asian countries. To date, the company says it has installed over 1.2 GW worth of projects in the Philippines.
Last August, the company announced it was working on two new solar plants in Central Luzon with a capacity of up to 150 MW, of which the GigaSol project was a part. In total, it says it has 330 MW of solar plants under construction in the country.
According to statistics released by the Department of Energy in December, the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.06 GW under the country's renewable energy law at the end of June 2020. The government of the Philippines plans to install 15 GW of renewables capacity by 2030. Currently, the 200 MW Tarlac Solar Plant is the country's largest PV facility.

The premiere was made possible by Munich-based company The Mobility House, which specializes in the use of second-life batteries and vehicle-to-grid applications.
Together with its partners Mobilize, which belongs to the Renault group, the Banque des Territoires and the Ecological Transport Modernization Fund, which is managed by the investment manager Demeter, it set up the 4.7 MW storage facility on the factory premises of the Renault branch in Douai, France.
Of this capacity, 4 MW are prequalified for participation in the primary control power market. The Mobility House states that this project has helped increase the total capacity of car batteries it uses for the control power market in France, the Netherlands, and Germany to 33 MW.
The Renault storage system consists not only of used car batteries, but also first-life batteries. Car manufacturers are obliged to keep a certain number of batteries available as replacements. However, since they are difficult to store, one solution is to integrate them into storage devices. To achieve the optimum state of charge, they are only minimally charged and discharged.
“We have been working successfully on the integration and marketing of electric car batteries in the electricity market since 2014 and are already active in various European markets and the USA,” said Robert Hienz, CEO of The Mobility House. “With the integration of a storage facility in the capacity market, as is now the case in France, we are once again expanding our technology spectrum with an innovative application.”
The system is used as a source of revenue in short-term trading and on the primary control reserve market. Although it is stationary, it will help The Mobility House and the other partners to further develop the technological cornerstone for mobile storage applications, i.e., vehicle-to-grid, the company explained. The Mobility House has been working on the intelligent charging and energy management system “ChargePilot” since 2016, which was also used at the facility in Douai.
“The intelligent control of battery storage systems is an important step for the integration of electric vehicles into the power grid,” said Yasmine Assef, Program Director Energy Services at Mobilize. “The fact that we are now actively participating in the French capacity market with the help of The Mobility House technology is a big and important step. With projects like this, we unlock unbelievable future potential that not only drives the energy transition, but also contributes to the stability of the power grid and generates income with vehicle batteries. A win-win situation.”

Totally Renewable Yackandandah’s (TRY) Community Battery project, which couples a 65 kW solar PV array and a 274 kW battery system, was officially unveiled on Thursday, edging the town closer to its community-based goal of reaching 100% renewables by 2022.
Delivered by TRY and the community owned energy company Indigo Power, the battery project – dubbed Yack 01 – is one of the first community-scale batteries in Australia. It is expected it will power up to 40 Yackandandah households.
“Yack01 is Yackandandah’s first piece of community-scale energy infrastructure and will supply power through the network to Indigo Power customers,” the TRY website reads.
“It is a pivotal first step and pilot for larger community-scale projects that will follow in our quest for 100% renewable energy.”
Indigo Power will own and operate the solar+battery facility with the tracking and sharing of local energy within the minigrid made possible by a widget developed by Mondo, an independent subsidiary of AusNet Services.
The community solar+battery project is one of two renewable energy initiatives unveiled in Yackandandah on Thursday.
The Twist Creek Microgrid, which saw solar modules, low-emission hot water services and batteries installed in nine Yackandandah homes, was also officially opened.
It is the latest of four microgrids connected into the electricity network, allowing for the trading and sharing of locally generated renewable energy.
The town is also home to a public virtual power plant (VPP), 10 public buildings hosting a combined total of 74.8 kW of solar modules and 36 kWh of battery storage.
Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio said Yackandandah’s latest renewable projects further highlighted the power of community action.
“Totally Renewable Yackandandah and Indigo Power are setting a great example with their ambitious targets and work to get Yackandandah on 100% renewable energy by the end of next year,” she said.
“Projects like these show the community is keen to embrace renewables. This grassroots enthusiasm is so important as Victoria works to halve its emissions by 2030.”
In a bid to progress the roll out of renewables in communities across the state, D’Ambrosio announced on Thursday the state government will provide $6.5 million to expand the Community Power Hubs program and provide grants for community groups to install renewable energy and undertake energy audits.
The seven new hubs, which include one to be convened by Indigo Power in Yackandandah, will be set up in regions across the state, with each hub supporting community energy groups in their region by providing support, funding and local expertise.
The Hume Community Power Hub, to be convened by Indigo Power, will commence work immediately having already secured more than $70,000 in funding to install two rooftop solar systems totalling 144 kW.
The other hubs will be convened by Healesville Community Owned Renewable Energy, Yarra Energy Foundation based in Richmond, Ballarat Renewable Energy and Zero Emissions, Geelong Sustainability Group, Gippsland Climate Change Network and Bendigo Sustainability Group.
The hubs have been funded to immediately deliver 16 solar energy projects by the end of the year.
“These community-owned and operated hubs will bring local renewable energy projects to life, drive investment in regional Victoria, create jobs and reduce energy bills,” D’Ambrosio said.

Jakson Group, a Noida-headquartered energy solutions company, has announced the commissioning of a 50 MW solar power plant, despite the pandemic. The plant is spread over a 200-acre area in the Kheragarh District of Agra in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh. It was built with an investment of INR 250 crore.
The solar plant benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA), which was signed with the Uttar Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Limited (UPPTCL) in February 2019. The power procured by UPPTCL will be further supplied to various districts and villages. 
Overall, the plant is expected to supply 1,05,100 MWh of electricity to the grid annually. 
Announcing the commissioning, Atul Gupta, head-Solar IPP, Jakson Group, said: “With this plant, the Jakson Group will be offsetting 85,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually, which is equivalent to planting 550,000 trees.” 
The plant uses mono PERC modules and string inverters. A dry cleaning module using robots has been deployed instead of wet cleaning, eventually saving up to 80% water. Drones used for thermal screening to detect any damage during the execution of the plant will continue to be deployed.
Jakson Group is also currently developing Assam’s first large-scale solar PV plant of 70 MW in Anguri Solar Park. This project is expected to become operational by the end of the year.
Jakson’s total portfolio stands at more than 200 MW (including the 50 MW plant in Uttar Pradesh and 70 MW in Assam) and is expected to grow to 1 GW by 2024.

Purdue University released the results of its Ag Barometer, a monthly survey of farmers in the U.S., and found that farmers are adopting solar leases at double the rate of carbon sequestration contracts. 
Farmers are continuing to turn to solar as a source of income, with financial fears brewing in the agricultural sector, said Purdue. The Farm Financial Performance Index has fallen 24% in just one month, as farmers are expecting their input costs to rise much more rapidly in the year ahead than they have over the last decade. 
Increasingly, solar is being considered and adopted by farmers to balance the books. Of the 400 surveyed farmers, who run operations larger than $500,000 in annual revenue, nearly one-third are aware of solar leasing opportunities for their farmland, and 29% have engaged in discussions with solar companies about leasing their land.  
One in ten of those farmers who engaged in talks moved forward with solar, with 2.9% of total respondents saying they currently have solar lease contracts. This compares to only about one percent of farmers engaged in carbon sequestration plans. 
Solar leases currently are offering some financial relief, but the surveyed farmers have witnessed a wide range of per-acre pricing for their contracts. A third of the projects offered less than $500 per acre annually, and about 27% percent said their solar contract offering ran at $1000 per acre or more, with the rest falling in between.  
These prices dwarf the $20 per acre value of carbon sequestration plans. Though in carbon sequestration plans, the farmer will still have utility of the cropland and the value therein, they may have to change their practices to achieve the contract’s sequestration goals. Most solar fields do not support farming in the same space, but a rising trend of agrivoltaics may change that. 
Carbon sequestration plans will need to make a stronger business case to farmers already feeling pain if wider adoption is to be seen. Such carbon plans are not necessarily in a zero-sum game with solar projects, so creative ideas on this front could generate new value chains.
