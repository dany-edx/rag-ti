Meyer Burger plans to enter the growing Australian solar market with its heterojunction half-cell solar panels, which offer up to 20% more yield compared to conventional PERC modules. It said it will offer its White, Black and Glass modules in Australia. All of them contain heterojunction half-cell solar cells. It said the modules achieve efficiencies of up to 21.8% and have up to 400 W of output.
The White panel measures 1767 x 1041 x 35 mm and weighs 19.7 kg. It is available with wattages ranging from 380 to 400 W and efficiencies between 20.7% and 21.7%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.23% per degree Celsius and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V. It is made with 120 monocrystalline heterojunction half-cells and 3.2mm antireflective glass.
The Black product has the same weight and dimensions as the white module, as well as its components and electric performance data. It is available in five versions with power ratings between 375 and 395 W and efficiency ranging from 20.4% to 21.5%.
As for the glass-glass version, the module weighs 24.4 kg and measures 1722 x 1041 x 35 mm, its power rating ranges between 370 and 390 W, efficiency up to 21.8%, and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The White and Black products come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. Their average annual degradation is 0.25% for 25 years and 2% in the first year of their lifetime. The output warranty for the glass-glass panel is 30 years and at least 93% of initial performance is guaranteed.
Meyer Burger Australia/New Zealand Country Manager Brendan Kay said Australia provides significant growth opportunities for the manufacturer.
“The Australian solar market, with its high demand for sustainable products manufactured to high social and ethical standards, offers an excellent opportunity for Meyer Burger,” he said. “With our solar panels, the customer can harvest more solar energy from the rooftop – even at very high temperatures. This advantage is even larger with the glass-glass product, which, when installed appropriately, converts the sun into electricity even on the back side with a bifacial efficiency of over 90%.”
The Australian arm of Germany's BayWa re will serve as the initial distributor of the Meyer Burger panels in Australia.
BayWa Australia Managing Director Durmus Yildiz said he expects the Swiss-designed and German-made panels will “fill an important gap in the Australian market … For us it is particularly important that Meyer Burger is adhering to sustainable manufacturing and sourcing practices, aiming to continuously reduce the carbon footprint of its high-performance modules.”

Atlas Renewable Energy has signed a PPA with Albras, Brazil's largest primary aluminum producer. The contract, signed in US dollars, will see Atlas supply solar power for 21 years, the longest term ever signed in Latin America for a corporate renewable energy PPA.
The energy supplied to Albras will come from the Vista Alegre Photovoltaic Project, scheduled to start operations in 2025. The partnership between Atlas and Albras will generate enough renewable energy to power the equivalent of approximately 3 million inhabitants, such as Brazil’s capital Brasilia.
“This is an important step for Atlas as we continue our focus on partnering with corporate customers to support their energy transition to clean energy,” said Carlos Barrera, CEO of Atlas Renewable Energy. “The closing of our second contract with Albras attests to our ability to provide an attractive tailored energy solution for our customers.”
Atlas Renewable Energy has more than 4 GW of contracted projects, of which 2.2 GW are in operation. The company specializes in the development, financing, construction, and operation of renewable energy projects in the Americas since early 2017. In November 2022, the company switched on a 300 MW solar project in Mexico.

“In the past, purchase groups have shown to be able to reduce installation costs, including equipment construction costs, by between 10% and 20%,” the city administration said.
It noted that registering for the program will not entail an obligation to purchase the products. Participants will have the option to buy PV systems and batteries separately, in addition to solar-plus-storage packages.
The program will span from April 28 to July 31. Participation in the program can be combined with other incentives that are already being offered by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for solar and storage.
In December, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly approved new mandatory PV requirements for new buildings and homes from 2025. The rules apply to new homes with rooftop spaces of more than 20 square meters and buildings with total rooftop spaces of less than 2,000 square meters. They will also require businesses to install solar arrays on 30% of their rooftop surfaces. Some parts of the city could face requirements for 85% of all rooftops to be covered by PV.

They also analyzed the viability of retrofitting existing standalone PV and wind plants into hybrid installations.
The scientists gathered data about wind and solar resources in India from 1979 to 2019 using the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts software (ECMWF ERA5). They only considered hybrid solar and wind potential installations with installed capacities of 2.8 MW.
The results show that hybridization could increase yearly power output to 10 GWh in most of India and to a maximum of 18 GWh in the west of the country. The peak of standalone solar generation is registered in the northern region of the country at around 7 GWh. Peak standalone wind generation is around 14 GWh in the western region.
The hybrid power exploitability index indicates that most Indian regions are suitable for peak-load demand hybrid installations. Southwestern India is ideal for addressing base-load demand.
The academics also found that seven of the eight solar or wind plants could successfully be retrofitted into hybrid power plants.
“The viability of hybridization has been determined by calculating the growth in electricity generation through hybridization,” they said. “Technically, the project may be regarded as viable if the yearly rise in electricity generation is larger than 50% because 50% of the capacity is new to the system.”
Three standalone PV plants generate 4.94 GWh, 4.82 GWh, and 4.59 GWh per year. Hybridization could boost power generation by 67.4%, 62.9%, and 26.0%, so only two of the three PV plants could be viably hybridized. However, hybridization would be successful in all assessed standalone wind installations, with the increase in electricity generation ranging from 62.3% to 399.2%.
The researchers shared their findings in “Hybrid wind–solar energy and resource simultaneity: An Indian case study for site selection and feasibility check,” which was recently published in the proceedings of The 5th International Conference on Renewable Energy and Environment Engineering.
They said their approach took India as a case study, but could be used for any other part of the world.
“The current approach will also help project developers and policymakers choose the optimum sites for more reliable [hybrid wind and solar] power plants,” they concluded.

For such vehicles, it is important to maximize their solar exposure while driving to optimize their energy usage.
Building on the research work on estimating optimized routes for solar vehicles, scientists at the Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, have expanded the parameters used to calculate the route, thereby improving the energy-harnessing quality of the route together with its overall utility for the driver.
The researchers used the online geographic information system software ArcGIS and the open-source application API to predict the solar potential of a vehicle by taking into account shade based on surrounding topography, vehicle type, weather, distance, and time of day. They implemented the model as a user mobile application ‘Drive Solar’ that calculates the optimal route for the user based on their preferences for time and energy efficiency.
The effectiveness of the prediction model was tested using a solar irradiance sensor in Dublin. The results showed that the model predicts the route with the most energy absorbed with a 51.65% accuracy and chooses the route with the most energy consumed with an 86.65% accuracy.
While these illustrate that the model can effectively predict the optimal energy-efficient route for a solar vehicle, the researchers have also highlighted some of its limitations. Namely, the model varies in accuracy depending on weather conditions with the most accuracy in clear sky conditions and the least accuracy in medium cloud conditions.
Noting that further research could focus on improving the accuracy of this model, the researchers conclude that “the Drive Solar application effectively implements the prediction model into a user-friendly application so that choosing the optimal route for a solar vehicle becomes a widespread practice as solar vehicles are released.”
Their findings were discussed in “Energy efficient route prediction for solar powered vehicles ,” which was recently published in Green Energy and Intelligent Transport.

The scientists describe the tracker as a low-cost device using a simplified and mechanically driven tracking mechanism. It can be connected to one solar panel and is able to orientate its linear displacement at each of the four corners of the module itself and make it rotate along the three principal axes. A power screw arrangement driven by DC motors enables the movement of the tracker.
“A motor coupler was used as a connector between the DC motors and lead screw,” they said. “The lead screw had pitch and diameter specifications of 1 mm and 8 mm respectively.”
Through the direction and rotational speed of the motors, PV system owners can achieve their desired tilt angles by precisely adjusting each corner of the solar panel.
“For smooth operation of the solar tracker, the four linear actuators were linked to the main stage by considering a ball-joint system based on aluminum balls of 18 mm in diameter,” they said. “To protect the motor components and electronic circuit from adverse weather conditions, a lightweight protective casing made from aluminum composite panel (ACP) namely, alucobond was used. The protective casing had cross-sectional area and height dimensions of 25 by 25 cm and 20 cm respectively.”
The system moves the panel in accordance with the positioning of the sun based on the sensor data transmitted and processed by the Arduino Uno open-source microcontroller, which follows a voltage difference observed in the corresponding paired sensors due to variation in light intensity.
“The paired motors operate in synchronization but in the opposite direction in order to induce a tilting effect to the solar panels,” they said. “To achieve an optimized orientation in the three principle axes, the remaining two motors also operate in a similar fashion to compensate for tilting of the solar panel in accordance with variation in light intensity as detected by the two additional sensors.”
The academics built a system prototype with a solar module measuring 450 mm x 170 mm with a power output of 22.5 W. The research group said the system was able to generate 37% more current than a reference panel without the tracker.
“The proposed device is projected to produce a total energy output of up to 8100 Wh if operated for 12 h over a 30-day period and if meeting the set target of maximum power output of 22.5 W,” it concluded.
The team described the device in “Low-cost solar tracker to maximize the capture of solar energy in tropical countries,” which was recently published in Energy Reports.
“Rhe cost analysis and portability test showed that the final designed system met the initially set targets in this study,” they said.

Argentina's government has revealed that five renewable projects, including three solar arrays, were incorporated into the national Argentine Interconnection System (SADI) in the first quarter of this year.
In a statement, it said that the projects are the Sierras de Ullum (58 MW), Sierras de Ullum B (20 MW), and Cañada Honda IV (0.71 MW) park, for a total of 78.71 MW. All three systems are located in the province of San Juan.
Argentina had reached a cumulative PV capacity of 1,104 MW at the end of 2022, according to recent data released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which means this capacity should now stand at 1,184 MW.
In 2022, the newly installed PV capacity was only 33 MW and in 2021 it was around 300 MW.
Overall, the country had around 5 GW of operational renewable energy capacity connected to its grid at the end of March. Data from the energy market operator Cammesa reveal that this was enough to cover 12.1% of Argentina's electricity demand in the first quarter of this year.
The most significant moment of the quarter for the renewable generation sector was reportedly on February 19, 2023, at 10:20 a.m., when the instantaneous record of demand-supply from renewable energy was recorded, with 32.2% of the electricity demand being provided by these sources, exceeding the previous mark 31.3% achieved on Oct. 8, 2022.
