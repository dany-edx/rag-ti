Scientists at the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH), in Germany, are investigating the feasibility of powering and heating entire town districts with wind, solar, and heat pumps.
The German group is seeking, in particular, to assess how the share of renewable energy in residential areas can be increased in various scenarios using both thermal and electrical storage systems in conjunction with heat pumps.
For this purpose, two residential areas in Lower Saxony and Bavaria, located in the north and the south of the country, respectively, were chosen, and their electricity and heat generation and demand were calculated considering power production from wind and solar in their proximity.
“The result showed that, with well-chosen management, you can achieve a very high level of regional coverage with renewable energies that exceeds the 80% mark,” explained Tobias Ohrdes, head of the ISFH working group.
According to their simulations, more than 60% of electricity demand could be covered directly by wind and solar power. A further 20% of demand may be covered with battery storage and smart control of the heat pumps with the locally generated wind and solar power. If the heat pump operation is coordinated in the entire districts, the renewable supply increases by a further four percentage points compared to an uncoordinated operation, the Hamelin researchers stated.
In the results, however, it must be taken into account that the wind farms feed into the medium-voltage network and, therefore, this power cannot be used per se for regional needs. “An argument in favor of the regional use of wind energy is that its generation over the course of the year usually matches well the demand for heat pumps in buildings,” continued Ohrdes.
From the investigations of the project funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics, derivations should now arise. “We will make recommendations for planners on how best to combine the electricity supply from wind power and solar systems with the demand for heat pumps in residential areas,” explained Ohrdes, adding that five more heat pump districts will be created in cooperation with the Lower Saxony Climate Protection and Energy Agency.
The research institute OFFIS is also taking part in the project to test how the output of power from the storage systems is being managed. Several companies equipped with battery storage have tested the so-called ‘software agents' created by the OFFIS group. “Such software agents can make decisions independently and they can also be controlled very well”, explained Martin Tröschel, OFFIS co-group leader for distributed artificial intelligence.
The software agents are claimed to be able to decide independently when battery storage should transfer charged energy to the grid, with peak shaving being chosen in the software as a key criterion. “The system successfully organized itself completely in the field test,” Tröschel said. “There is no central authority that assigns a timetable to each storage unit, as is the case in virtual power plants.”
This is considered by the scientists a big plus, especially in view of the further increase in deployment of decentralized renewable energy systems. “Central control units will reach their limits with an increasing number of power generators,” added joint group leader Stefanie Holly. For the future, it is an important task of applied research to take away power managers' skepticism towards software agents.
The research project is being funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics.

“The nameplate production capacity of the HiKu7 and BiHiKu7 modules will reach 10 GW by the end of 2021, of which a significant portion has already been booked,” the panel maker stated. “The company will deliver the first batch of the new high-power, high-efficiency modules this month.”
According to the company's CEO, Shawn Qu, these high-power modules are manufactured with damage-free cell cutting, strict hot-spot control, and low-LeTID technology.
All the panels of the HiKu7 CS7N-MS series are produced with 210mm wafers and have dimensions of 2,384×1,303×35mm, a weight of 35.7kg, and feature 132 monocrystalline half cells. The manufacturer claims they can reduce balance of system costs by up to 5.7% and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of a project by up to 8.9% compared to conventional 445 W modules.
The module technology relies on Canadian Solar's own cell technology and module design, including hetero-type ribbon (HTR) and paving technology, which the company said improves performance with minimal cell spacing. The technology is said to combine the advantages of half-cell panels and paved modules.

France's power utility, EDF, and UAE-based renewable energy developer Masdar were awarded a 25-year power purchase agreement for a 300 MW solar plant by the Saudi Ministry of Energy in the country's second tender for large scale solar projects.
The facility will be located in Jeddah and EDF said it will sell power to the Saudi Power Procurement Company (SPPC) at a price of €0.01367/kWh after the Saudi authorities reported the price as $0.01988. “This project also clearly demonstrates our ability to submit extremely competitive offers,” said Bruno Bensasson, executive director at EDF in charge of the Renewable Energies division.
The solar plant will be built with bifacial panels and single-axis trackers, provided by unnamed manufacturers.
In the second round of Saudi Arabia's renewable energy procurement program, prices hit a new all-time low. The Al Shuaiba IP PV project will sell its electricity at $0.0104/kWh. The tender was held under the country's National Renewable Energy Program (NREP).
The second round of the program initially drew 250 bidders.

The Jolywood (Taizhou) Solar Technology Co Ltd major subsidiary of the manufacturer is planning a fab able to produce 1 GW of solar cells and panels per year through a joint venture (JV) with PT Len Agra Energy. The venture will be 60% funded by the Chinese partner.
The Len Agra Energy solar manufacturer and project developer is owned by state-controlled energy company PT Len Industry and by PT Agra Surya Energy.
The fab will open up the Indonesian and U.S. markets for Jolywood, thanks to domestic content requirements instituted in the former country and the fact Indonesia is not among the nations upon which the U.S. imposes import duties on solar products.
The plans outlined by the Jolywood board indicate permission for the JV will have to be given by Chinese state departments including the Ministry of Commerce, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and the National Development and Reform Commission, as well as their Indonesian counterparts.
Jolywood is the largest n-type TOPCon technology user and the only one with gigawatt scale production capacity for such products. The Jolywood website states the company had 5.1 GW of n-type TOPCon cell and module capacity last year.

The battery business, which also offers an auto glass repair and replacement service, is set to ask its shareholders to approve a three-year deal to supply float glass manufacturer Xinyi Glass and PV glassmaker Xinyi Solar with lithium batteries and related products.
Under the terms of the sales agreement, Xinyi Electric Storage–whose investors own 59.72% of Xinyi Glass plus 25.97% of the Xinyi Solar business controlled by Xinyi Glass–would sell up to RMB30 million ($4.58 million) worth of batteries to Xinyi Solar for use alongside its PV project portfolio this year, with up to RMB82 million and RMB74 million worth of business to follow in the next two years.
Xinyi Glass which, like Xinyi Solar, wants to replace lead-acid batteries in its production operations, would sign up for RMB7.5 million ($1.15 million) of products this year and then RMB6 million and RMB5 million, if the sales agreements are approved.
With the lithium-battery unit prices to be determined on a case by case basis, Xinyi Electric Storage said it would publish details of when and where the shareholder vote will be held by April 29.

Baywa re explained that the mine operates 24 hours a day and that the solar plant will replace three out of six heavy fuel oil generators while reducing the production of the remaining three generators during the daytime. “The 15.4 MWh battery storage compensates energy generation fluctuations and assures a reliable operation, which allows up to 75% of the electricity demand of the gold mine to be covered by renewable energy during the daytime,” it said in a statement.
The two companies claim the $38 million plant will enable saving around 13.1 million liters of heavy fuel oil per year.
“Integrating such a large amount of solar into a small, isolated grid safely and reliably has been a major technical challenge and required the use of battery storage as well as a tailor-made control system,” said Baywa re project manager Thorsten Althaus. “This was conceptualized in the early stages of the project and we ensured that our vision was implemented accordingly by the suppliers.”
Finnish marine and energy solutions provider Wärtsilä supplied a storage system based on its GEMS software platform for power monitoring and optimization, for the project. The company said the payback time for similar projects is typically short, as fuel costs for extremely remote locations can be excessive.
Suntrace and Baywa re were selected to handle project planning and construction duties in October 2019.
This is the second solar-plus-storage project being built at a Malian mine. In October, British oil provider Vivo Energy said it was developing a project at the Nampala gold mine owned and operated by Canada-based mining company Robex Resources in the country, under a power purchase agreement.

The near-$12 million instrument has been floated by NGO the SAJIDA Foundation, which is owned by the Renata Ltd pharmaceuticals and animal health business spun out of the local branch of U.S. giant Pfizer in 1993.
The SAJIDA Foundation, which received $7.5 million from Dutch development lender FMO in December, will use the proceeds of the bond to provide micro loans to small businesses and social initiatives.
With the International Finance Corporation private-sector arm of the World Bank last year highlighting Bangladesh's green bond potential, numerous such fundraising vehicles are awaiting approval by the securities regulator.
In January, Bangladesh’s central bank mandated 2% of loans issued by banks and other financial institutions be devoted to green projects. In addition, a $125 million revolving fund has been established to finance technology development and support exports, including renewables-related products.
The World Bank on Thursday also published Living in the Light—The Bangladesh Solar Home System Story, describing what the multilateral development lender has labeled the largest off-grid solar program in the world.
Launched in 2003 as a 50,000-household pilot scheme, the World Bank said the campaign had provided electricity to around 16% of the nation's rural population at its peak, and has brought power to 20 million people.
Residential and farm rooftop solar, mini-grids and solar irrigation systems were also covered by the $726 million Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development project overseen by the World Bank and rolled out by Bangladesh's Infrastructure Development Company Ltd.
Bringing estimated benefits worth $1.7 billion up to 2018, by distributing 6 million solar home systems with a total generation capacity of 263 MW, the program is estimated to have removed around 9.6 million tons of CO2 equivalent in its 15-year lifetime, by removing the emissions from 4.4 billion liters of kerosene.
“In remote and hard to reach areas, the government successfully introduced affordable off-grid renewable energy solutions through a public-private partnership,” said Mercy Tembon, World Bank country director for Bangladesh. “Clean electricity meant better health and living conditions for families and more study time for children.”

Chilean startup Lader Energy has commissioned the first solar project that is able to produce 10 thousand liters of water per month from the humidity in the air.
The system in San Fernando, Chile, is based on hydropanels, which combine solar PV energy with solar thermal energy. The hydropanels can capture the humidity from the air and, following a condensation process, produce water.
“In 2019, we took the first three hydropanels to Chile to test and validate the technology,” Andres Vasquez, the director of business development at Lader Energy, told pv magazine. “After a year it gave us incredible results and that is how the idea of bringing this to a business model that is scalable.”
In the construction of the first plant, they have invested $250,000. According to the company, around 10,000 liters of 100% renewable water can be produced per month.
US manufacturer Zero Mass Water by Source is supplying the module technology.
“Within the same panel it is mineralized with calcium and magnesium,” Vásquez said. “To this technology, we add a system of various water filtration and recirculation processes that are fed by a solar installation.”
He said the process ensures that a high quality water is produced, thanks to an ultraviolet light disinfection system and an activated carbon filter with coconut fibers.
Lader Energy's first plant features 62 hydropanels, with a production capacity of 10,000 liters per month. That equals production of 33,000 containers per month in this first phase.
“The water will be sold in retail, boutique shops, mini-markets, restaurants, different marketplaces and, of course, on our own website,” Vazquez said, noting that the price will be in the CLP 800 ($1.13) range.
The company now plans to expand the first plant and aims to triple production this year. It also hopes to install another plant in Colombia, near Medellín. “By 2022 the goal is to build two more plants in Chile, a second in Colombia and open in Peru,” Vázquez said.

Australia's Clean Energy Council (CEC) says in a newly published paper that large-scale battery energy storage has become the best way to spread energy generated by solar and wind throughout any day, and to instantly respond to peak energy needs in the National Electricity Market (NEM) for long and short durations.
The paper compares the levelized cost of energy delivered by a new 250 MW gas peaker plant with 250 MW four-hour and two-hour grid-scale batteries. It finds that overall – when various costs are calculated – that the batteries are 17% (two-hour) and 30% (four-hour) cheaper.
Improvements in battery-operating technology mean storage now outperforms gas-fired peaking plants on speed and reliability of response, which was the basis of gas technology’s biggest claim to a place in the future renewables-based electricity system.
Where gas plants can respond within 15 minutes, says the CEC report, battery solutions can discharge as “demand (and correspondingly prices) approach peak levels” and sustain output “to cover the typical daily peak duration.”
“Batteries can ramp up quickly, have zero start-up time and provide a better frequency response,” said CEC Chief Executive Kane Thornton.

They explained that the modification of the SnO2 layer with the cPCN is key to avoiding undesirable current-voltage hysteresis, which is responsible for reducing the cell's stability. This phenomenon occurs in electrical systems when current or voltage changes and the effects of the changes are delayed. It is strictly dependent on the composition of the material, and ion migration and non-radiative recombination near interfaces are generally considered responsible for the effect.
These issues are commonly solved by applying dopants or additives to the SnO2 layer. The cPCN, according to the scientists, allowed for the development of an ETL with superior electron mobility, which they defined as more than three times higher than that of a simple SnO2 layer. “The perovskite solar cells based on SnO2-cPCN exhibited negligible current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis due to the decreased charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface under the increased electron mobility,” they explained. “Besides, the SnO2-cPCN surface became smoother and less wettable. On this basis, the perovskite absorber layers with reduced grain boundaries and enhanced qualities were realized due to suppressed heterogeneous nucleation of [the] perovskite.”
This ETL configuration also avoided the growth of perovskite grains, which resulted in a reduction of non-radiative recombination.
The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.17% on devices with a small active area of 0.1cm2. The device also showed a short-circuit current of 24.9 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.126 V, and a fill factor of 82.5%. The Chinese group was also able to obtain a 20.3% efficiency on a device with a large active area of 1 cm2. This cell exhibited a short-circuit current of 23.4 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V, and a fill factor of 82%.
“This work provides a promising direction for developing high-quality ETLs and verifies the enormous potential of large scale deployment of perovskite photovoltaics,” the academics concluded.
The solar cell is described in the paper cPCN-Regulated SnO2 Composites Enables Perovskite Solar Cell with Efficiency Beyond 23%, published in Nano-Micro Letters.

Materials science is one of the most open-ended fields of discovery. As if to prove the point, researchers at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) have used human hair clippings sourced from a Brisbane barbershop to create carbon nanodots that were then incorporated into perovskite solar cells.
The researchers have discovered that the hair creates an armor-like framework that supports greater stability and improved performance. The research group, led by Professor Hongxia Wang, recently published a paper on its findings in the Journal of Materials Science A. It has been studying advanced solar cells for 20 years, and has been working with perovskite technology for about a decade.
Perovskites are widely considered the successor to today’s monocrystalline silicon solar cells. Their outstanding properties include the fact that they are lightweight and can be manufactured as a flexible film. They are suitable for a wide range of energy-generating applications, from clothing to the materials used to make tents, as well as powering spacecraft.
Wang says the team’s ultimate aim is to make solar energy cheaper and easier to access, so it can help to cleanly cater to global energy needs. The big challenges in the area of perovskite solar cells are stability improvements, so that cells are “able to operate for 20 years or longer, and the development of a manufacturing method that is suitable for large-scale production,” she said.
Wang tried incorporating the carbon-dot solution out of “curiosity” after one of her colleagues transformed hair clippings into carbon nanodots by breaking down the strands and then burning them at 240 C. They subsequently used them to create flexible displays that could be used in future iterations of smart devices.
