In some PV markets, projects are getting older and certain owners and operators are beginning to rethink their asset management strategy. The choice is clear: maintain the asset on the basis of preventive and corrective maintenance, determined by the original electromechanical condition; or invest in new equipment to extend the life of the asset, assuming the challenges that entails. In this, three-part article, Asier Ukar, senior consultant at PI Berlin and general manager of the German engineering company’s Spanish subsidiary, will address several issues that will allow us to understand the benefits of revamping without losing sight of the challenges and risks involved in carrying it out on a photovoltaic asset.
This first installment of the interview investigates the scenarios that justify revamping, or plant modernization strategy. The first question that naturally comes to mind is, in which scenarios does revamping make sense? PI Berlin identifies four: when there is a big technological leap between the grid connection date and the revamping date; when plant performance is compromised due to poor execution practices and there is an electricity tariff or feed-in-tariff (FIT) in force; when the natural aging of the plant requires it; and when an IPP (independent power producer) wants to homogenize its portfolio, made up of assets built in different periods and made up of technologies of different natures. Let's analyze them one by one.
This could mean a scenario in which there has been a big technological leap between the original date of connection and the date of revamping. Take Spain or Italy as an example. These markets experienced big expansions between 2006 and 2008 and between 2009 and 2011. At that time, it was common to build PV plants using solutions that are practically extinct today, such as dual-axis trackers, 60-cell crystalline PV modules (measuring 1,650x990mm), galvanically separated inverters, thin film amorphous silicon, or CIGS module technology.
In addition to purely technical factors, there are also economic factors that have influenced the development and implementation of PV installations. For example, the Spanish regulatory framework that led to the division of PV plants into 100 kW islands with individual transformers and meters, or the strong demand for modules caused by Italy and Spain that forced many installers to purchase, for a single plant of a few megawatts' capacity, modules from various manufacturers and technologies in order to meet the required volume. The technical characteristics of the PV components available between 2006 and 2011, as well as economic and regulatory factors, were characteristic of the nature of the first PV plants. Progress on technology and policies means these strategies have now practically disappeared.

Since FITs typically guarantee a price per kilowatt-hour generated within predefined limits and under-performance can quickly become a serious problem for project economics.
Under-performance can be due to many factors, including poor installation practice, product failure, or a combination of the two. Ukar lists several examples to illustrate these aspects, such as (i) flimsy design of dual-axis trackers; (ii) trackers based on prisms rather than astronomical tracking, adding complexity and wear on moving elements; (iii) use of three-pole AC cables for DC applications; (iv) reduced cable capacity due to excessive accumulation of cables in trenches or troughs; (v) mistreatment of modules on-site, with consequent damage to cells or glass and back foil; (vi) very permissive engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts that barely contain requirements for quality control during construction and commissioning; (vii) the absence of a SCADA system that would allow adequate monitoring of plant operation and failures; (viii) a lack of knowledge of degradation phenomena such as PID; and (ix) lack of quality control during PV module manufacturing. “In some plants installed in Spain or Italy before 2011, it is not uncommon to find disoriented or stopped trackers, incorrectly labeled modules, detached diode boxes, inverters with poor grid synchronization, or plants where the performance ratio is not monitored at all,” Ukar said.
Failures can be partly justified by the rush some installers and developers had to deal with due to tight construction schedules and short supply of modules, and also from a lack of experience in the sector. In any case, there are, today, a large number of PV plants operating well below their theoretical yields, leading not only to wastage of the tariff, as mentioned above but also, in the specific case of Spain, the risk of the loss of the tariff entirely for not reaching the minimum threshold of operating hours.

Here we consider ‘natural’ aging of the plant by itself as an argument to justify revamping, regardless of under-performance or construction defects.
This will focus mainly on modules and inverters, since these components have been most thoroughly studied in relation to their lifetime. The 10 to 12-year threshold is commonly considered the point at which replacement of the most sensitive inverter components (mainly IGBTs, capacitors and filters) will be required. In the case of string inverters, this means almost a complete replacement of the inverter, while in the case of central inverters it would mean the replacement of these parts while maintaining more durable components, such as busbars, racks or certain protections. High temperatures and high DC/AC ratios undoubtedly shorten inverter lifetimes. Therefore, greater longevity is expected in central European climates compared to tropical climates, where humidity should also be added as a degrading factor.
As for PV modules, different degradation trends are observed depending on the technology used and location. These differences can be seen in established markets such as Germany, Italy or Spain, which have a large number of PV plants that have entered the last third of their useful life. It should be noted the environmental factors that first trigger degradation effects are high temperatures and high exposure to UV radiation, or a combination of both. This phenomenon is clearly observed in modules installed on dual-axis trackers, which are widely present in both Italy and Spain.
In these cases, modules are subjected to high temperatures and high radiation for long periods due to the theoretical perpendicularity that the tracker seeks with respect to the incident radiation. This is why phenomena such as yellowing, corrosion of busbars, chalking or degradation of cables and connectors are frequent in these plants, and somewhat less frequently observed in countries such as Germany, where the use of two-axis trackers is restricted mainly to the south, and where environmental conditions are benevolent for PV components.
Adding India as a fourth market with around ten years of accumulated lifetime in a significant number of plants, we observe that the levels of decay described above emerge in a significantly shorter time, as a result of the confluence of environmental stress factors such as high humidity, high temperatures, salinity or high UV radiation. In states including Rajasthan, Gujarat or Tamil Nadu, it is not uncommon to find signs of accelerated aging in modules, electrical panels or inverters with associated insulation problems, overheating due to dust accumulation, corrosion in wiring, or cracking of the backsheet.
It should not be forgotten that product warranties provided by module manufacturers in the early days of PV rarely exceeded five years, and that the only certifications required in more than 90% of cases were restricted to IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 – both necessary but clearly insufficient to predict the performance of a module beyond the first few years of its life. As in the second scenario described above, a low performance ratio – for whatever reason – is a waste of the tariff and therefore a loss of return.
The rate of aging for modules and other components depends on the number of environmental stress factors that converge simultaneously. The incidence of these factors is different in Southern Italy than in Germany, as well as in the case of fixed-tilt or dual-axis tracking. Most of the defects associated with such aging are not covered by the expired product warranty, which is particularly relevant in the case of modules installed more than a decade ago whose product warranty was generally limited to five years, as opposed to today's 12 years or more.

In this scenario, revamping is considered by an independent power producer looking to homogenize a portfolio that is made up of assets acquired at different times, and therefore made of different technologies. We are talking about portfolios of multiple plants, most of them less than 3 MW, and installed with varying technologies such as low-power crystalline modules; thin-film modules which are now practically extinct, such as amorphous silicon or CIGS; old inverters with low efficiencies; dual-axis trackers with prism tracking etc.
Such asset collections involve the management of plants of very different sizes and technologies, which undoubtedly adds complexity and increases operation and maintenance (O&M) costs due to the different requirements of each plant and the impossibility of implementing standardized maintenance which could benefit from an economy of scale.
The confluence of one or more of the scenarios described above in a single plant, which is very common, justifies revamping from a cost-benefit point of view. First, by an increase in the efficiency of the components with a direct influence on the performance ratio (especially modules and inverters); secondly, by the possibility of correcting installation faults with a direct impact on electrical safety and loss of energy yield; thirdly, by the possibility of reducing O&M costs through standardization and the smaller number of elements in operation; and finally, by the added remuneration thanks to the extension of the plant's useful life.
Parts two and three of this article will follow next week.

Tata Power has won an INR400 crore (US$53.5 million) contract from utility Kerala State Electricity Board Limited to develop 84 MW of rooftop solar projects for domestic consumers in the state. The allotted capacity includes 64 MW for individual households – with project sizes of 3-10 kW – and 20 MW for housing societies, with generation capacities of 11-100 kW.
The developer secured the contract from a tender announced by the electric company in February under Kerala’s ‘Soura Subsidy Scheme in [the] Domestic Sector,' which itself is in line with the Phase II subsidy program overseen by India's Ministry of New & Renewable Energy. 
Tata must commission the rooftop projects within three months of receipt of orders from residential customers and, upon completion of the contract, the 84 MW of generation capacity is expected to generate 120 GWh of electricity annually, helping offset around 100,000 metric tons of CO2 per year.
The contract win was Tata's second from the Kerala utility this year, with the Mumbai-based developer securing 110 MW of solar capacity from the electric company in January. That project capacity is expected to generate around 274 GWh of electricity per year.

The company now estimates a net profit increase of between 152% and 172%, resulting in expected earnings of RMB 1.16 to RMB 1.26 billion ($180 to $190 million). The company attributed the improved forecast to greater production capacity as well as more market demand in the past six months.
Kibing Group, another major glass supplier, also released its estimated H1 results this week. The presumed net profit will be RMB 2.1 to RMB 2.3 billion ($320 to $350 million), with a year-on-year increase of 316%-360%.
China South Glass (CSG) issued its preliminary H1 report on Tuesday showing an estimated year-on-year net profit to between RMB 1.3 and 1.43 billion ($200 and $220 million) — an increase of 233% to 265%. CSG said the performance was due to high glass prices in the first quarter and increasing market demand for PV glass.
According to data from PV InfoLink, the price of PV glass rose from RMB 24 per square meter in July 2020 to around RMB 45 per square meter in December and January 2021. Since March, the price has rapidly dropped, almost returning this week to July 2020 levels.
Jinko Energy, a major subsidiary of Jinko Solar focusing on renewable energy development and EPC services, announced on Wednesday its decision to sell three solar PV farms with a total capacity of 85 MW to Hubei Energy Group. The deal is valued at around RMB 125 million ($19.3 million). The three solar farms, all located in Jiangsu province, have installed capacities of 35 MW, 20 MW and 30 MW. Jinko said the deal would strengthen funding for the future development of solar PV farms. The transaction is also expected to reduce liabilities arising from these projects.
Major Chinese HJT equipment supplier Maxwell Technology said in a recent statement that it had signed an equipment sales contract in July 2020 with solar cell manufacturer Tongwei worth a total of RMB 1.2 billion ($190 million). The deal is expected to supply several of Tongwei Group's subsidiary companies, including branches in Chengdu, Anhui, Meishan and Jintang. In 2020, sales from the deal reached RMB 680 million ($105 million); in the first half of 2021, the agreement generated RMB 493 million ($76 million) in revenue.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/09/perovskites-get-a-14m-boost/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 9, 2021",Perovskites get a $14m boost,"Scientists in the U.S. are setting up a research project to focus on perovskite solar cells, having received $14 million from the Department of Energy (DOE). The Perovskite Photovoltaic Accelerator for Commercializing Technologies Center is being led by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), with input from several other U.S.-based research institutes and companies.
Perovskite solar cells have received plenty of attention from researchers and the PV industry in recent years but challenges to commercial development remain. “Perovskite photovoltaic technologies may provide a pathway to low-cost manufacturing but there is still much that is unknown about this technology, especially in terms of outdoor performance and reliability,” said Joshua Stein, an SNL engineer who will direct the project. “The center will field-test and monitor this technology using a common set of testing protocols so that every device can be fairly compared.”
Sandia's project partners are the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), CFV Labs, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute and engineering firm Black & Veatch.
Perovskite cells differ from silicon and other commercial PV technologies in several ways, meaning new standards will be needed to accurately measure their performance. Establishing such standards will be among the center’s first jobs. “Right now, it’s like the Wild West,” said Stein. “We would like to craft a clear set of test protocols that have been validated and vetted by the industry to create a rubric, or set of goalposts, so that companies that are getting into perovskite solar technologies know what they need to do.”
Within its first year, the project plans to begin outdoor testing of at least 30 perovskite solar modules, with plans to expand to 50 kW of full systems.
Determining reliability is another of the stumbling blocks perovskites have faced and the center will also be working on meaningful accelerated testing to better understand degradation and the long-term performance of perovskite cells and modules. “NREL’s role in leading the reliability focus area is to provide a lot of the scientific basis behind understanding reliability in perovskite-based solar modules,” said NREL scientist and deputy director of the new center, Laura Schelhas. “This means looking at the degradation of these materials in contrast to traditional solar cell materials; what is causing this degradation; how to test for it; and how to accelerate it.”
The center will also help companies make the jump into commercial development of perovskites and conduct assessments of various approaches, to advise which offer the best potential at large scale. “I see this center as a way for technology developers, who generally don’t have a strong commercial background, to receive invaluable guidance on what they need to achieve to be commercially successful,” said Ralph Romero, senior managing director of Black & Veatch Management Consulting’s bankability practice.
The center will initially work with perovskite PV companies to develop ‘bankability roadmaps,' within two years, and complete bankability assessments by the fourth year.
“The DOE has made this investment to create an independent and neutral assessment center,” said Schelhas. “Hopefully, this will lead to U.S. manufacturing of perovskite solar panels.”

On Wednesday, General Manager Alessandro Puliti met in Algiers with Toufik Hakkar, CEO of Sonatrach, to speak about green hydrogen opportunities in Algeria. “A road map was outlined for the joint assessment of the technical and commercial feasibility of a pilot project to produce hydrogen using electricity generated from renewable sources (solar and wind),” the company said in a statement. In order to preserve the country's water resources, the companies will seek to use water produced by oil fields for the electrolysis processes necessary for the production of hydrogen after its appropriately treated. A day later, Eni announced it had signed an agreement with the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC) and the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) to assess the technical and commercial feasibility of projects for the production of blue and green hydrogen in Egypt. “The parties will conduct a study into joint projects to produce green hydrogen, using electricity generated from renewables, and blue hydrogen, through the storage of CO2 in depleted natural gas fields,” Eni said in note released Thursday. The study will also analyze the local market consumption potential of hydrogen as well as export opportunities. Meanwhile, other Italian companies are teaming up to develop hydrogen solutions. Also on Thursday, defence group Leonardo and gas transmission operator Snam signed a memorandum of understanding for the joint development of cyber security and advanced sensor solutions for large energy networks. “This is the starting point for our partnership with Leonardo … to develop technologies aimed at strengthening the security of energy networks, optimising their management and decarbonising the aerospace sector through hydrogen,” Snam’s CEO Marco Alverà commented in a note.
The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) announced on Thursday an agreement with three Japanese entities to explore the commercial potential of blue ammonia production in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Adnoc signed the joint study agreement with two Japanese companies, Inpex Corporation and Jera, and the state-owned Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (Jogmec). “This joint study agreement with Inpex, Jera and Jogmec provides a roadmap for us to deepen access to Japanese markets for Adnoc’s products and further strengthen the UAE’s hydrogen value proposition,” said Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE minister of industry and advanced technology and Adnoc CEO. Adnoc is already working on a blue ammonia production facility at the Ta'ziz Industrial Chemicals Zone in the western Abu Dhabi city of Ruwais. The facility is expected to have a capacity of 1,000 kilotons a year. According to Al Jazeera, Adnoc is in talks with international, mostly Asian, energy companies about acquiring equity stakes in its hydrogen projects. The UAE is currently in competition with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern oil producers as they increasingly focus on hydrogen production.
South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia have signed a memorandum of understanding with Canadian water electrolysis technology company Next Hydrogen to develop an alkaline water electrolysis system and its related stack. “The aim is to advance stack-related technologies that are at the core of the alkaline water electrolysis system to reduce the cost of building the system and maintaining/operating the system,” Next Hydrogen said in a statement released Thursday. “The key benefit to be derived from the project is that by enhancing the performance of stack-related technologies in the alkaline water electrolysis process, it will be possible to develop a new stack which can be operated at high current density and produce green hydrogen economically,” the company explained.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the US state was exploring the potential role of green hydrogen as part of its decarbonization strategy. “To support this effort to study green hydrogen and its possible applications, the state is collaborating with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, joining two hydrogen-focused organizations to inform state decision-making and making $12.5 million in funding available for long duration energy storage technologies and demonstration projects that may include green hydrogen,” the governor's office said in a note released on Thursday. Additionally, the New York Power Authority (NYPA), collaborating with the Electric Power Research Institute, General Electric and hydrogen supplier Airgas, will undertake a green hydrogen demonstration project at NYPA's natural gas plant on Long Island to evaluate hydrogen's potential role in displacing fossil fuels from power generation. Among the many related initiatives, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority is also preparing its stakeholder engagement effort. The state wants to reach 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and 100% zero-emission electricity by 2040.
Eight European companies, including Italy’s Enel, Spain’s Iberdrola, Denmark’s Ørsted and France’s EDF, sent a letter to the European commission calling for hydrogen to be included in the carbon border adjustment mechanism. “In order to avoid fossil based and highly emitting hydrogen imports, which would be similar to carbon leakage for hydrogen production, the signatories of this letter call for the inclusion of the hydrogen sector in the upcoming carbon border adjustment mechanism regulation,” reads the letter sent last week and published by Euractiv on Thursday. The letter was also signed by Portugal’s EDP, France’s McPhy, the ESB Energy for Generations Fund and the European Association for the Storage of Energy (EASE). The European Union is considering the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) no later than 2023. The mechanism, controversial on an international scale, would impose a carbon price on imports of a list of goods from “less climate-ambitious countries.” The European Commission is expected to present its proposal next week. According to the World Bank, only 20% of global emissions are subject to carbon pricing.
France-based Hyvia, a joint venture between Renault and US hydrogen solutions company Plug Power, announced it will offer hydrogen refueling stations and a range of fuel cell-powered light commercial vehicles by the end of 2021. The assembly of fuel cells and hydrogen refueling stations at Renault's factory in Flins, France, is expected to start in late 2021. “The products will be sold throughout Europe,” reads the note released by Renault on Thursday. Hyvia is working on a van with 12 cubic meters of cargo volume, a second van for transporting larger freight (19 cubic meters), and a bus for transporting up to 15 people.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/09/longi-reports-us-decision-dismissing-hanwha-patent-claims/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",MAX HALL,"JULY 9, 2021",Longi reports US decision dismissing Hanwha patent claims,"With pv magazine having this week confirmed a shipment of PV panels made by Longi Solar was seized in Rotterdam last month, the Chinese solar giant this morning said Hanwha technology patent claims had been dismissed in a separate case in the U.S.
Longi reported the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) had, on June 28, “issued a final written decision on an inter partes review (IPR) proceeding, declaring all of the patent claims in Hanwha Q-Cells’ U.S. Patent 8,933,525B2 to be invalid.”
Seizure
The date of that final ruling is thought to be 12 days after an unspecified volume of Longi solar panels was seized at the Port of Rotterdam with the consent of the Dutch courts. A source close to the incident told pv magazine Hanwha had requested seizure of the shipment as the products were at risk of being distributed in markets where its patented solar cell passivation technology is in force. The source said Longi had subsequently written to customers in such markets warning delivery of its products could be delayed because of the action taken by Hanwha.
The customers contacted by the Chinese company were said to include businesses in Germany, where the Dusseldorf Regional Court in June last year decided Longi and Chinese-owned co-defendents JinkoSolar and REC Solar, had infringed Hanwha's patent. Hanwha had filed the claims in March 2019 and an appeal announced by Longi, and which was due to have taken place in April, is now expected to be held some time in “late summer,” according to a source close to that case.
US decision
Hanwha's success in Germany, however, has not been reflected in a similar case lodged against the same three manufacturers in the U.S. courts.
Longi this morning said, of U.S. patent 8,933,525B2: “The patent attempts to cover a specific type of PERC solar cell with a three-layer passivation structure, including a chemical passivation layer, a field-effect passivation layer, and a silicon nitride cover layer. The field-effect passivation layer contains aluminum oxide. Although this patent has been filed, and was granted, in many countries previously, it was considered to be obvious and not novel based on the analysis of Longi’s IP [intellectual property] team, which filed an invalidity procedure, with evidence, in a number of countries. The USPTO agreed with Longi that all of the claims in Hanwha Q-Cells’ patent do not fulfill several legal requirements and are unpatentable.”
The Chinese manufacturer's statement continued: “This decision is welcome news for Longi and also for the industry. It follows Longi’s earlier success in invalidating another Hanwha Q-Cells solar cell patent, US 9,893,215B2, in another IPR proceeding. That was initiated after Hanwha Q-Cells filed a suit against Longi at the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) in 2019.
“Longi respects legitimate intellectual property rights and understands that valid patents play an important role in technological progress. At the same time, invalid patents, and attempts to enforce such patents, negatively affect both the industry and the enterprizes involved. Accordingly, Longi will continue to resist baseless assertions of patent infringement and will continue to invest in the fight against invalid patents.”
Different tech
A spokesperson for Hanwha said there was a difference between the U.S. patent referred to by the written decision and that in process in Europe, and stated: “Q Cells respects the decision rendered by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) on June 28, 2021, in the inter partes review (IPR) proceedings filed by Longi relating to passivation technology. However, it is regrettable that the board has not taken our claim into proper consideration, considering that this technology already proved its validity by winning the patent invalidation trial in China’s Reexamination and Invalidation Department of the Patent Office (CNIPA).
“The technology in the IPR proceedings is clearly different from the technology currently in the process of patent infringement litigation in Germany, Australia and France, and thus the decision by the U.S. PTAB will not affect the results of litigations in those countries. Q Cells has and will continue to focus on our current litigations to protect our intellectual property rights and contribute to establishing a healthy innovation landscape in the solar industry.”
This copy was amended on 20/07/21 to remove the previously reported statement the technology which permitted Hanwha to secure permission to seize the Longi panels in Rotterdam was the same as, or similar to, the technology patent invalidated in the U.S. The copy was also amended to reflect the fact the U.S. patent decision came 12 days after the Longi panel shipment was seized, not a week later, as previously stated.

A new report from the Clean Energy Council reveals that the grid connection process is the most significant challenge facing large scale renewable energy projects in Australia, with substantial delays and changes in technical requirements impacting projects and investor confidence.
The Clean Energy Council’s (CEC) latest Clean Energy Outlook – Confidence Index also found that “unhelpful and unpredictable government intervention” has increased risk and undermined confidence for new investment in Australia’s renewable energy market.
“This is the time to be opening the doors to new investment in utility scale clean energy projects, boosting jobs and regional development and ensuring that sufficient new generation is in place before old fossil-fuel generators retire or are priced out of the market,” CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry, looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing in batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, AgriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
“Instead, we’ve seen governments backing two gas plants in New South Wales, the surprising decisions from the federal government not to support the Kaban Green Power Hub and then reject the world-leading Asian Renewable Energy Hub hydrogen project, on top of moves to change the funding remit of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.
“It’s a concerning series of events and not a particularly welcoming environment if you’re an investor in clean energy.”
The CEC report, based on the results of a survey of Australia’s renewable energy and energy storage industry’s leaders, found that investor confidence has continued to decline in the past 12 months, dropping from 7.3 out of 10 in July 2020 to 6.3 this year, its lowest level since December 2019.
“We have in the past invested in projects that on paper seemed like a safe bet only to be frustrated by red tape, policy indecision, regulatory changes and slow decision making. We are now highly skeptical,” one respondent was quoted as saying.
The decline in investor confidence is supported by figures released by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) which show no major large scale renewable energy project reached financial close in the March quarter and there was a 76% reduction in the amount of renewable energy completing installation compared to the same quarter in 2020.
The regulator, however, indicated the pipeline of large scale projects with a power purchase agreement, which is seen as a leading indicator, had reached a record 3.7 GW over Q1 2021, suggesting that investment in 2021 and beyond should remain strong.
The CER expects between 2 and 3 GW of large scale renewables capacity to reach financial close in 2021, a similar level to 2020, but conceded the difficulty, time and costs in getting connection approvals may delay some projects.
The CER's concession echoed the concerns of investors who said the challenges related to the grid connection process and technical requirements remain the greatest barriers to the roll-out of renewable energy projects.
“Grid connection certainty is still the greatest dampener when it comes to investment confidence,” one industry figure wrote.
“We have capital ready to deploy and projects ready but the grid remains the single biggest barrier to investment,” said another.
 
The nation's ageing transmission infrastructure also remains a concern for investors who highlighted an under-investment in network capacity to address congestion and constraint issues.
Thornton said it is incumbent upon authorities to deliver on the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Integrated System Plan (ISP), which has identified the highest priority transmission projects with a clear business case to benefit electricity customers concerning the price, security and reliability of the energy system.
The ISP also recognized that new renewable energy projects, including wind and solar, will not enter the energy mix as quickly as necessary without adequate investment in transmission infrastructure.
“These transmission projects are nation-building projects that will see us through into the next century,” Thornton said.
“Build the transmission infrastructure and the renewable energy investors will come, benefiting the entire Australian economy, keeping the lights on, supporting low emissions technologies, and delivering low-cost energy to consumers.
“Without transmission investment, congestion will increase, creating greater risks for generators and further stalling investment.”
The lack of a long-term integrated federal energy and climate policy was also an issue for investors while concerns and uncertainty around marginal loss factors (MLFs) also featured in their responses.

Following a successful constitutional challenge over insufficient action on climate change, Germany’s governing parties have beefed up their climate protection plan in recent weeks. The country is now committed to climate-neutrality by 2045, instead of 2050. The bar has been raised for the 2030 climate target, as well, as greenhouse gases will be cut by 65%, rather than the originally proposed 55%. Nevertheless, climate experts warn that even these targets are not sufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 C. In order to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, at least 200 GW of installed capacity will be needed by 2030, from 55 GW today. This means an annual increase in PV of at least 15 GW in Germany alone – a far cry from the 2 GW to 3 GW annually added in recent years.
But how are such increases to be achieved with the legal hurdles and red tape still in place? And in what way should the “market” drive expansion when medium- and large-scale renewables plants are becoming more expensive and uneconomical due to rising prices?
In June, almost all of the values in the pvXchange price index rose again by around €0.01 per watt-peak, and bifacial modules even saw a jump of €0.02. This means the prices of some module types are now 20% higher than at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2020, when module prices dropped to a historic low. With currently rising raw material and transport prices, all forms of energy generation are becoming more expensive, but wind and PV especially so. While the procurement costs for inverters and storage are still largely stagnant, the prices for solar panels are skyrocketing, as are those for substructures and installation materials. This is due, among other things, to soaring polysilicon prices. Since the beginning of 2021, the cost of polysilicon has already tripled. Thanks to a lack of capacity and the fallout of a recent accident at a polysilicon factory in Xinjang, the bottleneck is only expected to worsen, further driving up prices.
Rising copper and steel prices are also causing problems. The purchasing terms for solar cables are being adjusted upwards almost monthly due to their high copper content, and a similar trend can be seen in mounting systems. Moreover, horrendous delivery costs for goods globally are negatively impacting component prices – international freight prices have multiplied by seven or eight times in the last year. This is not expected to change in the near future. For shipping prices to come down, the economy outside China would first have to pick up again and container congestion in Asian ports clear.
Some analysts are already correcting their forecasts for global PV expansion this year since many planned projects are stalled. Some see a revival of multicrystalline modules sparked by the persistently high cost of pure silicon, and for mono-PERC cells. But cells are no longer the decisive factor in the module and if all other production costs are constant, there will be no decisive price advantages here. I do not see any new availability in the multi sector yet. The only major module manufacturer still consistently using multicrystalline technology is Canadian Solar. Otherwise, one can only find old stock, mostly modules below 300 W.
At present solar panels are cheaper on the international spot market than directly from manufacturers, which mainly draw on surpluses and returns from unrealized projects. Some of the product prices were negotiated well before the price increases of the last few months, meaning small to medium-sized plants can still be built as expected. Many a large project will probably have to be put on hold until the situation eases. It remains to be seen whether the Chinese market will perform as predicted in view of the high prices, and it generally gobbles up a large share of the modules it produces in the second half of the year. After all, Chinese project developers are not as dependent on affordable overseas shipment to Europe. If these expectations are not met, we can hope for an easing by as early as the fourth quarter. But we will not return to the historically low module prices of 2020 any time soon.
The PV market needs good ideas in order to stimulate the construction of medium- to large-scale solar plants in the near future. The rapid removal of market barriers by lawmakers is one possible and sensible measure, but larger tender volumes are also needed, especially for smaller players.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/09/southeast-asias-big-pv-plans-27-gw-by-2025/,OPINION & ANALYSIS,,"JULY 9, 2021",Southeast Asia’s big PV plans – 27 GW by 2025,"By the end of 2020, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia had installed 98% of the operational PV capacity in Southeast Asia. But Vietnam was the only country that continued to steadily install PV systems throughout 2020. About 76% of installations in Vietnam came from the rooftop segment, thanks to a looming FIT deadline. The remaining 24% were ground-mount projects under the feed-in tariff (FIT) 2 regime. Thailand and the Philippines are currently driven by rooftop installations up to 5 MW. In Malaysia, large-scale solar (LSS) projects have contributed to recent growth beyond rooftop systems. As emerging markets, Cambodia and Indonesia have also seen some development in large-scale projects.
Solar support
Vietnam passed 9.2 GW of rooftoop installations in 2020. However, 2021 will see it slow down unless new support is approved by the government. As per the proposed draft of National Power Development Planning (PDP) VIII, 9.1 GW of ground-mount PV projects are in the planned and pre-planning stages. Of this, 6.3 GW is targeted for completion by 2025 and 2.8 GW by 2030. These projects are planned to come under direct PPAs, with 400 MW to 1 GW of capacity in the PV auction scheme. PDP VIII also mentions an 18.6 GW target by 2030, which had already been achieved by 2020. This target is likely to be revised upward in the final version.
Thailand’s installation activity picked up from 2019, but was hit by Covid-19 in 2020. As per government data, there were no new ground-mount installations in 2020. However, the C&I sector continued without much interruption. IHS Markit projects steady growth, with projects mainly built for self-consumption and not grid export.
Malaysia continues to be driven by utility-scale projects under its LSS program. With the exception of 2020, the government has awarded PV tenders annually since 2017. As of 2021, the upper project size limit was raised to 100 MW. The LSS4 PV tender in 2021 awarded 823 MW of PV capacity, with projects to be installed in 2023 and 2024. The first tender, LSS1, awarded 450 MW, followed by 563 MW in LSS2 and 490 MW in LSS3. While LSS1 projects have been fully commissioned, 311 MW of LSS2 projects are pending completion in 2021 and 2022 (LSS capacity figures are given in AC). Strong oversubscription of tenders indicates the capacities of future LSS tenders are likely to remain stable or increase.
The Philippines rooftop market is thriving. PV systems for direct consumption at malls, schools, cold storage, and factories are all increasing, as permits are easy to obtain. The Philippines is a clear example of a market driven by the competitiveness of PV, with no need for explicit policy support.

Myanmar’s ongoing political crisis has created great uncertainty around the 1 GW of PV projects awarded in 2020. Most of these were won by Chinese developers such as Sungrow Renewables and China Machinery Engineering Corp. (CMEC), at an average tariff of $0.0422/kWh, with the original completion deadline on March 9, 2021. However, with the current situation, developers are reconsidering projects and may pull out. Funding is not widely available, as most financing entities are not ready to provide loans.
Laos relies on hydropower and coal, and exports a great deal of electricity at certain times of the year. Hydro declines in the summer, however, and the government ends up importing. To diversify the electricity mix, Laos has started allotting PV projects, such as the 76 MW PPA between nValid Precision Engineering and Electricite du Laos (EDL), or the intent of Wealth Power Group to build 580 MW of PV.
Cambodia’s government has installed 260 MW of PV capacity, mainly in ground-mounted installations outside of any auction scheme. Since 2019, the government has been working on a 100 MW auction scheme in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank. In 2019, the government awarded 60 MW of capacity to Prime Road Alternative Company.Another 40 MW of capacity is at the second stage of tendering. Apart from the auction scheme, 455 MW of unsolicited PV plants are at different stages of development – mainly very early stages.
Indonesia’s PV market is dominated by 125 MW of ground-mount installations. The government has a target of 6.5 GW PV capacity by 2025 and 45 GW by 2050. As per our project tracking, Indonesia has 841 MW of PV projects in the pipeline, including 174 MW of floating PV. State-owned electricity utility company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) is also working on a PV auction mechanism.
Southeast Asian markets cover the full range of opportunities for the PV industry. At the same time, regulatory uncertainty elevates risk for investors in several regions. Despite this uncertainty, more and more developers and suppliers are seeking to capture a share of the 27 GW that we forecast will be added through 2025.

The membership organization has recorded 1,879 MW of utility scale solar and storage project announcements in the five weeks since the start of June, it said in a post on its website.
Scatec's Kenhardt project – awarded in a coal-exempt but otherwise technology-neutral ‘risk-mitigation' tender held by the South African government to address frequent grid failings – was the largest of the recent awards, which also included seven project announcements for total generation capacity of 70 MW in Zimbabwe among a list of facilities across 18 nations.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out. The print edition offers an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, pv magazine has been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
Three Togolese projects on the list amount to 225 MW of new solar in development or announced and two facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will add 200 MW, the same volume as the Serenje PV plant planned by the Zambian operation of U.S. clean power developer Ultra Green Corporation in the DRC's southern neighbor. Two plants will add a projected 180 MW in Tanzania and two Namibian projects announced in the last five weeks are due to add 111 MW of solar.
The smallest project included on a list of solar and storage plans announced in Cote D'Ivoire (a total of 75 MW); Niger (60 MW); Botswana (50 MW); Madagascar (20 MW and 5 MWh of storage); Mozambique (19 MW plus 7 MWh); Burkina Faso (17 MW); the breakaway Republic of Somaliland in Somalia (8 MW/2 MWh); Mauritius (8 MW); and Burundi (7.5 MW), was a 550 kW array planned in Sao Tome and Principe. The latter project was one of two which will add a total of 2.15 MW of generation capacity in the offshore state. The list also included plans for the Rebiana Solar Plant by Italian energy company ENI in Libya, although no details of scale were given.
AFSIA noted the re-emergence of the World Bank's Scaling Solar campaign as an important driver in generation capacity, following the initiative's failure to deliver an anticipated hundreds of megawatts of photovoltaics in Ethiopia. This year, said the trade body on Wednesday, the program has delivered plans for 50 MW of solar in Niger, 60 MW in Cote d'Ivoire and 190 MW in Togo.
The continental industry grouping noted the floodgates may finally be opening for clean power in Botswana after state-owned electric utility the Botswana Power Corporation licenced local developer Shumba Energy to develop 100 MW of solar as the nation's first independent power producer. AFSIA said the move had followed years of disappointment for solar developers who had expressed interest in annual 100 MW clean power tenders which were never followed up. The Southern African nation also introduced a net metering and feed-in tariff program late last year which will allow for 8 MW of commercial and industrial (C&I) and 2 MW of household solar in its first year.
The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority is behind that country's presence in the list, after granting seven licences for more than 66 MW of generation capacity and AFSIA estimates there are also plans for more than 1 GW of private, C&I solar projects in the country, including the 200 MW to be installed by U.K.-based platinum miner Zimplats at its Mimosa operation.
