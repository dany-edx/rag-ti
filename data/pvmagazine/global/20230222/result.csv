https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/22/perovskite-cigs-tandem-solar-cell-design-promises-29-7-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 22, 2023",Perovskite-CIGS tandem solar cell design promises 29.7% efficiency,"Researchers at the Chitkara University in India have designed and simulated a two-terminal, monolithically stacked tandem solar cell based on a top cell made of perovskite with an energy bandgap of 1.68 eV. The bottom cell is based on CIGS, with a bandgap of 1.1 eV.
The researchers conducted a numerical simulation to predict the device’s performance and behavior, using SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium.
They designed the bottom cell as having an indium zinc oxide (IZO) transparent conductive oxide film, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, a perovskite layer, and a layer of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) as the hole-transport layer. For the top cell, they proposed to utilize indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a cadmium sulfide (Cds) layer, and a CIGS absorber.
“In the top cell, the perovskite layer acts as an absorber to absorb the high-energy photons. Similarly, the bottom cell uses the CIGS layer to absorb the low-energy photons,” the scientists said, noting that both cells are connected through an intermediate layer of ITO to provide the current matching for the tandem configuration.
They tested different CIGS absorber layer thicknesses from 0.5 micrometers (μm) to 5 μm and found that there was an increase in current density due to higher photon absorption, up to a 2.3 μm thick absorber layer. They also determined that there is a saturation of current density for the thickness beyond 2.3 μm.
With an optimized absorber thickness of 2.3 μm, the bottom cell showed in the simulation it may reach a power conversion efficiency of 16.26%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.64 V, a short-circuit current of 35.98 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 70.51%.
“The voltage drop across the tandem solar cell is the sum of the voltage drop across both subcells individually, the scientists said, adding that the top cell delivers less current than the bottom cell in the standalone configuration and acts as a current-limiting cell.
The tandem device top/ bottom cell thickness of 347 nm/2.0 μm showed an efficiency of 29.72%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.92 V, a short-circuit current of 20.04 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 77%.
The scientists introduced the cell technology in “Perovskite-CIGS Monolithic Tandem Solar Cells with 29.7% Efficiency: A Numerical Study,” which was recently published in Energy Fuels.
“The main limitation of the adopted filtered spectrum approach is that it ignores the interfacial reflection losses and interference effects,” they concluded. “The transfer matrix method (TMM) can be used in the future to calculate a more accurate filtered spectrum.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/22/spanish-startup-releases-plastic-ballast-mounting-structure-for-rooftop-pv/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"FEBRUARY 22, 2023",Spanish startup releases plastic ballast mounting structure for rooftop PV,"Landatu Solar unveiled a new mounting structure for rooftops and flat surfaces this week at the Genera trade show in Madrid, Spain. The floating solar specialist is applying its technology to land-based solar with a two-piece high-density polyethylene ballast system that weighs less than 3 kg. The system features a fillable base and a cover.
“The base can be filled with water, gravel, or sand,” Landatu CEO Cristian Martín told pv magazine.
The system has 56 liters of capacity and can reach a weight of up to 100 kg when filled with gravel or sand, he added. The Spanish startup claims the mounting system can withstand wind speeds of up to 162 km per hour.
The Landblock measures 465 mm x 1,235 mm x 480 mm and comes with plugs, metal fixing parts, and stainless-steel screws. The PV modules are fixed directly to the mounting structure using these extra parts, bypassing the need to perforate the rooftop. The modules can be placed on the mounting structure at a 15-degree angle.
Landatu claims that the plastic ballast system is up to 10 times lighter than concrete ballast mounting systems, facilitating installation and protecting the health of the installers. The purported benefit is that the installer can place the mounting system at the desired location, and only after filling it with water or another material. A single installer can purportedly complete a small installation alone, with a structure for six PV modules weighing in at around 21 kg.
The units can be stacked on top of each other, allowing for an ultra-compact compact system for transportation. More than 40 units fit in 1 square meter, according to Landatu. The new product comes with a 10-year warranty and costs from €0.05 ($0.053)/W. Landatu is selling the product in Spain and is looking for distributors in other countries.

“The new modules series is suitable for both residential and C&I applications,” company spokesperson Michael Katz told pv magazine. “The novelty of the new product consists of combining double-glass design with n-type technology.”
The company is offering the panel in two versions – a monofacial module with a white backseet and a bifacial product with a transparent backsheet.
“The monofacial NEG9R.28 comes with a white rear encapsulant for maximum output power, boasting up to 445Wp and reaching 22.3% efficiency,” the manufacturer said. “In contrast, the transparent NEG9RC.27 is the preferred option for high-end aesthetic applications, for example on residential rooftops where the array would all but disappear optically. This bifacial module features a front side power of 435Wp, at 21.8% efficiency.”
Trina Solar is offering five versions of the NEG9R.28 products, with a power output spanning from 425 W to 445 W and power conversion efficiencies ranging from 21.3% to 22,3%. Their open-circuit voltage ranges from 50.9 V to 52.6 V and the short-circuit current is between 10.56 A and 10.71 A. The panels measure 1,762 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh in at 21.1 kg.
The NEG9RC.27 modules are available in five versions with output between 415 W and 435 W and efficiency ranging from 20.8% to 21.8%. Their open-circuit voltage ranges from 50.1 V to 51.8 V and the short-circuit current is between 10.50 A and 10.64 A. They measure 1,762 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh in at 21.1 kg.
The products can be used with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and are built with IP 68 enclosures. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per C and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The panels come with a 25-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“Both types feature a surface area of just under two square meters and a black aluminum frame,” the manufacturer said.
“When it comes to installation, Vertex S+ is highly compatible with other BOS components,” Trina Solar explained.
It offers a range of mounting methods, including short side and long side clamping, crossed beam, shared rail, and slide-in mounting. Due to its short circuit current of 10.7A, it is also compatible with more than 99% of mainstream inverters in the market, as verified by a comprehensive compatibility analysis.

Lithium-ion batteries are based on metals such as cobalt and nickel, which are known to cause skin irritation, allergies, and even cancer.
Worldwide Universities Network scientists have embarked on a research project to develop conductive electrode materials with very low amounts of toxic metals. They have synthesized polymeric porous materials based on abundant and environmentally friendly components as battery electrodes. They have also designed ionic-conductor functional materials as solid-state electrolytes for improved electrochemical performance.
Their key result was the development of a small-molecule organic electrode material hexaazatrianthranylene (HATA) embedded quinone (HATAQ). By introducing conjugated quinone moieties into the electron-deficient hexaazatriphenylene-derivative core, HATAQ with highly extended π-conjugation showed potential to yield extra-high capacity for metal-ion storage.
“Organic electrode materials possess many advantages, such as low cost and environmental friendliness,” said Professor Watchareeya Kaveevivitchai of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Taiwan. “They also contain a large number of redox active sites capable of undergoing a multi-electron-transfer process at a redox potential, which, if properly fine-tuned, can lead to a high energy density.”
Inspired by the excellent electrochemical performance of HATAQ in lithium-ion batteries, the researchers have investigated the compound as cathode in other rechargeable battery systems that are known as safer and cheaper such as sodium-, zinc-, and other multivalent-based systems.
Specifically, in rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries with 1 M ZnSO4 solution as electrolyte, the large number of redox active sites and extended conjugation allowed HATAQ to deliver ultra-high capacity of 492 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and excellent rate capability up to 20 A g−1 with 199 mAh g−1 reversible capacity corresponding to 99% retention after 1,000 cycles.
The researchers say that the performance from HATAQ is among the best ever reported for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. They discussed their findings in “Proton-enabled biomimetic stabilization of  small-molecule organic cathode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries” which was recently published in Journal of Materials Chemistry A.

Iberdrola said this week that it is now working with Exiom Solution to build a solar module factory in Langreo, Spain. The company has not revealed the planned capacity of the factory, but said it will be one of Europe's first “industrial-scale” facilities.
It will initially invest €20 million ($21.3 million). It said it expects to start commercial operations by the end of this year.
“Exiom is a manufacturer with 100% Spanish capital, based in Asturias itself, and one of the only European companies to appear on the prestigious list of Tier 1 manufacturers,” Iberdrola said. “The opening of this new factory in Europe responds to the interest of both companies in achieving competitive manufacturing at the EU level, focused in a first phase on solar panels with the possibility of expanding the partnership to other components of the photovoltaic value chain.”
The latest edition of pv magazine is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
Exiom currently produces solar modules at two factories in China with a combined capacity of 1 GW. Its main markets are Europe and Asia. It reported a turnover of around €200 million in 2022 and currently employs around 300 people.

The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ruled that a solar power facility’s alternating current (AC) size is the technical consideration that matters when determining “Qualifying Facility” status under PURPA. The case was filed by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The case focused on Broadview Solar’s facility in Montana, which applied for an 80 MW (AC) Qualifying Facility electricity contract with the state under PURPA guidelines. The facility was sized at 80 MW (AC)/160 MW (DC) of solar power, and 50 MW/200 MWh of batteries. Broadview Solar says the site will feature 20 inverters, rated at 4 MW (AC) each.
An initial ruling from the Montana Public Utilities Commission in September 2020 stated that the solar power facility should be based upon its direct current (DC) rating, which is the same way in which solar panels are rated. Broadview Solar argued that its peak grid output, determined by its inverters, is what should be considered. The commission realized this was a departure from previous logic, but they went with it anyway. Broadview Solar appealed.
The Montana Supreme Court has ruled against the commission’s apparent anti-solar biases in the past. In March 2021, the commission vacated its prior ruling, instead stating that the facility’s peak grid output was the motivation for PURPA’s legislation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/22/baywa-re-unit-completes-floating-pv-plant-in-austria/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRIA,EUROPE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 22, 2023",BayWa re unit completes floating PV plant in Austria,"ECOwind and EVN have completed a 24.5 MWp floating PV plant in Grafenwörth, Austria. They claim that the project – purportedly the largest of its kind in Central Europe – was delivered in record time, with the 45,304 east-west oriented solar modules installed in just 10 weeks.
“In Grafenwörth, the challenge was to drive approval procedures and regulations for this new PV application in Austria and to ensure a safe construction – which we managed even with a level difference of 7 meters between the mounting surface and the water,” said Johann Janker, managing director of ECOwind.
The floating PV system, which measures approximately 14 hectares, was built on the surface of two ponds at a former sand and gravel pit. The project features 158 inverters and 10 1,800 kVA floating transformers. It is expected to produce 26,700 MWh of green electricity per year – enough to supply power to around 7,500 Austrian households.
“Floating PV also has the benefit of a higher electricity yield thanks to the cooling effect of water – making the application a very attractive prospect to landowners of unused water bodies,” said Janker.
ECOwind said it will regularly carry out research on the fish population and local dragonfly fauna to ensure the project’s integration into the surrounding ecosystem.
The project is purportedly the fourth-largest floating PV plant in Europe, along with three projects in the Netherlands – all built by BayWa re. Including the project in Grafenwörth, the group has installed a total of 15 floating PV projects, with more than 230 MW of capacity throughout the world.
IHS Markit says that 3.4 GW of floating PV capacity had been installed across the world by the end of 2021. It predicts that global floating PV demand will reach up to 14 GW by 2026. About 92% of those installations will likely be built in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by favorable policies and installation targets, says IHS Markit.
Floating PV is more expensive than ground-mounted solar installations, but other costs, such as O&M, tend to be lower. Depending on the site and technology, the output can be as much as 30% higher than a ground-mount PV plant, but further R&D innovation is seen as key for cost reductions and the continuous growth of floating solar.
