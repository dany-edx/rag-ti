“The coloring is done on the inner side of the glass, so the color is much more durable and resistant to all weather conditions,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Spectrum module with the colored glass is a 60-cell monocrystalline product relying on 3.2 mm glass with anti-reflective coating and high transparency. It is sold in three versions with power outputs of 190, 200 and 290 W, and an efficiency of up to 11.4% for the white panel. For comparison, the Spectrum modules without the colored glass would have an efficiency ranging from 18.9% to 20.5%.
The panel measures 1,665 × 1,002 x 35 mm and weighs 18.8 kg. The open-circuit voltage is between 40.3 V and 43.5 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 6.00 to 8.75 A. The maximum system voltage for the new product is 1,000 V.

With the introduction of the reform of Germany's renewable energy law, or EEG 2021, the size limit that exempt owners of residential PV systems from paying the EEG levy, which finances all of Germany’s renewable energy incentives programs, was raised from 10 to 30 kW.
According to an analysis by German market research company EUPD Research, this is driving strong growth in the residential segment. In the first quarter of 2021, the addition of photovoltaic systems with an output of up to 10 kW increased by 39% compared to the same quarter of the previous year, with the newly installed capacity rising from 154 to 215 MW. As for the systems with an output between 10 and 30 kW, the growth was even steeper year-on-year at 142%, and the newly installed capacity increased from 27 to 66 MW:
EUPD Research expects this trend to continue in the further course of the year and assumes 1.5 GW of newly installed capacity for systems up to 10 kW. In 2020, a record total of 1.1 GW was recorded in this segment. For the photovoltaic systems with an output of between 10 and 30 kW, the analysts forecast a newly installed output of 600 MW this year.
This strong increase in rooftop PV systems up to 30 kW is also accompanied by growth in home storage systems. After an increase of 106,000 home storage systems in the past year, the analysts assume that 150,000 new battery storage systems will be installed this year. This is a growth of 42%. EUPD Research also expects a slight increase in the retrofitting of existing photovoltaic systems with home storage. They would make up around 15% of the total demand.
The increasing demand for PV home storage systems means, among other things, that battery providers are further expanding their capacities. In 2020, Sonnen and BYD were the leading suppliers with a market share of 20% and 18%, respectively, as EUPD Research determined through extensive inquiries from manufacturers, installers, and end customers. E3/DC and Senec are in third place with 17% each. Overall, the leading manufacturers supplied 72% of all newly installed photovoltaic home storage systems.

Highview Power, a UK-based provider of long-term energy storage solutions, is developing several energy storage projects throughout Spain, with an aggregate capacity of up to 2 GWh and an estimated investment of about $1 billion.
The projects will be developed with the support of a consortium of investors, including Spanish engineering services provider TSK Ingeniería y Electricidad S.A. and Spain's Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT). Highview Power plans to develop up to seven liquid air storage projects with a capacity of  50 MW / 300 MWh each in Asturias, Cantabria , Castilla y León and the Canary Islands.
In February, Highview Power announced the closing of a $70 million funding round and a portfolio of 4 GWh liquid air storage projects in the United States, Europe and Latin America. TSK is also among the investors.
The so-called Cryobattery technology developed by the company uses liquid air as the storage medium and offers critical network stability services such as synchronous inertia, short-range circuitry, and dynamic voltage control.
According to Highview Power, Cryobattery plants have a performance equivalent to that of thermal and nuclear power plants. “Highview Power's cryogenic storage technology is cost-effective, scalable, clean, and has a long shelf life,” it said in a statement. “It is the only long-term energy storage solution available today that is traceable and offers multiple GWh of storage.”
In 2019, Highview Power and TSK announced the creation of a joint venture, Highview TSK, which planned the development of different projects in Spain, the Middle East and South Africa between 2019 and 2022.
The Spanish government's national energy storage strategy aims to reach 20 GW of storage capacity in 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/20/hybrid-wind-solar-could-make-green-ammonia-cost-competitive-in-niche-markets-by-2030/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 20, 2021",Hybrid wind-solar could make green ammonia cost-competitive in niche markets by 2030,"Ammonia is an industrial chemical that is used widely across many sectors in applications such as plastic, pesticides, detergent, and fertilizer. Around 80% of the world's production is used for agricultural purposes to generate ammonium nitrate fertilizers, which release nitrogen, a basic nutrient for growing plants, crops, and lawns. Producing this compound made of nitrogen and hydrogen with conventional power sources, however, results in high levels of CO2 emissions and several scientists have sought over the past years to improve ammonia-making processes with the aim of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide.
According to a group of researchers from the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, producing green ammonia from semi-flexible plants powered by hybrid PV-wind power plants may not only be a better solution in terms of greenhouse emissions but also of final costs. “Green ammonia has best chances to become the first e-fuel/e-chemical disrupting fossil fuels, simply due to attractive economics,” LUT professor of solar economy, Christian Breyer, told pv magazine. “I am not yet aware of green ammonia projects based on hybrid PV-wind plants, but I could very well imagine that such projects may be announced soon in Spain, Morocco or Australia, finally in regions of excellent wind and solar resource conditions.”
The scientists investigated the potential of this configuration in the paper “Global potential of green ammonia based on hybrid PV-wind power plants”, recently published in Applied Energy, in which they stated that hybrid wind-solar could make green ammonia cost-competitive in niche markets by 2030. “Niche markets may grow quite fast. It depends on relative prices and policies. CO2 pricing for emissions from marine transportation, but also chemicals, could be a booster,” Breyer further explained. “However, some companies may offer more sustainable products, such as cruise ships without huge air pollution,” he added, noting that the industry currently had quite a negative climate impact, resulting in a poor reputation for this high-cost segment of tourism.
According to research lead author Mahdi Fasihi, potential niches include: Ammonia demand in remote areas with traditionally high ammonia transportation costs and good renewable energy resources; pioneer countries, regions, or industries that would apply a significant CO2 emissions cost or enforce policies for reducing their GHG emissions by use of alternative fuels or technologies; and demand for ammonia as a medium for hydrogen transportation to hydrogen refueling stations for fuel cell powered trucks and buses.
“Apart from cost parity, technology readiness of green ammonia production chain is a key to its fast deployment,” Fasihi told pv magazine. “All the key components of the proposed green ammonia plant exist on large-scale today.”
The price of ammonia produced with hybrid wind-solar may reach between €345 and €420 per ton in 2030 from around between €440 and €630 currently, the researchers determined. They also believe this price may further drop to between €300 and €330 in 2040 and €260 and €290 in 2050. The current price of ammonia produced with fossil fuels ranges between €300 and €350 per ton.
The paper points out the regions of Patagonia and the Atacama Desert in South America and the northwestern European countries as the areas with the largest potential for the proposed combination. The scientists also emphasized that beyond 2030 green ammonia could become less expensive than natural gas-based ammonia with carbon capture and storage or with realistic GHG emissions costs. “Applying a GHG emissions cost could significantly change the time and scale of such cost-competitiveness,” they further explained. “For GHG emissions costs of 75 €/tCO2, RE-based ammonia in 2040 would be cost-competitive with natural gas at prices as low as 2 USD/MMBtu.”
Looking forward, the research team wants to investigate the costs of ammonia transportation via pipelines in different terrain conditions in comparison to electricity transmission lines.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/20/optimization-model-to-combine-residential-pv-with-hybrid-hydrogen-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 20, 2021",Optimization model to combine residential PV with hybrid hydrogen storage,"A recent study conducted by scientists from German research center Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH has proposed an optimization model to integrate solar power generation from rooftop PV arrays with hybrid hydrogen storage in a self-sufficient, well insulated, highly energy-efficient residential building.
The model is claimed to provide the required information to shape the hybrid system depending on the technology selection and the capacity of its units. “We show for the first time how a heat-integrated hydrogen storage unit equipped with a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) storage system and reversible solid oxide cells (rSOCs) enables cost-effective, self-sufficient residential buildings with only rooftop PV installed,” the researchers explained. This configuration was chosen because LOHC storage is able to provide a cost-efficient supply with a relatively small capacity for PV power generation, they added.
LOHCs are organic compounds that can absorb and release hydrogen through chemical reactions. “Roundtrip efficiencies (electricity-to-electricity) for LOHC storage systems of 30-40% without heat recovery have been reported,” the German group stated. “Up to 70% of electrical energy is converted into heat in this process. Residential buildings offer the opportunity to utilize this large share of energy for room heating or adsorption cooling.”
The rSOC technology combines the operation of fuel cells and electrolysis into a single unit and is able to store excess electricity as hydrogen and with it produce electricity and heat again. “We assume that the rSOC in fuel cell mode runs at an electrical efficiency of 45% and heat efficiency of 35% to decouple enough heat for the dehydrogenation process,” the academics emphasized. “The heat integration increases the roundtrip electrical efficiency to around 40%, discounting heat usage in the residential heating subsystem.”
They specified that rSOC systems are currently being utilized at an experimental level and that their performance in residential buildings was assessed based on experience with separate solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells.
In the proposed configuration, the DC power of the PV system is connected directly to the hybrid hydrogen system, a lithium-ion battery, an electric water heater, and an inverter, which in turn would provide AC current to the household and a heat pump. The building's room heating demand was estimated at 18.6 kWh/m2 per year. “The simulated annual energy demand for a 187 m2 living area and four residents is 4062 kWh of electricity and 3481 kWh of heat,” the study notes.
The analysis showed that a self-sufficient energy supply may be achieved for the building with a PV capacity of 26.8 kW, which would require large seasonal storage capacities. “With only battery storage available, a relatively large heat pump with a rated power of 6.8 kW, electrical storage of 458.9 kWh, and thermal storage of 60.0 kWh (1.0 m³) is needed to ensure supply during winter periods with low PV generation,” the research team added. By contrast, if a hybrid hydrogen system is adopted, there would be less need for PV capacity on the building's less sunny northwestern parts and the PV usage factor per installed capacity is higher. “It can be observed that reduced generation capacity is turned into a hydrogen storage size up to 10 times larger than the battery capacities in the lithium-ion battery (LIB) case,”  the paper underlines.
Compared to a proposed system with battery storage and no hydrogen system, the one using the rSOC LOHC technology is said to have an upfront investment cost which may be up to 80% lower. “The assumed investment costs for the optimal solution for the rSOC in the LIB rSOC LOHC case is €7190 for 0.91 kW(7901 €/kW) rated power,” the authors of the study concluded. “As the rSOC combines fuel cell and electrolysis functions in one component, this price can be considered attainable for a 2030 system.”
The system was presented in the paper Hybrid Hydrogen Home Storage for Decentralized Energy Autonomy, recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.

In its eight years of existence, One Stop Warehouse has come to dominate Australia’s solar distribution sector. The company posted record revenue in the 2020 financial year, hitting AUD 512 million ($396.8 million). That same year, Zhang entered the retail electricity market by opening Discover Energy.
“At its core, Discover is really a tech company though,” said Aaron Chen, Discover Energy’s director of corporate finance.
At Sydney’s International Convention Centre last week, Zhang and Chen told pv magazine Australia about their interlocking vision for the two companies – for which IT is the centerpiece. “The company’s DNA is very different,” Zhang said. 
One Stop leases tens of thousands of square meters in almost every Australian state to house solar equipment like PV panels, storage batteries and inverters. It then supplies that equipment to solar installers and retailers. As crucial as the physical aspect of the business has been in launching One Stop, it’s hardly the most important part of Zhang’s business future. IT, he says, is really where the money is.
Which is why he started Discover Energy. The point of venturing into the electricity retail space, Zhang and Chen explained, is to understand Australia’s electricity markets, to be up close to the action, to see what happens there. “As a tech company, we need data. You only get data if you have customers,” Chen said. “The more customers, the more data, the more accurate [your algorithms become].”
Algorithmic backbones
Who knew math equations would prove so sexy in this brave new world? But sexy they are. Algorithms and IT are really the brains of the software system, which are in turn the brains of how any computer-driven system operates.
“Software as a service – that’s the key,” Zhang said. One of the key areas Discover Energy is using its software is in its virtual power plant (VPP) offerings.
VPPs are software platforms that connect the capacity of home batteries distributed around the grid and join their forces so they have enough power to meaningfully engage in lucrative spot markets. Through a VPP, a home battery goes from being a solar-shifting device to an electron-trading platform that can generate profit for its owners.
There are a number of VPPs operating today in Australia, with state governments backing numerous trials, and energy giants like AGL and Origin also trying their hand. However, Discover Energy’s VPP is the only platform in Australia that can integrate all battery brands, according to Zhang – giving it an important point of difference.
“We are a truly hardware agnostic platform,” Chen added.
They describe Discover Energy’s platform as the “Android” of the VPP world – able to integrate with any hardware. Many of Australia’s other VPP operators rely on software provided by, for instance, Tesla, which naturally only pairs with its own battery hardware – a business strategy more akin to Apple.
Steady rollout
Discover Energy’s strategy has been to slowly spread through Australia’s states with all their technical variations. It’s been operating a VPP in South Australia for two years now, aggregating a capacity of 5 MWh. The company later moved into New South Wales and Queensland before launching in Victoria and the Australia Capital Territory (ACT) in April of this year. Zhang believes Discover Energy is the first company to launch a VPP in the national capital.
Discover Energy currently has 735 VPP customers across the nation. Its target is get to a total of 2,000 by the end of this year. Given there were roughly 10,000 home battery installations in Australia last year, his target is characteristically ambitious, but Zhang is adamant that the company’s capacity to integrate with any battery brand and hardware gives it the upper hand.
Operating virtual power plants across the country has provided Discover Energy with the data it craves. For instance, it’s found that at any given time, around 15% of batteries won’t be able to answer the VPP’s call to discharge their power at the most profitable moment because in reality it’s already being drawn by its ultimate overlords, the household’s owners.
On top of that, another 10% to 15% of household batteries won’t respond simply because they have bad internet connections, leading to roughly a 30% non-response rate overall. Not only does such knowledge breed more accurate algorithms, it has also proved helpful for Zhang in other ways, by granting him a powerful position of influence.
Knowledge is power
Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator estimates that around 80% of solar panels installed in Australia are sourced from China. The country also relies on China for much of its other solar equipment, too.
Zhang is therefore acutely aware of his position as “middle man,” as he called it. That is, he is able to communicate with parties in China about what Australia actually needs to deal with its unique technical issues.
From the start, Zhang’s business strategy has always been focused on B2B (business to business). So it’s hardly surprising that he is bringing that practice to Discover Energy, which is far more customer-facing than One Stop. Zhang said he’s been able to influence the next generation of batteries entering Australia from the Chinese market. Why? Because he has useful information – information Chinese manufacturers need.
Zhang sees VPPs as one of the solutions to smoothing Australia’s increasingly unsteady grid. “New things always bring new problems, they just need new solutions,” he said. Ultimately, it’s about finding non-network solutions to solve the networks problems, he adds – like a VPP.
Naturally, the role of VPPs will grow as battery uptake grows, for which Zhang also has high hopes. He forecasts that in the next three years, the price of installing a solar+storage system at home will drop from the AUD 13,000 to AUD 10,000 it generally costs today, down to between AUD 7,000 to AUD 8,000.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/20/new-applications-surging-demand/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA",,"MAY 20, 2021","New applications, surging demand","From pv magazine 05/2021
A 30 MW solar installation in Qinghai province. China installed 48.2 GW of PV last year, defying all expectations for the final year of the 13th five-year plan, which covered the 2016-20 period.
China’s solar PV power generation capacity grew 60% year on year in 2020, adding an impressive 48.2 GWp and beating all estimates for the final year of the nation’s 13th Five-Year-Plan (2016-20).
At a recent press conference, representatives of China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) highlighted China’s six consecutive years as the world’s largest solar PV market, and noted Chinese solar PV companies supply 58%, 93%, 75%, 73% of global polysilicon, wafer, cells and modules, respectively.
That fact didn’t go unnoticed. The Consultive Commission on Industrial Change, affiliated with the European Economic and Social Committee, described China’s present situation as being in “a quasi-monopolistic position in terms of components for photovoltaics.” This statement was made in the context of the EU’s “Critical Raw Materials Resilience: Charting a Path towards greater Security and Sustainability” assessment.
New paradigm
AECEA anticipates that near-future utility-scale project development in China will increasingly feature the combination of different renewable energy technologies. For example, wind/PV/hydro/biomass and other generation technologies are expected to be integrated as, for example, agrivoltaics, fish-farm-PV, floating PV plants, or combined with electrical energy storage devices in an attempt to support grid operations.
Single standing utility-scale PV systems designed to “just” generate power might soon be no longer sufficient to receive official project approval. NEA’s guiding considerations in this context are “integration and local consumption,” to ensure that as much as possible of the locally generated renewable energy power will be locally consumed.
Moreover, NEA’s promotion of gigawatt-scale hybrid renewable energy appears to already be bearing fruit. During January-March 2021, more than 50 such projects, with a combined capacity exceeding 100 GW, were signed between developers and local governmental authorities.
In light of the increasing penetration of renewable energy in the energy mix, the deployment of electrical energy storage (EES) devices is almost inevitable. Against this background, at present approximately two-thirds of all provinces made it mandatory that all future PV installations have a certain share of EES capacity on-site, usually between 10-20% of the power generation capacities and for up to two hours. However, given that an EES device increases the initial investment of a PV power plant by approximately 8-10%, the financial viability of these so-called “grid parity” projects could become a challenge.
Residential market
In terms of distributed generation, the NEA considers offering a subsidy of CNY 0.03/kWh for residential solar PV systems throughout 2021. Additionally, cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xian have issued support policies specifically designed for distributed solar. These cities offer a feed-in-tariff (FITs) for between two to five years. In Beijing, a subsidy of between 30-50% of the total investment is also added. Moreover, Xian and the province in which it is located, Shaanxi, offer CNY 1/kWh with a maximum of CNY 500,000 if PV is combined with an EES unit.
Tapping into the nation’s potential of Building Integrated PV (BIPV), Jiangsu’s provincial capital, Nanjing, announced in early April subsidies for BIPV projects accounting to CNY 0.5/W and with a maximum of CNY 200 million per project.
Strong 2021
In early 2019, China’s NEA announced that it will have completed its envisaged transition from a previously subsidy-driven development toward a subsidy-free market by 2021.
During the 2019-20 period, the central government conducted several rounds of competitive project auctions, which either resulted in projects eligible for FITs or to receive approval as grid-parity projects.
Taking the auctions and programs as a whole, strong demand for 2021 is ensured. The demand pipeline includes 55 GW of grid-parity projects approved in 2019/2020, 8 GW of bidding-converted-parity projects subject to a December 2021 deadline, and the 2020 carry-over bidding projects to be installed by June 30. It also includes two integrated GW-bases with 1-2 GW each anticipated to be tendered by the NEA in the coming weeks, plus pure provincial developments like 3 GW in Yunnan province and 1 GW in the Guangxi autonomous region by the end of this year.
In addition to these projects, growing market momentum is reflected by the number of project applications officially submitted to relevant provincial authorities during the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, 10 provinces across the country have received project applications amounting to approximately 45 GW, the same amount submitted for all of last year.
Due to relatively high local electricity tariffs, the top destinations are the provinces of Guangdong, Hubei and Guangxi, with 24 GW, 11.6 GW and 3.5 GW, respectively. Furthermore, in light of the NEA’s emphasis to ensure that future PV systems are dual-use projects, therefore, it is not entirely surprising that approximately 76% of the 45 GW submitted in Q1 202 are either PV-powered fish farms and/or agri-PV systems.
According to the NEA, during January and February, a total of 3.25 GW of solar PV was installed, against 1.07 GW installed in the same period in 2020. As of today, AECEA estimates full-year demand to be between 60 GW and 75 GW, thus representing an increase of 25-55% year on year.

A team of scientists studied the inner workings of a perovskite material to better understand the material’s behavior at the atomic scale. Their work revealed that a liquid-like motion in perovskites may explain how they efficiently produce electric currents.
The scientists explained that when light hits a photovoltaic material, it excites electrons, prompting them to “pop out” of their atoms and move through the material, conducting electricity. One problem is that the excited electrons can recombine with the atoms instead of traveling through the material. This can cut the amount of electricity produced relative to the amount of sunlight that hits the material.
Perovskites do well at preventing this recombination, the scientists said. Their work aimed to uncover what mechanism causes this and how more efficient solar cells can be developed. Duke University led the effort that included scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
The team studied one of the simplest perovskites, a compound of cesium, lead and bromine (CsPbBr3). They then used X-ray scattering capabilities at Argonne’s Magnetic Materials group’s beamline.
The team captured the average positions of the atoms in a perovskite crystal at different temperatures. They found that each lead atom and its surrounding cage of bromine atoms formed rigid units that behaved like molecules. In particular, the units oscillated in a liquid-like manner.
One theory to explain how perovskites resist recombination is that these distortions in the lattice, or crystal structure, followed the free electrons as they traversed the material. The electrons might deform the lattice, causing liquid-like disturbances, which prevented them from falling back into their host atoms. The researchers said this theory may offer new insights into how to design optimal perovskite materials for solar cells.
The data also indicated that molecules in the material oscillated within two-dimensional planes, with no motion across planes. This two-dimensional nature could also help explain how the perovskite can prevent electron recombination, contributing to the materials’ efficiency.
To investigate the motion of the atoms directly, the team used neutron scattering capabilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Neutron scattering confirmed the pattern seen in the X-ray scattering experiment. It also showed that it took almost no energy for the molecules to oscillate in two dimensions. The researchers said this helps to explain why the excited electrons could deform the lattice so easily.
A paper on the study, “Two-dimensional overdamped fluctuations of the soft perovskite lattice in CsPbBr3,” was published in Nature Materials in March. Computational studies to support the experiment were performed at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Berkeley National Laboratory. The research was funded by DOE’s Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Science and Engineering division.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/20/indias-utility-scale-solar-installations-fell-by-39-in-fiscal-2021/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 20, 2021",India’s utility-scale solar installations fell by 39% in fiscal 2021,"From pv magazine India
India added about 3.5 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity in the 12 months of fiscal 2020-21 (April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021), or about 39% less than in fiscal 2019-20. Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh led large-scale solar installations, with most of the share coming from these states.
Rooftop solar posted strong deployment figures despite pandemic-induced lockdown and restrictions. About 2 GW of new rooftop PV capacity was added in fiscal 2021. Gujarat and Maharashtra together contributed nearly 50% of all rooftop solar installations in fiscal 2021. Other states that added maximum rooftop solar capacity during the year included Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. 
JMK Research expects about 10 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity and 3.5 GW of new wind capacity to be installed in fiscal 2022. That will be about 25% less than its initial estimate made before the second wave of Covid-19 hit India. 
The analysts quoted the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s May 12 notification, which stated that “renewable energy projects having their commissioning dates on or after April 1, 2021, can claim extension owing to the second surge of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The MNRE also mentioned that, on receipt of applications for time extensions, the implementing agency will not initiate any coercive action on projects to recover the penalty against delayed commissioning until the extended time frame is decided upon.
According to JMK Research, lockdowns imposed across several states could lead to a shortage of labor and interruptions in equipment supplies. This could in turn delay the commissioning of nearly 3 GW to 4 GW of solar and wind projects. 
However, it said that it expects rooftop solar capacity additions to exceed the fiscal 2021 figure in the current financial year. India could add about 2.5 GW to 3 GW of rooftop solar in fiscal 2022, it said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/20/solar-101-the-basics-of-net-metering-for-your-solar-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 20, 2021",Solar 101: The basics of net metering for your solar project,"From pv magazine USA
As you’re learning in our Solar 101 series, solar power is a combination of construction, hardware … and money.
The money side of things is determined by more than just the cost of construction and hardware. It’s also influenced by the local price of electricity, as well the legal policies governing the power grid. In the United States, these laws vary in every state and are regulated by public utility/service commissions after they’ve been put in place by state legislatures.
One legal structure that gets extensive coverage is  “net metering.” It is important to be familiar with net metering because it affects how long your solar project takes to pay for itself, and how you and your contractor need to design your project.
The first thing to know is that net metering is a tool to count and – importantly – assign a value to the excess electricity that a solar project is expected to export to the grid. When the sun is out and your electricity use is low, your rooftop solar will probably produce more energy that you are consuming. That excess power can be routed to the broader electric grid and help reduce the need for large-scale power plants, many of which burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.
Because of net metering, most solar power systems are designed to generate enough electricity in the daytime so that they can offset 24 hours of electricity use. And in order to generate enough electricity to offset use at midnight, a solar system must overproduce at high noon.
So, the electricity utility – following the rules put in place by the PUCs – “meters” (a technical term that describes counting) both your electricity generation and your use. Once the net electricity value has been found, calculations unique to each state determine the dollar value of the net metered electricity; in other words, your system’s net benefit to the grid for which you can be compensated.

One indispensable resource for learning your state’s net metering rules is the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center’s Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE for short). In their net metering law page, you will find links describing policies in 50 states and four territories. DSIRE also provides the summary maps like the one above, providing a cursory view of net metering policies across the United States.
Again, the laws vary by state. For instance, Florida has a very straightforward law (that the electricity utilities are attacking): All net metered electricity is credited to your electricity bill at the same price that electricity costs to buy. In Utah, the electric utilities successfully lobbied the PUC to lower the rate net metered electricity is paid to well below what homeowners pay. And Hawaii, because it has so much solar power, does not allow homeowners to export electricity to the power grid at all.
Some states, like Texas, have no state-level rules for net metering, even though several utilities that have implemented their own rules.
The nation’s leader in solar power, California, is currently debating what is called “Net Metering 3.0,” a reference to the state’s third major update to its policy. One nuance in California’s current energy policy (NEM 2.0) is that solar system owners are charged for electricity based on “time of use,” while those who do not own solar pay a simple flat rate. That means solar owners pay more for electricity in the evening than in the daytime. This is typically more common in commercial and industrial electricity use cases than in residential.
It also means that residential solar owners in California are paid less for electricity that they produce in the daytime than for electricity they produce in the evening. These policies are intended to motivate consumers to install batteries that store low-cost daytime electricity, to be used or exported during the more expensive peak-demand hours, around 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.
With all that in mind, let’s review the effect net metering has on revenue. Let’s consider two hypothetical cities which have matching electricity rates of $0.12/kWh. In City 1, net metered electricity is paid at a rate matching the cost of electricity – $0.12/kWH. Meanwhile, City 2 pays half of that net metered rate. It looks like this:

As you can see in this example, 50% of our electricity is used instantly inside the home. This offsets the full City 1 local electricity rate of $0.12/kWh. The second 50% is net metered, covering the rest of the City 1 house’s needs during non-sunlight hours. Meanwhile, City 2’s net metered electricity earns 50% of City 1’s, and, when added to the electricity used instantly, means the project earns 25% less revenue ($360 a year) overall.
In a later article, we will show how net metering laws fit into your project’s economic calculations, and how to calculate your solar power project’s return on investment.
