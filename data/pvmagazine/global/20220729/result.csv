German PV production equipment supplier Manz AG has to write off €23.2 million ($23.6 million) after final negotiations on the outstanding payments for the CIGSfab project with Chinese client Chongqing Shenhua Thin Film Solar Technology Co., Ltd. ended without agreement.
The €218 million solar factory project has been in operation since 2017, with Manz providing services totaling some €198 million for Chongqing Shenhua but only having received payments of around €175 million. The work was interrupted in December 2020 at the request of the Chinese company. Since then, Manz has been waiting for the outstanding amounts to be paid, and the management board assumed that the contractual obligations would have been met.
Contrary to expectations, however, it has not been possible to find an amicable solution between the contracting parties to date and Manz is now pursuing the goal of asserting its claims through litigation.
“We very much regret that we were unable to reach an amicable solution with our Chinese contractual partner,” explained Manz CEO Martin Drasch, noting that Manz will exit the photovoltaic business completely. “We will now focus our energies consistently on implementing our growth strategy in the automotive and electromobility, battery manufacturing, electronics, energy, and medical technology sectors. Accordingly, we are not making any further technological developments in the field of CIGS thin-film solar technology and have stopped working in the market,” Drasch added.

It also revealed that polysilicon output during July was affected by maintenance operations at the factories of three different manufacturers. As a result, output was 5% lower at 58,500 MTs compared to June.
Module manufacturer JinkoSolar announced it will issue convertible bonds worth CNY 10 billion ($1.48 billion) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Sci-Tech Innovation Board. The company said it will use the net proceeds from the bond issuance to expand production capacity. The plan includes 11 GW of n-type solar cell capacity and 26 GW of other cell and module capacity
Panel maker Trina Solar said it expects its profit for the first half of this year to reach up to CNY 1.39 billion ($205.9 million), a 98% increase compared to the same period a year earlier. The manufacturer said the strong performance was due to increased module shipments and sales volume as well as to large market penetration of its 210 mm products. The company's distributed smart energy business also contributed to the growth of sales and profits, it added.

The more photovoltaic systems are installed, the more relevant are precise forecasts of how their feed-in will develop in the event of weather events such as solar eclipses. Extreme meteorological events in particular pose major challenges to secure network operation.
Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology (IEE) in Germany have addressed this issue by developing a new forecast methodology that will soon be tested under real conditions. On October 25, in fact, there will be a partial solar eclipse in Central Europe, which will significantly reduce the photovoltaic feed-in. So far, such rare extreme events have not been routinely included in weather forecasts.
The scientists claim their solution is able to combine the degree of coverage specifically for location and time with all important weather forecasts. This would allow regional and local PV feed-in forecasts to be optimally adjusted in the future, with minimal errors.
Although the effect of the solar eclipse is slower and smaller than the influence of changing clouds, it still plays a significant role in the result. Volatile self-consumption also has a massive effect on the feed-in profile of photovoltaic systems, which can be forecast separately, according to the researchers.
Fraunhofer IEE validated its results with the data from the eclipse that occurred in Central Europe on June 10, 2021, in two steps: through ground-based measurement of global radiation based on data from German weather service DWD and feed-in measurements from thousands of photovoltaic power plants that are used for extrapolation and forecasting processes. The simulation also included weather forecasts and performance data from Fraunhofer IEE. The solution is also available as an algorithm or software for direct integration with the user.
The researchers are considering the proposed methodology as a tool to further strengthen the grid integration of renewable energy sources in Germany. For new locations or regions that have not yet been measured, an extrapolation process is possible by using current measurements from comparable areas and systems.
The October solar eclipse, with a 25% degree of coverage, will be about twice as strong as the result in June 2021, according to the researchers. Weather forecasts a few days beforehand are expected to provide information about cloud density and the effects the solar eclipse may ultimately have.
“In addition to the already good forecast models for the feed-in of individual photovoltaic parks or entire portfolios — including self-consumption — an important contribution can be made to avoiding or reducing errors,” said Rafael Fritz of Fraunhofer IEE.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/29/reverse-bias-a-hidden-challenge-for-perovskite-solar-cell-stability/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 29, 2022",Reverse bias – a hidden challenge for perovskite solar cell stability,"Stability issues with perovskite solar cells have been well documented, even as the technology has continued to reach impressive efficiency levels. Much of the research focused on improving stability to date has focused on the issues that arise under normal operating conditions – for example sensitivity to oxygen and moisture, which can be solved through encapsulation, or degradation under UV light, which can be solved with reflective coatings.
Other issues,  some only recently noted, may present a more serious challenge to developing perovskite devices that can stand up to outdoor deployment for years and even decades. “…thermal degradation and reverse-bias instability are remaining issues that pose challenges even for intrinsically much more stable silicon cells, suggesting that innovative approaches may be required to satisfactorily address these for perovskite cells,” state the authors of a new paper addressing the topic.
Reverse bias is caused for example when an individual cell is shaded and other cells in the module try to push a higher current through it. Recent research has shown this itself can cause damage to the shaded cell, and also lead to an increase in temperature causing further damage.
New research from Australia’s University of New South Wales (UNSW) outlines how perovskite solar cells are vulnerable to this problem, particularly since they typically dissipate heat much more slowly than silicon, and many of the typical component materials can begin to degrade at temperatures as low as 60 C. In the paper “Combatting temperature and reverse-bias challenges facing perovskite solar cells,” published in Joule, UNSW scientists Dongchen Lan and Martin Green outline the vulnerabilities relating to reverse bias in full, and begin to suggest solutions.

Noting that making the actual materials less susceptible to reverse bias damage would be much more difficult, the scientists first recommend design approaches that would simply avoid the risk of it occurring: Adding a bypass diode to each individual cell would offer significant protection, and if combined with altering the module interconnection layout so that current flows across the cell widths, and possibly an additional component to aid in heat dissipation, Lan estimates that this should limit temperature increases to 40 C in most conceivable field situations.
And for perovskite-silicon tandem cells, in particular, tuning the bandgap of the perovskite cell, to make it slightly lower than the optimal value to match the current in the silicon, could be another effective strategy without significant costs. “This is to prevent the silicon cell generating substantially more current than the perovskite cell under some conditions, driving it into reverse bias.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/29/solar-tree-based-photovoltaic-plants-for-mountainous-areas/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 29, 2022",Solar tree-based photovoltaic plants for mountainous areas,"Researchers from the Korea Maritime Institute have proposed the use of solar trees to build photovoltaic plants in mountainous forest areas in land-scarce South Korea.
They defined the new concept as forest-photovoltaic and explained that it would both maintain carbon absorption activities under the solar trees and produce solar power on the upper part of forest land.
“Compared to a general flat fixed panel, the solar tree has a higher structure and a stronger support base, increasing construction costs,” they explained. “As the demand for solar trees increases due to the development of new technology, more companies enter the market. Therefore, it is expected that solar trees can be installed at a cost that can compete with the current flat fixed panel in the not-too-distant future.”
Using Google Earth satellite imagery, the Korean group assessed the concept's operational potential by simulating solar tree installations in a mountainous area at 400 meters above sea level, where there is an operating agrivoltaic plant relying on solar trackers. “The solar power plant was constructed by cutting a mountainous ridge available in the highly elevated plateau into flat land,” they explained. “The solar panels installed on the 3-meter-high structure made a space for farming in the ground. One kind of ginseng, mountain garlic, is being grown in the space at the bottom of solar power facilities.”
The academics used Google Earth 3D to reflect solar tree size and the distance between the trees. As a reference, they considered a 4.8 m × 4.1 m panel with a rated power of 1.2 kW developed by Korea-based module manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells. “The slope distance was measured using the built-in elevation path measurement function in Google Earth Pro to arrange the solar tree at 100 m intervals in the three-dimensional image,” they specified. “The forest area, solar panel, and open space were calculated using the polygon measurement function provided by Google Earth Pro to quantitatively evaluate changes in mountain landscape before and after solar tree installation.”

The researchers performed their analysis with criteria developed by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) for agrivoltaic projects. One of the important factors they considered is the distance between the solar trees, which is crucial for determining their impact on the surrounding natural environment. They ascertained that, if the trees are installed according to the scale of the 3D image, a considerable number of solar trees could be deployed throughout the 1,100,872-square-meter study area. If too many solar trees are placed in a limited space, however, the solar trees displayed as too small in size, causing significant limitations in terms of visual effect, they noted.
Despite their higher costs compared to conventional PV installations, solar trees may have a strategic advantage as they occupy a much lower amount of land. “The land purchase cost is the most important parameter in calculating LCOE on the solar power plant in South Korea,” the research team said. “Compared to other countries, South Korea ranks third in the world in terms of land price. So, purchasing the land is much higher than the money required to build a solar power plant.” On the other hand, in the South Korean Energy Agency's most recent renewables auction, the final average price was KRW 143.120 per kWh ($0.11), which shows prices quite above the average prices seen in the world's largest and most mature solar markets.
“The solar tree has not been popularized yet, so the forest-photovoltaic field has many problems to be solved and is only in its infancy,” the scientists admitted, noting that most major module manufacturers haven't entered the business yet. “The procedure for the solar tree to be commercialized has to deal with different international standardization and regulation schemes.”
They introduced their concept in the study “Exploring the operational potential of the forest-photovoltaic utilizing the simulated solar tree,” published in scientific reports. “A follow-up study is needed to initiate legally binding international standards for solar trees' wind and snow load operation,” they concluded.

German PV module manufacturer Solarwatt has obtained a “cradle-to-cradle” silver certification for its glass-glass solar modules produced at its facility in Dresden.
The panels are said to be particularly sustainable over the entire cycle and the entire manufacturing process – from material procurement to recycling – is evaluated for certification. Solarwatt claims to be the first German module manufacturer to receive this certification, which responds to the growing demand for products that are sustainably produced in Europe.
“It is important to us that our modules not only deliver clean energy, but are also produced sustainably,” Solarwatt Managing Director Detlef Neuhaus said. “Solarwatt has already set up its production accordingly in recent years and uses 100 percent green electricity. We now wanted to make this commitment visible to our customers and have initiated the demanding certification process.”
The “cradle-to-cradle” certification is considered a globally recognized holistic product quality standard. The assessment is made for five categories: material health, recyclability of materials, energy management and CO2 emissions, water management, and social responsibility.
In addition to ecological aspects, social performance is also evaluated. “In contrast to pure environmental standards, the company's social responsibility is also considered, for example using the UN Global Compact Self Assessment Tool,” said Annika Beck, Corporate Social Responsibility Manager at Solarwatt.
The certification values the production according to five different evaluation degrees: Basic, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Solarwatt achieved gold in the Energy Management & CO2 Emissions and Water Management categories, and silver in the rest. Ultimately, the lowest certification level achieved in an individual category is decisive for the overall rating.
The certification is awarded by the independent Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. The accredited agency EPEA assessed Solarwatt's glass-glass solar modules.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/29/the-pv-industry-needs-12-times-more-polysilicon-production-capacity-by-2050/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 29, 2022",The PV industry needs 12 times more polysilicon production capacity by 2050,"Researchers at Australia’s University of New South Wales (UNSW) seeking to assess polysilicon (poly-Si) demand for the PV industry, and assuming the world will have 63.4 TW of installed PV capacity by 2050, have concluded that current production capacity should be increased 10 to 12 times in order to achieve the target.
Their assumptions were based on the broad electrification scenario from the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV), which assumes that PV will cover around 69% of the global primary energy demand and the solar industry will see its total production capacity increase to 1.4 TW per year in 2030 and to 4.5 TW by 2050. “The PV industry is expected to expand 7-15 times current PV annual production capacities by 2030, and annual growth rates in the range of 25-35% would be required to reach broad electrification,” they explained. “Further growth of 1.5 to 3 times in the subsequent 20 years to 2050 would also be required.”
Using the software OpenLCA, the scientists conducted a lifecycle assessment (LCA) of the polysilicon manufacturing stages from mining through to solar grade (SoG) ingot production, taking as a reference a 1 kg ingot. “The LCA was key in forming the basis for understanding the current environmental impacts of poly-Si production in the PV industry on a global scale,” they emphasized.
The researchers based their estimate of the PV industry's current polysilicon consumption on average cell thickness (170 μm), efficiency (20%) and utilization rate (70%), which they said would result in 2.83 kt per GW. “In 2021, the estimated poly-Si demand continued to grow to 549 kt, with poly-Si consumption slightly reducing to 2.88-3.27 kt GW,” they specified, noting that the 63.4 TW may require a capacity of up to 87 Mt of poly-Si.
The Australian group estimated the current learning rate of polysilicon at around 29.3 and said this should decrease to approximately 7.6 when the globally installed PV capacity reaches 3 TW. “Using the learning rates and the broad electrification scenario, the annual and cumulative poly-Si demands by 2050 are expected to be 1.8-5.7 Mt of poly-Si year and 46-87 Mt of poly-Si, respectively,” it further explained. “While silicon is an abundant element, it will still be a challenge to supply such a significant amount of poly-Si demand compared to the last year’s demand and supply of only about 0.5 Mt and 0.7 Mt, respectively.”
Through the LCA analysis, the academics found that, if fossil fuels are used, the carbon footprint of polysilicon manufacturing can be equivalent to 360-680 kg CO2 for 1 kg of silicon wafers or 0.5-1.1 kg CO2 for 1 kW. “Decarbonizing the electricity source using renewable energy like hydropower or PV, however, can reduce the total cumulative emission of greenhouse gas emissions by 5.1-47.5 Gt of CO2 for broad electrification scenario,” they concluded.
They presented their analysis in the study “A polysilicon learning curve and the material requirements for broad-electrification with photovoltaics by 2050,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. The same research group assessed the required aluminum demand for the PV industry by 2050.

India has installed a cumulative 57.7 GW of solar power generation capacity as of June 30, 2022. It is also in the process of installing a further 48.7 GW of PV projects and 16.7 GW under bidding, according to information recently provided by power minister RK Singh in the lower parliament. 
Most of these solar power projects are being installed by private sector developers. Considering the normative cost of INR 4.5 crore ($568,063) per MW, an expenditure of approximately INR 2.60 lakh crore ($32.8 billion) has been incurred on installing the cumulative solar capacity of 57.7 GW.
Rajasthan tops in solar installations, accounting for 25% (14.4 GW) of the cumulative PV capacity installed in the nation. It is followed by the states of Gujarat (7.8 GW) and Karnataka (7.6 GW).
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy released INR 2,633.92 crore ($332 million) of funds under its various solar schemes during FY 2021-22, compared to INR 1,854.28 crore ($234 million) in 2020-21 and INR 1,591.15 crore ($201 million) in 2019-20.
The National Institute of Solar Energy has estimated that India has around 750 GWp of solar capacity potential, based on land availability and solar irradiation.

The first phase of the development plan, valued at $710 million, will cover 600,000 square meters. The facility is to produce 20,000 tons of green hydrogen and 100,000 tons of green ammonia by 2025. The deal targets export markets and, marginally, the internal market. According to the Egyptian government, the country is working on using hydrogen for shipping. The final aim is to produce 220,000 tons of green hydrogen and 1,100 million tons of green ammonia. It is not clear when the second phase of the project will be commissioned. The Suez Canal Economic Zone has so far concluded eight memoranda of understanding in the hydrogen field with international companies, including Maersk, Scatec and EDF Renewables. In November, Egypt will host the COP 27 in Sharm El-Sheikh. Egypt is also exploring hydrogen collaboration with Germany. In its 2035 energy strategy revisited this week, Egypt said it would focus on green hydrogen, wind and solar. 
A research team led by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) developed a method for predicting platinum alloys’ potency and stability, resorting to a combination of experiments, complex computation and X-ray spectroscopy. The researchers then created catalysts combining platinum, nickel and cobalt in a specific atomic structure and configuration based on their experimental measure. “They showed that the alloy they designed is both highly active and highly stable, a rare but much-needed combination for fuel cell catalysts,” wrote the University of California, Los Angeles. According to first author Jin Huang, the method could be applied to potential catalysts mixing platinum with a subset of metals beyond nickel and cobalt. The paper “Experimental Sabatier plot for predictive design of active and stable Pt-alloy oxygen reduction reaction catalysts” was published in Nature Catalysis. 
Iberdrola and bp announced their intention to form a strategic collaboration aiming to help accelerate the energy transition. The two companies want to jointly work on large-scale green hydrogen production hubs in Spain, Portugal and the UK. The two companies also want to produce green ammonia for export, most likely to Northern Europe. Iberdrola and bp aim to finalize the joint venture agreement by the end of 2022. They would then explore potential future opportunities for green hydrogen production in other geographies. A second agreement focuses on electric mobility in the Iberian peninsula. 
Ukraine and the European Union are considering hydrogen collaboration. “Our joint plans include the development of renewable energy sources together with biomethane and hydrogen,” said Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko following a meeting with Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson. “Ukraine has a significant potential for biomethane production; we are currently working on creating a full-fledged market for this biofuel. Hydrogen also has significant prospects — the EU has already identified Ukraine as one of the key partners in the development of hydrogen energy.”
H-TEC Systems has sold a PEM electrolyzer to Wenger Hydrogen, the general contractor for a project in Switzerland. “The Hydrogen Cube System (HCS), which H-TEC launched in the spring of this year, is suitable for multi-megawatt PEM electrolysis systems and enables gradual expansion and scaling up to 10 megawatts and more,” wrote H-TEC. The plant, through hydropower, will produce up to 900 kilograms of green hydrogen daily. It is scheduled to be commissioned at the end of next year.
More than 40 international participants announced the formation of the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI), a coalition working to advance nuclear hydrogen. “NHI will facilitate the development of nuclear hydrogen demonstrations, engage the financial sector in nuclear hydrogen development, catalyze commercial partnerships and advocate for policies that support nuclear hydrogen deployment,” wrote the coalition.

“The spin coating method, a solution process mainly used in the laboratory research stage, creates a uniform photoactive layer mixture as the solvent evaporates rapidly while the substrate rotates at a high speed,” the researchers explained. “However, the large-area, continuous solution process designed for industrial use caused solar cell performance deterioration because the solar cell material solution’s solvent evaporation rate was too slow. Consequently, unwanted aggregation between the photoactive materials can be formed.”
The Korean group designed the cell with ternary photoactive layers that contain polymer additives and, as a result, prevent aggregation in photoactive layers. It also engineered nano-level structure control to improve sunlight trapping.
The solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 14.7%, which the academics said is 23.5% higher than that of a conventional binary system. The device was also able to retain 84% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 hours at a temperature of 85 C.
“We have gotten closer to organic solar cell commercialization by proposing the core principle of a solar cell material capable of high-quality, large-area solution processing,” said KIST researcher Hae Jung Son. “Commercialization through follow-up research will make eco-friendly self-sufficient energy generation possible that is easily applicable to exterior building walls and automobiles and also utilized as an energy source for mobile and IoT devices.”

First Solar, a US-based solar manufacturer, has entered into a supply agreement with Intersect Power for 2.4 GW of its thin-film photovoltaic solar modules. The modules are scheduled to be delivered from 2024 to 2026, making Intersect Power, which previously placed orders for a total of 4.1 GW, in 2019 and 2021, one of the world’s largest buyers and operators of First Solar’s modules with approximately 6.4 GW expected to be deployed by 2027.
Founded in 2016, Intersect Power is involved in all phases of development, design, engineering, finance, and operations. Last year the company secured $127 million in equity funding from Climate Adaptive Infrastructure and Trilantic North America to accelerate the company’s move to become a scalable provider of electric power for utilities and large end-users. Intersect also closed on a $482 million debt facility with Generate Capital and CarVal Investors.
Intersect Power has more than 8.5 GW pipeline that includes a base portfolio of 2.2 GW of solar and 1.4 GWh of co-located storage that will be in operation by 2023. One of Intersect Power’s largest projects, which uses First Solar modules, is the 425 MW Juno solar facility in Borden County, Texas. The project has two long-term power purchase agreements, one for a portion of the project output with the Lower Colorado River Authority and the other with an undisclosed off-taker.
“Intersect Power’s ongoing relationship with First Solar has been critical in rapidly scaling our business to meet our vision and reliably delivering our customers value and performance to support their decarbonization goals,” said Sheldon Kimber, chief executive officer, Intersect Power. “We look forward to bringing this large-scale portfolio to operation, and creating good-paying, American jobs in both construction and manufacturing with First Solar’s domestically-produced modules.”
The modules procured through the recent supply agreement will be deployed in Intersect Power’s solar, storage, and green hydrogen projects coming online across the United States in 2025 through 2027. A large proportion of the modules are expected to be produced in First Solar’s Ohio manufacturing facility.
First Solar reports that its modules have a carbon footprint that is 2.5 times lower and a water footprint that is three times lower than the average crystalline silicon solar panel made with cells produced in China. The company operates a recycling program in the United States as well as in Germany, Malaysia and Vietnam.
The program recovers approximately 90% of Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) semiconductor material that can be used to manufacture new modules, as well as other materials including aluminum, glass, and laminates. First Solar is reported to be the only company among the ten largest solar manufacturers globally to be a member of the Responsible Business Alliance, the world’s largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities in the global supply chain.
“Intersect Power sets an important example by maximizing the impact of its investments on the US economy without compromising on competitiveness,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer, First Solar. “By powering its growth with American solar, Intersect Power is directly supporting US manufacturing and jobs and enabling a durable domestic supply chain. It is also demonstrating the ability of American solar technology not just to compete, but to help drive our country’s transition to a sustainable energy future.”

JinkoSolar has launched its modular SunTank home battery system in Australia, a lithium-iron phosphate storage solution that is sized for day-to-day use in residential settings and is primarily designed to be paired with a solar panel system.
JinkoSolar said the battery energy storage system is scalable from 2.56 kWh to 25.6 kWh with a single-phase hybrid inverter and can provide 5.1 kW power output. Each individual module measures 650 mm x 260 mm x 185 mm and weighs in at 28 kg. With an IP65 rating, the Suntank has an operating temperature ranging from -10 C to +50 C. The company also said the product, which is backed by a 10-year product warranty, has been designed to ensure fast and flexible deployment and is suitable for both wall and floor installation.
JinkoSolar said the Suntank system offers both AC and DC-coupling methods to realize multi-directional energy interaction between PV modules, batteries, and the grid, and can provide power back-up in the case of grid outages. “Due to the instability of the power grid, supply shortage still exists in some areas of Australia, energy storage trend is gaining importance as a counter to this situation,” the company said. “If the grid is lost, the system would switch to back-up mode and AC output is supplied via the emergency power supply (EPS) load port using energy from PV and battery.”
JinkoSolar APAC country manager Thomas Bywater said the Suntank system provides an efficient solution for owners looking to implement effective residential energy management, helping to reduce costs, manage demand, and maximize the self-consumption of power generation. “As one of the most mature photovoltaic markets in the world, we believe that energy storage will become an indispensable part of the Australian market,” he said.

Credit Suisse has reportedly launched an auction for Enel Green Power’s Australian renewables assets with the Australian Financial Review reporting potential investors were told Enel is looking to sell down 50% to 80% of the portfolio and would like to remain involved as the asset manager.
The portfolio includes the 34 MW Cohuna Solar Farm in Victoria and Enel’s 51% stake in the Bungala 1 and Bungala 2 solar farms, which deliver a combined 220 MW of generation capacity into the grid in South Australia.
The Bungala solar farms are backed by long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) with Origin Energy while the Cohuna Solar Farm has a contract with the Victorian government.
Enel’s portfolio also includes the proposed 88 MW Girgarre Solar Farm in Victoria and the 75.6 MW Flat Rocks Wind Farm, currently under development in Western Australia. The company said they are part of a 3.6 GW development pipeline in Australia.
The auction procedure has already been launched with Credit Suisse calling for the first round of offers by the middle of August. It is anticipated the final offers are likely to be called towards the end of September.
