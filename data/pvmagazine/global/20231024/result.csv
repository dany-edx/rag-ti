The 4th edition of Efintec, the installation and energy sector fair organized by the Federation of Installers of Catalonia (FEGICAT), took place at Fira de Barcelona, featuring more than 160 exhibitors and attracting 8,000 visitors, marking a 15% increase from 2022.
This year's theme, “Renewing the energy model,” brought together manufacturers and distributors, introduced the Escola Gremial for installer training options, and offered interactive knowledge-testing stations across installation specialties.
The event was sponsored by BBVA and received support from the Generalitat of Catalonia, including the Servei d'Ocupació de Catalunya (SOC) and the Consorci per a la Formació Contínua de Catalunya (CONFORCAT). Additionally, the event hosted various debate sessions in the Auditorium for the first time.
Several company representatives told pv magazine that two concerns casting shadows over the sector are the stockpiling of modules and a slowdown in the residential PV business. However, they also expressed a positive outlook for the commercial, industrial, and residential heating segments.
Nonetheless, this growth could potentially create a new bottleneck as the shift in the energy model is expected to trigger a surge in demand, for which the sector currently lacks the required qualified workforce. In 2022, Spain experienced significant growth in the distributed-generation solar business, attracting many untrained installers.
“A neighboring baker that I know closed the bakery a few months ago and became a PV installer,'” the owner of a well-known PV product distributor told pv magazine. “Of course, he didn't know what he had bought or what he was selling,” he added.
One installer said that this situation increases their workload, while another company representative said he believes that legislation won't appear until there are fatalities.

The distributed-generation solar segment in Brazil, encompassing all PV systems up to 5 MW in size, reached 24 GW of installed capacity at the end of September, according to Brazilian energy regulator Aneel.
During the first nine months of the year, developers connected approximately 5.79 GW of new distributed-generation solar arrays to the Brazilian grid – slightly less than the 5.99 GW connected in the same period last year.
However, most of the new connections in 2023 occurred in the first quarter, with 2.75 GW, compared to 1.5 GW in the same period of 2022. From March to June, an additional 1.8 GW was added, the same volume as in 2022. In the third quarter, there were 1.2 GW connected, down from the 2.4 GW connected in the same period in 2022.
“This last 1 GW took almost three months to be installed, there is a clear slowdown throughout 2023. Until the middle of the year, monthly [distributed-generation] additions were 20%, 30% higher than in the same month of 2022, which is significant after the 2022 gold rush,” said Guilherme Chrispim, the executive president of the Brazilian distributed-generation association ABGD.
However, companies are pointing to a recovery in sales in the second half of the year, he acknowledged.
“We have never had such a low watt value and we are all selling very low. In many cases, the payback has equaled or is even better,” he said. “So it never stopped being competitive. Manufacturers signal that this movement should continue.”
However, the systematic denials of new connection permits by Brazilian utilities should not go unnoticed, said Chrispim.
“How many companies will die in six months if they stop selling? How many [distributed-generation] systems were not connected during this period? The consumer gives up on the purchase if they have to wait many months, due to denials and other barriers imposed by utilities,” he said.
In 2022 and 2023, residential consumers accounted for most newly added distributed-generation capacity, contributing 4.5 GW out of a total of 7.1 GW in 2022 and 2.8 GW out of 5.9 GW by mid-October of this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/24/fraunhofer-ise-presents-silicon-carbide-string-inverter-for-medium-voltage-applications/,"INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 24, 2023",Fraunhofer ISE presents silicon carbide string inverter for medium-voltage applications,"Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) has unveiled a new medium-voltage string inverter for large-scale PV power plants.
In a press release, Fraunhofer ISE researchers said the new device is the first of its kind and is based on silicon carbide semiconductors.
Silicon carbide-based inverters are known to have higher power densities, with less need for cooling and lower overall system costs than traditional inverters. However, defects at the interface between the silicon carbide and the insulating silicon dioxide material could still represent an issue for such devices.
The researchers claim the new inverter is technically able to handle voltage levels of up to 1,500 V at 250 kVA.
“Modern PV string inverters have an output voltage of between 400 VAC and 800 VAC. Although the output of power plants is steadily growing, voltage has not yet been increased,” they said. “There are two reasons for this: First, building a highly efficient and compact inverter based on silicon semiconductors is a challenge. Second, there are currently no PV-specific standards that cover only the low-voltage range (max. 1,500 VDC / 1,000 VAC).”
The research institute emphasized that the increase in voltage from 800 V to 1,500 V resulted in a lower cable cross-section, which was reduced from 120 mm² to 35 mm². This, in turn, reduced copper consumption by around 700 kg per km of cable.
“Our resource analyses show that in the medium term, the electrification of the energy system will lead to copper becoming scarce. Increasing the voltage allows us to save valuable resources,” said Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.
The German institute developed the new inverter in partnership with German conglomerate Siemens and equipment supplier Sumida Components & Modules GmbH. It sits under the umbrella of the research project MS-LeiKra, founded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK).

The Innoptus narrow-bodied entry features a wind-managing fin and a PV panel with 257 standard-sized interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells from an undisclosed supplier.
For assistance in its solar PV plate design, the Innoptus team tapped the tools, such as simulators and laminators, and the experts at Belgium’s Imec, Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE), according to the team’s high voltage engineer, Simon Decat. They also sourced material from the Dutch integrated PV technology supplier Mito Solar.
The design constraints are the same for all teams in the one-seater Challenger Class: restricted weight, aerodynamics, and a silicon PV surface no larger than 4m2. “To be aerodynamic, the chassis should be rounded but that could put the PV cells at a less than optimum angle to the sun, so we had to search for the optimum between curvature and aerodynamics,” Decat told pv magazine.
To keep weight in check, a traditional backsheet was not used. A white polyolefin encapsulant was used, acting as a backsheet, and a structured film frontsheet was supplied by Mito Solar to boost performance. Decat added that the team considered cutting cells to increase surface coverage, but in the end, after calculations were made, standard-sized cells were chosen.
Two performance-boosting steps related to quality were taken. One was to perform electroluminescence quality testing before and after encapsulation. The second step was to test each and every cell with a lab analysis tool upon delivery, to separate out the best performers. “Each cell was Loana flashed with the help of ISFH,” said Decat. “It might just be a 1% difference, but we wanted to have it,” said Decat.
The race is scheduled to finish in Adelaide on Sunday 29 October.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/24/co-location-co-location-co-location/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",,"OCTOBER 24, 2023","Co-location, co-location, co-location","From pv magazine 10/23
The long-standing misconception, in the United Kingdom, that co-located energy storage doesn’t work is rapidly crumbling. Over the last two years, nearly half of all permitted solar developments in the United Kingdom had co-located storage systems, marking a significant shift in the renewable energy landscape. In time, the co-location of storage may become the default development model for renewable energy in the nation.
Several crucial storage co-location milestones have been achieved in the past 18 months. Firstly, in mid-2022, co-located projects secured deals under the contracts for difference (CfD) incentive, after an amendment permitted co-located storage as part of CfD agreements.

Secondly, in May, Cero Generation and Enso Energy closed project financing for the United Kingdom’s first combined energy storage system and solar farm directly connected to the grid. More recently, in July, with the support of Swiss consultancy Pexapark, Dutch investment fund DIF Capital Partners signed the United Kingdom’s first bankable, unsubsidized, co-located hybrid project power purchase agreement (PPA) with French utility company Engie for a 55 MW solar project co-located with 40 MW of storage.
While specific to the United Kingdom, the trifecta of subsidy eligibility, project finance availability, and PPA demand is a major step change to commercializing the solar-plus-storage pipeline. The typical scale of storage capacity is shifting from 20% of generation capacity to more than 100% at a growing number of sites, and Apricum sees more and more large investors now preferring co-located projects.
As the appetite for co-located facilities grows, driven by their benefits, several challenges need addressing to ensure widespread adoption. There are numerous benefits of co-locating solar and storage in the United Kingdom.
At a generic systems level, as the penetration of renewables accelerates, each incremental project is more exposed to the impact of “cannibalization.” The phenomenon occurs when the success of solar in driving down electricity prices reduces returns for future PV sites. High solar-penetration markets, therefore, have the greatest need to mitigate potential cannibalization impact. Load-shifting, via the co-location of storage, is one way of doing this. Energy storage protects long-term asset value and is increasingly seen as enhancing the value of PV projects.
Long lead times for permitting and grid connection have been significant barriers to renewables deployment, not just in the United Kingdom but across Europe. While solar-only projects often use less than 20% of their grid connection capacity, energy storage systems at co-located projects can utilize some of the unused capacity for additional revenue streams. In some cases, these revenues mitigate the capital cost of the storage system.
Battery-coupled projects are preferred by solar developers because excess electricity that cannot be exported to the grid due to constraints can be stored and monetized. If a system is DC-coupled – the battery is connected to solar on the DC side and only one inverter is used, compared to separate solar and battery inverters for an AC-coupled system – the storage can prevent excess clipping of electricity production by a solar inverter. In both cases, co-location enables the oversizing of generation capacity, thus maximizing revenue from the industry’s principal constraint – grid connection capacity.
Despite these benefits, it is not a given that solar projects will always be developed alongside energy storage systems. There are technical and market challenges and potential drawbacks to that approach.
Co-located projects require adherence to regulations for both solar and battery installation, adding complexity to permitting within an already challenging process. Furthermore, if a solar developer, having already obtained a grid permit, decides to add storage capacity to the project, the connection date may be delayed. Favorable changes in regulations and permitting processes are expected as more co-located projects come online.
Solar and storage projects have contrasting commercial models. Solar projects offer long-term, secure revenues while battery storage projects operate in the merchant market, with 85% to 95% of revenues coming from ancillary services to the grid. Backers of these two types of contracts typically had divergent risk tolerance, which impeded investment. Splitting the contracts with different parties creates operational challenges and disputes over grid connection.

Additionally, debt funding remains challenging due to the relatively novel nature of co-located ventures, as financial institutions have typically perceived them as higher risk, leading to higher interest rates, lower returns, and, henceforth, limited investor interest. This is now changing as merchant risk-tolerance thresholds increase, and particularly as utilities and energy players displace financial investors as the principal acquirers of solar assets. Power companies bring higher merchant appetite and less reliance on project finance.
The examples of hybrid PPAs and project financing for co-located projects mentioned above demonstrate that these offtake and funding challenges are starting to be overcome – even for financial investors. Hybrid PPA contracts are also expected to move from separate contractual agreements for renewables generation and storage assets, like the PPA signed by DIF Capital Partners, towards a single blended contract supporting 24/7 green energy supply.
Battery energy storage system developers may be hesitant about co-locating with solar due to the merchant revenue impact. Grid constraints mean solar electricity export is prioritized, which can limit a battery’s revenue potential from ancillary grid services such as frequency response. Efficient DC-coupled connections further limit the ability to perform ancillary services. As a result, investors and buyers often prefer AC coupling. Finding the right trade-offs and tuning trading algorithms accordingly, becomes crucial to minimizing losses.
The technical integration of energy storage systems with solar demands meticulous engineering expertise, which increases development time and costs. For example, grid constraints may prevent solar and storage capacity from exporting simultaneously beyond certain limits, to avoid fines from distribution network operators. To comply, exports must be controlled and limited by hardware and software on the sites.
While only eight co-located projects have been brought online in the United Kingdom to date, Apricum said it is confident that the share of co-located projects will rise significantly across the country’s traditional renewable energy markets. This will especially be the case in regions where penetration is high, and cannibalization and grid constraints pose growing risks.
In Spain, for example, €150 million ($159 million) in grants was awarded for energy storage co-located with renewables in 2022. This kind of supportive government policy, in combination with increasing cannibalization, is already driving investors to look into co-located projects. Germany has also introduced a subsidy scheme favoring hybrid projects, which also signals a positive future for co-location and has brought about projects such as the solar-plus-storage site commissioned by Enerparc in April.
Developers venturing into co-located projects face significantly more complexity with permitting and contracting, financing, and technology planning. Strengthening contract structures and risk management capability will be imperative to fully realizing the benefits of co-location. However, these upfront investments create more resilient and valuable long-term assets.
This increased complexity spreads to transactions, too. Monetizing co-located development assets requires a more sophisticated vendor or broker than one selling standalone project rights. The pool of competent advisers and buyers is narrower. Apricum’s depth of modeling, engineering, and financing competence distinguishes its services and it expects to play a growing role in transacting co-located assets throughout the United Kingdom and across Europe.

In the week of October 16, solar energy production decreased in all major European markets compared to the previous week. The largest declines – 42% and 41% – were registered in the Iberian Peninsula and Italy, respectively. The smallest drop was registered in the German market at 11%.
For the week of October 23, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s solar energy production forecasts, solar energy production is expected to increase in all analyzed markets compared to the previous week.


The week of October 16 brought a week‑on‑week increase in wind energy production in most of the major European markets. The Portuguese and Spanish markets were the most prominent, with increases of 294% and 272%, respectively. In addition, on Tuesday, Oct. 17, the Portuguese market broke its all‑time record with a daily wind energy production of 108 GWh. During the same week, on Friday, Oct. 20, wind energy produced 420 GWh for the Spanish market – the highest value since December 2021. The German market was the only sector where wind energy production decreased and was 14% down compared to the previous week.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts indicate that levels will decrease in all analyzed markets except Italy for the week of October 23.

Electricity demand
During the week of October 16, electricity demand increased in most major European markets compared to the previous week. Increases ranged from 0.7% in the Dutch market to 6.4% in the British market. However, demand decreased in two Southern European markets. In Portugal, demand fell by 2.2% and, in Italy, by 1.1%.
During the same period, average temperatures decreased in all analyzed markets. The largest decrease, 5.6 C, was registered in Germany. In contrast, Spain and Italy registered the smallest temperature decreases, each by 2.3 C.
Demand is expected to increase in Portugal, Italy, Great Britain and the Netherlands and to decrease in Spain, Germany and Belgium for the week of October 23. In France, demand is expected to remain similar.

European electricity markets
In the week of October 16, prices in the main European electricity markets remained generally stable, with a certain upward trend compared to the previous week in most cases. However, in the MIBEL market of Spain and Portugal, prices fell by 37% and 38%, respectively. In the EPEX SPOT market of France, a slight decline of 1.2% was also registered. On the other hand, the largest percentage price rise, 141%, was reached in the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries, while the smallest increase, 2.7%, was registered in the IPEX market of Italy. In the remaining markets, prices increased between 3.7% in the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium and 21% in the EPEX SPOT market of Germany.
In the third week of October, weekly averages were below €95 ($101.4)/MWh in most of the analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the British and Italian markets, where prices were €103.08/MWh and €149.23/MWh, respectively. In contrast, the lowest average price, €22.29/MWh, was reached in the Nordic market. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €77.98/MWh in the Portuguese market to €94.45/MWh in the German market.
On October 16, the highest hourly prices in the week were registered in most of the analyzed European electricity markets. On that day, the TTF gas price in the spot market was the highest in the third week of October, exceeding €50/MWh. A price of €240.00/MWh was reached in the German, Belgian, French, Italian and Dutch markets from 19:00 to 20:00. This price was the highest since Aug. 24 in the French and Italian markets. The highest price since January was recorded in the N2EX market of the United Kingdom, on Oct. 16, from 19:00 to 20:00, and was £241.19/MWh. At that time on the same day, the highest price since January was registered in the Spanish market, which was €220.00/MWh.
Peak prices were not as high in Portuguese and Nordic markets. The highest prices were reached on Monday, Oct. 23. In the Portuguese market, a price of €215.02/MWh was registered from 20:00 to 21:00 – the highest price since the end of January. In the Nordic market, from 8:00 to 9:00, a price of €87.66/MWh was reached, the highest price since the end of June in this market.
During the week of October 16, the rise in the average price of gas, the increase in demand in most markets and the general decline in solar energy production led to higher prices in the European electricity markets. Wind energy production fell in the German market, contributing to the price increase in this market. On the other hand, the production with this technology increased considerably on the Iberian Peninsula and in France, leading to lower prices in the MIBEL and French markets.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the fourth week of October prices in most analyzed European electricity markets might increase. This could be influenced by lower wind energy production and higher demand in most markets.

Brent, fuels and CO2
In the third week of October, Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market registered their weekly minimum settlement price, $89.65/bbl, on Monday, Oct. 16. This price was 1.7% higher than the previous Monday. Subsequently, prices increased and by Wednesday settlement prices exceeded $90/bbl. The weekly maximum settlement price, $92.38/bbl, was reached on Thursday, Oct. 19. This price was 7.4% higher than the previous Thursday.
At the beginning of the third week of October, news of a possible lifting of sanctions on Venezuelan oil pushed Brent oil futures prices lower. But concerns about possible supply disruptions related to instability in the Middle East continued to exert an upward influence on prices.
As for settlement prices of TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, on Monday, October 16, the weekly minimum settlement price, €48.47/MWh, was reached. But this price was 10% higher than the previous Monday. As a result, prices increased. The weekly maximum settlement price, €51.11/MWh, was reached on Friday, Oct. 20. However, this price was 5.3% lower than that of the previous Friday, which had been the highest since mid‑February.
In the third week of October, supply concerns related to instability in the Middle East continued, causing settlement prices of these futures to remain above €48/MWh. However, forecasts of mild temperatures, abundant supply and high levels of European stocks allowed settlement prices to remain below the maximum price reached in the previous week.
As for settlement prices of CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, during the third week of October, they registered a downward trend. The weekly maximum settlement price, €83.35/t, was reached on Monday, October 16, and it was 2.0% higher than on the previous Monday. However, as a result of the declines registered during the week, the weekly minimum settlement price, €81.41/t, was registered on Friday, October 20. This price was 5.3% lower than on the same day of the previous week.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/24/acquiring-more-accurate-measurements-with-ventilation-and-heating/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 24, 2023",Acquiring more accurate measurements with ventilation and heating,"To get the most out of a radiometer, pyranometer, pyrgeometer, and UV sensor, their optical domes need to be clean and dry. Water droplets can scatter incoming photons, while snow or dust blocks light on its way to the detector.
To ensure a constant measuring quality, Kipp & Zonen ─ a brand of OTT HydroMet since 2017 ─ had started early to develop systems that ventilate and heat their measuring instruments.
Now, based on 30+ years of experience, OTT HydroMet manufactures the Kipp & Zonen CVF4 ventilation unit. The unit ─ which can be easily mounted on all Kipp & Zonen pyrgeometers, ultraviolet radiometers, and CMP/SMP pyranometers ─ creates a steady air flow that keeps the quartz or glass dome clean from dust, dew, rain, and snow. The integrated heater prevents dew formation, disperses precipitation, and melts frost, ice, or snow on the dome.
The CVF4 unit has an operational temperature range of 20 to +70 °C and consumes 5 W continuous power for ventilation and 5.5 W power for heating when necessary. The tachometer output provides a 5 Volt signal that can be connected to a data logger to monitor the proper operation of the CVF4.
Proven under harsh conditions
CVF4 ventilation units are already being used globally, especially for stations within the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), in colder regions with a lot of dew or precipitation ─ such as the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), which already uses the CVF4 and its predecessor models ─ and in dusty areas.
“The Kipp & Zonen ventilators have proved to be reliable and weather-resistant and are adequate to keep frost and snow away,” says Olli Mantikka, solar technician at the FMI. “All in all, I am very pleased with the long-term performance of the units.”
In very cold regions, external ventilation units remain the best solution to keep the radiometer domes clean. In rather moderate climates, there is another option: A new generation of pyranometers provides integrated heating that melts snow and evaporates dew on the dome. One of them is the new Kipp & Zonen SMP12, which combines solid-state dome heating, with no moving parts, and best-in-class surge protection. It also features internal sensors for the monitoring of the tilt angle and humidity.

Joop Mes, Senior Scientist at OTT HydroMet, says, “The SMP12 fulfills all the requirements stated in the international standard for solar irradiance monitoring, ISO 9060:2018. It is a Class A pyranometer, spectrally flat, and has a fast response time of less than 0.5 seconds.”
This is relevant for PV plants, Mes says, because “If the clouds move quickly and cast shadow on the PV modules, fast response pyranometers can give nearly real-time irradiance information to reliably determine the performance ratio. Traditional pyranometers need about five seconds to respond.”
In the end, only clean domes give reliable readings. The choice between external ventilation units and pyranometers with integrated heating depends on the actual application and region.

Under the terms of the agreement, VedantaESS will acquire and deploy 525 MWh of energy storage vessels (ESV) from EnerVenue over the next three years.
The master supply agreement with VedantaESS provides for the annual delivery of energy storage by EnerVenue, with 75 MWh in 2024, 150 MWh in 2025 and 300 MWh in 2026.
VedantaESS will use EnerVenue's storage systems to meet Brazil's growing demand for clean energy, including through distributed generation, isolated microgrids and commercial, industrial and utility scale applications.
The São Paulo-based company provides customers with energy storage project design and management, including energy storage management software, battery solution assembly, installation services, technical support and other products.
“At VedantaESS, our mission is to solve the significant renewable energy challenges facing Brazil by strategically applying innovative yet proven technologies,” said Richard Phillips, president of VedantaESS. “With their unique metal-hydrogen batteries, EnerVenue solutions provide enormous longevity, reliability, safety, savings and, most importantly, flexibility. ESVs will be valuable to our customers in each of the applications we work with. We are proud to be the first organization to partner with EnerVenue in South America and look forward to bringing the benefits of this supply agreement to our customers.”
The batteries reportedly have a 30-year, 30,000-cycle lifespan, with the manufacturer offering a 20-year/20,000-cycle warranty that guarantees at least 88% battery capacity remaining after that period.
EnerVenue claims its nickel-hydrogen battery technology can operate at temperatures between -40 C and 60 C. It can also provide the promised cycles without degradation and at varying rates, for a wide range of fast and slow charging capabilities.
The battery has an efficiency ranging from 80% to 90%, depending on the cycle rate, and its energy density per square foot is equal to, or better than lithium-ion batteries, according to the company.
The nickel-hydrogen battery technology is particularly good in remote and harsh conditions with operational temperatures ranging between -40 C to 60 C, as demonstrated by its use in NASA satellites.

Power producers have until Oct. 31 to submit proposals relating to the development, financing, construction operation and management of the project.
According to the tender document, the procurement exercise is open to citizen-owned companies and non-citizen-owned companies. However, non-citizen-owned applicants must subcontract at least 40% of the work to citizen-owned companies.
The announcement does not include information about technical requirements for construction.
Botswana, a country deriving most of its energy from coal-fired power plants, aims to deploy large-scale PV through several tenders. In addition to this, the Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security (MMGE) launched a net-metering scheme for rooftop PV systems in late 2020.
The landlocked country recorded an installed solar PV capacity of 6 MW at the end of 2022, according to the most recent estimates published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

We are in the midst of an energy technology revolution with major economic and ecological implications. So, what is the scale we are dealing with now and in the near future?
This is a blog in two parts: The first part, which you are reading today, analyzes the present. The second looks into the future.
According to a projection by BloombergNEF, 392 GW of photovoltaics will be added in 2023. This is more capacity than all worldwide nuclear power plants in operation in 2022, which was 371 GW cumulatively.
 

 
There are approximately 1,000 average coal-fired power plant units. The global average is 375 MW per unit. The impact of these power plants on climate change can already be surmised. It is important to note the comparison is flawed because of the different full load hours, but more on that later.
Even though these figures are impressive, they are only a snapshot. There will probably be installation figures of 1,000 GW per year – meaning 1 TW per year – before the end of this decade, and several TW per year installed in the next decade. That is what the second part of this blog will be about.
Part I of Photovoltaics-Energy Revolution – Interim Status 2023
In 1998, 57 MW of photovoltaic capacity was installed worldwide. Today, that corresponds to the output of a medium-sized solar park. At around 390 GW, annual capacity additions have increased seven thousandfold since then. The power of photovoltaics has grown in volume worldwide. We can therefore rightly speak of power photovoltaics.
Roughly 390 GW per year corresponds to a photovoltaic addition of over one GW every day. By comparison, 2004 was the first year where more than 1 GW of photovoltaic capacity was added. In 2010 this volume was added in less than a month and in 2015 it was less than every week.
 
 
The magnitude of solar photovoltaics is already considerable. The above table shows this year's installed photovoltaic capacity is greater than the total nuclear power plant capacity. That metric is equivalent to about 1,000 average coal-fired power plant units.
But how does it look if we compare generation instead of output?
A photovoltaic plant is known to have significantly lower full load hours than coal-fired – and especially nuclear – power plants. In international 100 percent studies, the number of full load hours for photovoltaic plants averages 1570.
The 390 GW of photovoltaic capacity that will be added in 2023 will generate as much electricity as about 77 nuclear power plants of the 1000-megawatt class. It will also generate roughly 370 of the 375 MW coal-fired power plant units, taking into account lower full-load hours.
 

 
One GW per day is equivalent to the power generation capacity of a typical 1,000 MW nuclear power plant. It is also equivalent to two-and-a-half coal-fired power plant units, with the global average being 375 MW per unit.
So, for this year, new solar power will be added as a coal-fired power plant unit produces – plus the power production of a nuclear power plant every few days.
Next year there will be more installed every day, and in 2025 even more. Those amounts will be added on top of the 2023 installed.
The expansion of photovoltaics has reached a scale that is changing the energy industry. Naturally, it is impacting the use of fossil fuels. Photovoltaics is already a significant climate protection technology with upside potential.
We will then see what this potential resembles in the second part of the blog, which will also explore how solar power can be used at night.

The solar strategy of French power producer Unite, adopted in 2020, is starting to bear fruit. The developer has started to build a 10 MW solar project on a pheasant farm in Brinon-sur-Sauldre, in France's Centre-Val-de-Loire region.
The project, developed in just five months and awarded a tender by the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) in September 2022, is scheduled to commence operations in July 2024, generating 11 GWh of electricity per year.
“The objective was to create a complete cover to prevent the penetration of migratory birds which could bring diseases,” said Stéphane Maureau, associate general director of Unite, in an interview with pv magazine France. “This hangar is partly covered by photovoltaic frames and the rest with conventional nets.”
The structures and solar module spacing for the 10-hectare deployment are customized to meet the specific requirements of breeder Régis Clément.
“The sun/shade ratio has also been optimized to improve animal comfort depending on the season,” said Maureau, noting that the farmer will pay for the electricity between €95 ($101.4)/MWh and €105/MWh.
Unite originally specialized in the development of small hydraulic power plants. “This activity gives us a valuable territorial anchor because we have been present for decades in the regions and local residents know us,” said Maureau. “However, given the increasingly significant constraints imposed on projects on French rivers, we have decided to continue our activity in small hydroelectricity, but at a less sustained pace. We will build one power plant per year, so as not to lose our know-how, and at the same time, we are making a real change of scale in solar.”
The company has secured land for at least 800 MW/year with over 60 solar projects in development, totaling 1.2 GW, including 150 MW with building permits.
“We work on large installations of 20 MW to 30 MW on average on the ground or in buildings,” specified Maureau.
The company, which owns 47 hydraulic power plants, 5 wind farms, and 16 solar installations, aims to reach 1 GW of PV capacity by 2027, with an annual growth target of approximately 800 MW.

Two inverter suppliers, Enphase and SolarEdge, dominate the US rooftop solar market. The former supplies microinverters, while the latter provides string inverters tied to module-level power optimizers.
Together, the two represent about 90% of the US market. Roth Capital Partners said in a recent industry note that Enphase holds about 50% of the market, while SolarEdge represents about 40% to 45%.
Residential solar is currently in a wounded state, with SolarEdge and Enphase stocks down as much as 70% from their highs in December 2022. High interest rates and changes to solar export compensation rates have caused a significant pullback in demand for new installations.
Phil Shen, managing director of Roth Capital Partners, has warned that these forces could continue to weigh on residential solar through 2024. He forecasts a 12% market contraction nationwide in 2024. This could spell doom for the share prices of high-growth companies like Enphase and SolarEdge.
Roth Capital Partners has also warned that Tesla might make a move to gobble up some market share in the rooftop solar inverter space. It is currently a major supplier of home batteries and despite a 48% pullback in its rooftop solar business, it is a significant player in residential solar.

For this purpose, ETIP PV is running an open consultation and is inviting all PV experts from both research and industry to fill in a 15-minute survey. The survey results would help us update the SRIA and make it even more relevant for the entire European PV R&D sector.
As already discussed in one of our previous articles, the SRIA focuses on five core challenges of European research and innovation:
When filling in the survey, you can choose to provide feedback for one or more of these challenges, depending on what your expertise is. You also have the chance to state your opinion on whether these challenges adequately encompass the main issues for R&I in the PV sector; or, if new topics should be considered and possibly included as well.
Are you a member of an EU-based research center and you participate in or are funded by HORIZON calls? Are you a member of an EU-based PV-related company? Or, are you interested in the resurgence of the European PV supply and value chain?
Then the SRIA is a document you should be familiar with as it officially addresses the European Commission. Namely, by publishing the SRIA, ETIP PV is directly advising the European Commission as an independent and neutral body of experts on the topic of PV research and innovation. Therefore, by sharing your valuable input with us, you directly get the chance to shape the new SRIA with us and thus, possibly influence any new and upcoming HORIZON calls, financing measures, and topics of high interest and focus in the EU.
The survey asks for no personal information, other than an active e-mail address and the name of an organization so that we can confirm that you are (somewhat) connected to PV in general. If you wish, you can save a backup of your answers on your local computer. The consultation is open until November 30.
