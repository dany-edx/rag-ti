The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (Masen) has published a list of prequalified bidders for a tender for the construction of the Noor Midelt 2 power plant. Masen launched the tender in July 2020.
The facility, planned for the Drâa-Tafilalet region in northeastern Morocco, will have 400 MW of capacity. It will include a battery, with two hours of storage.
The list includes 24 bidders, such as Spanish group Cobra Instalaciones Y Servicios, S.A., a consortium of French energy giant EDF and UAE-based Masdar, and Italian energy company Enel with Taqa Morocco. Other bidders are a consortium of Spanish utility Iberdrola, China’s Dongfang Electric International Corp., and Morocco-based Gaia Project SARL, and a group including Saudi energy company ACWA Power, Belgium-based International Power SA, and Morocco-based Nareva Holding SA.
The Noor Midelt 1 plant, an 800 MW solar plant combining CSP and PV with 5 hours of storage capacity, is to be built and operated by EDF Renewables (35%), Abu Dhabi Future Energy CO (30%), Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) (25%) and Green Of Africa (10%).
Local media outlets report that the site is behind schedule. Combining PV and CSP optimizes the project’s levelized cost of energy (LCOE), around 0.68 Moroccan dirhams ($0.069) per kWg, according to a figure from Masen for the first phase Noor Midelt 1.

Bosch says it is preparing to showcase new hydrogen-related products during its upcoming Tech Day. The German company is developing technologies for the production, compression, storage, and use of hydrogen. It says its main manufacturing site in Feuerbach, Germany, will produce fuel-cell power modules (FCPM) from July. The FCPM weighs more than 500 kilograms, has a surface area of approximately 1.5 square meters, and a total output exceeding 200 kW. Bosch will also unveil a water treatment system, scheduled for launch in 2024. Stefan Hartung, chairman of the Bosch board of management, noted the importance of ultra-pure water for green hydrogen production and highlighted the company's special-purpose systems for water treatment in remote areas.
HH2E and Foresight Group have completed funding for the green hydrogen production site in Lubmin, Germany, with construction expected to be finished by mid-2025. The project aims for an initial capacity of 100 MW, scalable to more than 1 GW by 2030. HydrogenOne and Foresight signed a final agreement in May to invest in HH2E, which acquired 120 MW capacity of electrolysis equipment from Nel in March. 
FDE says that the HECO2-Plasmalyse Hybride consortium, including FDE, has been selected to promote decarbonated hydrogen usage in Belgium. The consortium aims to build a clean hydrogen production pilot project using Hybrid Plasmalysis technology. The ultimate goal is to establish a plant producing 15,000 tons of hydrogen and 45,000 tons of solid carbon materials. FDE also recently announced the discovery of natural hydrogen in one of the drilled wells, with significant hydrogen concentrations in the Carboniferous formations of the Lorraine mining basin. In May, FDE announced the discovery of natural hydrogen (white hydrogen) in one a previously drilled well.
UK Minister for Energy Efficiency and Green Finance Martin Callanan has confirmed that the hydrogen village trial in Whitby will not proceed due to lack of local support. Discussions are ongoing with NGN regarding the potential trial in Redcar. The rejected project aimed to transition Whitby to hydrogen by 2025, while Redcar remains the sole hydrogen village trial location in the United Kingdom, facilitated by the NGN gas network. Gas distribution network Cadent and British Gas proposed the project in Cheshire, offering residents the choice to participate. The decision raised criticism, with differing opinions on the transition from fossil fuels. Callanan, a Conservative politician, has been vocal in his opposition to the Labour Party's no-fossil-fuel policies.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/11/fully-printed-carbon-electrode-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-19-2-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JULY 11, 2023",Fully printed carbon electrode perovskite solar cell achieves 19.2% efficiency,"Researchers in Germany have sought to improve the performance of carbon electrode perovskite solar cells through a hole-transporting bilayer made of organic semiconductors, instead of a conventional hole transport layer (HTL), which they said is able to enhance their fill factor and open-circuit voltage.
They explained that replacing costly gold, silver, and copper with carbon in perovskite solar cells typically causes efficiency losses and stability issues compared to benchmark devices. “For the printable cells, we aim at eventually transferring this technology into a roll-to-roll fabrication line,” Tian Du, corresponding co-author told pv magazine, noting that the next steps on the path to commercialization are to fabricate a mini solar module on glass substrates, then a mini solar module on flexible substrate, and then transfer to roll-to-roll fabrication.
The German team built the cell with a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), the perovskite absorber, the hole-transporting bilayer (HTbl), and the carbon contact. “The HTbL configuration forms an energy cascade at the interface, with the outer HTL 2 reinforcing Ohmic contact with the carbon, whereas the inner HTL 1 reduces surface
recombination of the perovskite,” it explained.
For the absorber, they used a  mix cation perovskite known as (FAPbI3)0.93 (MAPbBr 3)0.07. They applied the two layers in sequential blade coating which they said can maximize hole injection/extraction at the electrode interface while minimizing surface recombination of perovskite layers.
They tested the device under standard illumination conditions and found it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V, a short-circuit current of 23.7 A, and a fill factor of 76%. For comparison, a reference cell with a single hole transport layer reached an efficiency of 17.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.06 V, a short-circuit current of 23.3 A, and a fill factor of 76%.
The cell based on the bilayer also showed stable operation of 2,500 h at 65 C in a nitrogen environment.
The cell is described in the study “Efficient, stable, and fully printed carbon-electrode perovskite solar cells enabled by hole-transporting bilayers,” published in Joule. The research team comprises academics from the Institute of Materials for Electronics and Energy Technology (i-MEET) and the Institute of Micro- and Nanostructure Research & Center for Nanoanalysis and Electron Microscopy (CENEM).
“Our results highlight that carbon electrodes can significantly enhance the intrinsic stability of perovskite solar cell without dedicated interfacial modifications,” they concluded.

ETIP PV experts are organized into six working groups: 1. Levelized Cost of Electricity & Competitiveness; 2. Integrated Photovoltaics; 3. Digital PV Systems & Grid; 4. PV Industry; 5. Reliability & Circularity; and 6. Social PV.
The ETIP PV is supported by a Secretariat, with shared responsibilities between SolarPower Europe and WIP Renewable Energies, funded by the European Union to enable support for the European Commission in its efforts to reach its climate and energy-policy targets. There are several other ETIPs: for example, for Wind or for Smart Networks for the Energy Transition.
The six ETIP PV working groups are actively engaged in continually sharing their findings in valuable publications for the European Commission and the wider PV community. Recent highlights of such publications are the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Photovoltaics (SRIA PV) published in 2022 in collaboration with the European Energy Research Alliance on Photovoltaics (EERA PV) or the most recent white paper on Manufacturing in Europe: understanding the value chain for a successful industrial policy.
In addition to publishing and advising the European Commission, the ETIP PV is synergistically collaborating with the newly founded European Solar Industry Alliance, which aims to enable the EU to achieve its target of 30 GW of local annual PV manufacturing capacity by 2025. The ETIP PV is also engaged in connecting the PV and energy policymakers, industrial, and academic research via outreach and communication through various events and conferences.
For instance, this year’s ETIP PV conference “PV Innovation: Assuring Europe's Energy Independent Future with Photovoltaics” discussed how policy, supply chain factors, research and innovation, international trade, economic growth, and environmental and climate concerns can deliver the resurgence of a European solar supply chain. It welcomed esteemed speakers from the European Commission, Enel Green Power, Wacker Chemie, Meyer Burger, Helmholtz Center Berlin, Fraunhofer ISE, CARBON, LONGi, McKinsey, and Oxford PV, among others.
Additionally, during the 2023 Intersolar conference and exposition in Munich, ETIP PV organized two side events – the first one on the challenges and targets of the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on PV and the second one on varying integrated-PV applications.
The next outreach activities of the ETIP PV are planned for the EU-PVSEC conference from 18th to 22nd of September in Lisbon, covering hot topics like digital PV or updates on levelized cost of PV electricity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/11/unify-data-to-reduce-complexity/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JULY 11, 2023",Unify data to reduce complexity,"The solar industry is growing at all stages along the supply chain. One of the key challenges of efficient production during an era of rapid growth is ever-increasing complexity. Renewables asset operators’ jobs become more complex as teams are required to manage a variety of disparate facilities, which use a wide array of software and interfaces.
Simultaneously, interaction with the grid and maintaining stability becomes more complex as providers must find ways to ensure the reliable operation of numerous assets – sometimes separated by great distances – with limited data at their disposal.
Moreover, regulation becomes stricter with each passing year, evidenced by recent changes in the United States such as the upcoming mandatory requirement for reporting of generation performance data to North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) through the Generating Availability-Data System (GADS), starting in January.
Fortunately, asset monitoring software designed specifically for the renewable energy industry makes it easier for producers to aggregate, monitor, and manage their assets so they can drive significant improvements in performance and reliability. The best of these solutions can unify all assets into a single system, provide improved access to data, and help producers improve management of their operations across the life cycle of a single asset or an entire fleet.
Renewable power generators have the option to buy PV equipment from a wide array of providers. Each component from a different supplier will come with its own original equipment manufacturer (OEM) control system and asset management application, with each delivering unique features and limitations. If an organization later decides to purchase a different brand, to extend software to comply with new grid requirements, or to build in a battery solution as part of a replacement or expansion project, all the new assets will have their own OEM software and maintenance teams will see an increase in complexity.
Control and asset management systems from a variety of manufacturers will typically use entirely different interfaces and dashboards. Operators will need to either switch among multiple applications to manage their assets, or they must find a way to create a complex interface that will connect two or more diverse equipment brands into one display.
The complexity continues to expand when companies build out their renewable energy portfolios, adding other sources of power. Operators and technicians will need to be trained on several interfaces and they will have to move between each and interpret data presented in different formats.
Comprehensive asset and energy management software can help teams circumvent such complexity issues by integrating many different types of systems across a fleet. The most advanced solutions are vendor independent, with the ability to manage assets from any manufacturer.
With an asset management platform designed specifically for renewable power production, teams can more easily combine multiple fleets of assets so they can be monitored from a single central surveillance or remote operation control center. These systems can also be operated alongside batteries and other assets, using a single dashboard. Built-in NERC GADS reporting can also be integrated into asset management software.
One of the key drawbacks of the software that ships with most solar components is that it is extremely limited by design. Most manufacturers are protective of the data their products deliver and, as a result, they limit user access to many data sources. For operations teams to effectively support their grids and maximize production, however, staff need access to far more information than is available via most OEM-supplied tools.
For example, operations and maintenance teams may want to access temperature readings from installed modules. If they are also using battery storage, they will want additional access to temperature data for those assets as well but, with standard OEM management tools, essential data is often siloed and unavailable.
Missing these and other critical data means not having full visibility of operations, with resulting decreases in reliability and uptime. When a team cannot see the data used to illustrate how its assets are operating, it is likely to miss problems that require a wider spectrum of data for identification. Such teams will also not be able to track and trend patterns so they can isolate and identify recurring issues.
A comprehensive renewable energy-specific asset management platform can easily provide 10 times to 50 times the parameters available from typical OEM software, and these parameters are critical for monitoring fluctuations in a system. Whether for supporting the grid to manage active power, reactive power, and frequency control – or improving reserves to ensure customers do not experience blackouts – operators need access to deep and reliable data.
Asset monitoring technology for renewables should be operational out of the box and capable of being maintained independently by a facility’s own staff. This should reduce the on-site engineering required with any new assets, each of which will be visible in preconfigured dashboards once connected.
Users should also be able to customize systems, if desired, adding new graphs and creating dashboard elements to highlight key information and make comparisons. For example, if an organization with three solar plants has one facility with sensor problems, it can compare that site’s operation against properly functioning plants to identify the trigger for those issues.
In addition, key alarms can be added to a custom dashboard designed to help sites meet specific goals. Some plants eliminate unused dashboards, replacing them with tools displaying critical information, such as emergency call numbers.
Trending asset performance can also enable technical teams to more easily intervene when assets are trending toward failure, and to make changes to optimize operations across a facility. Teams can better schedule maintenance and changes, ultimately lowering lifetime maintenance costs and driving higher earnings from production across a system's lifecycle.

The factory, located in Alxa Right Banner, is expected to reach a capacity of 5 million metric tons (MT) by the end of this year, accounting for approximately 13.8% of China's total soda ash production. Prior to the factory's opening, China's soda ash production stood at around 31 million MT.
“Prior to the start-up of this new plant about 94% of the soda ash capacity in China was synthetic,” Marguerite Morrin, Research and Analysis Director at OPIS' Chemical Market Analytics division told pv magazine. “Natural soda ash production, which is via a mining process, is typically much lower cost than synthetic.”
Inner Mongolia Berun Group has invested $2 billion in the new facility and plans to allocate an additional $3 billion to expand its capacity to 7.8 million MT in the future.
According to Morrin, the new factory could contribute to a decrease in soda ash and PV glass prices.
“Soda ash prices had already started declining prior to the factory's commissioning, but this increased capacity may drive prices even lower,” she said.
Morrin explained that the average production cost for natural soda ash in the United States, where most natural production occurs, is approximately $100/MT.
“Natural production costs in China should be comparable, if not slightly lower,” she noted.

They said that the novelty of their approach consists in analyzing the characteristic of radiation and energy balance under different synoptic conditions for floating PV power plants, which previous research had reportedly neglected. “Our study fills this research gap maybe to amend the accuracy of solar radiation prediction due to our paper to consider the impact of weather condition on solar radiation,” they explained.
The trial was conducted at the Tongwei Huantai 10 MW Fishery Complementary Photovoltaic Demonstration Base in Yangzhong, a city in the Jiangsu Province of Eastern China. Two flux observation towers – one located inside (FPV) and one outside (REF) the floating PV power plant – collected data on three days with differing meteorological conditions, capturing and comparing the changes of radiation and energy flux for the two sites.
According to the researchers, the impact of the floating array on the sensible heat flux is 1.5 times compared to that of the natural lake, which they said means that solar radiation plays a decisive role in the change process of the sensible heat flux. They found, in fact, that the contribution of the impact of the solar radiation on the FPV site was 98%, while for the REF site, the contribution of the impact was 77%.
The data showed that the driving force of sensible heat flux on the floating PV system site was regulated by the temperature of the solar panels, while the driving force of the latent heat flux – under both sunny and cloudy conditions – was the wind speed multiplied by the water-air vapor pressure deficit.
“Overall, the latent heat flux (LE) in the two sites was relatively stable, and the sensible heat flux (H) in the FPV site has more obvious fluctuations than that of the REF site when there is solar radiation,” the report noted. “This phenomenon was explained by the air temperature in the FPV site rising faster due to the PV panel warming effect with obtaining the solar than the air temperature in the REF site.”
Because PV arrays on a lake create a new underlying surface, the group established that the difference in radiation on these covered surfaces results from the effects of aerosol, water vapor, terrain, and weather conditions on sunlight.
The impacts of the floating system were also found to be related to the scale of the power plant.“The effects of utility-scale floating PV power plants on the radiation and energy flux need to be further researched,” the researchers concluded.
Their findings are available in the report “Effects of fishery complementary photovoltaic power plant on radiation, energy flux and driving forces under different synoptic conditions,” published in Scientific Reports.

Excess energy from Western Australia’s booming rooftop solar sector will be used to help households struggling with cost-of-living increases with the state government unveiling a new Community Energy program that will provide free electricity to Synergy customers during off-peak times.
The Western Australian government said the new scheme will provide free electricity throughout the day to Synergy customers who are experiencing ongoing financial hardship and are being case managed by the state-owned utility.
Western Australian Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the program will provide eligible households with 10 units of free electricity – which is about 75% of an average household’s daily usage – in off-peak periods. Johnston said the electricity will come from excess power generated by rooftop solar systems connected to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), the state’s main grid.
More than 400,000 Western Australian homes and businesses, about 36% of customers, now have PV systems connected to the SWIS and collectively rooftop solar is the largest generator in the state.
Johnston said the new scheme will help to address the new generation dynamic and stabilize the grid by incentivizing customers to shift their electricity consumption away from evening peak demand periods to the middle of the day when solar generation is high and household usage is traditionally low.
“The Community Energy product, introduced by Synergy, offers 10 units of electricity at no cost during the day to those on the case management program,” he said. “This will bring the cost of electricity down for those experiencing financial hardship while also making use of the energy being generated by solar panels during the day.”
Johnston said the new program also provides households doing it tough with an alternative to installing solar panels, giving more Western Australians access to the benefits of cheaper electricity during the day.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
To be eligible for the program, financial hardship customers must have an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) meter and not have solar panels installed on their property. It is estimated about 9,100 Synergy customers are currently eligible.
The state government has forecast the scheme will save participants between AUD 200 ($137.80) to AUD 500 on their electricity bills a year.

The project will be located in Bedfordshire, England.
Swiss consultancy Pexapark helped DIF Capital Partners in structuring the deal.
“Working with DIF, the seller within the agreement, Pexapark’s PPA Transaction advisory team was able to draw on the quantitative expertise of its Storage and Flexibility Desk to analyze expected revenues and risk exposure,” Pexapark said in a statemenr. “This enabled Pexapark to determine an optimal PPA structure that encompasses both the power generation and storage aspects of the project.”
Pexapark did not specify a time frame for the project construction or disclose the financial terms of the deal.
“We anticipate that this deal will be the first of many, representing a turning point for the European sector in the deployment of bankable solar hybrid projects,” said Jack Rankin, Pexapark's PPA transaction advisory regional lead for Great Britain and Ireland. “In the long run, agreements like this will be essential for integrating high shares of intermittent renewable energy generation into the grid.”
DIF Capital Partners said in mid-June that it had reached a close on financing q co-located solar and battery storage portfolio in the United Kingdom. The portfolio consists of seven ready-to-build sites with 380 MW of solar capacity and 340 MW of storage capacity.
“The first two projects in the portfolio have commenced construction, with an expectation that all projects will be operational between 2024 and 2025,” the fund said at the time.
The United Kingdom requires grid-stabilization services provided by BESS due to its weaker interconnections compared to continental Europe. Utility-scale projects have increased in recent years, expanding the range of services that large batteries can offer in this deregulated market.
According to the National Grid, the United Kingdom may need up to 50 GW of storage capacity by 2050 to achieve its net-zero carbon emissions goal.
In April, RenewableUK reported that the total pipeline of battery projects in the country has doubled from 16.1 GW to 32.1 GW. Operational battery storage capacity has grown by 45% to 1.6 GW, and the capacity of projects under construction has more than doubled to 1.4 GW. Additionally, 10.4 GW has been approved, while 7.7 GW is in the planning system.

The US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) has issued its latest Electric Power Monthly update, which provides data through the end of April. The update reveals that solar generation rose by 16.6% from April of the previous year, accounting for just over 7% of total US electricity generated that month, up from 6% in 2022.

Solar has produced 5% of all electricity so far this year. Comparing data for the whole year through April, solar energy production has seen a 14.2% uptick.
Solar growth rates in 2023 are projected to be less robust than in prior years, due to a decline in total capacity deployment in 2022. Total solar power deployed in 2022 was down 16% versus 2021, at 20.2 GW. With the dip in deployment in 2022, the total installed solar capacity in the United States rose to 141 GW by year’s end, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie Renewables & Power, an increase of just over 16.9%.

The technology holds particular significance for land-scarce countries, including numerous Southeast Asian island nations, as they seek to transition to emission-free economies.
NREL collaborated with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Development Mission for Asia to assess the technical potential of floating PV throughout the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has set a goal of achieving 35% installed capacity from renewable energy sources by 2025.
NREL has assessed the technical potential of floating photovoltaics (FPV) in 10 ASEAN countries, using a solar data explorer tool.
“[Floating PV] arrays are situated on water bodies such as lakes, reservoirs, or water treatment ponds, where they can be installed alone or in combination with hydropower dams,” said NREL.  
NREL said floating PV is particularly attractive in locations where hydropower infrastructure is planned or already in place and increased frequency or severity of drought may raise pose reliability concerns for hydropower production. Southeast Asia is particularly exposed to this hydropower underproduction risk as it has a strong network of established facilities.
“Additionally, much of the region is covered by rainforest ecosystems,” said Evan Rosenlieb, a geospatial data scientist for NREL. “Siting PV on water can be a way to increase renewable energy generation without deforestation.” 
Southeast Asia is also a hotbed for the growing practice of aquaculture, or raising fish, crustaceans, and aquatic plants in a controlled water body. These sites are targeted as another potential match for floating PV. 
“This emerging combination of aquaculture and photovoltaics, commonly referred to as AquaPV, can allow countries to co-locate energy and food production on existing natural or artificially created water bodies while minimizing the overall environmental impact of both sectors,” said Prateek Joshi, NREL energy engineer.
Joshi and the NREL team said aquaculture and solar may help boost food security in the region, offering dedicated, resilient energy production to critical food sources.
The data accompanying the report are publicly available as a resource for developers interested in learning more about the technical and economic potential of floating PV in the region.
“This data will lead to more discussions and can inform decisions on the potential role of [floating PV] in the region. It wouldn’t have been possible without all the existing work of previous [floating PV] studies and previous RE Data Explorer tool development,” Sika Gadzanku, the NREL energy technology and policy researcher.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/11/iron-chromium-redox-flow-battery-with-high-energy-density/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 11, 2023",Iron-chromium redox flow battery with high energy density,"An international research team has developed a new concept for redox flow batteries that uses iron and chromium ore for redox chemistry.
“We are in the preliminary stages of exploring the economic aspect of these batteries,” the research's lead author, Hyun-Wook Lee, told pv magazine. “While we have not yet carried out a thorough levelized cost of storage (LCOS) estimation, our early findings point towards potential cost-competitiveness, especially given the environmentally friendly nature of our batteries and their promising performance metrics.”
The battery relies on a chromium-based negative electrolyte, or negolyte, and strong-field cyanide ligands, which the scientists claim can mitigate the Jahn–Teller effect. The latter is a geometric distortion of a non-linear molecular system that reduces its symmetry and energy and, in redox flow batteries, reduces redox potential, stability, and rapid kinetics.
Suppressing the undesirable decomposition of the chromium(II) chloride Cr(II) complex used in the battery is the crucial step for avoiding these issues during the electrochemical cycling of redox flow batteries, thus facilitating a stable and fast redox reaction.
The battery also utilizes a negolyte based on hexacyanometalate, an inorganic compound with the formula Cr(CN)6. “The reliable electrochemical properties of Cr(CN)6 are unique because of its low redox potential of −1.15 V,” the group explained. The electrolyte was based on sodium cyanide (NaCN), which is claimed to offer excellent electrochemical stability, especially against very reductive potentials, combined with high solubility in water.
Through a series of thermodynamic density-functional theory (DFT) simulations, the researchers found that the negolyte coordinates well with the strong-field ligands used for the battery and is able to reduce the Jahn–Teller effect.
The proposed battery configuration may achieve a stable lifetime of 500 cycles and a high-energy density of 38.6 Wh L−1, according to the research group.
“This hexacyanometalate-based redox flow battery is capable of reversible redox reactions with relatively high potential as an aqueous system taking advantage of the low potential of Cr(CN)6 and improved cycling performance at high current densities,” it stated. “In comparison to conventional and other flow batteries, this cell configuration has superior properties in terms of the full-cell potential and cycling performance.”
The new battery concept is presented in the study “Full-Hexacyanometallate Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries Exceeding 1.5 V in an Aqueous Solution,” published in Advanced Energy Materials. The research group includes scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in South Korea.
