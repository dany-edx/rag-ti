Zinc-ion, however, still has the potential for good energy storage performance out of cheap, abundant materials. And at industrial level, could potentially use many of the manufacturing processes already developed for lithium-ion batteries – making them far easier than other materials to scale up. This has been enough to keep scientists interested in working on zinc-ion battery chemistry, and the latest discovery from a group led by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia (KAUST), could open up several new doorways for them.
Since a lot of these challenges stem from side reactions involving water-based electrolytes, the group worked with a very high salt concentration, limiting the number of ‘free’ water molecules available to the unwanted reactions. The group designed an electrolyte based on zinc salts mixed with a highly concentrated sodium salt, which serves to both suppress reactions with water and increase conductivity, since the mixed electrolyte dissolved more readily than the zinc-salt by itself. “The supporting salt of NaClO4 can efficiently adjust the solvation structure and electronic states of the electrolyte upon increasing the concentrations,” the group explains. “Therefore, the highly concentrated electrolyte shows the scarcity of free water molecules, low viscosity, and high ionic conductivity, which can efficiently prohibit the dissolution of the NVO cathode to enable remarkable cycling stability and high rate performance.”
One problem with such electrolytes has been finding suitable cathode materials to work with them, and that can be fabricated cost-effectively. The group worked with a sodium-vanadate material, made using a dissolution-crystallization process at room temperature, and found this showed strong performance in combination with the electrolyte. “The nanofiber morphology enhances ion diffusion, which ensures faster charge and discharge rates of the aqueous Zn-ion batteries,” said Husam Alshareef, who leads the research group at KAUST. “This combination of electrode and electrolyte potentially solves the shortcomings of conventional aqueous Zn-ion batteries.”
The battery is described in the paper Concentrated dual-cation electrolyte strategy for aqueous zinc-ion batteries, published in Energy and Environmental Science. The group notes that previous ‘water in salt’ electrolytes have often relied on toxic substances, and that it has shown that sodium alone can actually show better ionic conductivity than these, as well as lower cost and reduced toxicity. They also note that in analyzing the battery’s performance they discovered a new interphase forming at the anode, which promotes uniform, reversible deposition of the zinc ions as the battery cycles.
With further investigation, the group is confident this battery chemistry could be attractive, at least for stationary storage applications where size/weight is not a pressing concern. “The fundamental understanding and the experimental demonstrations of reversible battery chemistry using a bi-cation electrolyte strategy open a viable route to developing aqueous batteries for emerging electrochemical energy storage applications,” they conclude.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/30/single-crystal-perovskite-solar-cell-with-17-8-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 30, 2021",Single crystal perovskite solar cell with 17.8% efficiency,"Perovskite single crystals have generated interest in recent years for solar cell applications, owing to their optoelectronic properties such as long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and low trap density. The crystals are known for being free from grain boundaries and demonstrating low defect densities which, according to many scientists, make them comparable to those of the best-performing quality silicon. However, the benefits of switching from multi to single crystal growth in silicon are well known. For perovskites this has thus far proved challenging.
Researchers at the University of Nebraska in the United States have manufactured a perovskite solar cell with single crystals comprised of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) via a novel approach, which they describe as a diffusion-facilitated space-confined method. “Current studies of the intrinsic properties of the perovskites are mainly based on thick bulk single crystals with thickness of millimeter which are too thick for application in solar cells,” they said. “Growing thin perovskite single crystals with large area represents an effective approach to overcome this obstacle, however there is no effective method handling the micrometer-thick iodide-based perovskite single crystals with large area.”
The U.S. group grew the crystals directly onto indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates covered with hole transport layer (HTL). These substrates have a controlled thickness of tens of micrometers and area of tens of mm2.The cell was then built with single crystals with a thickness of 10 μm that showed an efficiency of 16.1%, a short-circuit current of 20.5 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 1.06 V, and a fill factor of 74.1%.
The academics decided then to treat the surface of the single crystals by spin coating the methylammonium iodide (MAI) solution to reduce the surface charge trap density, which raised the cell efficiency to 17.8%, the short-circuit current to 21.0 mA cm−2, the open-circuit voltage to 1.08 V, and the fill factor to 78.6%.
“We demonstrated the use of a single crystal to broaden the photoresponse range of the perovskite solar cells without losing device photovoltage and fill factor,” the scientists said. “More efforts are needed to enhance the carrier diffusion length and passivate the surface nonradiative recombination center density in order to boost the device efficiency to Shockley–Queisser limit.”
The novel approach is described in the study Thin single crystal perovskite solar cells to harvest below-bandgap light absorption, which was recently published in nature communications.

An additional 1,367 MW of solar PV power plants were grid connected in France during the first half of 2021, according to new figures from the French Ministry of Ecological Transition (MTE).
This result represents an acceleration compared to the previous years and represents a new kind of growth that the country has not experienced before. For comparison, the newly installed PV capacity for the first six months of 2020 was 431 MW and in the same period of 2019, 431 MW.
This increase is explained both by an increase in the number of connections and also by a higher proportion of utility-scale PV plants, according to the MTE. Around 66% of the newly connected power, in fact, corresponds to installations bigger than 250 kW, which represent less than 1% of the number of new connections. Smaller-sized installations, below 9 kW, represent almost 83% and around 7% of the new capacity.
Between January and June 2021, solar PV generated around 7.6 TWh, compared to around 6.8 TWh for the same period in 2020, due to high levels of solar radiation in March and April. This result represents approximately 3.1% of French electricity consumption, up slightly from 3% a year earlier.
In terms of self-consumption, 22.4% of the PV installations in mainland France, representing 12.8% of installed capacity, have self-consumed a good part of their production. The share of these installations is up 1 percentage point compared to the previous quarter. In the second quarter of 2021, 158 GWh of PV electricity was self-consumed.
In geographic terms, the regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, Grand-Est, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur hosted around 69% of the newly connected power in mainland France in the first half of 2021.

“It is a project to support and strengthen the collective economy in Jishui County,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine, noting that the plant is being built partly on water, where rice cultivation and fishery activities are carried out, and partly on agricultural land. “It maximizes land utilization.”
Construction on the unsubsidized project began in March and completion is scheduled for the end of this year. “Around 40% of the project is completed to date,” the spokesperson said. Overall, it is expected to occupy a surface of 530,000 m2 and to be built at a cost of RMB 220 million (US$33.9 million).

The solar plant comprises a mounting structure featuring a Zn–Al–Mg alloy (ZM) coating, which provides enhanced corrosion resistance and is usually used by Chiko Solar in fishery-solar hybrid projects. The panels are placed at a height of 1,454 mm from the water's surface.

Chiko Solar said that the Jiangxi Province, like other eastern Chinese provinces, has been suffering from increasing land constraints in recent years and that projects such as the 50 MW facility in Shuitian Town may become more frequent in China's eastern regions in the future.
Currently, the largest PV plant built on a fishery in China is a 260 MW facility in Dangtu county, in the Chinese province of Anhui.

The facility will supply power to 700 households in two remote villages.
“The off-grid power station will help municipality reduce diesel consumption by 30%,” the head of corporate communications for Hevel Solar, Anton Usachev, told pv magazine. “The fuel savings are expected to reach 2130 tons during a 10-year energy service contract.”
The $2.7 million solar+storage unit includes a 550 kW PV array and a 470 kWh lithium-ion battery.

The project was built under Russia's energy service scheme, which enables independent power producers to sell power to municipalities that own and operate diesel power plants via a competitive bidding scheme. Upon completion and commissioning of the facility, the municipality remunerates the selected bidder on a monthly basis, with the revenue derived mainly from diesel economy volumes and generated power.
The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the project was estimated by Usachev at between RUB 13 ($0.18) and RUB 19/kWh, “which can be explained by complicated logistics,” he said.
Hevel Solar is also building off-grid solar plants in the Russian Far East, the country’s easternmost region, where access to electricity and transmission networks is limited. The region, which is the largest and least populated district of Russia, has the poorest energy and transport infrastructure in the country. The company has also built off-grid PV installations totaling 2.8 MW in the Siberian regions of Altay, Tyva and Zabaikalsky.

Solar technology advocate Nigel Morris and the software experts at Solar Analytics have been mining the potential of data to eradicate what Morris calls “the incredibly complicated, mind-numbingly boring and almost impossible task of choosing the right provider and energy plan as a new solar owner.”
In a recent conversation about impending five-minute settlement rules in Australia's National Electricity Market, Morris, who is head of business development at Solar Analytics, told pv magazine Australia about the launch of Solar Analytics Plan Optimizer, an upgrade to the company’s real-time solar monitoring and analysis software, which already tracks the data of solar users to help them make the most of their PV systems, given their electricity usage and weather forecasts.
People with new solar systems on their rooftops are primed to reap the rewards. But they typically need to change their energy plans or their providers, or both, to dovetail with their enhanced power status and really get the benefits flowing.
In recent years, competition between proliferating energy retailers has resulted in a dizzying variety of solar export rates, time-of-use rates, fixed charges and so on.
The impost on solar owners to compare and contrast different plans in relation to their own individual energy use is “nightmarish,” says Morris. He has various pithy criticisms of existing energy-plan comparison sites, but says the main problem is that “no one has done it with solar owners in mind – they’re all chasing the 25 million Australians who buy energy, but no one’s really thought about it and said, ‘well, how do you get the best plan if you’re a solar owner?’”
The most recent State of the Energy Market Report by the Australian Energy Regulator seems to concur with Morris in its acknowledgement that existing switching services “may not provide customers with the best outcomes” and that it is “difficult for customers to assess whether an offer is right for them.” Little wonder that the rate of customers changing their energy plans is notoriously low, and potential savings accordingly seep away.
Pilot testing of plan optimizer technology revealed its calculations and recommendations on the best plan to switch to resulted in an average saving per site of AUD 100 ($73) a quarter to AUD 400 a year. Of the sample solar sites analyzed, Solar Analytics’ data showed 70% could reap rewards by switching plans or providers, and the maximum saving shown so far by a plan optimizer switching recommendation was AUD 2,000 a year.
For new solar owners who subscribe to the Solar Analytics software application, the plan optimizer is a new standard feature and calculation of the most suitable energy plan begins with entering the details of their latest electricity bill into the Solar Analytics dashboard. Actual home energy figures are then run through a set of algorithms to compare the compatibility of plans on offer in the market with the use patterns of that site.
Morris told pv magazine Australia that the system will yield ideal results when supplied with two to three months of usage data; so new solar owners “don’t need to worry about it straight away, just let the automation do the work for you, and eight weeks down the track, the calculation will tell you whether there’s a material saving to be made by switching.”
The company’s existing 25,000 users will start receiving the upgrade for free from today as it rolls out to New South Wales, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania, Victoria and Southern Queensland. For these customers the platform already has a wealth of electricity-usage data, and will do its thing in the background, scanning market offerings and updating each user either immediately or periodically – depending how spot on their existing plan is – on what they could save by switching to a new plan.
The system is also expected to save solar retailers a mountain of time and calculations in advising customers on what they could save by installing solar.
“Solar businesses struggle to keep up with advising their customers about ever-changing energy plans,” says Morris, but the plan optimizer uses the latest information on plans in the market to highlight potential savings for prospective buyers of solar systems.
It’s the first upgrade in a suite of optimizing services Solar Analytics has planned, says Morris. “We’re working on Battery Optimizer, VPP Optimizer and EV Optimizer, all with specific needs in mind and offering unbiased advice based on real data.”
And on the subject of five-minute settlement – the rule change that is intended to incentivize investment in fast-response technologies, such as big batteries in the electricity market, and stimulate innovation in retail energy plans – Morris says the following: “It’s certainly something we’re keeping a watching brief over. We’ll be making sure that any changes to plans are automatically passed through into our plan optimizer, for example.”

The two entities will award loans ranging from €3,000 to a maximum of €400,000, at an interest rate of 3% per year, with a repayment period of up to 10 years.
The program also includes non-refundable rebates in the amount of up to €25,000 that will help entrepreneurs buy and install PV systems. The rebates are being awarded via a tender held by the Eco Fund, which is a government agency promoting development in the field of environmental protection.
Montenegro's power utility, Elektroprivreda Crne Gore (EPCG), and the country's Ministry of Ecology, Spatial Planning and Urbanism, kicked off a net metering program for rooftop PV in mid-July.
The EPCG is also building a 100 MW solar park in partnership with Finnish utility Fortum, and a floating PV power plant on the Slano artificial salt lake.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had installed solar power of just 6 MW at the end of 2020. The vast majority of Montenegro’s electrical power demand is currently met by the 225 MW Pljevlja thermal power plant in the north of Montenegro and two large hydropower plants, at Perućica (307 MW) and Piva (363 MW).

The report detailed myriad ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) can help accelerate climate action, including detecting foliage growth across power line infrastructure; providing highly accurate and localized weather forecasts; and boosting the speed of algorithms to optimize electricity supply and demand.
German-owned company Altmetric, which logs online references to research papers, has said the Climate Change AI paper is one of the top 50 most-referenced documents among almost a million preprints listed on research paper repository arXiv. Preprints are academic papers published online before they have been peer-reviewed.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they are changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
Since the Climate Change AI study was published – by the assembly of around 30 academic researchers and young professionals interested in how machine learning can combat climate change – the group has expanded its scope to include educational outreach, a research grant program, community building, and providing policy guidance for responsible AI. The group’s initiatives – and the potential of AI to be used to address climate change – have earned two of its co-chairs, David Rolnick and Priya Donti, membership of this year's MIT Technology Review’s “35 innovators under 35.”
For Donti, receiving that distinction was proof of broader recognition of the urgent need for action on climate change. “We need a wider variety of tools and approaches to accelerate on-the-ground action, like existing work in renewables integration and sustainable agriculture,” she said. “At Climate Change AI, we seek to catalyze and accelerate this work by supporting members of the AI and climate action communities to deploy machine learning where it can make an impact.”
The body recently launched its ‘innovation grants' research funding program to provide financial support for studies into the intersection of climate change and AI. The $2 million grant scheme is funded by the Quadrature Climate Foundation owned by London-based investment fund Quadrature Capital; and Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative founded by Wendy Schmidt and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The grants will provide up to $150,000 to researchers in OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development) countries. Grant recipients must create novel, public datasets and demonstrate a pathway to real-world deployment for their research.
Climate Change AI is also working with Canada’s International Development Research Centre and the Swedish International Development Agency to evaluate proposals for an AI and climate change research hub in sub-Saharan Africa. The CA$1.2 million (US$951,000) center would disburse grants in Africa as part of the four-year Artificial Intelligence for Development in Africa program which focuses on AI for climate action.
The grants program is part of the group’s broader vision to accelerate action on climate change. Much of Climate Change AI’s work focuses on bridging the gap between energy organizations interested in AI who face challenges leveraging the technology, and members of the machine learning community interested in contributing to climate action and uncertain how to start.
“We are very eager to brainstorm with power-sector organizations on how to put our programs and activities to work for them,” said Donti, who leads the group’s power and energy sector work. “If a power-sector entity is interested in better understanding how to incorporate AI, we will be glad to chat. We are also excited to build partnerships around impactful initiatives in this sector, for instance, by creating AI researcher-in-residence programs to facilitate AI knowledge sharing within the energy sector.”
Climate Change AI sees itself as a resource for those aiming to shape programs to bridge the gap between AI and climate change action. “Our broad base of expertise and engagement has given us a good understanding of the opportunities, as well as the pitfalls to watch out for in these areas,” said Donti.
To bridge the knowledge gap between the climate action and AI communities, CCAI has developed educational and capacity-building efforts. Short tutorials on machine learning and climate change are hosted on its website, and a full summer school and course series are being created.
“We recently launched our CCAI Wiki, which is a living, breathing extension of our comprehensive research paper,” said Donti. “We also have a monthly newsletter with an extensive listing of jobs and other resources, as well as an online discussion platform for community members to ask questions and share ideas.”
The group has run events for the last two years, including workshops at leading machine learning conferences – with videos hosted on the Climate Change AI website – and a side event at the COP25 UN climate change conference in Madrid in 2019. The organization also hosts a ‘happy hour' every fortnight to foster community building.
“The goal is to tackle climate change, not get AI implemented in every corner of climate action,” added Donti, to underscore the group’s understanding of the limitations, as well as the potential of artificial intelligence.
The volunteers who make up Climate Change AI have provided policy guidance to governments and the body has also contributed to the Global Partnership on AI – an OECD initiative aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice on responsible, trustworthy machine learning – by helping draft recommendations to facilitate responsible AI use in the fight against climate change.
Donti said: “AI has the potential to both be helpful and harmful towards action on climate change.” For example, machine learning can help oil and gas firms extract fossil fuels, help online retailers drive consumption, and improve the performance of self-driving cars, to the potential detriment of public transport use.
As part of Climate Change AI's work with the Global Partnership on AI, the former has issued a call for more examples of responsible artificial intelligence use to combat climate change.
CCAI co-chair Donti said: “We want to be a resource to all organizations working at the intersection of climate action and AI. We are continually looking for more ways to enhance our impact and strengthen this community.”

The Conolophus project is designed to lower diesel consumption on Santa Cruz Island in the Galapagos National Park, as well as on the adjacent island of Baltra. It is the third project of its type for the archipelago.
Another 1 MW project, including a 2.2 MWh battery storage system, was announced two years ago. The project has the financial support of the Korean Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT).
Another project under the KIAT program is a PV installation with storage built by Siemens on Isabela Island. The company completed one of the world’s first 100%-renewable island power systems in October 2018.

The governments of Mexico, Malaysia, and Turkey – along with the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), NextEra Energy Resources, REC Americas, and other entities – are chiming in to have a say in a recently reignited debate over the extension of import tariffs for solar equipment destined for U.S. markets.
In a filing earlier this month, SEIA, the American Clean Power Association, NextEra Energy, and REC Americas said they opposed extensions for the the safeguard measures. They urged the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to reject a handful of petitions asking the body to extend the provisions beyond their current expiration date of February 2022.
The statement challenged petitions from Suniva, Auxin Solar, Hanwha Q Cells USA, LG Electronics USA, and Mission Solar Energy seeking to have the tariff safeguards extended. The SEIA-led group challenged the claim that the five companies represented the views of the domestic U.S. solar industry. The group also pointed out that Suniva had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2017 and is currently not operational.
The request to reject the petitions also said that Auxin Solar only produces modules, and not cells, in facility a San Jose, California, that has an annual production capacity of 150 MW.
“Extending this safeguard is essential for America to reclaim its lead in solar energy manufacturing and development,” said Auxin Solar.
The five companies filed two sets of petitions to the ITC under Section 204(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 and Subpart F of part 206 of the rules of practice and procedure of the ITC. The companies said that they are representatives of the domestic industry producing CSPV cells and modules and, therefore, have standing to file the petition.
“Extending this safeguard is essential for America to reclaim its lead in solar energy manufacturing and development, and it represents a critical step to achieve the broader goal of American renewable energy independence,” said Mamun Rashid, co-founder and chief executive officer at Auxin Solar at the time his company asked for the extension.
Rashid said that Auxin Solar “is committed to re-shoring the solar supply chain” and filed the petition in the hope that policymakers are “committed to the promise of green energy independence and the good-paying manufacturing jobs that will result.”
Auxin said that its extension petition would prompt the ITC to determine whether the safeguard remedy continues to be necessary and whether evidence exists that the industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition. The ITC is expected to report its determination to President Biden by December 8.
Standing challenged
The SEIA-led filing asking that the petitions be thrown out said that Suniva has not produced CSPV cells in the U.S. since early 2017, and Auxin Solar has only ever assembled modules in the United States. As a result, the filing said that neither petitioner can file on behalf of the domestic industry with regard to cells “because they are not domestic producers of cells and are not currently members of the domestic cell industry.”
In addition, the filing said that Hanwha is a wholly owned unit of Hanwha Chemical Corp. in South Korea, and that the company originally opposed the safeguard measure. In September 2019 –around 18 months after the safeguard action was imposed – Hanwha opened a 1.7 GW module production facility in Dalton, Georgia. It imports CSPV cells for assembly into modules and is related to U.S. importers and leading foreign producers in China, South Korea, and Malaysia.
The SEIA-led request said that like Hanwha, the U.S. unit of LG Electronics originally opposed the safeguard measure. But LG Electronics USA began importing CSPV cells and modules from South Korea in February 2019 to support commercial production in a new module facility in Huntsville, Alabama, with an annual production capacity of 500 MW. The filing also said that Mission Solar is a unit of South Korea-based OCI Ltd.
Mission Solar opened production in San Antonio, Texas, in 2014 with cell and module capacity of 100 MW. It later doubled that to 200 MW in 2015. The company closed its cell production lines in 2016, but continued to assemble modules in the United States by importing cells from Asia. The filing said that Mission Energy has a current module production capacity of 200 MW.
The filing said that with respect to modules, Hanwha and LG Electronics USA began domestic production of CSPV modules in 2019, “in the middle of the safeguard period.” It said the companies opposed the original petition and “continued to import significant quantities of cells to feed their domestic module production.” As a result, it said that Hanwha and LG Electronics USA are not eligible to file a petition on behalf of the industry because they were not part of the domestic module industry at the time of the original investigation.
Turning to Mission Solar, the filing said that company has the capacity to produce around 200 MW of modules in the United States per year. Based on 2,021 MW of total domestic module capacity, Mission Solar represents roughly 9.9% of total domestic module capacity. In the context of the market, the filing said that Mission Solar represents at most around 1.0% of the 19.2 GW of total U.S. solar installations in 2020.
“This is not adequate to establish standing, especially given the fact that domestic module producers disagree on the safeguard measure,” the filing said.

Loom Solar, a solar technology startup in India, has launched its Shark line of bifacial panels. The modules use sixth-generation (PID-free) mono PERC solar cells from Germany.
The nine-busbar panels are mainly designed for rooftop solar projects. They provide power outputs ranging from 440 W to 530 W, with power conversion efficiencies of 20% to 21%. The rear side gains are up to 20%, leading to 530 W of output.
Each panel features 144 half-cut solar cells and measures 2,131 mm x 1,047 mm x 35 mm and weighs 24 kg.
“The Shark bifacial panels utilize both sides to generate power, further raising the efficiency with the help of reflective surfaces like white paint, RCC roof, and installed height of 1.5 meters from the base. The panels help in 33% saving of rooftop space with respect to existing technologies,” said Loom Solar.
