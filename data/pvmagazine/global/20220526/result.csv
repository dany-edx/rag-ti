Back then Scaysbrook described the United States as “the most opportunity-rich market in the energy transition,” with the UK running a very close second, whereas Australia was “really a bit of a non-event in terms of the scale and volume of investment opportunity, particularly for institutional investors”. 
However, following the historic 2022 federal election which saw Labor sweep to power with a trail of Teals and Greens, the major infrastructure investor believes the scene is set for a massive influx of institutional green capital into Australia.
“This is now a very significant market opportunity by global standards, and what's attractive about it is the sheer scale of it and the timeframe over which it has to be achieved,” Scaysbrook told The Australian Financial Review (AFR) newspaper. 
“This is putting Australia back on the map in the eyes of global institutions looking at renewables and decarbonizing industry,” continued Scaysbrook. 
In the last 12 to 18 months QIP has deployed more than AUD 2 billion ($1.42 billion) of equity into low-carbon infrastructure and renewables, mainly in the UK and the US as its Australian projects were delayed by the tardiness of the Morrison government, or simply deemed too risky because Australia's states were having to do the hard work of emissions reduction without much federal support.
QIP has about 20% of its portfolio in Australia, including two 30 MW plants producing biogas from sugar cane waste in Byron Bay; a specialist green energy retailer called Energy Locals that provides businesses with the tools to set up their own energy plan and is also partnered with Tesla in the SA VPP; Energy Trade, one of Australia’s largest behind-the-meter, community energy network businesses; and Apac Green Data, a developer of data center campuses — so far, one in Queensland and another in New South Wales — which deliver low-cost 24/7 renewable power to help customers meet their carbon-reduction targets.
Scaysbrook told AFR that after Saturday's election a new opportunity for private capital has opened, an opportunity to help fund the investment needed to meet a “truly stunning” goal for renewables growth this decade. 
“Here in Australia, we do have a champion of hydrogen, in Fortescue Future Industries … but they're not the only ones that are out there in the world that are getting prepared to make very, very significant capital commitments to drive this forward,” he said.
“In Australia we have what most other countries don't have, that they relish, and this is large tracts of land that can be developed for solar and wind production. We have access to port facilities, we have relatively good shipping access to export markets. So we have a lot of the things that the rest of the world would love to have if they were trying to develop these green export industries.” 
Newly-elected prime minister Anthony Albanese has promised to make the nation a “renewable energy superpower” in the wake of Labor’s federal election victory at the weekend.
“We are the greatest country on earth. But we can have an even better future if we seize the opportunities that are right there in front of us. The opportunity to shape change, rather than be shaped by it,” he said.
“Together we can end the climate wars. Together we can take advantage of the opportunity for Australia to be a renewable energy superpower.”
Federal Labor has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 43% by 2030, based on 2005 emissions levels; boost renewables; boost demand for electric vehicles (EVs) through tax breaks; and help build community-owned solar power and battery projects.
Labor’s Powering Australia Plan would see renewable capacity grow to 26 GW, or 82% of all NEM generation by 2030. The plan also assumes that electric vehicles will make up 89% of new car sales in Australia by the end of the decade.
Labor’s approach centers on an AUD 20 billion government intervention to fast-track upgrades to the national electricity grid to accommodate the influx of renewable energy. The policy is designed to bring forward the construction of high-voltage infrastructure by lowering financial and planning barriers to unlock the commercial development of large scale renewable energy resources.
The party’s plan also includes AUD 200 million to install 400 community batteries, AUD 100 million for the development of shared ‘solar banks’, and a commitment to reduce the emissions of the Australian Public Service to net zero by 2030.
Australia just took a big step toward becoming a global clean energy superpower. Let’s get back in the race! #ausvotes
— Kane Thornton (@kanethornton) May 21, 2022

Clean Energy Council (CEC) CEO Kane Thornton posted a letter to new climate change & energy minister Chris Bowen on Twitter this week, urging Bowen to make good on renewable energy pledges. “I hope you're well rested,” said Thornton, “because there's a lot to do, and not a minute to waste.” 
“Mind, you do not have to do everything,” Thornton continued. “State and territory governments responded to the policy vacuum and stepped up … If we get it right, we put Australia back on the path to becoming a global clean energy superpower and restore our rightful place as a glowing example of a modern and prosperous economy powered by reliable, low-cost, clean energy. Saturday showed the Australian public is with us, so let’s get to it.”

Imran Chowdhury, country manager for the Singaporean development unit of Chinese inverter maker Sungrow, told pv magazine land shortages in Bangladesh mean the company is addressing site concerns before plant development.
“Sungrow Renewables have plans to develop bankable IPP [independent power producer]-based solar project development in Bangladesh for providing affordable green energy to the national grid.” said Chowdhury.
The popularity of solar was reflected by an announcement by junior energy minister Nasrul Hamid that the government will approve more solar plans, above and beyond the 1.4 GW of generation capacity due to come online by 2025.
The planned pipeline of 28 under-construction projects includes sites which are ready to start commercial production and others at an advanced stage of building, according to industry insiders.
The largest of the announced projects are reportedly between 50 MW and 100 MW in size.
Addressing the fifth energy transition council ministerial meeting this week, Hamid said solar contributes 554 MW of the nation's 788 MW of clean power generation capacity.
The politician said more than six million solar home systems supply electricity to 12% of Bangladesh's 170 million people.
Net-metered rooftop solar arrays add up to 42 MW of capacity, Hamid said.
The junior minister said: “Special emphasis is given on [the] generation of green power in the next Power Sector Master Plan,” adding that strategy would outline the government's next zero-carbon plan.
The minister noted clean energy is also a priority in the nation's Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan.
Climate prosperity plans (CPPs) are being prepared by the nations of the Climate Vulnerable Forum of countries on the front line of the effects of rising temperatures.
Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina oversaw the forum's first CPP as part of a bid to change the narrative from stressing the vulnerability of climate-affected nations to making them climate resilient.
The nation continues to attract overseas investment in clean power with Chinese developer Guopu Energy in November 2021 proposing to invest $50 million into Bangladeshi renewables.
Bangladesh plans to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables.

The Vizcaya-based inverter maker said it signed the supply deal at the Intersolar show in May.
Siemens will use the Proteus products in its photovoltaic and energy storage projects worldwide, Gamesa said in a press release this week.
The Intersolar award win marked the first time a central inverter had secured the gong.
Gamesa said its products offer a high power output of up to 4,700 kVA and a “record” efficiency of 99.45%.

US-owned Wood Mackenzie issued a note this week which also estimated China will add 75 GW of the 110 GW of new solar to arrive in the Asia-Pacific region in 2022.
The world will pass a terrawatt of solar generation capacity this year, the Edinburgh-based company added, and North America will see its share of the world's new solar capacity double from the 11% recorded last year.
It was not clear from the note whether the project capital cost rise predicted would apply solely to the US.
The analyst said it had observed a “substantial amount of [solar] module volumes for utility scale projects” postponed after Californian manufacturer Auxin Solar in February lodged an anti-circumvention petition to the authorities.
Auxin has claimed Chinese companies are manufacturing products on home soil and only putting the final touches to them in Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia before labeling them as made in the latter-named nations to get around US anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
An anti-circumvention investigation is under way and Wood Mackenzie said the development is also prompting some manufacturers to shift “importer of record” responsibility onto panel buyers.
Germany will lead the European push for solar this decade, Wood Mackenzie predicted, because of a new governing coalition and the nation's dependence on Russian gas.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine means the Russia and Caspian Sea regions will add no new solar capacity this year, the analyst said.
Rising solar costs will be partially offset by plans to add, this year, production lines sufficient to produce an extra 200,000 metric tons of polysilicon per year, plus 1 GW more cells, 1 GW more wafers, and 500 MW more modules.
The analyst noted moves by India this year to tax solar imports and bolster domestic production would also “shift the pricing and supply dynamics in the US and India.”

The planned battery, at Heysham on Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, will also replace local grid services due to be lost when the Heysham 1 and 2 nuclear reactors are decommissioned, in 2024 and 2028.
A press release issued by London-based Kona this week did not reveal the energy storage capacity of the planned facility.
Kona said the battery will be installed at the landing site for wind farms including the large Walney development, and “will be one of the largest in Europe.”
Quoted in the press release, Kona founder Andy Willis said the battery would be in an area which suffers regular curtailment of wind power and “other low carbon technologies”: the B7a constraint boundary.
“Roughly GBP 1 billion ($1.25 billion) was spent in the last year curtailing energy from wind farms and other generators, replacing that need elsewhere – usually from fossil-fuel [-powered] stations,” said Willis. “Tackling this enormous waste of both money and energy is crucial.”
Kona said the site would also provide inertia and reactive power support grid services, the need for which will be more acute after the nearby nuclear reactors are shuttered.
The London-based company's website states Kona is developing a 500 MW pipeline of UK energy storage projects.

The two grid operators aim to build the “Celtic Interconnector” subsea link between Ireland and France. EirGrid submitted the planning application for the project in July.
“This followed a series of technical assessments, consultations and engagement with the local community that took place over the preceding years. The planning application included a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report and Natura Impact Statement,” it said. “An Bord Pleanála assessed the proposal, including the landfall in Youghal, cable route, converter station and network connection and associated technologies. The board also ran a seven-week period of statutory consultation.”
The project still needs to secure a marine license from the UK Marine Management Organisation. It will also need to obtain a foreshore licence from the relevant Irish authorities.
“Subject to securing these consents, it is expected the project will be built and energized by 2026,” EirGrid said.
The European Commission’s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Energy Programme is supporting the project with €530 million ($566.5 million) of funding. If it is built, the submarine cable would be the first interconnector to exist between the two countries. The 700 MW high-voltage direct current submarine power cable should be deployed between the southern coast of Ireland and the northwestern coast of France.

“Perovskite solar cells are at the forefront of next-generation photovoltaic technologies. We are proud to work with some of the best research teams in perovskite photovoltaics to tackle some key challenges for the commercialization of this low-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic product,” the research's corresponding author, Wei Zhang, told pv magazine. He further noted that the migration of lithium is critical in the degradation of spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, which is accelerated at higher temperatures, leading to the rapid degradation of the perovskite.
The scientists described ferrocene as a sandwich structured material that is highly stable and can be used as a low-cost transition metal complex. “Ferrocene has previously been incorporated into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a redox mediator, before being identified as an effective co-mediator when combined with inorganic redox shuttles enabling fast regeneration of oxidized sensitizers,” they specified. “When applied in organic photovoltaics (OPV) the addition of ferrocene has also been shown to improve carrier mobility and suppress recombination via the volatility of ferrocene and the ability to bridge between organic molecules, ordering the structure.”
“The application of metallocenes in perovskite solar cells is quickly becoming an exciting avenue for tackling the key challenges of perovskite solar cells including performance and stability,” researcher Thomas Webb said.
According to their findings, the addition of ferrocene at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface rendered the lithium ions immobile, preventing them from migrating within the perovskite layer and thus significantly reducing their aggregation at the interface, where they can cause damage. This was achieved without compromising the perovskite cell efficiency. In addition, the diffusion of ferrocene into the HTL helped oxidize spiro-OMeTAD, improving its carrier transporting properties.
The solar cell developed with the proposed technique achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.45%. It was also able to retain 70% of the initial efficiency after 1,250 hours stored at 60 C and 50% relative humidity.
The academics described the cell in the paper A Multifaceted Ferrocene Interlayer for Highly Stable and Efficient Lithium Doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based Perovskite Solar Cells, published in Advanced Energy Materials. The research team includes scientists from Imperial College London, the University of Surrey, the University of Nottingham, research institute UCL, Switzerland-based Fluxim AG, and London South Bank University. “This work offers insights into the tendency of ferrocene to bind and immobilize lithium ions by means of the cyclopentadiene rings, such immobilization has wider applications in other lithium-containing devices such as batteries,” research co-author, Saif Haque said. “Tackling the stability of perovskite solar cells is essential for any future commercialization. In this work, we show that the inclusion of ferrocene in the solar cell device structure can improve stability. These insights could prove valuable in a wide range of practical applications beyond solar cells.”

Through the proposed methodology, which relies on geographic information and meteorological data, project developers should be able to evaluate the potential energy production by a photovoltaic system for either a long or short time.
“The system accesses the geographic information that was previously downloaded and creates a map with a grid that delimits the areas available for energy estimation. It allows the user to select the area of interest by defining a polygon on the map,” the scientists explained. “The system then loads the image covering the area delimited by the user’s coordinates through the polygon on the map. Subsequent processing steps only take into account the data filtered in this step.”

The software integrates data on the mean inclination, orientation, size, and latitude for every connected component. It also implements an image processing model and extraction of the characteristics of the roofs, as well as photovoltaic energy calculation models.
“This tool offers excellent opportunities because it can be easily updated with new features made by the same developers or new contributors. After all, the source code is released,” the academics explained. “Those new features could include focusing on new types of elements in a city or performing a more precise estimation of the energy potential.”
The scientists presented the software in the study Data driven tools to assess the location of photovoltaic facilities in urban areas, which was recently published in Expert Systems with Applications. “URSUS-PV is offered as a free web tool available to individuals, municipalities, neighborhood communities or companies in the photovoltaic sector,” the research team said. “It is also supplied as a package that can be altered to be adapted to specific scenarios or improved with new features.”

Called RSM130-8-430-450M, the new 130-cell module is available in five versions with a power output ranging from 430 W to 450 W and efficiencies ranging from 20.7% to 21.7%. The open-circuit voltage is between 44.36 V and 45.33 V and the short-circuit current is between 12.35 A and 12.65 A.
The panel measures 1,894 mm x 1,096 mm x 30 mm and weighs in at 22.5 kg. It is built with a white backsheet, low iron, tempered anti-reflective glass and an anodized aluminum alloy frame. It also features an IP68 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.34% per C and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new product comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.8% of the nominal output power.
“As an upgrade for the Titan 40-cell high-performance monocrystalline PERC solar modules, RSM130-8-430-450M features a power output range from 430Wp to 450Wp, 10-20Wp higher than other mainstream residential PV products available on the market,” Risen stated.

Though commercial manufacturing of CIGS solar products has faltered in recent years, the technology has retained plenty of interest among researchers, particularly for its potential in flexible or multijunction devices.
A group of scientists led by Ritsumeikan University in Japan investigated one problem for CIGS manufacturing; the use of a buffer layer of cadmium sulfide, a highly toxic material. “In the conventional process, cadmium is deposited on the CIGSSe layer via a chemical bath deposition process,” explained Jakapan Chantana, a professor at Ritsumeikan. “By eliminating this step, we have created a completely dry manufacturing process that generates less waste.”
The group was able to replace the cadmium-containing buffer layer by oxidizing the surface of the CIGS film, forming a “native” buffer layer. This approach has been successfully demonstrated before, however, in some previous research the oxidation could take as long as several months. Here, it is reduced to a six-hour air-annealing process at 130 C – which could potentially be implemented in large-scale manufacturing.
The academics described the process in full in the paper Formation of Native Inx(O,S)y Buffer through Surface Oxidation of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 Absorber for Significantly Enhanced Conversion Efficiency of Flexible and Cd-Free Solar Cell by All-Dry Process, published in Solar RRL. Depositing a commercially produced CIGS film on a flexible steel substrate, the group demonstrated 16.7% efficiency.
While higher efficiencies have been reported for cadmium-free CIGS cells in the past, the group states that what it has developed is the first with potential for large-scale applications, and also that the all-dry processing could lead to significant waste reduction and cost savings.

This was the aim of a collaboration between scientists at Cambridge University in the UK and Japan’s Okinawa Institute of Technology (OIST). The group used various imaging techniques to observe the structure of perovskite films at the nanoscale, and the mechanisms at work when the light hits the film.
“Illuminating the perovskite films over time, simulating the aging of solar cell devices, we find that the most interesting dynamics are occurring at these nanoscopic trap clusters,” said Stuart Macpherson from Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory. “We now know that the changes we see are related to photodegradation of the films. As a result, efficiency-limiting carrier traps can now be directly linked to the equally crucial issue of solar cell longevity.”
The group found that defects in the material, which were previously known to create “traps” for charge carriers that limit device efficiency, are also involved in structural changes that reduce device performance over time. By focusing on the removal of these defects during the manufacturing process, the group states that improvements in both performance and longevity should be achievable. “We reveal that performance losses and intrinsic degradation processes can both be mitigated by modulating these defective phase impurities, and demonstrate that this requires careful tuning of local structural and chemical properties,” they explain.
Methods for altering chemical composition and process parameters should be quickly applicable to larger scale processing of the materials, and the observation techniques developed here could be applied to other semiconductor materials as well.
“We now understand that any residual unwanted phases – even tiny nanoscale pockets remaining from the processing of the cells – will be bad news for the longevity of perovskite solar cells,” said Cambridge University scientist Sam Stranks. “The manufacturing processes need to incorporate careful tuning of the structure and composition across a large area to eliminate any trace of these unwanted phases – even more careful control than is widely thought for these materials. This is a great example of fundamental science directly guiding scaled manufacturing.”
The researchers presented their findings in the paper Local Nanoscale Phase Impurities are Degradation Sites in Halide Perovskites, published in Nature.

India added over 3 GW of solar capacity in the first quarter of 2022, a 21% increase over the previous quarter, according to the Q1 2022 India Solar Market Update by Mercom India Research.
Large-scale solar accounted for 86% of new quarterly installations and rooftop PV for the remaining 14%. The state of Rajasthan had the largest share with 52%, followed by Gujarat with 18% and Karnataka with 6%.
India’s cumulative installed solar capacity stood at 52 GW at the end of March.
The report predicts that this year a new record in new PV installations may be achieved in India. It also stressed, however, that some delays in the grid expansion of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) area may have a negative impact on the market.
“The uncertainty around the Great Indian Bustard case in Rajasthan is the only issue standing in the way of 2022 being another record year for solar installations. Everything depends on the Supreme Court ruling and how quickly it is resolved. A little push from the government can help India surpass the 60 GW large-scale solar installation target set for 2022, which will be a great achievement,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.

In the quest to electrify everything, it appears that heat pumps are the answer for many homeowners, according to a recent survey conducted by Carbon Switch, a producer of research and guides on how to live more sustainably. Carbon Switch surveyed 125 homeowners in the United States and Canada, reviewed previous research, spoke with installers, and analyzed data from states including Massachusetts and California.
The bottom line is that the average cost of a heat pump is $14,000 after rebates. But there’s a huge difference costs depending on rebates available, size of the home, location, whether the home needs ducts, and more.
As far as rebates go, some of the homeowners surveyed got zero in rebates, while others got as much as $14,000. The average rebate was found to be about $1,500. Not surprisingly, New York and Massachusetts have some of the most generous rebates, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. Rebates can vary (and not be obvious). For example, Central Hudson (upstate New York) customers can receive $1,000 per 10,000 BTUs if they replace a fossil fuel heating source, so at least $3,000 for a typical 3-ton system. The DSIRE database is a good place to start.
The survey found that home size directly correlates to the cost of heat pump installation. According to the survey, heat pumps for a 1,500 to 2,000 square foot home was $16,933. And a home of over 2,000 square feet averaged $19,117. For mini-splits, the number of zones in a home was another cost factor, ranging from $7,100 for 1 zone up to $26,573 for five zones. The bottom line on the size of home/cost correlation is that more than half of the homeowners surveyed paid between $4 to 10 per square foot, with the most common installation costing between $4 to 6 per square foot.

Location is a factor as the market for heat pumps is more mature in the South, and costs tend to be lower. Also the homes in the South are generally already wired for electric heat, which saves some retrofitting costs. The Northeast and West are more dependent on fossil fuels and have not yet embraced heat pumps, so costs are higher. The survey found that across the South, costs averaged $7.33 per square foot. In the Midwest, the average was $7.44 per square foot. In the Northeast and West, costs were over $8 per square foot.

The survey also found that costs are far lower when heat pumps are installed in new construction compared to existing home. In new construction the average was $7,384 after rebates and $6.54 per square foot. In an existing home, the average heat pump installed was $15,113 after rebates and $8.15 per square foot. Why? Because the electrical service can be designed for a fully electric home, and ducts and mini-split lines can be run before the walls are enclosed.
Other factors to consider include what type of heating system is being replaced. Some states offer rebates priced per heating ton when switching from fossil fuels. New York, for example is offering $2,500 per heating ton in rebates if a homeowner switches from gas, propane or fuel oil. Another factor is whether the home already has functional ductwork—if not the installation involves major renovation, and thus higher costs. And a final consideration is the electrical panel. Upgrading the panel to accommodate new equipment also boosts costs.

Kevin Purdy, author of the survey summary“Are heat pumps worth it?”, noted that upfront costs are only a fraction of the energy picture. ”Heat pumps can save the average US homeowner $10,000 throughout the unit’s lifetime. They replace both a furnace and an air conditioner, and they’re usually more comfortable and efficient than either of them. They free your budget from fluctuating fuel costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

The provincial authorities have already identified 10 offshore sites along Shandong’s coast where the projects could be constructed. Binzhou, Dongying, Weifang, Yantai, Weihai, and Qingdao are some of the preferred areas.
“The project will be assigned to developers with excellent models, advanced equipment, good technical solutions, and reasonable construction periods,” the administration said, noting that interested developers have until Jun. 1 to submit their proposals.
Upon implementation, the scheme will mark the global industry's biggest effort to date to deploy offshore solar on a large scale. Currently, the largest announced installation is a 100 MW project under development by Italian gas contractor Saipem. But thus far, only small pilot projects have been built in offshore waters.
