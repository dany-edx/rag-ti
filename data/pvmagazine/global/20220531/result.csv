China installed just 55.1 GW of new PV in 2021, but 16.88 GW of PV were connected to the grid in the first four months of this year, with 3.67 GW of new capacity in April alone.
China Huaneng Group has revealed plans to build a 10 GW solar panel factory in Beihai, Guangxi province. The state-owned company said it will invest CNY 5 billion ($749.8 million) in the new manufacturing facility.
Akcome said it will install more heterojunction module manufacturing lines at its factory in Ganzhou, Jiangxi province. The new lines are part of a plan to reach 6 GW of heterojunction production capacity. They will likely produce PV modules based on 210 mm wafers, with power conversion efficiencies of up to 24.5%.
Longi and Tongwei have announced new prices for wafers and solar cells. Longi left most of its product prices unchanged, but Tongwei raised them slightly, pricing its M6 cells at CNY 1.16 ($0.17)/W and M10 cells at CNY 1.19/W. It kept its G12 product price flat at CNY 1.17/W. Longi maintained the prices of its M10 (182 mm), M6 (166 mm), and G1 (158.75 mm) products at CNY 6.86, CNY 5.72, and CNY 5.52 per piece, respectively.
China Shuifa Singyes has secured a CNY 501 million cash injection from a state-owned distressed asset management company for two of its solar parks. The deal has been structured so that China Shuifa will contribute the solar project companies, worth CNY 719 million, plus CNY 31 million in cash. The funds will be invested in a limited partnership, including CNY 500 million from China Cinda and CNY 1 million from Cinda Capital, both of which are owned by China’s Ministry of Finance. The project companies, which will become 60% subsidiaries of Shuifa Singyes, will then secure a CNY 500 million cash injection.
IDG Energy Investment has switched on its solar cell and semiconductor cleaning equipment production lines in Xuzhou Hi-Tech Zone in Jiangsu province. It installed the production lines with an unnamed German partner.
Comtec Solar said it has until June 17 to publish its 2021 results. The figures were due to be published on May 31, but the company said the auditors had yet to finish their work due to pandemic disruptions. The unaudited figures revealed at the end of March showed a loss for shareholders of CNY 45 million.

Daniel Pasker, a sales manager for JA Solar, said African nations have recorded extensive growth in recent years, with about 5 GW of PV capacity expected in 2022. South Africa is now leading the continent with about 1 GW of installations for 2022, followed by Egypt with 800 MW.
Norman Moyo, the CEO of Distributed Power Africa, said the key driver for solar deployment is energy security. He also noted a decline in fossil fuel investments. Due partly to outdated grids, renewable energy is now growing across Africa.
Garth Cloete, group chief executive of Sustainable Power Solutions, said there has been a significant evolution over the last 10 years for solar prices, inverter technology, and policies across Africa. He noted that South Africa, for example, has a friendly regulatory framework.
Strathmore University in Kenya is driving the development of renewables throughout East Africa. But every country has its own regulations and requirements, which presents a key challenge to deployment.
“Change is inevitable. We started when they used to call us the rooftop market, then generation market and now the new password is distributed generation,” De Villiers Botha, chief operating officer at Solareff. “That speaks to the evolution of the regulatory space.”
Matanda Mwewa, sales manager at JA Solar for the Southern African Development Community (SADC), said he is excited to see what is embedded in national energy targets, especially across the SADC region. “Each country has its target for renewables, and we see policies aligning with those targets to enable the targets to be achieved,” he said.   
Grace Zhuo, regional manager of international sales for Clenergy, said that Africa's market cumulative capacity is at 7.7 GW. She said she therefore sees massive potential in South Africa and the eastern and western parts of the continent.  
“We have seen where clients have been limited by roof space, and we removed previously installed smaller modules of 240 W installed in 2014 and replaced it with new higher output modules which have more power,” Botha said. “For sure, the advancement in technology does assist the industry.”
Pasker said the sweet spot is the 540 W to 550 W range for rooftop installations, because of the physical footprint of the module. Even from a levelized cost of electricity perspective, you can still get more kilowatt-peak out of a container of 550 W panels than you can from a bigger module.

Germany installed 553 MW of new PV capacity in April, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur).
The new solar additions for April included 517 MW under the country's incentive scheme and 35 MW of unsubsidized installations. By comparison, the country installed 916 MW of solar in March and 620 MW of PV in April 2021.
Newly installed solar capacity reached 2.5 GW in the first four months of this year. The figure for the same period a year earlier was around 2.05 GW. The cumulative capacity of all subsidized PV systems in Germany hit 58.8 GW at the end of April.
Bundesnetzagentur has also published new compensation rates for June. The monthly decline in solar subsidies will be 1.4%, while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0481 ($0.051)/kWh and €0.0634/kWh, depending on the size.

Bosnia's Foreign Investment Promotion Agency (Fipa) said last week that the Bergen-based developer has started working on the 45 MW Petjnik solar plant. Fipa said construction will begin in June, with panels to be installed from the first quarter of 2023. The site will be commissioned at the end of 2023.
Fipa said civil engineer GP Toming, based in Grude municipality, is working on the project with Greenstat. The government agency said the Norwegian business had been scouring Europe for 12 months before settling on Grude. It also described the project as “Greenstat's first international investment,” but the Norwegian group actually owns a green hydrogen business in India.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that Bosnia and Herzegovina had 53 MW of grid-connected solar capacity at the end of 2021.

They have found that PV has the biggest potential for such applications, especially in hot climates.
They considered PV along with other two solar technologies – photovoltaic thermal collectors (PVT) and concentrating photovoltaic thermal collectors (CPVT). They compared the performance of these technologies for compression, absorption, adsorption, desiccant, and ejector cooling cycles.
“The types of cooling cycles coupled with PV panels are limited,” they said, noting that solar panels are commonly used to meet energy demand from compression refrigeration, which is critical for vaccine preservation, domestic refrigerators, and ice makers. “The main reasons for using PV panels are their high power-to-weight ratio, compactness, easy installation, and lack of movable parts.”
The scientists said that two critical considerations for the development of PV refrigeration systems are exergy efficiency and exergy destruction values.
“The exergy destruction has been reported considerably high on the PV panel,” they said. “Besides, in a refrigeration system, the compressor mainly considers exergy destruction. So, the best performance results are investigated by varying system parameters to maximize the exergy efficiency and minimize the exergy destruction.”
The group offered recommendations for project designers and future research. They said the solar panels should be always connected directly to variable speed compressors and argued that more compressors should be used to improve overall system efficiency. They also suggested using an ice storage tank as a cost-effective way to eliminate the need for inverters and batteries. In addition, they said that higher numbers of PV modules could guarantee a refrigerator’s viability on cloudy days.
“Domestic refrigerators work on a compression cycle, and combining them with PV might produce an acceptable result in locations where electricity is scarce,” they said. “One of the most significant issues with this technology is that it is ineffective throughout the winter and rainy days when little solar energy is available.”
They presented their findings in “Photovoltaic and Photovoltaic Thermal Technologies for Refrigeration Purposes: An Overview,” which was recently published in Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering.  The paper also describes the challenges and opportunities for projects based on PVT and CPVT panels.

“They rely on a new frame structure that provides better protection for the glass surface,” Marketing Manager Helga Ruscsák told pv magazine. “They can be used for pavement, terraces, driveways, sidewalks, parks, bicycle roads, marinas, and low traffic roads, as well as for other industrial and off-grid applications.”
The modules come in variants featuring conventional monocrystalline and polycrystalline cells, with a choice of clear or opal glass. All of the products measure 359 mm x 359 mm x 41 mm and weigh 6.5 kg.
The polycrystalline products feature 156 mm x 156 mm 18.6%-efficient solar cells, with a nominal power of 18.2 W. It has an open-circuit voltage of 2.56 V and a short-circuit current of 8.9 A.
The monocrystalline panels have a power conversion efficiency of 22.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.72 V, and a short-circuit current of 8.89 A. They are fabricated with four cells measuring 158.7 mm x 158.7 mm.

The panels are covered by 10 mm of tempered glass treated with an acid-etched pattern. They are also equipped with a frame made of a polymer composite based on low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with matrix-forming material.
“The frame is made out of 100% recycled plastic,” Ruscsák said.
All the modules have a maximum allowed vehicle wheel load of 2 tons per module. The manufacturer claims a vehicle with a maximum weight of 8 tons could drive on the modules.
“We do not intend to build solar highways or solar roads with our products,” said Ruscsák.
Platio Solar said the solar cells have the same lifecycle of those used in conventional panels, despite being exposed to mechanical stress.
“Several tests have been performed at this regard during the CE certification process,” Ruscsák said, noting that the modules have a low-voltage system, which makes walking on them a safe option.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/31/higher-prices-not-holding-back-european-demand/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"MAY 31, 2022",Higher prices not holding back European demand,"pv magazine: I think one of the most talked-about issues here at Intersolar Europe is supply chain and challenges in securing some components, like modules, inverters, and batteries. If I was to place an order with Longi Europe today, when would I receive the modules?
Gulnara Abdullina: You would probably get them at the end of Q3 or maybe the beginning of Q4. The product is available. But you are right, there are some other bottlenecks in the industry.
And how is it that Longi is in this position of being able to supply? I have heard that negotiations are happening for module supply in 2023 or even 2024.
Well, there are some discussions like that – particularly for large scale projects where the stakes are higher and visibility is a little longer than usual. We are working on some 2023 deals right now, not 2024 in Europe unless there is a rather blanket type of framework agreement with some of our customers, which can span out across various geographies. For supply in 2022, we still have capacity available, and are happy to take on more orders.
Does it feel like the German market is particularly hot?
Because of the price increase and capex limitations, at the beginning of the year we have seen less dynamics on the German market, but now, with the EU Repower Europe initiative and the German government aligning its strategy to work towards energy independence, we see a nice upward trend from the German market.
You mentioned higher prices – how would you describe the situation from buyers? Are they holding off and waiting for prices to fall, or accepting the new reality?
It really depends on the project itself or whether it can be postponed. If a project is approaching a hard deadline, then often it cannot be postponed. You may remember that many projects that we have right now have been carried over from the previous year, or even as far back as 2020.
In some of the cases we see that the project economics are still acceptable. In some other cases we some flexibility with construction timelines, so they are able to wait. But in other cases, they simply have to order now and there will be a reduced profitability of the project – it is not only module prices, but balance-of-system prices have increased.
How many projects have you heard of actually being canceled, given that the cost of capital is going up?
When looking into greenfield developments in Europe, it takes over three years to develop a project. And all of the soft costs that have been incurred up until that time making it painful to give up. I’m not seeing projects cancelled, rather that it is a moving target and some projects are being pushed.
Looking to the rooftop segment, it seems that demand is very strong. Is that how you see it?
In the distributed segment, demand is very strong. Generally speaking, it is a much more agile segment. Also, the price elasticity of the final customer is different. That means that the segment can adjust to the new situation and the pricing trend. Rooftop projects do have their capex constraints, but price increases can be passed onto the final customer, particularly given gas prices right now. And with some country specific subsidies and recently reduced VAT, some end customers are able to absorb the additional price increase.
In the residential segment, we are seeing some formerly pure-play module suppliers moving into home energy supply, including battery storage, EV charging and so on. Is that a part of Longi’s strategy?
We are strong believers in being the best at what you do and focusing on what you are good at; and that is why, with all respect to other ventures, our company’s goal is to focus on our core business – which is modules. In saying that, we are venturing into hydrogen, and we are already commercializing alkaline electrolyzers in the market, focused on the utility segment. So, we are not looking into expanding into other segments. We also believe that there is enough negotiating power that comes from the systems integrators and distributers that already have established channels for BoS components – for us stepping in, I don’t see it as a value add for our clients.
On module technology, there is a shift to n-type from some manufacturers – heterojunction (HJT) and TOPCon, in particular. Can you give me an indication as to which way Longi will go in terms of n-type?
We are not discarding any of the technologies. Our R&D is strong and last year alone we invested €600 million ($644.7 million), over 5% of our revenues. Knowing that our founders are very much forward looking, they know the technology and are focused on what is coming next. There are still things to do with p-type and great potential with n-type as well. At the cell level, we are working on p-type and n-type among others. Some of the n-type technologies that are readily available on the market today and in the past, did not yield additional gains as expected. And some remain very expensive. This means that it is not always possible to strike the right price-performance balance required.
So, it’s p-type PERC for Longi in the foreseeable future?
In the near term, there are still things to do with p-type PERC, but n-type does have a good future and potential. Longi is working in several directions to allow us to exploit the gap when we can.
‘Made in Europe' cell and module production is also a big topic now. How seriously is a manufacturer like Longi investigating something like a module assembly production facility in Europe?
These decisions have to be taken in light of the growing market and the very sunny prospects for the European market, the way the market is designed with a very fair share of distributed generation, I would not rule out the possibility of Chinese manufacturers or other international manufacturers stepping in and localizing some parts of the value chain. But this will take time.

Norway’s Statkraft has commissioned a 76 MWdc solar plant in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It developed the Nellai solar park via the “group captive model,” under which customers own a minimum 26% share of the plant and buy the electricity under long-term power purchase agreements.
The solar plant features 140,000 PV panels and spans 773,678 square meters of land. It is expected to produce 124 GWh of electricity per year.
Belectric, a German engineering, procurement and construction specialist, built the plant. Its Indian unit will also provide plant operation and maintenance services for the first three years after commissioning. 
“Statkraft has an ambition of ramping up as a solar and wind power developer in India and is currently focusing on developing greenfield solar projects at utility scale,” said Jürgen Tzschoppe, Statkraft executive vice president of international power. “Nellai is the first project in realizing this business objective and supports our strategy to strengthen our industrial presence in the solar segment and grow our customer-oriented business.”
Oslo-based Statkraft has had a presence in India since 2004 and now owns 215 MW of production capacity, with around 1,310 GWh of annual generation. In Himachal Pradesh, it is also building the 150 MW Tidong hydropower plant, which is scheduled for completion by the end of the year.

Green hydrogen is considered essential when it comes to decarbonization and future energy supplies. The hydrogen economy is still in its infancy, but the German government says generation capacity will be increased to 10 GW by 2030.
German consultancy Aurora Energy Research has reported that hydrogen projects with a total output of 21 GW have already been announced in Germany, but only a fraction of them have been realized. The analysts estimate that the industry will need up to 300 TWh of green hydrogen by 2050.
They assumed that the average costs for the renewables-powered production of green hydrogen will fall to around €5 per kg by 2025. They also assumed that industrial buyers will be ready to pay more than €5 per kg in the coming years. But from 2030 onwards, they are optimistic that green hydrogen imports will continue to reduce costs. That said, transport infrastructure such as ports and pipelines will need to be set up first.
Aurora Energy Research has determined that at prices of more than €5 per kg, the combination of solar with onshore wind farms is the most profitable option. However, maximum project profitability can only be achieved if wind and solar parks are coupled together with small electrolyzers for the production of green hydrogen. Aurora Energy Research sees the lowest green hydrogen production costs via the combination of 50 MW of wind power, 50 MW of PV, and 20 MW of electrolysis.
The analysts also assumed that if green hydrogen is generated via power purchase agreements, without direct co-location of a renewables plant, the production costs could also reach €5 per kg.
“Since the locations for the renewable systems can be optimized in these cases and the electrolyzer can be built closer to the customers, the costs for hydrogen transport and potentially also for hydrogen storage decrease,” they said.

The EIB surveyed 20 hydrogen companies and 26 investors on behalf of the European Commission, to identify the obstacles to driving Europe's hydrogen economy. The respondents said renewables-powered green hydrogen is more expensive than other forms of the energy carrier, with a lack of uniform regulation for hydrogen deployment.
Finance is constrained, cross-border projects need to be better coordinated, and the multiplicity of funds available to back hydrogen projects is counterproductive. The investors and hydrogen companies suggested incentives could include guaranteed offtake contracts, feed-in tariffs for hydrogen production, green public procurement to drive hydrogen demand, and production capacity auctions.
The respondents highlighted Germany's H2 Global plan to create a hydrogen marketplace via a state body responsible for buying the gas for the cheapest price and selling it to end users for the highest return. Carbon contracts for difference (CCFDs) were also suggested, with associated modifications of Europe's emissions trading scheme (ETS) and guarantees of origin to certify carbon reduction volumes.
CCFDs would fix an auction-determined level of income for companies that produce carbon allowance certificates linked to the market-driven price of the certificates on the European ETS. Instead of being subject to fluctuation in the carbon price, certificate producers – in this case, electrolyzer makers – would receive a publicly funded top up to the value of their certificates when the ETS-determined price is below the CCFD figure. When the ETS carbon price is higher than the CCFD strike price, the certificate holders would refund the difference back to the appropriate public fund.
Quotas could stipulate a minimum requirement of green hydrogen consumption, for example by European steelmakers, in conjunction with an EU carbon border. They could also mandate a certain volume of hydrogen be carried in European gas pipes, to reduce transport costs.
The hydrogen industry representatives called for an easing of state aid rules on large scale projects. The companies and investors also called for uniform hydrogen regulation across the EU, to help cross-border projects.
Standard contracts for hydrogen pipeline installation would be helpful, according to the EIB's “Unlocking the Hydrogen Economy” report, as would safety and pressure standards, particularly for transport and storage of the energy carrier. The EIB report states the European Union wants the bloc to have 6 GW of electrolyzed hydrogen production capacity by 2024 and 40 GW by 2030.
That will cost €24 billion ($25.8 billion) to €42 billion by 2030 for electrolyzers alone, the report stated, with the total hydrogen investment cost to 2030 “in the region of hundreds of billions of euros,” and the bill to mid century “as high as €470 billion.”
