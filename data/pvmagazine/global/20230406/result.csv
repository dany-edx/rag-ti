Indian Power Minister R.K. Singh says the government has decided to accept bids for 50 GW of renewable energy capacity per year from fiscal 2023-24 to fiscal 2027-28. The annual bids to set up renewable energy capacity for the inter-state transmission system will also include at least 10 GW of wind projects per year.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) finalized the plan at a recent meeting chaired by the power minister. The plan is in line with India’s target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel (renewable energy and nuclear) sources by 2030.
India had installed 168.96 GW of cumulative renewable energy capacity by Feb. 28, 2023. This includes 64.38 GW of solar power, 51.79 GW of hydro, 42.02 GW of wind, and 10.77 GW of bio power. About 82 GW is under various stages of implementation and about 41 GW is in the tendering stage. 
“The structured bidding trajectory will provide sufficient time to the RE developers to plan their finances, develop their business plans and manage the supply chain more efficiently,” said Singh.
The power ministry has also declared a quarterly bid plan for fiscal 2023-24. It will include bids for at least 15 GW of renewable energy capacity in each of the first and second quarters of the financial year, and at least 10 GW in each of the third and fourth quarters.
Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), NTPC, and NHPC are the government-notified “renewable energy implementing agencies” (REIAs) that can accept bids. The ministry has also decided to allow SJVN, a public sector enterprise under the government of India, to serve as one. 
The targeted bid capacity for fiscal 2023-24 will be allocated among the four REIAs. The REIAs will be allowed to bring out bids for solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid capacity, andn round-the-clock renewable power services with or without storage.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/06/bigger-modules-bigger-headaches/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RACKING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"APRIL 6, 2023","Bigger modules, bigger headaches?","From pv magazine Global 04/23
The year 2020 saw the launch of solar modules exceeding 500 W of rated power generation capacity, in a leap from the previous standard of between 400 W and 450 W.
The solar market experienced an unprecedented power-per-unit boost in comparison to the then-steady 10 W to 15 W, year-to-year, average power growth trend driven by cell efficiency improvements.
Manufacturers said the motivation behind this disruptive product innovation was economic and aimed at adjusting the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from solar by using fewer modules per megawatt-peak of generation capacity, as well as optimizing balance of systems (BOS) expenditure and other construction and operations and maintenance costs.
At module design level, just as mainstream passivated emitter, rear contact (PERC) cell efficiency was reaching its practical maximum, two key features defined the development of the new PV module technology paradigm.
The first was a transition from regular, 156.75 mm “M2,” 158.75 mm “M3,” and 166 mm “M6” silicon wafer cells to 182 mm “M10,” and 210 mm “M12” sizes, all presented in cut-like forms with multi-busbar connections.
Secondly, module-surface non-active regions were reduced via high-density cell layouts, implementing novel cell interconnection approaches such as cell paving and tiling or shingling.
Today, modules with 550 W-plus nominal power – based on 182 mm wafers – and 210 mm-based, 650 W-plus products, are mainstream options for utility scale sites, typically with bifacial cells. Such panels require more, and larger cells, meaning larger, heavier modules, higher currents and lower voltage values. That has resulted in the most pluralized range of cell-to-module options ever seen.
Like any new PV technology, large-format modules come with hotly debated benefits and downsides. Despite impressive performance, larger modules are still not clear of challenges in terms of controlled and reliable use.
Developers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies must consider the implications when deploying larger modules, including product quality and panel manufacturing processes, packaging and transportation, and tracker and inverter compatibility. These aspects must be taken into account before project design and procurement, to safeguard bankability.
In the factory, a key, still unsettled issue to tackle during the manufacturing of larger modules is the so-called “cross-crack defect,” which is detectable by electroluminescence testing. As mentioned before, larger solar modules are based on new PV cell interconnections which can enable the reduction of non-active areas between solar cells to up to just a few millimeters, which partially mitigates product enlargement.
Still, these novel welding processes might lead to tiny, cross-shaped cracks in the vicinity of cell edges, seldom reported by manufacturers as a formal product defect despite their widespread occurrence. Unless it is duly negotiated and improved during the supply-agreement negotiation phase, this subtle defect may imply major on-site micro-crack propagation risks. Stress arising during cell soldering and lamination, plus the potential presence of chips at the wafer’s cut edges, facilitate the formation of such small cracks which can harmfully propagate upon mechanical loading application.
Larger modules are intrinsically prone to significant body deflections and torsions, free from any International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) or Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards. This stems from big surface areas – often exceeding 3 m2 – with the use of aluminum frames thinner than the typical 35 mm used in 400 W designs, driven by the need to optimize module weight of up to 40 kg. Weight reduction compels 3.2 mm glass substrates to be switched to the current 2 mm-plus-2 mm, dual glass architecture. Merging variables including higher area, shorter frame width, and thinner but heavier glass means a weaker module.
Glass quality is indeed a current challenge to consider, underscoring the need for bill-of-materials evaluation and approval prior to module production. Most suppliers declare in their constructional data forms and other documents that both front and rear glass are tempered, even though a simple audit check reveals quite the opposite on many occasions. Datasheets are confusing about the type of thermal treatment used in glass manufacturing, if any was used at all. As a result, sudden and unusually regular glass breakage incidences on mounted modules, mostly affecting the rear glass substrates, are being reported in many PV plants worldwide.
The flash test measurement of bifacial larger modules deserves further consideration when defining supply power bin distributions. The common 5 W datasheet’s interval, within the same module series, remains unchanged since early PV industry times, when around three-times-lower-powered panels were used. This may lead to less controlled nameplate power and module class sorting distribution, especially if several nameplate values are involved in the supply agreement – questioning whether more than one nameplate power is actually needed – and often triggering eventual changes in the total quantity of panels to comply with the total purchased power.
 
Also, the virtually, not-so-properly-established plus or minus 3% flash test uncertainty standard – amounting to a 16.5 W difference in a 550 W module – can lead to greater difficulties in filing power warranty claims and in rejecting lower-power, pre-shipment, laboratory inspection results, limiting the success ratio if test conditions and acceptance criteria are not duly settled in the supply agreement.
Finally, when measuring a larger module, the spatial uniformity of solar simulators should be a basic checkpoint to report during factory inspections, to avoid systematic errors potentially affecting the whole power output under purchase. Likewise, the use of more and larger cells per module may tend to a certain bifacial coefficient scattered distribution, which could play a role in determining PV plant design. Fortunately, as per our extensive experience of auditing factories and inspecting larger modules, manufacturers are making efforts to control these aspects properly, especially in brand-new production workshops and lines that do not require flash test system retrofits.
Larger modules are defined by increased area and weight. Consequently, logistics are affected one way or another. For instance, turning from a 400 W, M6-based module to an M12’s 650 W-plus implies an extra 30% surface area and load to pack and transport by sea and road. Despite cargo costs gradually decreasing since the container crisis hit worldwide markets in recent years, module manufacturers have built up innovative box packaging designs to optimize the kilowatts-peak of generation capacity shipped to sites.
Two main features were considered. The placement of modules in a portrait disposition within the box, implying new handling and safety guidelines to consider; and the use of thinner aluminum frames, even if module areas beyond 3 m2 were involved. Weight excess is also relevant in some locations, including some US states, because of regulated restrictions for road transportation, leading to potential situations in which container filling is limited, leaving empty spaces inside that must be properly managed in advance, outside the factory.
Besides the aforementioned considerations and challenges ultimately impacting site activity and performance, a core concern was fast highlighted right after larger modules showed up on the market. That is, to what extent are solar trackers and inverters prepared for these devices?
The overall management of considerably bigger and heavier modules, based on lower voltages and greater currents, did bring about an intricate recipe to cook. At first, larger modules led to problematic situations requiring major re-engineering tasks, as the 400 W-based versions used at development stages were no longer available a couple of years later when construction activity was set to commence.
Fortunately, this is no longer a major issue to address unless the context is associated with revamping or repowering activity, which requires a change from much older module designs to larger solar PV panels.
For DC/AC inverters, one can arguably say that most inverter manufacturers have become well adapted to the management of high current values. High currents do not imply significant challenges any more, beyond paying attention to the proper match between a maximum admissible current per input or maximum power point tracker in a string inverter and the maximum current of module output, including bifacial gains.
The same cannot be said about solar trackers, a problem caused by the still-suboptimal collaboration between modules which come in a range of dimensions, and tracker manufacturers. EPC contractors complete the trio as they juggle to optimize risk-cost ratios in a context of increased structure height and wind-exposed area, regardless of the use of 1P or 2P orientation configurations.
Tracker suppliers must reconsider several variables to enhance structural stiffness and reduce mechanical aeroelastic effects. Structural stiffness can be enhanced by using thicker hardware and reinforcements, at a cost. Mechanical aeroelastic effects such as torsional galloping at particular tilt angles, at even moderate wind speeds, can also be improved. Wind tunnel testing is not always available and not all laboratories are ready to test larger modules. And the occurrence of abnormally frequent windstorm events related to climate change, even in historically calm locations, makes tracker design tougher than ever.
Additionally, the module’s cantilever and deflection effects remain uncontrolled and unregulated by IEC/UL standards and manufacturer installation guidelines, regardless of the use of panel rails, clamps, or bolts in a structure.
Finally, the well-known unique current-voltage characteristics of larger modules makes possible the arrangement of longer module strings, potentially optimizing project costs. Yet, in some cases, this feature may lead to design issues when trying to match the use of complete strings – based on 35 modules, for example – with tracker unit length.
Larger modules are here to stay as standard solar devices. Though all developers, EPC contractors, and technical advisors have been learning how to overcome the challenges stemming from the use of these big panels, there is an industry sentiment that module-area growth should cease at some point, and that PV module makers should eventually reach a standard product series that can be effortlessly adapted to any BOS equipment. The upcoming era of negatively-doped, n-type cells should pave the way to high-power modules based on device efficiency, rather than size.

The Swiss Federal Department for the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) has unveiled new amendments to the Energy Subsidy Ordinance (EnFV) and other energy laws for public consultation. Stakeholders now have until July 7 to comment on the planned adjustments, which are set to go into force on Jan. 1, 2024.
The Energy Subsidy Ordinance establishes that rebates for PV systems with outputs of up to 5 kW will have to be removed from the rebate scheme for rooftop PV. The Swiss authorities currently grant a one-time payment of CHF 200 ($221) to PV installations up to 5 kW in size.
Systems ranging in size from 5 kW to 30 kW are entitled to receive rebates of CHF 380 to CHF 440. However, this amount is also to be reduced by CHF 20 from 2024.
“As a result, the total remuneration for smaller, more expensive systems falls more than for larger systems,” said the Swiss Ministry of Energy. “This provides an incentive to build larger systems that use the entire suitable roof area for electricity generation if possible.”
On Jan. 1, the Swiss Confederation introduced a “high one-off payment” (HEIV) for solar, in addition to the other existing incentives models: the non-recurring remuneration for small installations (KLEIV), less than 100 kW, and the non-recurring remuneration for large installations (GREIV), more than 100 kW.

Astypalaia, an island in the Aegean Sea, has attracted attention in recent years because Volkswagen has selected it as a testbed for its smart mobility pilots. The German automaker and the Greek government launched a pilot project in 2021 to offer smart mobility services such as ride-sharing and car-sharing, based on electric vehicles. The smart mobility pilot will run for at least six years.
Critics have said that the island, which is home to about 1,500 permanent residents, still draws most of its electricity from diesel generators. However, that is now set to change.
PPC Renewables Chief Executive Konstantinos Mavros told pv magazine that construction of the solar-plus-storage plant is expected to start in about six months. The system will be fully operational in about 20 months and will cover half of Astypalaia’s electricity needs. Existing diesel generators will remain in place to power the rest of the island.
Mavros said that PPC Renewables is committed to expanding the hybrid project in about three to four years, to cover more than 80% of the island’s electricity needs. However, Astypalaia is not the only Greek island that is transitioning to a green and smart energy future. pv magazine recently presented a list of smart projects currently operating on the Greek isles of Naxos, Halki and Tilos, for example.
In 2021, the Greek government launched the “Gr-Eco Islands Initiative,” which aims to deploy green tech in the Aegean Sea archipelago. The initiative includes a broad map of intended sustainable actions and a €100 million ($99 million) investment pot, but the government has not published a policy framework yet that actually translates this initiative into a concrete set of policies and schemes. 
Transitioning to renewable energy, especially on small islands that are not linked to Greece’s mainland grid, is a key priority. But it is not just for environmental reasons, as generating electricity via diesel generators cost Greece millions of euros every year. All Greek electricity consumers pay for this via subsidies that could easily be phased out or significantly be eliminated via systems of renewable energy.

They claim the tech could be used for four-terminal (4T) and two-terminal (2T) tandem perovskite silicon solar cells.
“Such CSPCs consist of doped poly-Si, alloyed with carbon or oxygen, which are deposited on an ultra-thin SiOx layer, prepared by a wet-chemical process, thermal oxidation, UV/O3 process, or low-temperature plasma oxidation,” the scientists said, in reference to the new passivating contacts. “The optoelectronic properties of poly-SiOx depend on the oxygen content.”
The scientists built the cell with a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). They also used n-type and p-type poly-SiOx passivating contacts, which they deposited on the thermal oxide with a dual-stack layer of 10-nm thick intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer, via a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) process, and a 20-nm thick hydrogenated a-SiOx layer from the PECVD process.
“Silane (SiH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen (H2) gases are used as the sources to deposit these poly-SiOx passivating contacts,” they said, in reference to the manufacturing process. “Phosphine (PH3) and diborane (B2H6) gases are used as doping sources for n-type and p-type poly-SiOx passivating contacts, respectively.”
The team also used screen printing to gear the cell with low-temperature front and rear Ag-based metallic contacts. The best solar cell built with this configuration and a p-type wafer achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.47%, an open-circuit voltage of 95 mV, a short-circuit current of 36.68 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.33%. The diffusivity of hydrogen in p-type poly-Si, on the other hand. is lower than in n-type, which prevents the accumulation of excess hydrogen around the oxide which deteriorates the passivation quality.
When tested in tandem with a previously developed perovskite solar cell with an efficiency of 19.7%, the new cell respectively contributed to efficiencies of 28.1% and 23.2% in 4T and 2T cells.
The research group introduced its findings in “Crystalline silicon solar cells with thin poly-SiOx carrier-selective passivating contacts for perovskite/c-Si tandem applications,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The group includes academics from the Eindhoven University of Technology and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).
The TNO is also now developing a four-junction (4T) semi-transparent perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell. It is working in partnership with the Solliance consortium, which includes Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology, and Belgian research institute Imec. The device achieved a 30.1% power conversion efficiency in September.
A Dutch-German consortium led by the TNO is also trying to commercialize 2T perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell tech under FIT4Market, a four-year research project.

Flow Power, a Melbourne-based renewable energy retailer, says the “cutting-edge” Berri Energy Project – built on the site of a disused racecourse, about 240 kilometers northeast of Adelaide – has commenced commercial operations. The solar energy generation and storage facility will export 11,500 MWh of clean energy to the grid every year.
The Berri Energy Project comprises 5.8 MW of PV across 9,800 solar panels mounted on a single-axis tracking system, a 4.6 MVA inverter station and a 6.7 MWh DC-coupled battery energy storage system. It uses the same transformer and inverter for all 9,800 panels and 18 battery racks to export energy into the grid. A DC converter connects the inverter to the batteries, creating what Flow Power said is “the first fully operational utility-scale DC-coupled PV and battery energy storage system project in Australia.”
Flow Power says the Berri Energy Project will also provide frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) and voltage control services to ensure the stability and reliability of the local distribution network. Flow Power Chief Operating Officer Byron Serjeantson said the launch of commercial operations was “an exciting milestone as our first storage project and one of the first demonstrations of utility-scale DC-coupled storage in Australia.”
The project incorporates technology from Canadian Solar, SMA, Nextracker and CATL. It uses Flow Power’s own kWatch Controller technology, which allows users to remotely respond to market price signals, optimizing and automating the management of energy systems. Flow Power says the Berri Energy Project boosts its total renewable energy portfolio to almost 450 MW of owned and contracted wind, solar and storage projects.
The project is underpinned by a long-term power purchase agreement with Westpac. The bank said it is part of its commitment to source the equivalent of 100% of its electricity requirements in Australia from clean energy sources by 2025.
The agreement with Flow Power will provide up to 32.5 GWh of power from the Berri Energy Project and the Ararat Wind Farm, about 180 kilometres northeast of Melbourne in rural Victoria. Westpac also has a pact for supply from Spark Infrastructure’s Bomen Solar Farm near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales.
