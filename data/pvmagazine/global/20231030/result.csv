https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/30/cause-of-30-kwh-battery-explosion-in-germany-remains-unclear/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Investigators still uncertain about cause of 30 kWh battery explosion in Germany,"Around three weeks ago, the explosion of a 30 kWh battery storage system caused a stir in Lauterbach, in the central German state of Hesse. The system owner is an electronics technician specializing in energy and building services, with 20 years of professional experience.
His home was destroyed in the explosion and it has not been habitable since. It is now in acute danger of collapsing, which is why police and insurance investigators do not dare to enter. This makes it impossible to determine the cause of the explosion with 100% certainty. The house will soon be demolished.
The homeowner told pv magazine that the battery energy storage system consisted of three battery packs from Shenzhen Basen Technology. He bought two in June 2022 and an additional one in June 2023 via the Alibaba platform. They are the “BR-48200B” and “MY-381” models, each with 10 kWh of capacity based on LFP technology housed in a 19-inch cabinet.

The battery system was coupled with a 15.47 kW photovoltaic system, which the homeowner was about to expand to 19.565 kW. The cause of the explosion has yet to be clarified, and there were no electrical clues, according to the homeowner. Right before the accident, the battery’s state of charge (SOC) was 90.2% and the voltage stood at 52.41 V.
After the explosion, the basement – which housed both the boiler and the battery system – was filled with white smoke. However, there were “hardly any signs of fire” near the battery storage unit, according to the homeowner. “The inverters on the other side of the room look like new,” he said.
Long after the incident, the homeowner noticed an odor that he described as the smell of lithium. He is now trying to determine whether it is makes sense to carry out safety tests outdoors for outdoor-use devices, as the smoke can evaporate and be overlooked. Now, the question is which gas caused the explosion, whether it originated inside or outside the battery, and how it happened.
pv magazine contacted two scientists, but the were unable to comment on the specific incident due to the ongoing investigation. Egbert Figgemeier, chair of aging processes and battery lifetime prediction at RWTH Aachen, said that it is conceivable that the electrolyte in the cells broke down and an internal short circuit ignited the gases.
“An external ignition source is not necessary,” said Figgemeier.
He described the white smoke as the decomposition products of the electrolyte, which can also contain dangerous gases. Soot formation is not necessarily to be expected, as many components of the cells could burn without leaving any residue at high temperatures. So-called thermal runaway could have preceded the explosion and may have been the trigger.
Axel Durdel, a researcher at the Technical University of Munich, told pv magazine that in a “worst-case scenario,” an LFP battery could leak hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ethene, methane and other gases. There has been a lot of discussion about the possible formation of hydrogen with a subsequent explosion. In principle, this is possible, but whether the conditions for spontaneous combustion have been reached cannot be estimated, according to Durdel.
He said it is not known that batteries could cause such an explosion without a thermal reaction. In the case of thermal reaction, the internal pressure could increase due to undesirable side reactions, leading to an explosion and the release of hot gases.
“In the case of batteries with a lower energy density or a low state of charge, it is entirely possible that the gas does not ignite directly when it exits the battery, but that the ignition occurs through external ignition sources,” said Durdel.
In that case, there should be traces on the battery. However, this can no longer be verified because no one is allowed to enter the home due to the risk of collapse.
The storage owner has noted the problem of carrying out safety tests with lithium-ion storage devices outdoors. Figgemeier confirmed that such experiements are carried out in semi-open bunkers, rather than in closed rooms.
Durdel said that the standard-compliant safety tests for the lithium-ion cells are carried out almost exclusively in test rooms with appropriate filter systems. In principle, it is conceivable that gases could accumulate in the basement without an appropriate exhaust system. However, the scientist from the Technical University of Munich could not say whether this was sufficient for self-ignition.
Battery storage is generally safe when professionally installed and certified, with compatibility between systems ensured through testing and approval by inverter and battery manufacturers.
For integrated systems, this is done by the system integrator. The safety of these systems is evident in the low number of accidents reported among more than 1 million home battery storage installations in Germany. Monitoring systems, common among established manufacturers, further assist in the early detection of critical conditions.

The Chinese PV module manufacturer said in a press release that the efficiency results have been independently confirmed by the National PV industry Measurement and Testing Center. pv magazine was unable to contact the National PV Industry Measurement and Testing Center to verify the claim, as its website was down.
The research and development team developed “advanced metallization enhancement technology, high energy bulk material passivation technology and high-performance light trapping passivating contact technology” to achieve the milestone, said the company.
Jin Hao, chief technology officer for JinkoSolar, said the new conversion efficiency rating has broken previous n-type monocrystalline silicon solar cell company records. He said the company will continue to invest in research and development.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/30/risk-premiums-for-pv-projects-remain-stubbornly-high-in-india/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,INDIA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Risk premiums for PV projects remain ‘stubbornly high’ in India,"Two academics from the Swiss university ETH Zurich – Bjarne Steffen and Florian Egli – have told pv magazine that after conducting research with a consortium of other solar PV experts, their data shows India’s risk premiums for solar PV projects remains “stubbornly high.”
Steffen, an assistant professor of climate finance and policy, said that through the course of the study, published recently in the academic journal Energy Policy, their analysis reveals that for almost all the nine countries analyzed the cost of capital (CoC) has decreased over the last decade.
Risk premiums that investors demand on top of baseline interest rates were “significantly reduced,” he said, but there there are exceptions to this trend. “Stubbornly high CoC rates” remain in India, Steffen said, as shown in their analysis. Asked what impact this would have on the South Asian country, and why the risk premiums are elevated, Egli said the researchers did not investigate these issues for the study. “[We] can only say that the solar PV risk premium stayed relatively high in India contrary to other markets [and] this has a negative effect on the cost competitiveness of solar PV,” he said.
According to the study, there were a total of 573 solar PV projects completed in India from 2011-2020, amounting to 30.4 GW. “The results show that the CoC declines are mainly due to lower solar PV risk premiums whereas base rates have stayed roughly constant,” the paper stated. “Risk premiums have declined substantially in all countries but India.”

India is the third biggest solar PV market in the world. It recorded 62 MW of solar PV installed capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recent data published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and is increasingly ambitious with its renewable energy goals. The country’s most recent National Electricity Plan stated it wanted to reach 185.6 GW solar PV installed capacity by fiscal 2026-27, reaching 364.6 GW by fiscal 2031-32. But according to a recently published report by think tank Ember Climate, India needs to increase its current annual solar capacity by 36% each year to achieve these aims.
The researchers came to this conclusion by analyzing the realized prices of almost 4,000 solar PV auctions in a spate of countries across an almost decade-long period. The academics used the auction results to “re-engineer” the underlying CoC in projects, Steffen said. The countries selected for analysis vary in geography, investment environment and institutional setup. They are Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Jordan, South Africa, United Arab Emirates and the US. Getting a complete picture of the CoC in China was limited due to a “lack of data”, the researchers concede in the paper. “Data is scarce because [it is] often treated as trade secret,” Steffen said.
Egli, a senior researcher and lecturer, said that as interest rates rise, the cost of capital, as a key determinant for renewable energy cost competitiveness, is becoming “more important”. What he found “surprising” through the research, though, was that financing premiums of solar PV projects over a base rate – for example returns of government bonds – has decreased to approximately 100 basis points “or less” in several countries. “There is even a possibility of a negative premium, particularly in developing and emerging economies, which may be a silver lining for the transition,” Eglis said.
The aim of the work is to provide transparency around the financial machinations of solar PV projects. “More transparency can help governments to see CoC as a policy lever and motivate them to think about what could be done to reduce CoC,” Steffen said. Egli believes that policy remains “crucial” for the determination of financing premiums, and a way for this to be achieved is to ramp up the “demand” for the publication of financing costs after the realization of auctioned projects. This would, “enhance transparency and facilitate energy system planning worldwide,” he said.
The research paper, titled “Estimating the cost of capital for solar PV projects using auctions results”, was published in Energy Policy this month. It was penned by researchers from ETH Zurich, Princeton University in New Jersey and IRENA in Germany.

The smallest product is the BM210H-120DG, which the manufacturer said is available in nine versions with a power output ranging from 625 W to 665 W. Its efficiency spans from 22.08% and 23.50%, with the open-circuit voltage being between 45.13 V and 46.48 V. The short-circuit current ranges from 17.31 A and 17.79 A.
This module measures 2,172 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm and weighs 35.3 kg.
The largest module is titled ‘BM210H-132DG' and comes in nine versions with an output of 690 W to 730 W and an efficiency of 22.21% to 23.50%. Its open-circuit voltage is between 49.82 V and 51.09 V and the open-circuit current spans from 17.31 A and 17.79 A.
This product is 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm in size and weighs 38.7 kg.
Both panels are made with a frame based on anodized aluminum alloy, 2.0 mm anti-reflection tempered glass and 210 mm n-type heterojunction solar cells. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and a maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The company offers a 39-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 90.3% of the nominal output power.
Boamax is based in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, where it operates solar cell and module manufacturing facilities with a combined capacity of 5 GW.

According to Rystad Energy modeling, new solar capacity additions are on track to grow 30% year on year, surpassing 58 GW (DC) of new panels by the year’s end.
After briefly conceding top position to Spain last year, Germany is retaking the lead with a projected 84% annual growth this year, reaching a record high of 13.5 GW of total solar PV capacity. Meanwhile, Spain faces challenges in maintaining momentum this year, despite its record-breaking performance in 2022.
Other key markets include Poland and the Netherlands, with their growth fueled by a surge in rooftop installations. Rooftop PV is expected to account for 70% of all newly installed solar across the continent.
“Rooftop solar is driving the transformation of Europe's renewable energy landscape, from a niche market to a powerful force in reshaping the continent's energy mix,” said Vegard Wiik Vollset, vice president and head of EMEA renewables research at Rystad Energy.
Contrasting solar’s success story, wind energy – including onshore and offshore, both of which were previously on a robust growth path – has faced hurdles that could hinder its expansion.
Due to permitting bottlenecks and rising supply chain costs, Rystad Energy forecasts a 11% drop in onshore wind installations in 2023 compared to last year. Offshore wind capacity is expected to grow this year, but only by 2% due to project delays.
Previously, a report presenting the RepowerEU plan’s progress one year after its launch, said the European Union will add 69 GW of solar and wind capacity in 2023, representing a 17% increase year-on-year.
A separate report from Aurora Energy Research released in June said Europe is on track to install 475 GW of solar power generation capacity by 2030 – more than double the continent’s current installed capacity. This will require more than EUR 145 billion ($153.4 billion)  investment, the analysts have calculated.
“Solar power is set to become the largest source of power generation globally by 2027 and to account for 65% of worldwide renewable capacity growth in 2023,” Aurora Energy Research said in its first dedicated European Solar Market Attractiveness Report.
According to BloombergNEF, the 2023 global solar installations will grow by 56% year on year to a “record high” volume of nearly 400 GW driven by falling prices of solar modules and the rapid buildup of PV projects in China and elsewhere.
In its flagship report World Energy Outlook, released earlier this month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that this year alone renewables generation capacity additions will exceed 500 GW globally, with $1 billion per day spent on solar deployment.
Renewables are set to contribute 80% of new power capacity to 2030 in the stated policies scenario (STEPS), with solar PV alone accounting for more than half of this, according to the IEA report.
“Solar has become a major global industry and is set to transform electricity markets even in the STEPS. But there is significant scope for further growth given manufacturing plans and the technology’s competitiveness,” the IEA writes.
By the end of the decade, the world could have manufacturing capacity for more than 1 200 GW of panels per year, according to the IEA. But in the STEPS, only 500 GW is deployed globally in 2030 – less than half of the module nameplate capacity potentially available for deployment.

Inlyte Energy, the recipient of $8 million in seed funding, was founded by Dr. Antonio Baclig, who incubated the company as a 2021 Activate Fellow in partnership with the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Since that time, Inlyte Energy has been on an upward trajectory, securing an ARPA-A award, acquiring Beta Research, being named to the 2023 Cleantech 50 to Watch, and now receiving a funding boost from At One Ventures.
The California-based company aims to use the seed funding to develop the first generation of its grid batteries made with the most abundant materials: iron and table salt.
The 2022 acquisition of UK-based Beta Research moves Inlyte e3nergy many steps closer to design and manufacturing, as the scientists at Beta Research originally developed a sodium metal halide battery more than 40 years ago and brought the technology to commercial readiness and manufacturing capacity. Beta Research has a pilot production line that will enable Inlyte Energy to begin manufacturing, once the optimized design is complete.
“The experience of the Beta Research team and their facilities give Inlyte a significant advantage compared to other battery startups in this space. They don’t need to find a pilot factory, get the tooling, or figure out how to manufacture,” said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. “Inlyte’s ability to compete with lithium-ion on lifetime, round-trip efficiency, and of course upfront cost also gives them a significant opportunity in a market that’s exploding right now.”
The battery chemistry is sodium metal halide, which Inlyte says can “create an energy storage system with high efficiency, long lifetime, competitive energy density, excellent safety, and at an ultra-low cost.” An advantage the chemistry has over conventional lithium batteries is the ability to operate in extreme heat or cold, said the company.
The target market for Inlyte Energy’s batteries is the diurnal energy storage market, with a storage duration of four to 10 hours. The company says this makes them appropriate for grid storage and other industrial applications.

As mentioned in a recently published academic article, the cell utilizes buffer layers made of transition metal oxides (TMOs) intended to protect the cell during the sputtering of indium tin oxide (ITO) in the cell production process.
The scientists tested, in particular, two different evaporated transition metal oxides (TMOs) – molybdenum oxide (MoOx) and vanadium oxide (V2Ox) – and found the former provided the best performance.
The buffer layer was tested in a cell built with a substrate made of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on carbon–titanium dioxide (C/TiO2) and a photocatalyst containing mesoporous titanium dioxide (m-TiO2). It also featured a perovskite absorber, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA) and an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.
Through a series of tests, the research team found that the ITO sputtering affects the PTAA layer and its interfaces with the perovskite absorber and the ITO electrode, respectively.
The ITO deposition process was optimized, balancing the UV plasma effect and the ion bombardment effect, and complete suppression of sputtering damage was achieved with the introduction of an evaporated TMO atop the PTAA layer,” the academics said in the paper. “The use of ultrathin protective buffer layers (2.5 nm for V2Ox or 7.5 nm for MoOx) effectively mitigated the sputtering damage effects.”
The cell fabricated with the V2Ox buffer layer achieved an efficiency of 15.65% and that based on MoOx reached 16.44%.
“We successfully demonstrated that the protective buffer layer is effective at suppressing the sputtering damage also in thinner perovskite-based perovskite solar cells for BIPV application, without impairing the average visible transmittance (AVT),” the paper said.
The cell design is introduced in the paper “Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cells with Ultrathin Protective Buffer Layers,” published in ACS Publications.

Star Scientific has committed AUD 100 million ($63.45 million) to establish a new clean hydrogen research and manufacturing base in New Mexico as it looks to target the North American market with its Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser (HERO) technology, whicb catalyzes hydrogen and oxygen to rapidly create industrial-scale heat without burning the gases and without generating greenhouse gases.
Star Scientific, headquartered i New South Wales, formalized the announcement by signing a letter of intent with the New Mexico state government.
Star Scientific Chairman Andrew Horvath said the document commits the company to an intensive process to secure a suitable site in Albuquerque where it plans to invest $100 million to create a sprawling research and manufacturing complex.
“The facility in New Mexico will mirror the facility we will build in Australia, and it will service customers in the United States, Canada and, initially South America,” Horvath said. “We will be developing GHG-free process-heat systems for industry and stand-alone power systems while continuing research on other projects.”
Star Scientific, which has a research and development facility in Berkeley Vale, New South Wales, and another office in Switzerland, is seeking to advance the rollout of its HERO technology. The coating substance can be applied to ceramics or certain metals and which, upon contact with hydrogen and oxygen, increases in temperature from 0 C to above 700 C in three minutes.
Hovath said the technology can be used for off-grid power, desalination, and heavy industrial production where high temperatures are needed.
“Because it’s not burning, it’s a reaction, all that energy is excitement energy and it goes straight through the substrate. So our energy transfer is above 90% into whatever you’re transferring it to, whether it’s water, CO2, whatever medium,” he said. “HERO allows us to make saturated steam for energy production, or in fact any sort of heat-driven energy production – be it in industry, be it in food or be it in mass energy production.”
Star Scientific said it is looking to acquire about 20 hectares in Albuquerque where it plans to construct up to 10 buildings for administration, design, testing, manufacturing as well as laboratory research.
The company expects to employ about 200 people at the facility and is currently in negotiations with the New Mexico Economic Development Department for an incentive package that would include assistance from the Job-Creation Fund under the Local Economic Development Act, as well as assistance for job training.
Horvath said he is hopeful the company can break ground in New Mexico in late 2024.

This metric is commonly used by project developers to assess the expected power output of a PV system over its installed life.
As touted in a recently published academic paper, the researchers said that there is currently no standardized approach for PLR measurements, noting that different methods applied to date have resulted in highly varying PLRs. “In our study, various methods for each calculation step are considered and carefully analyzed, resulting [in] over 1600 filter-metric-aggregation-model combinations to calculate the PLR, thus contributing to global efforts to develop standardized and reliable PLR calculation frameworks,” the paper explained.
The group applied the proposed methodology to vertical bifacial PV systems operating in Nordic conditions. These systems are characterized by large seasonal variations in temperature, solar radiation and daytime length.
The experimental setup consisted of an east-west oriented vertical array equipped with power, temperature, and plane-of-array (POA) irradiance sensors, wind speed and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) sensors and a weather station. Measurements taken resulted in a minute-level, long-duration and high-resolution dataset.
“Each module has a DC-DC optimizer to keep the module at maximum power point (MPP), a DC energy meter (EM) to measure the DC current and voltage, and a T-type thermocouple (TC) attached to the front side to measure module surface temperature,” the paper said. “The POA irradiance is monitored by two reference cells (RCs) at the top of the modules, one facing east and the other facing west.”
The method excludes data that are non-relevant in terms of performance analysis, affected by system malfunctions, or recorded under conditions that are hard to model or not suitable for a given performance model. “This includes, for instance, nighttime, sensor issues, shadows, and low irradiance conditions,” the paper said.
The novel approach is reportedly able to obtain a benchmark PLR of -1-46%/year. “The year-on-year method with a daily/weekly aggregated temperature- and irradiance-corrected performance model was found robust and reliable to Nordic high seasonality,” the researchers said in the paper. “In contrast, several commonly used methods, such as the PVUSA model, produced unrealistic results.”
They presented the novel approach in the paper “Comparing methods for the long-term performance assessment of bifacial photovoltaic modules in Nordic conditions,” published in Renewable Energy.
The same research group unveiled in July a methodological workflow to boost electricity yield in bifacial vertical PV systems that are connected to low-voltage (LV) grids located at high latitudes and have different panel locations, orientations, and technologies.
