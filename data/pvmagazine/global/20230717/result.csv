A fire July 8 destroyed an industrial building equipped with a PV system in Vétroz, Switzerland. The local police published several videos of the blaze on its Twitter account. They reported that the fire required the intervention of 140 firefighters and two helicopters.
The fire also destroyed a truck and smoke spread across nearby areas, triggering an alert from local authorities, who are still investigating the causes of the fire.
A week after the accident, the municipality of Vétroz stated that civil protection completed its mission to control and clean up residues and slag, including pieces of the PV system.
“The prohibition of grazing and fodder harvesting in the area concerned is therefore lifted,” the municipality said. “The measure had been enacted in view of the risks that these residues represent for animals that could have ingested them.”

The proposed system combines a solar thermal plant based on parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) connected to water storage and a photovoltaic facility coupled to a sand-based high-temperature heat storage system. The two facilities are planned to provide heat separately to the same industrial facility, with the PV unit being used when the solar thermal plant is unable to meet the heating demand.
The scientists explained that the operation of the solar thermal plant should always be prioritized as it generates steam at the most economical heating cost. Furthermore, they said the system should also rely on a third backup heating system, like a typical commercial boiler, which should only be used when both solar installations are insufficient to meet the heating demand.
The group modeled the hybrid system with TRNSYS software, which is used to simulate the behavior of transient renewable systems. It then used Python software to simulate the interaction of the solar collector and the load.
Four different scenarios were investigated: a reference case where heat is provided exclusively by the conventional boiler; a system configuration based on the boiler and the solar thermal plant coupled to water storage; a hybrid system using the boiler and the PV plant linked to sand storage; and a system using both solar technologies connected to their respective storage systems.
The researchers assumed the system and the industrial building to be located in Sevilla, southern Spain.
Through their techno-economic analysis, they found the fourth system configuration using both solar technologies provides the lowest levelized cost of heat (LCOH) of €83.5 ($93.9)/MWh. The highest LCOH was offered by the system based on the conventional boiler alone at €100/MWh, while the system based on PV steam generation without solar thermal energy achieved an LCOH of €90/MWh. The system based on solar thermal energy without PV reached an LCOH of €84/MWh.
“In a combined system, the PTC and PV systems complement each other to achieve better economic and land area performance, while also achieving a very high combined solar fraction,” the scientists said, adding that this hybrid system provides the best area savings of approximately 20,000 m2. They also emphasized that the solar thermal unit is able to meet 30% of the industrial facility's heating demand, with the PV unit and the boiler covering 60% and 10%, respectively.
They introduced the system in the study “Techno-economic assessment of a novel hybrid system of solar thermal and photovoltaic driven sand storage for sustainable industrial steam production,” published in Energy Conversion and Management. The research team comprises scientists from the Dalarna University in Sweden, Finnish sand storage system provider Polar Night Energy Oy, and Sweden-based solar thermal specialist Absolicon Solar Collectors AB.
Polar Night Energy developed a sand storage system that pv magazine reported about in July 2022. The system is embedded in a high steel container and is able to store electricity in the form of heat for several months at temperatures ranging between 500 C and 600 C. The system uses common dry sand without any special treatment as the storage medium and works with pipes containing air. When this air is heated up, it is pumped through the pipes and reaches the sand, which is in turn heated up to up to 600 C.

With better raw material costs, enhanced safety, and better sustainability credentials, sodium-ion holds a promise of easing the strain on lithium-ion’s supply chains.
As global commercialization efforts for sodium-ion batteries intensify, IDTechEx forecasts that by 2025, around 10 GWh of sodium-ion batteries will be installed as significant manufacturing capacities come online and existing lithium-ion lines are converted to sodium-ion production.
At a CAGR of 27%, sodium-ion is forecast to grow to just under 70 GWh in 2033, says the UK-based market research company. “There may be potential for more rapid growth than forecast once the technology is trusted, qualified, bankable, and available,” it added.
Earlier forecast from Wood Mackenzie is more conservative. According to the US-owned Scottish data company, sodium-ion batteries are expected to replace some of the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) share in passenger electric vehicles and energy storage, reaching 20 GWh by 2030 in the base-case scenario.
Presently, production is mainly limited to pilot plants, and a few smaller factories are starting up. However, IDTechEx calculates that “the capacities that have been publicly announced by various raw material manufacturers alone add up to well over 100 GWh over the next three years.”
IDTechEx said in its latest report that it has identified around 15 companies developing their own Na-ion battery technologies. It has also analyzed patents and found that China is taking the lead once again.
For instance, battery industry heavyweight CATL rolled out its first-generation sodium-ion battery in 2021, with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg. Earlier this year, it confirmed that China's Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
HiNa Battery, which was spun off from the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017, became the world’s first company to switch on a gigawatt-hour sodium-ion battery production line last year. It also revealed plans to expand the capacity to 5 GWh.
Last week, BYD’s subsidiary FinDreams said it had found a partner in Huaihai Holding Group to begin producing sodium-ion batteriesin the Xuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone in the Jiangsu province. In a press release, the companies said the joint venture will be the world’s largest supplier of sodium-ion batteries for mini and micro vehicles.
Until now, sodium-ion batteries have mainly been used in electric two-wheelers and for stationary energy storage due to their lower energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries. Sodium-ion is three times heavier than its lithium counterpart and has a lower redox potential, which results in at least 30% lower energy density.
Sodium-ion batteries are quoted to be between 20% and up to 40% cheaper, but the challenge is bringing the technology to scale. Therefore, significant saving over lithium-ion batteries is unlikely, at least initially.
According to IDTechEx research, the average cell cost for Na-ion batteries is $87/kWh taking different chemistries into account. By the end of the decade, the production cost of Na-ion battery cells using primarily iron and manganese is likely to bottom out at around $40/kWh, which would be around $50/kWh at the pack level, the company calculates.

Back in 2010, I was in charge of building the solar business for a well-known corporation. Me and my team successfully grew that business to be an industry leader in just a few years. From 2019 to 2022, I was appointed to lead an AI computing business and achieved excellent results once again. These experiences allow me to view the renewable energy sector from a different perspective.
The solar energy industry has witnessed significant growth and transition over the past two decades, with grid parity achieved in numerous countries. The industry is experiencing a pivotal shift in focus to energy storage, and in recent years, we’re starting to see explosive growth in global shipments of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs). Meanwhile, artificial intelligence, especially the remarkable potential unleashed by ChatGPT, presents unprecedented opportunities for widespread applications across industries. The energy sector could undergo accelerated transformation by integrating AI to enhance efficiency and create customer value. I believe the biggest innovations ahead will be AI-empowered ESSs to improve customer experience.
Firstly, battery safety issues and quality risk. Unsafe solutions can be disastrous, and we’ve already seen recalls and fire accidents in many countries. Secondly, time-consuming, labor intensive, and costly installation is a problem, especially in Europe where labor cost is high and installers are in serious shortage. The third challenge is low system integration and performance, particularly when devices of different brands are pieced together. Not only does it not look great, but it also creates compatibility issues with potential for system failure. The last challenge is the low level of system intelligence ─ data is loosely captured and reported for system monitoring, but never effectively processed nor utilized to make the system smarter.

“The cell could be used for all conventional PV systems, as well as for vehicle-integrated solar (VIPV) and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV),” the research's corresponding author, Ding Yong, told pv magazine.
The cell uses a 2D perovskite layer at the interface between the perovskite and the hole transport layer, which the researchers said can improve charge-carrier transport/extraction while suppressing ion migration. Cells with this architecture usually exhibit large exciton binding energies and are generally more stable than conventional 3D devices due to the protection provided by the organic ligands. 
“The interlaminar molecules in 2D perovskites can effectively saturate the 3D perovskite surface to reduce surface defects during the fabrication process, leading to the formation of a potential energy offset for field-effect passivation,” the scientists stated.
The group built the cell with a substrate made of tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer made of titanium oxide (TiO2) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), a 3D perovskite layer, a 2D perovskite layer, a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, and a metal contact based on gold (Au).
To fabricate the 2D perovskite absorber, the academics used a precursor known as n-butylammonium iodide (BAI), which they claimed can increase the layer's activation energy to 0.52 eV. “This increase is usually attributed to the larger migration energy owing to the large distance between the interlayer spacings of the 2D perovskite,” they further explained.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.32%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.159 V, and a fill factor of 83.9%. For comparison, a reference device without the 2D layer achieved an efficiency of 23.02%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.120 V, and a fill factor of 78.9%.
“The efficiency value of 25.32% obtained is record-breaking for 2D/3D perovskite-based perovskite solar cells,” the team said, noting that the device was also able to retain 90% of its initial values after 2000 h of operation.
Using this cell, the scientists also built a mini module that reached an efficiency of 21.39%, an open-circuit voltage of 9.416 V, and a fill factor of 80.3%. “We believe that these modules may potentially achieve an efficiency of around 23%,” Yong said. “Their commercial production can be expected in three years. We estimated the costs of the cells at $0.02/kWh, and the energy payback time is 6 months.”
The cell technology is introduced in the paper “Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules,” published in Advanced Materials. The research group is also formed by scientists coming from the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) and the Peking University in China.

Norsun said it will use the funds to quadruple the capacity of its n-type mono wafer and ingot plant to 3 GW in Årdal, western Norway, powered by hydroelectric capacity. Wafer production is very energy-intensive and the use of hydropower significantly reduces the ecological footprint of PV modules. The Oslo-based company currently has a production capacity of 1 GW.
“The EU sees NorSun and Norway as a strategic resource to rebuild the European solar value chain and has therefore chosen to provide direct support to this industry in Norway. 3 GW of new capacity provides a quadrupling of current capacity,” the company said in a statement.
Norsun said it is aso preparing the technical and commercial details on a 5 GW plant in the United States, in addition to its Norwegian facility.
Midsummer said it will invest the funds in a 200 MW CIGS module plant near Stockholm. The company will deploy its own DUO production equipment at the facility.
“Midsummer makes the thin film deposition equipment ourselves, but back-end equipment like screenprinters, testers, sorters, tabbing and stringers, will be purchased from third party suppliers,” Sven Lindström, CEO, Midsummer, told pv magazine.
Midsummer, which specializes in building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and rooftop modules, also has a 50 MW factory under construction in Italy. It raised about a third of the financing from national grants and low-interest loans. “
We expect to be ready to sign with EU by the end of the year. Locations in Sweden have been focused around the area of lake Mälaren,” Lindström said.
The EU Innovation Fund funded several other PV manufacturing expansion projects recently, such as the 3 GW project by Enel Green Power in Italy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/17/texas-curtailed-9-of-solar-generation-in-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 17, 2023",Texas curtailed 9% of solar generation in 2022,"From pv magazine USA
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) curtailed 5% of its wind generation and 9% of its solar generation in 2022.
Power curtailment is the deliberate reduction in output that otherwise could have been produced. It typically occurs when supply exceeds demand and wholesale power prices drop to zero or even negative. It is a common occurrence for solar and wind energy, as these technologies have intermittent cycles of generation, requiring a different set of engineering solutions to support them.
Two main constraints in Texas are leading to high levels of curtailment: lack of transmission and energy storage. Utility-scale Texas solar facilities are often built in the western part of the state, where land is less expensive and solar irradiance is higher. Much of this huge amount of generation is transmitted to cities in the east, passing through bottlenecks in the grid along the way.
Constraints in transmission can be alleviated in four ways. First, more transmission can be built, leading to less bottlenecks in the grid. However, this task is not inexpensive. Currently, there are $7.46 billion of future transmission improvement projects that are expected to be put into service between 2022 and the end of 2027, according to ERCOT. These costs will be passed on to home and business owners in the form of utility bill increases.
A second strategy to alleviate constraints and cut curtailments is the installation of energy storage. Storage facilities can “time shift” or store low-cost, off-peak energy, and discharge it during periods of high demand. Battery energy storage can provide additional support to electricity grids to manage demand through ancillary services, managing load, congestion, and resiliency services. At the 2022 RE+ conference in San Antonio, solar and storage developer 8minute Energy shared that 95% of revenues in a two-hour duration battery occur in the first hour of discharge in Texas.
A third method that is discussed less often in the booming utility-scale state of Texas is a more conscious choice of where to site projects and how to right-size them for the most benefit. Rather than building massive low-cost solar facilities that deliver lowered value and require billions in transmission upgrades, solar projects can be installed in a distributed fashion, bringing them closer to where the energy is in demand.
This allows generation to be installed at the distribution level, sending electricity over shorter distances and lowering line losses. It also alleviates the congested transmission superhighway, creating a more dynamic grid. This is especially true when distributed solar is installed with co-located energy storage, which enables revenue-creating demand response services and virtual power plants.
As a fourth strategy, at times of “surplus” renewable generation, customers with flexible demand for electricity can use more electricity that would otherwise be curtailed.
In a grid the size of Texas, at 15% renewable generation flexible demand could yield $3.3 billion in annual net savings for all consumers, including those with non-flexible demand, says the ESIG report by Michael Hogan, citing a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory study.
About 80% of cost reductions yielding those annual savings would result from avoided costs of investing in infrastructure – generation capacity, transmission and distribution hardware.
With increasing adoption of “inherently flexible loads” such as EVs and heat pumps, there is a growing potential for price-responsive demand, according to the report. To avoid unnecessary infrastructure investments and capture the cost savings, the ESIG calls for progressively assessing and incorporating expected demand elasticity into long-term capacity planning and procurement, at both the bulk system and distribution levels, among other measures.
The constraint problem in Texas will likely need to be solved in a combination of all three strategies. EIA projects that if no improvements are made to the ERCOT grid, curtailments of wind could reach 15% and solar as high as 19%.
About 64% of the wind and solar curtailments in EIA analysis occurred when the energy supply from high wind and solar resources outpaced low system electricity demand. An increase in demand, such as through battery charging, could potentially reduce these types of curtailments, said EIA.

Pegasus Solar has unveiled InstaFlash, a new roof mount for solar installations on composite shingles. The mount is pre-installed with a watertight sealant designed to address roof irregularities and seal any missed pilot holes, cracked shingles and shingle seams. 
It said the mount is designed to make it easy-to-install in a variety of composite roof configurations and weather conditions. The sealant instantly deploys when the mount is fastened to the roof, instantly creating a watertight seal. It seals any potential water ingress points under the entire footprint of the base. 
Kai Stephan, chief executive officer of Pegasus Solar said that InstaFlash is “new guy proof,” as it “virtually eliminates the potential for user-error.” 
The non-hardening sealant is housed in a cage that contains where the sealant spreads when deployed, preventing any messes and directing the material to the point where it is needed. InstaFlash can be installed in freezing temperatures or extreme heat (0 F to 170 F) and can be installed in rain without leaks.
For sloped roofs it can be installed on composition shingle or rolled asphalt, and for flat roofs it can be mounted on modified bitumen or built-up roofs. 
“When a fastener lands in the so-called ‘slot-canyon’ between shingles, water can pass under a rigid tape, mastic or rubber-type barrier,” said Kai Stephan, chief executive officer of Pegasus Solar. “We realized we needed a semi-liquid sealant to fully penetrate and seal this gap to eliminate any potential for leaks.”
The mount comes with a 25-year warranty, is IBC and CBC code compliant, and UL certified. Full specification sheet can be found here. 
“We approached this design from a clean slate,” said Stephan. “The guiding principle was, ‘What are the toughest challenges for a comp roof mount, and how can we solve those challenges with a product that’s easy enough for the newest installer to master?’”
Pegasus Solar also provides rail systems, tile scissor mounts, tilt leg kits, tile replacements, conduit and accessory mounts, MLPE brackets, and wire management systems.
