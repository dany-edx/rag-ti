The guide will focus on onshore renewable wind, solar PV, and hydro energy projects at first, but might be extended to other renewable energy sources in the future.
“The same licensing steps will be laid out for projects of any technology,” Diogo Carvalheda, head of communication at APREN, told pv magazine. “The guide aims to illustrate how to obtain production and exploration licenses, showing the various steps required to approve renewable power plant projects, especially wind and photovoltaic.”
Lengthy, unpredictable, and unclear licensing processes are one of the major obstacles to the expansion of solar and other renewables in Portugal. The guide therefore aims to streamline the processes. Project developers, the guide’s main target group, will find information on how to develop projects according to the legal criteria of the licensing process.
“The large number of applications with significant discrepancies between the levels of preparation by different developers with more or less experience and preparation is another reason why the current licensing process is so lengthy in Portugal,” said Carvalheda.
The standardization of the application process for developers will facilitate the analysis of applications and accelerate the entire licensing process, he explained.
APREN is developing the guide in collaboration with the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) and the General Directorate of Energy and Geology (DGEG). The dissemination of information at the municipal level will be indispensable to the success of the guide in expediting the licensing process in Portugal. According to Maria José Espírito Santo, deputy director of DGEG, “some municipalities are acting as an obstacle to many processes, not only for lack of a timely response, but often for lack of knowledge.”
The national and local government bodies involved in the process will ultimately determine how quickly the licensing guide will be applied after its conclusion by the end of the year, Carvalheda told pv magazine. He said APREN expects the process to be “relatively quick,” given that the two main entities responsible for approving renewables projects are already involved.

Alsym Energy has emerged from stealth mode to introduce a battery storage solution that will provide the performance of lithium-ion batteries at a fraction of the cost, and without the inherent risk of fire. While we know that the cathode is primarily manganese oxide, the anode is a different metal oxide, and the electrolyte is water-based, the company has not yet disclosed the exact battery chemistry. It has indicated, however, that the battery uses no lithium, cobalt or nickel to avoid the problems associated with material supply and cost.
The company said it expects the batteries to cost less than half of current lithium-based batteries. An added benefit is that the batteries are easier to recycle because of the use of non-toxic materials.
“We’re seeing global competition to bring new batteries to market. Most companies are focused primarily on performance and put little thought into also making their batteries safer and more cost-effective – especially for the developing world where consumers are more price-sensitive,” said Nitin Nohria, PhD, chairman of Alsym Energy’s board of business advisors and former Dean of the Harvard Business School. “The team at Alsym Energy is working to ensure that their batteries not only meet performance expectations at reduced cost, but also avoid most of the supply chain challenges associated with lithium-based technologies.”
Founded in 2015, Alsym raised $32 million to date from investors including Helios Climate Ventures. The company’s team of scientists and product developers, based in Massachusetts, is currently developing a 500 kWh prototype manufacturing facility. Alsym said its batteries can be manufactured in existing lithium-ion battery factories with little to no retrofitting required and without the need for expensive dry rooms, fire locks, and solvent recovery systems.
Alsym has partnered with an automaker based in India in a joint effort to develop the batteries for EVs. The automaker is expected to contract with Alsym to supply a minimum of 3 GWh of battery systems annually, providing that key performance levels are being met. Alsym said it is in discussion with marine shipping and electric two-wheeler companies to develop similar partnerships.

New Delhi-based Ornate Solar has commissioned India’s largest building-integrated rooftop solar system in Bhagru, Rajasthan. The 530 kWp InRoof system will help Canada-based natural stone manufacturer Pangaea Natural Stone to meet its net-zero goals by offsetting 18,346 tons of CO2 emissions.
The system serves as the primary roof over Pangaea Natural Stone’s newly constructed production facility. It covers a total roof area of 35,000 square feet, thereby saving 124,968 kg of CO2 that would have been emitted in the production of the steel roof.
Ornate Solar designed, engineered and manufactured the system in India. It was subjected to 18 months of tests before commercial deployment. The company claims that its InRoof system is the industry’s first universal structural solution to integrate panels of any shape and size to replace conventional metal roofs.
“InRoof PV can replace metal sheets traditionally used as roofing for industrial factories and can serve as a PV integrated roof,” Ornate Solar Director Aditya Goel told pv magazine.

The InRoof system features microinverters from Enphase Energy. The microinverters come with a 15-year replacement warranty and are aligned with the highest international safety standards.
Canadian Solar supplied 1,175 high-efficiency mono PERC solar panels to generate energy and act as an integrated roofing element, replacing trapezoidal sheets. The indigenously developed InRoof structure consists of special-purpose roll-formed continuous (SRFC) sections made from a high-strength steel alloy resistant to corrosion and oxidation.
Anodized aluminium profiles provide two-layer protection against water ingress and distribute the static loads of the PV panels across the building purlins. Precision-engineered structural members have been used to build walkways and ridge profiles that interlock seamlessly with the PV panels and ensure a 100% guarantee against water leakage.
“Roof-integrated solar systems designed with [our] proprietary architecture can accommodate 26% more solar panels than traditional roof-mounted systems and have shown to generate over 4% to 8% more energy, due to free air circulation which lowers module backsheet temperatures by up to 15 C,” said Goel.
The InRoof system can also be used for solar parking lots, canopies and facades. Existing parking spaces and sheds can be retrofitted easily with the InRoof components compatible with most prefab steel structure designs.
The company has invested in manufacturing the required components at its production facility in New Delhi. It is also developing a plug-and-play version of the InRoof system for premium residential households, which can be installed on terraces and balconies. It is expected to hit the Indian market by December.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/20/pilot-vertical-rooftop-pv-system-comes-online-in-norway/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORWAY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 20, 2022",Vertical rooftop PV pilot goes online in Norway,"Norwegian startup Over Easy Solar AS has finalized the first pilot project to use its vertical solar module technology for rooftop applications.
“The 5 kW system was deployed in a school building in Oslo,” CEO  Trygve Mongstad told pv magazine. “We applied our modularized solution at a height of 31.4 cm above the rooftop with no need for ballast or fastening, and we are now validating it for application in each building and local wind conditions.”
The PV system is owned by Oslo municipality, which provided support through its Smart Oslo innovation fund. The system will be used mainly for self-consumption and will also sell excess power at spot prices to the grid under Norway's net metering scheme.
“The orientation we chose here gives a peak at around 11 am in the morning, and a second peak at around 7 pm in the afternoon,” Mongstad explained, referring to the advantages of deploying vertical solar arrays at high latitudes. “There is most activity here early in the day and in the evening when the school is used for other extracurricular activities.”
Andreas Nilsen, energy and environmental adviser for municipal enterprise Oslobygg, said the energy production matches the school's demand profile “perfectly.”
Over Easy Solar used 150 of its special solar panels, which are based on heterojunction solar cell technology. They have an efficiency of 22% and a bifaciality of up to 92%. Their temperature coefficient is -0.26 C. The panels were installed in 50 vertical PV units.
The units consist of a mounting system and solar panels in a single pre-assembled piece, so they can be mounted more quickly. The geometry with low-building vertical panels has no or very low need for fastening or ballast, which further simplifies the mounting job. Each unit measures 1,600 mm x 1,510 mm x 350 mm and weighs 24.5 kg. It also features an IP68 enclosure rating and 3.2 mm double-tempered glass.
“We are working to take down costs to a competitive level with respect to conventional solar installations,” Mongstad said. “The modularization of the vertical system is the key to taking down cost. By integrating the mounting system into the product we can take down cost and installation is much faster and easier than with conventional solar products.”
He claimed that deployment is extremely easy and fast because of modularization.
“The complete installation was in place in less than one hour, with two workers placing out the vertical units,” he said. “On a company level, our challenge is now to reach commercialization of the product. For this, we need risk capital, early mover customers, and other support to get over the ‘valley of death'.”

The $500 billion development will include a range of smart technologies and will serve as a “living laboratory and hub for innovation,” according to its planners. It will also be exclusively powered by renewable energy.
According to a new study by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), renewables-powered desalination will play a key role in the city. It will be critical to ensuring sustainable supplies of water through demand-side management (DSM).
“This work proposes a multi-period (2020–29) generation and expansion planning co-optimization model for a system that considers investment and operation decisions for the power and water sectors under uncertainty,” the scientists said. “The model accommodates a high penetration of renewable energy sources and introduces flexibility through water storage, batteries, and DSM.”
Their model was based on a 4 GW transmission connection to the existing Saudi Arabian electricity network. They assessed the costs and added flexibility to the power-water coupled system. They also divided the city into nine nodes and considered four generating technologies: combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT), photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), and onshore wind turbines, as well as battery storage and hydroelectric pumped storage (HPS).
“We consider constructing 14 possible transmission lines with a nodal balance to ensure that supply meets demand,” they said, adding that they assumed reverse osmosis (RO) desalination and water storage tanks as the main technologies for the desalination facilities. Renewables-powered desalination is expected to account for around 20% of Neom's total electricity consumption.
The Saudi team presented four business cases. They considered a desalination system powered exclusively by solar-plus-storage (PV only), as well as a system based on wind-plus-storage (wind Only). They also looked at a system based on different renewable energy sources, including concentrated solar power (CSP) and no CCGT, as well as a system that could rely on the existing connection with the Saudi network. For every case, they used independent approaches, under which the power and water sector investments would be planned separately, and co-optimized approaches, where the two sectors would cooperate.
The second approach showed the biggest cost savings for the power sector, as it allows for shaving peak demand by shifting necessary power consumption by the water sector.
“The savings are greatest for the ‘wind only' and ‘PV only' cases,” the academics said. “For these cases, the generating capacity is significantly greater than the power demand at any given hour because these systems must generate enough electricity to meet demand and battery storage for future use.”
The “PV only” case resulted in a substantial increase in total desalination capacity. The co-optimized “PV only” model required nearly 41% more RO desalination capacity than the independent strategy. There was also a 4% increase in water storage capacity, the Saudi group explained. Despite the increase in costs for the water sector, the total costs of the entire system decreased for all cases, they noted.
The levelized costs of energy of the “PV only” case was found to be $47.90/MWh, while that of the “wind only” case was $134.07/MWh.
“Co-optimizing the two sectors resulted in a 4% and 7% decrease in LCOE for the respective cases. By understanding water production patterns, capacity investment or power spillage can be decreased, which reduced the LCOE,” the academics said. “Analysis results suggest that systems with higher shares of non-dispatchable renewables experience the most significant cost reductions.”
They introduced their findings in “Simulated co-optimization of renewable energy and desalination systems in Neom, Saudi Arabia,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
“The results obtained for Neom may provide insights into other systems with similar climates, renewable resource availability, or a need for desalination,” they said. “These regions include the Southwestern region of the United States, parts of Australia, Chile, South Africa, and the MENA region.”

Nickelsdorf – a small town in Burgenland, eastern Austria – has broken ground on what will be the country's largest PV park to date.
The regional government plans to build the 120 MW solar plant as part of a hybrid wind-solar project, with a 164 MW wind farm. The plan is to reach grid connection by the end of this year.
“The citizens of Nickelsdorf stand behind this project,” said Mayor Gerhard Zapfl, noting that the solar panels will be placed at a height that will also enable livestock farming with sheep. “Between the rows of modules, flowering meadows should also ensure even more biodiversity and species richness and create new habitats for insects and wild animals.”
The power will be sold by local utility Burgenland Energie to its customers at a dedicated tariff.
“The population here in Nickelsdorf can benefit directly and save an average of €150 per household per year,” said Burgenland Energie CEO Stephan Sharma.

The utility claims it will lead to higher power densities and lower production costs.
“The new patent solves a major challenge in flow batteries,” DEWA said in a statement. “Conventional redox flow battery stack has inactive sites at the edges of the cell which restrict mass transport of the reactants at the electrode/electrolyte surface, leading to pressure drops which affect the overall efficiency and performance of a flow battery system.”
The novel technology could remove this hurdle due to its improved electrolyte distribution. The stack is reportedly able to modify the size of the cell at the inlet and outlet sections.
“This ensures a reduced pressure drop, better performance and efficiency of the battery flow system,” the scientists explained, without providing additional technical details.
DEWA's R&D center is located at the massive 5 GW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The facility, which spans 4,400 square meters, is the biggest solar testing and certification facility in the United Arab Emirates.
DEWA is currently testing a 1.2 MW network-attached storage (NAS) system supplied by Japan's NGK Insulators at the first section of the Mohammed bin Rashid Maktoum Solar Park – a 13 MW array built by US thin-film manufacturer First Solar in late 2013. It also plans to use output from the plant to provide energy for a newly tendered 250 MW pumped-storage hydroelectric power station at Hatta, an inland exclave of the emirate of Dubai. It has also built a solar-powered hydrogen electrolysis facility at the solar park.

They claim it has remarkable stability and lower performance losses than other types of hybrid electrocatalysts.
They fabricated the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst with platinum and iron (Pt–Fe) alloy nanoparticles on highly dispersed Pt and Fe single atoms in nitrogen-doped carbon support. This resulted in an ultra-low Pt loading of around 1.7wt%.
“However, as the Pt loading decreases, the oxygen transfer resistance increases because of the limited accessible active sites, which results in a lower durability,” the scientists warned. “Thus, the ambition to develop low-Pt-loading cathodes poses great challenges in the areas of Pt utilization and the intrinsic durability of Pt-based electrocatalysts.”
By scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images, the researchers found that the small nanoparticles used have an ordered structure, which is shown by the characteristically alternating bright and dim lattice. They said it also indicates the high order degree of the nanoparticles themselves. In addition, they used electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), which demonstrated the co-existence of abundant Pt and Fe single atoms and Pt–Fe nanoparticles in the hybrid material.
The academics measured the performance of the fuel cell in a hydrogen peroxide (H2/O2) environment and it exhibited a power density of 1.08 W cm–2 at 2.0 A cm–2, which they said is just a bit lower than that of a reference fuel cell with higher Pt loading. They also tested the device via accelerated durability testing under repeated square-wave cycles and it was able to retain 97% of its activity after 100,000 cycles, with no noticeable current drop at 0.6 V for over 200 hours.
“The enhanced durability of the hybrid electrocatalyst may result from a reduced H2O2 formation and consequent alleviation of the membrane and ionomer degradation,” they said.
They described their findings in “Atomically dispersed Pt and Fe sites and Pt–Fe nanoparticles for durable proton exchange membrane fuel cells,” published in Nature Catalysis. The research group includes scientists from the US Department of Energy Argonne National Laboratory, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the Southern University of Science and Technology in China.
“Our results highlight the importance of the synergistic effects among different active sites in hybrid electrocatalysts and provide an alternative way to design more active and durable low-Pt-group metal electrocatalysts for fuel cells and other electrochemical devices,” they concluded.
