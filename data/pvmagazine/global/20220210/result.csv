https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/10/residential-based-energy-storage-will-become-the-new-boiler-2-0/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED KINGDOM",,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",Residential based energy storage will become the new ‘Boiler 2.0,"As we transition away from natural gas and other fossil fuels, we can – and will – make better use of renewable energy, storing it as electricity to provide space heating, hot water, and power for every socket and appliance in the home. This will then offset the power needed for the inevitable EV parked outside and in need of charging.  
Using a battery energy storage system (BESS) combined with renewable technology and connected to the grid enables a home to store excess clean energy either for its own use or for selling back to the grid. The system can then recharge from the grid automatically during off-peak hours, capitalizing on cheaper tariffs. This setup creates a more flexible energy system, increasing the possibilities for renewable energy and helping to decarbonize the grid.
The most promising thing about this setup is that we already have the technology and skills to make it happen. We have the battery technology, solar panels, electricians (to connect the system to the grid) and we have compliances and standards in place for a smooth, safe integration.  
We have a way to go before such a system is widely available and in place but energy storage is being adopted at a very rapid rate. According to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Energy Storage Tracking Report (last updated in November 2021) it is expected that installed global energy storage capacity will reach 585GW by 2030. 17GW was reported globally in 2020.
BESS is a swiftly evolving technology with a wide range of storage capabilities so what we don’t want is to create a system or components that will become obsolete as the technology advances. As with existing boilers, energy storage products will need to be serviced and maintained in order to extend their lifespan.
Boilers currently last for between 10-15 years before having to be stripped out and replaced, which no one likes to do; it is costly, messy, and wasteful. Another drawback with existing boilers is that, if a home is extended, to accommodate a growing family, for instance, the boiler and/or water tank may need replacing (even if it’s relatively new) to meet increased demand.  
The beauty of battery storage is that it is often modular. If demand for power increases, it is possible to just add more batteries without the upheaval and waste of stripping everything out and starting again.
I don’t want to overlook the fact that battery waste is a very serious concern and, as our reliance on energy storage rises, consideration must be given to what will happen to a system or its parts when it no longer has a use in its current state.  
As demand for batteries increases, so do the amounts of battery parts that will eventually go to recycling. Aceleron was set up to help the battery industry extract more value before batteries reach the material recovery stage. We bought and took apart a variety of batteries to see how they were built and discovered that most lithium-ion cells were assembled using permanent assembly methods like spot welding and adhesives. This has made recycling a challenge and reuse of viable components uneconomical. From this insight, we developed our own battery assembly technology and technique which provides the same performance as welding and can be disassembled for repair, reuse, and recycling.
Where this technology comes to life from a sustainability point of view, is unlocking reuse and repurposing. This additional extraction of value before recycling is where the technology adds value to the circular economy. We work in a number of countries around the world, where we can build second-life batteries using discarded parts that still have a purpose. These go on to provide power in a variety of ways, for instance for communities that are off-grid or to power fishing boats in Africa.  
The bottom line with a circular economy battery such as this is, no part should ever need to go to landfill. They must be designed specifically so that every part will have second, third, fourth (etc) life opportunities.
There are repairable, upgradeable products already available which, with the proper care, updates and maintenance, can last a lifetime. Individual parts can be upgraded as technology advances and the components that need replacing over time can be easily recycled. The service engineer who services the system once a year (just like with existing boilers), can take those parts away, sending them into various recycling channels, ensuring that they are not contributing to a waste problem.
That is not to say, however, that we are in a position (yet) to install energy storage systems that can work independently everywhere, harnessing renewable energy to heat and power a home as well as recharge one, two, or possibly even three EV’s parked outside and power a heat pump. However, energy storage provides the flexibility to capture and use as much renewable energy available as possible from the grid, locally generated sources, or both, to supply our growing energy needs.
Energy storage is also a cleantech force ‘multiplier’; if a property has other clean technology installed, such as heat pumps, the renewable energy stored in the batteries can also be used as a power source for them. 
The challenge with renewable energy is that we have no control whatsoever over whether the sun shines or the wind blows. This means that there are times when there is an abundance of clean energy and little or no demand – which is of course where energy storage comes into play.  
If as many properties as possible have ‘clean energy buckets’, there is the potential to create a virtual power plant. This distributed network of batteries enables the grid to send excess renewable energy to the various locations during low demand, high generation periods, for later use by the property owner, or to resupply to the grid when demand is high. This ultimately reduces the requirement for fossil fuel by the network.
It also removes the ‘facilities burden’ for utility companies as there is no need for a massive, city-sized energy storage plant. Instead of building an energy storage plant to store around 20,000kWh – 30,000kWh, it can be broken down into small home energy storage systems (approximately 10kWh per home). In markets where the incentive model is right, property owners have even self-invested in energy storage, mitigating the capital and operational expense for the utility company as well. 
This will work particularly well for countries where space is at a premium – cities in the UK for instance, where energy demand is high, but utility space is constrained. However, where the home already exists and the boiler space already exists, we are simply repurposing existing space and using it to store new, clean technology.
Of course, not every residential property will have the space or capacity to install an energy storage system for their own use so a more collaborative approach will be needed. In Spain for instance, solar communities are springing up, where groups of people are coming together to share the electricity generated on roofs. A battery-based solution allows everyone to participate.
The first thing we need to address, however, is the cost of these installations. Currently, the installation of a new boiler will cost £1,500 – £2,500 whereas a home energy storage system is likely to cost three to four times as much.  
This is where governments need to step in. Just as there used to be financial incentives for installing solar panels 15 years ago, now we need incentives in the form of grants, tax rebates, and cashback schemes. Government incentives are going to be absolutely key to encouraging people to take the plunge. 
Governments are more than aware that we have deadlines to hit our net zero goals and the only way for us to meet them is to find a way to store clean energy.  
Homeowners also need to understand that there is a longer-term return on investment. Energy storage products with a longer operating life mean that a homeowner will continually reap the benefits over time. Longevity and reliability are how we will make the longer-lasting storage solutions a reality.  
It will take a while and there are still several hurdles to overcome before battery storage replaces boilers entirely but when we get there, global carbon emissions will plummet as domestic reliance on natural gas practically disappears.

The EAIF, which borrows from public and private lenders to on-lend finance for renewables projects in Africa, distributed the first installment of the loan, via South Africa's Standard Bank Group, in late December.
Spanish solar company Alten Energías Renovables is developing the Kesses solar project near the town of Eldoret, near the equator in Kenya's Rift Valley, with construction expected to be complete in “spring 2022.”
The solar field, which will create up to 400 construction jobs and 15 permanent positions, will supply all the electricity it generates to national utility the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, which has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement.
As project lead financer, Johannesburg-headquartered Standard Bank will provide $41 million for the Kesses facility, including the $35 million from the EAIF, an extra debt facility, and VAT.
Sine Zulu, an investment specialist at London-based asset management company Ninety-one, which manages the EAIF, said: “The Kesses plant brings multiple benefits to Kenya's economic development. It will also play an important part in combating climate change and strengthening Kenya's recovery from Covid-19. [The] EAIF is now established as a lender of choice for renewable energy companies investing in Africa.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/10/latent-heat-thermal-storage-with-pv-for-nearly-zero-energy-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",Latent heat thermal storage with PV for nearly zero-energy buildings,"Researchers at Politecnico di Torino in Italy are testing how latent heat thermal storage (LHTS) could be used in combination with rooftop PV to achieve nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB). NZEBS are residential and commercial buildings that have very low primary energy requirements, which have to be met to a significant extent by renewable sources.
“In the European project RE-cognition, we are using LHTS and PV independently of each other to meet the electrical and thermal demand of our pilot building – the Energy Center at our campus,” researcher Giulia Manco told pv magazine. “In general, however, it would be possible to couple photovoltaics to this type of heat storage if you had a heat pump capable of converting the electricity produced by photovoltaics into thermal energy.”
He said the configuration would facilitate the accumulation of surplus electricity from photovoltaics in the form of heat, thus increasing the self-consumption of renewable energy.
“A heat pump is currently not included in this specific project,” said researcher Alessandro Colangelo. “Therefore, the LHTS will allow increasing the flexibility of the thermal demand of the pilot building, while photovoltaics will increase the share of renewable electricity consumed on site.”
The 47kW PV system consists of a southwest-oriented solar array on the rooftop and several southeast-oriented PV panels integrated into the hall windows. The pilot building also has other renewable energy technologies such a geothermal heat pump, a district heating substation, and two small experimental wind turbines.
The latent heat thermal storage system is described by the scientists as able to accumulate significant amounts of thermal energy to use when heating is needed. The system is based on a special kind of phase change material (PCM) related to bio-based paraffin, with a melting point at 74 C.
PCMs are substances that absorb and release heat energy when they change phase and are able to store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range. In the construction business, combining building materials with PCMs is an efficient way to improve the thermal energy storage capacity of construction elements. The cost of PCM is strongly dependent on the type of material.
“Organic PCMs are the easiest to use and cost between 2-10 €/kg,” Manco said. “The specific energy content is also rather variable, but approximately organic PCMs are able to store 200 kJ/kg”
The LHTS  appear as a tank filled with the PCM, crossed by several pipes where the water of the heating system is flowing.
“To enhance the rate of the heat exchange between the water and the PCM, extensions made of high conductive material are added to the pipes, thus facilitating the charging and discharging processes,” the research group explained.
In the charging phase, the initially solid PCM melts gradually, heat is stored and hot water can be supplied through the pipes. In the discharging process, the initially liquid PCM solidifies when heat is released and cold water can be supplied through the same pipes.
“The energy required for these transformations is very high since the molecular structure of the PCM is modified. Hence, a large amount of heat can be accumulated in a relatively small volume, up to five times lower than a traditional water tank,” the academics said.
The proposed system was built with two tanks that can store up to 40kWh of thermal energy each and different internal pipe extensions.
“Following a topological optimization approach in the design phase, the same quantity of high conductive material was arranged differently around the tubes to increase the LHTS performance,” the scientists said.
The two storage tanks can purportedly release most of their energy content in less than one hour. Experimental tests are currently being made by the group, which said the real potential of this technology should be well known by this spring.
“It would be immediately transferable to commercial production and there is already a start-up here in Turin working on this type of devices,” Colantuono said.

A White Paper published by Áurea Capital Partners, a Madrid-based investment firm focused on renewable energy, analyzes the integration of the European energy market to conclude that Spain is “facing a leadership opportunity” that it must “take advantage of and promote.”
According to the company, the European energy sector is going to shrink and consolidate in the medium term, with an increasing number of fossil fuel companies merging with big electricity providers.
On the other hand, the incorporation of technologies such as hydrogen, geothermal and tidal energy, that until now were excluded from the market due to their high cost, is expected to advance this year, thanks to technological innovation and the internalization of the cost of CO2 in the economy. “The development of hybridization and new energy storage formulas will be two of the major trends in the sector in the coming years,” the report states.
In this context of the ecological transition, Spain is defined as the “Texas of Europe,” due to its enviable position in terms of solar radiation.
Áurea Capital Partners experts predict that the penetration of renewables in the mix would save the European economy €254.3 billion in the period from 2019 to 2050, that is 2.12% of GDP in the Eurozone for 2020. “Each euro invested in Spain in solar energy production provides a 35%-higher profit margin than any other country in the EU,” says the report.
Spain can cover its own demand and a large part of Europe's renewable energy supply with solar energy and storage in an environmentally sustainable – and socially inclusive – way. “It can aspire, without a doubt, to become the main provider of renewable energy in Europe, displacing imports of gas and oil,” said Áurea Capital.
“Spain, with its solar irradiation, is in the same situation as Norway when it discovered … oil pockets in the 1960s and created the largest sovereign fund in the world,” says the report. Although the intervention of the state in the electricity market is against free-market laws and the European structure of the energy market, there is room for Madrid's participation in the electricity market by channeling investment towards the sector. To this end, Áurea Capital proposes the creation of a National Energy Transition Fund in Spain to serve as a vehicle for pension investment through the creation of independent power producers (IPPs).
“We believe that the creation of a National Energy Transition Fund could mobilize co-investment from pensions and institutional investors with a low cost of capital, towards the creation of IPPs in the energy sector. This fund could be financed through the savings obtained [from not] importing fossil fuels and [from] the pension budget, by modifying the pension law, following the French or Norwegian model,” says Carlos Bendito, CEO of Áurea Capital.
According to him, a special investment mandate for the ecological transition which, by diversification criteria, would not exceed 10% of the total budget – €30 billion – would cover approximately 3.6% of the €830 billion investment in renewables needed by 2050 in Spain.
The approach of seeking a replica of the Norwegian State Fund by substituting renewables for fossil fuel assets, however, poses a challenge. While the Nordic assets were in the sea, in the Spanish case they are located onshore.
Due to this difference, it will be key to simultaneously propose, together with the new model, a territorial organization that favors the distributed nature of renewables, and in particular of solar PV, in the Spanish network with interconnected self-sufficient nodes which should be superimposed on European demands. Given that the powers in territorial planning belong to Spain's autonomous communities, replicating, as far as possible, the national strategy at the regional level could facilitate the process of territorial integration.
“It is also essential to accelerate the interconnection with France and the rest of Europe in order to be able to sell the renewable energy generated by Spain,” Bendito concluded.

The Shanghai-based manufacturer today said it and German solar park engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partner Intec Energy Solutions had secured the contract to develop BeGreen's Danish portfolio, which comprises three solar parks plus an “additional extension” of 13MWp of solar capacity.
Chint, which said the contract would showcase its 540Wp high-efficiency modules, said BeGreen will develop a 137.3MWp solar project at Barmosen, a 111.7MWp field at Bregentved, and a 66.7MWp facility at Vildbjerg, without revealing any further project details.
Quoted in a press release issued by Chint Solar today, chairman and CEO Lu Chuan said: “This cooperation is a remarkable milestone achieved by Chint Solar and our partners in the Danish market. We are therefore very proud that the project can make an important contribution to achieving … sustainability ambitions in Europe. It is a leap forward in the right direction. In the future, we will step up our efforts to deliver quality EPC services and best-in-class PV equipment to our partners.”
Chint has already built three solar parks with a combined capacity of 152 MW in the Netherlands.

Another round of anti-circumvention cases have been filed against Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and now Cambodia, reports ROTH Capital Partners in an industry note. US-based panel assembler Auxin Solar added its name to the petition.
This comes just months after the Commerce Department tossed out an earlier similar request by an anonymous group of solar companies that sought tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules. About 80% of US crystalline-silicon modules are shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. Auxin claims Chinese manufacturers are shipping cells to these countries to avoid paying tariffs that have been in place since 2012.
ROTH said under this case, all crystalline-silicon modules from each of the four countries could be subject to a tariff. Unlike the first case, this one is designed to be focused on entire countries, rather than specific companies. This new petition adds Cambodia, as Auxin claimed Chinese companies were moving operations to the country in anticipation of tariffs. Historically, Cambodia contributes less than 3% of all US C-Si module imports.
Thin-film modules are exempt in this petition. The ROTH note said the new filing “cures all the deficiencies” of the first anti-circumvention case. It said that this filing was a numerically based decision.
The note added that the Department of Commerce is expected to take on the case. The Biden administration may not have the same ability to block the tariffs as in Section 201, as there are procedures in place to prevent interference, it said.
Even if the case is denied, ROTH said there is significant risk of other strategies being taken by the petitioners. In a webinar, ROTH explained how the America COMPETES Act could be used in a similar fashion to achieve the group’s goals.
This latest filing may come as bad news for US utility-scale solar developers. The dismissal of the earlier anti-circumvention case was celebrated by Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), which vigorously opposed the 2021 request by American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC) for anti-dumping and anti-circumvention tariffs. In a statement, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called the decision to reject the petitions a “major victory for America’s 231,000 solar workers.”

Swiss renewable energy producer Alpiq has announced it will build an 18MW vertical, bifacial solar plant in the municipality of Gondo-
Zwischbergen, in Switzerland's canton of Valais, at an altitude of between 2,000 and 2,200 meters above sea level.
The Gondosolar project will be built with 4,500 bifacial modules on a 10-hectare surface and will be able to generate around 23.3 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.
The project is expected to require an investment of CHF42 million ($45.5 million) and, due to the project design, to produce around twice as much electricity per square meter as a comparable facility on the Swiss plateau, the company said. “In addition, 55% of its electricity is produced in winter and Gondosolar produces four times as much winter electricity per area as a PV installation in the lowlands,” it further explained.
Alpiq said it is now in the process of securing approval and funding for the project and that construction works should be finalized within three years from the start of construction.
The project was initiated by Renato Jordan, a landowner in possession of the plot of land at the Alpjerung location where the plant should be deployed. “A comprehensive feasibility study ultimately concludes that the project is not only environmentally and technically feasible but also economically viable, provided that the federal parliament enacts the subsidy model and Gondosolar receives the maximum subsidy of 60%,” Alpiq said.
The plant will be owned and operated by local utility Electrique du Simplon (EES), whose largest shareholder is Alpiq itself.

“The increase will be driven by record silver industrial fabrication, which is forecast to improve by 5%, as silver’s use expands in both traditional and critical green technologies,” the analyst said. “The outlook for silver’s use in the photovoltaic (PV) industry remains bright. Government commitments to carbon neutrality have resulted in a rapid expansion of green energy projects.”
Considering that the global photovoltaic market may cross the 200 GW threshold for newly deployed capacity this year, The Silver Institute also predicted that silver demand in the solar industry may reach an all-time high in 2022, without providing specific figures.
“Silver industrial offtake (accounting for more than half of total silver demand) is projected to strengthen further, establishing a new record high in 2022. Ongoing improvements in the global economy will give silver industrial applications an additional boost, mitigating near-term headwinds from supply chain bottlenecks and the challenges in certain regions from the ongoing Covid pandemic,” it also stated.
The average silver price for 2022 is expected to reach $24.80 per ounce, which would be around 1% lower than $25.14 a year earlier. The Silver Institute said that, despite the slight drop, this year's average price still represents a historically high annual average.
Due to increasing silver prices, the share of silver in PV module costs rose last year by around 5% to account for approximately 10% of the total, according to U.S.-based analyst Matt Watson.
In June 2020, The Silver Institute noted that the ability of PV producers to reduce silver content in solar cell production – a process referred to as ‘thrifting’ – had reduced since 2016 but they anticipated the average 111mg of the precious metal needed for each solar cell in 2019 would nevertheless fall to 80mg by 2030. With silver prices on the rise, or at the current levels, it is expected that the rate of thrifting will continue to increase.

Its Volans generator has a storage capacity of 1.28kWh. If combined in a two-unit series, it can reach 2.5kWh.
“Volans has multiple charging options and can be connected to a solar panel as a power generator,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, noting that the device can also be charged by car chargers, AC inputs, or fast charging if there is a power delivery charger.
The system features built-in 120V(AC) output, continuous AC output power of 1,200W, and peak output of up to 2,400W. It measures 380 mm x 215 mm x 210 mm and weighs in at 30 kg. According to Soluna, it can be fully recharged in an hour.

The researchers said they adapted the conventional colorization approach used for crystalline silicon photovoltaics to solar cells based on perovskite. It consists of inkjet-printing pigment-based colored layers on the plain glass side of pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates and then depositing the PSC layer stack on the ITO side of the substrate. “This approach of colorization is, with regards to fabrication, mostly independent on the solar cell architecture,” they explained.
The academics used pigment-based inks of white, cyan, magenta, and yellow color. A reflective white interlayer was embedded between the perovskite solar cell and the printed pigment film, to obtain a color impression as close as possible to the targeted color while also increasing lightness. “The projections of the 3D representation show that the color impression of the PSCs with white interlayer is very close to the targeted color on a white background and significantly more brilliant and colorful than without the white interlayer,” they emphasized.
The performance of the solar cells was analyzed under standard illumination conditions and that of the cells colored with layers of magenta and yellow suffered the lowest yield losses – between 10 and 30% – compared to the efficiency of reference uncolored solar cells. Cyan-colored devices registered the largest losses, in the range of 50 to 70%. “These differences originate from the significantly differing parts of the solar spectrum that are reflected and therefore lost for photo-absorption in the perovskite,” the research group stated.
“Until now, when manufacturing colored perovskite solar cells, the color impression of the devices for the viewer was heavily dependent on the angle of the incident light,” explained the research project coordinator, Helge Eggers. “With our method, on the other hand, the color used is almost entirely independent of the angle of incidence of the sunlight but always looks the same.”
Five interconnected solar cells were used to fabricate a colorized small perovskite solar module in white marble optic displays. The module has a total area of 9cm2 and an active area of 4cm2. Its power conversion efficiency was found to be 13.9%, which is 88.5% of the average of uncolored reference devices, with an efficiency of 15.7%. “Our prototype highlights that a high aesthetic value does not necessarily go hand in hand with an immense loss in performance,” the scientists said.  The modules colored with bright mono-colored cyan, magenta, yellow, blue, red, and green all achieved efficiencies close to 12%.
All the details on the coloring technique can be found in the paper “Perovskite Solar Cells with Vivid, Angle-Invariant, and Customizable Inkjet-Printed Colorization for Building-Integrated Photovoltaics,” published in RRL Solar.

A spokesperson for the Zug-based investor told pv magazine: “We’re closely monitoring the possible consequences of the proposed decree and of Article 16 [of the legislation, which concerns renewables projects]. Notwithstanding the short-term exceptional increases in power prices, we remain positive on the long-term fundamentals of the Italian power market.”
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
SUSI yesterday announced plans to back 500MW of solar plants in Italy, with the help of a local management team “from an experienced clean energy developer.” The company spokesperson said the management team could not be identified at the moment because of a confidentiality agreement but it may be revealed “in a couple of months.”
The press release issued yesterday by SUSI to announce the solar ambition stated: “While the Italian solar PV market experienced slower growth following the expiration of government incentives after 2013, a new expansion phase is expected throughout the 2020s, as the country gears up to meet 2030 emission reduction targets.”
The company statement cited “rising carbon and gas prices supporting market electricity prices,” as one of the reasons attracting SUSI to Italy.
Article 16 of Italian Law Decree 04/22, published on Jan. 27, will restrict returns from solar plants for the rest of the year but only applies to plants commissioned under the previous Conto Energia incentives regime, and to unsubsidized facilities whose revenue is tied to electricity spot market prices.
The SUSI spokesperson told pv magazine it expects the 500MW of solar capacity to be operational between 2024 and 2026. SUSI did not reveal how much the solar investment would cost.

SJVN Limited, an Indian state-owned hydropower producer, aims to develop 10 GW of solar power projects in the Indian state of Rajasthan over a period of five years.
The developer has submitted a letter of intent to develop the solar projects in Rajasthan. The government of Rajasthan has given the developer its full support.
SJVN plans to establish 10 GW of renewable power projects/parks on the land banks to be allocated by Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation in the state.
Commercial production will commence in a phased manner and the power generated will be supplied to the beneficiaries through the nearest substations. Power purchase agreements for the generated energy will be signed at prices determined through competitive tariff-based opportunities available in the market.
“SJVN has proposed to develop solar power projects in Rajasthan as the state has the largest solar power potential in the country. It receives the highest solar radiation (5.72 kWh/m2/day) and also has the highest number of more than 325 clear sunny days in a year. All these factors work in our favor of developing the projects,” said SJVN.
The projects will assist SJVN in achieving its ambitious vision of 5GW by 2023, 25GW by 2030, and 50GW by 2040. It will simultaneously contribute to the renewables capacity addition target of 500GW by 2030 set by the government of India.

Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has filed environmental documents with the West Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to build the multibillion-dollar Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub.
Plans for the renewable energy hub, to be built near the coastal town of  Onslow and 170 km west of the Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) Eliwana mine site, have this week been released for public comment by the West Australian Environmental Protection Authority.
The proposal is to construct and operate a renewable energy hub comprising an enormous 3.33GW solar farm and a 2.04 GW wind farm spread across approximately 10,000 hectares. The hub would also include a battery with a storage capacity of 9.1GWh.
A 220kV transmission line would connect the Uaroo Hub main substation to a substation at the Eliwana mining operations. The transmission line has not been included in the EPA submission.
FMG said the Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub will provide renewable energy to power its mining operations in the Pilbara and is a critical component of it achieving net zero emissions from its mining operations by 2030.
It is expected the Uaroo project will reduce the miner’s current annual carbon emissions of 2.2 million tons by at least 1.5 million tons by the end of this decade.
“The proposal is an essential step toward FMG’s larger goal of supporting the rapid uptake of zero-carbon fuels globally,” the company said in its submission to the EPA.
FMG said it had has previously considered alternative energy sources to power its mining operations, but said the Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub is a “compelling option” and hoped the project would inspire others to implement similar solutions, as they too target net-zero operations.
“Renewable energy is now, in many cases, the lowest-cost form of energy available, making its uptake a contributor to financial performance as well as climate health,” the company said. “The proposal will demonstrate the viability of zero-carbon technologies in fuelling commercial-scale operations and will encourage other proponents to follow suit.”
FMG said the project has been scaled to provide a reliable power supply source to satisfy the miner’s operational needs, with consideration given to the variability of wind speeds and the restriction of solar power generation to daylight hours.
FMG said construction of the Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub will commence after it secures all necessary approvals. The renewable energy generation and electricity transmission infrastructure will be constructed and commissioned in stages, with works anticipated to run for approximately seven years.
