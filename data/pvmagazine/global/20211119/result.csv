SunPower Corp. said it will launch a virtual power plant program that will let energy storage customers who use its SunVault system to be paid for allowing the local utility to use stored energy during peak demand.
SunPower said it will coordinate charging and discharging customers’ batteries, while keeping some electricity in reserve for backup power to the home. Participating customers will be told ahead of time that their battery will be discharged and can choose to bypass or pre-set their system so their reserve does not fall below a certain level. In return, customers are expected to be paid by the utility for the use of their stored energy.
SunPower’s first offering is called ConnectedSolutions and will be marketed to customers served by Eversource and National Grid in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.

Russia is also coordinating its energy policies with China. On Wednesday, the Russian-Chinese Intergovernmental Commission on Energy Cooperation held its 18th meeting. “In discussing the power supply system, the countries agreed to maintain the steady operations of Russia-China cross-border power transmission lines and to develop power engineering,” the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade wrote on Wednesday. “They also supported further cooperation in promoting RES, the hydroelectric power industry and hydrogen energy. They discussed separately the development of China’s nuclear industry with the use of Russian technology.” Representatives from the two countries will meet again on November 29 to discuss energy matters. According to S&P Global, Russia plans to spend over Rb9 billion, equivalent to around $124 million (€106.54 million), on hydrogen projects over the next three years.
Chile and Korea signed an MoU for the development of green hydrogen on Tuesday. “The two countries will share experiences and knowledge to promote the deployment of technologies for the production, storage, transportation, distribution and use of green hydrogen,” the Energy Ministry wrote on its website. It is the second hydrogen-focused MoU that Chile signs with Asia after an agreement with Singapore in March. Chile is also in talks with Japan.
France and Germany coordinated on energy policies during the Franco-German Energy Forum on Thursday. The message was that the two countries will continue with their different energy policies: Germany will focus on hydrogen imports, and France will make fresh investments in nuclear, which could be then used for hydrogen production. French President Emmanuel Macron also announced additional investments in hydrogen (nearly €2 billion). “Presented by the president of the Republic on October 12, the France 2030 investment plan must support the transition in our sectors of excellence. Within this framework, France has put in place a strategy for low-carbon hydrogen with a budget of €7 billion, which France 2030 will accelerate by adding nearly €2 billion,” the Élysée wrote on Tuesday. The pledge was made by the French president during a visit at electrolyzer and fuel cell technologies company Genvia. According to Macron, France can produce hydrogen “on our soil much more massively than many others.” Also this week, Macron spoke with Russia’s Vladimir Putin about Belarus, Ukraine, and Libya.
German energy company RWE confirmed it will be making a series of investments in hydrogen. Commenting on the 2030 investment plan, CEO Markus Krebber said that “there is no way around hydrogen.” The company is investing €50 billion in offshore and onshore wind, solar, batteries, flexible generation, and hydrogen. “The company is thus expanding its portfolio by 25 gigawatts net to 50 gigawatts (GW) in the attractive markets of Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific Region,” RWE wrote on Monday, adding that the company also “plans to open up new business opportunities in the areas of hydrogen and ammonia importing, in order to supply industry in Europe.” Earlier this month, RWE Generation SE and Shell New Energies NL BV said they would team up to develop projects for the production, use, and distribution of green hydrogen in northwest Europe. RWE is taking advantage of financial opportunities and low interest rates. “RWE has successfully issued a further green bond with a total volume of €1.35 billion,” the company wrote on Wednesday, adding that the first tranche is based on a coupon of 0.5% p.a. (tenor until 2028); the second tranche on a coupon of 1.0% p.a. (tenor until 2033). On Thursday, RWE announced that it was conducting research to test technologies for CO2-free steel production. The energy company will work with CO2GRAB, LSF and BENTELER Steel/Tube, banking on public investments. The state of Lower Saxony has agreed to provide €3 million of funding to the CO2GRAB start-up, RWE noted. “In 2022, the pioneering demonstration project for a green hydrogen direct reduction plant is to be built on RWE’s Lingen power plant site,” it added.
Japanese trading company Marubeni Corporation’s green hydrogen production project in South Australia has been chosen by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (MOEJ) as a pilot under a program aimed at accelerating the introduction of hydrogen to the Indo-Pacific region. South Australia Energy Minister Dan Van Holst Pellekaan said Marubeni had chosen the region as its preferred location due to the state’s high-quality natural resources and developed infrastructure. Earlier this year, Marubeni announced it was teaming up with Australian-based oil and gas producer Woodside and fellow Japanese company IHI Corporation to investigate green hydrogen production options, mostly from hydropower in Tasmania.
“Gas distribution grids need to prepare for a disruptive end to their business model,” wrote German think tank Agora Energiewende in its “12 Insights on Hydrogen.” The report published earlier this week suggests that Europe could face difficulties installing additional capacity for electrolysis, which makes imports a top priority for the role of hydrogen for climate neutrality. “Europe has enough green hydrogen potential to satisfy its demand but needs to manage two challenges: acceptance and location of renewables, as each GW of electrolysis must come with 1-4 GW of additional renewables. To keep industry competitive, the EU should therefore access cheap hydrogen (green and near-zero carbon) from its neighbours via pipelines, reducing transport cost. Imports from a global market will focus on renewable hydrogen-based synthetic fuels,” reads one of the key findings of the work signed by Patrick Graichen, executive director of Agora Energiewende, and Frank Peter, director of Agora Industry. The report also calls for targeted policy instruments for industry, power, shipping, and aviation.
The European Union announced on Tuesday €1.1 billion of investments in seven large-scale projects under the Innovation Fund. Three of them are related to hydrogen. “A project in Sweden aims to entirely eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from steel production by using renewable hydrogen in Gällivare and Oxelösund,” the European Commission wrote on its website. “Another project, in Finland, will demonstrate two ways of producing clean hydrogen at a refinery in Porvoo, through renewable energy and by capturing CO2 and permanently storing it in the North Sea. … To reduce the emissions in the production of hydrogen and chemicals, a project in Belgium will develop a complete carbon capture, transport and storage value chain in the Port of Antwerp.”

“EverVolt 2.0 offers enhancements for greater customization, and features a convenient modular footprint and weatherproof design,” the company said in a statement. “Up to three systems can be stacked together to obtain more power output and energy storage capacity.”
Panasonic said the system is available in the U.S. with storage capacities of 17.1 kWh and 25.65 kWh. The product comes with a floor-standing battery cabinet and a hybrid smart inverter with 4 MPPTs. It can be AC- and DC-coupled, which makes it suitable for both new and existing PV installations with a power of up to 12 kW. The system is reportedly able to provide a continuous output of 7.6 kW off-grid and 9.6 kW on-grid.
The company offers a 10-year product warranty for the weatherproof outdoor-rated system, which is equipped with an outdoor protection rating of IP55.
Panasonic launched its EverVolt storage system in September 2019. In May, it launched a heterojunction solar module compatible with the storage system. “The EverVolt 2.0 battery storage system integrates seamlessly with Panasonic solar panels to create the Total Home Solar Energy System, enabling homeowners to generate and store abundant clean energy,” the manufacturer said.

The module is produced in Lithuania at a newly installed manufacturing site with an annual capacity of 180 MW, SoliTek head Julius Sakalauskas told pv magazine. “The M40 panel has a power of 235 W and light transmittance of 40%, which means that as much as 40% of its surface is transparent and transmits more natural light than in our previous modules.”
The 40-cell panel has a power conversion efficiency of 12.6% and can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V. Its open-circuit voltage is 26.60 V and its short-circuit current is 11.01 A.
The frameless product measures 1,770 x 1,049 x 7.1 mm and has a weight of 30 kg. Front and back glass both have a thickness of 3 mm. The operating temperatures range from -40 to 85 degrees Celsius and the power temperature coefficient is -0.47% per degree Celsius.

The Lithuanian manufacturer offers a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 30-year product guarantee. Its output is guaranteed at 87% of the original efficiency for 30 years.
Solitek said that the M40 is almost two times cheaper than the previous versions of the panel.
Sakalauskas explained that the company gained experience in building the module through a 1.5 MW agrivoltaic rooftop project in Malaysia, for which it provided its conventional glass-glass products. “Even then it became clear that growing peppers in drier and hotter areas in the shade of solar modules can achieve much higher yields and significantly reduce the amount of water needed for irrigation. The yield of vegetables and fruit can increase by two to three times than in usual agriculture and the yield matures by 30% faster than under normal conditions,” he said, adding that water losses have been reduced by as much as 65%.
Solitek currently assembles solar modules at its facility in Lithuania. The company sold its IBC solar cell production lines to Finnish manufacturer Valoe in December 2020.

Swedish energy company Vattenfall is currently in the process of planning the first photovoltaic power plant in the Netherlands outside of the SDE+ program for large-scale renewables.
“We want to become a pioneer in the country,” Annemarie Schouten, Vattenfall's head of photovoltaic project development in the Netherlands, told pv magazine. “In the country, photovoltaic power plants are still preferably implemented through state subsidies, but projects with power purchase agreements (PPAs) are the future.”
The planned 16.8 MW solar facility is to be built with 25,000 bifacial modules in Almere, in the Netherlands' northern province of Flevoland. As the start of construction is planned for 2024, the energy company expects more powerful solar modules to be available over the next few years. In addition, the solar park will use solar trackers, which are expected to help it generate around 18.3 GWh per year.
The photovoltaic power plant will be built on state-owned land, which imposes special requirements, explained Schouten. That is why Vattenfall decided to use the trackers, to provide the soil with sufficient light and water and, thus, increase soil quality and biodiversity.
“It takes a long time to get the necessary permits,” said Schouten. Vattenfall has now submitted the applications for the environmental permit and once they are approved, the company will also enter into a dialogue with the community and residents about the planned project.
In addition, Vattenfal is trying to secure a grid connection for the photovoltaic power plant. “Getting approval for this is currently generally very difficult in the Netherlands,” continued Schouten. “The network operators are currently only connecting new photovoltaic power plants in a few places.”
However, the network operators have also announced that they want to invest in the expansion of the infrastructure. “This also speaks in favor of a long lead time for the project,” she further explained. “In general, Vattenfall is considering several options for its photovoltaic power plants in the Netherlands and combining them with battery storage in order to relieve the power grid and to get a connection more easily. However, the combined photovoltaic storage projects in the Netherlands are not yet economically viable.”
Vattenfall is also looking for customers who will buy the electricity generated by the solar park in Almere. Schouten is seeing increasing demand from industry in the Netherlands, but still at a very slow pace. “We are already in talks with some local companies,” she stated. “The aim is to conclude one or more PPAs with industrial customers at a fixed price, preferably for a term of 10 to 15 years.”
The experience from the project will certainly contribute to Vattenfall's decision as to whether it will increasingly rely on photovoltaic projects with PPAs in the future. “We believe that subsidy-free parks have a future, even if they are far from a reality in the Dutch market,” she concluded.

The entire project will require a total investment of RMB10 billion ($1.55 billion) and is scheduled for completion within five years.
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly yesterday announced the signing of a five-year deal to sell poly materials and its low-energy-intensity granular product to solar equipment supplier Wuxi Shangji Automation. Wuxi Shangji will buy at least 97,500 metric tons from January 1 to the end of 2026 with shipments and prices to be set monthly. According to current prices supplied by Taiwanese analyst PV InfoLink, the deal will be worth RMB26.2 billion (US$4.1 billion). GCL yesterday also contradicted a statement reported last month that was made by the company appointed to investigate its internal policies as one of the conditions to resume trading of its stock on the Hong Kong exchange. Crowe (HK) Risk Advisory Ltd had said it had found no evidence of due diligence being carried out before GCL pledged 865 million shares in its GCL New Energy solar project development business as part of a deal to secure a US$60 million loan from Bentley Rothschild Capital 5 Ltd. Only US$2.2 million of the cash arrived and the lender subsequently claimed the stock after stating the terms of the agreement had been breached, leaving GCL-Poly only a 49.24% stake in the project business. However, GCL-Poly said yesterday it had originally been asked to pledge shares tied to the full US$60 million of the proposed loan but had agreed to a commitment related to just the initial $16 million payment “to reduce its security exposure, as the company had not had any prior business dealings with the lender.” GCL added it had carried out desktop searches on the lender and broker concerned and had also checked the list of connected parties which is updated monthly by GCL’s secretarial department.
Heterojunction (HJT) solar new entrant Golden Solar on Tuesday announced it and “strategic partner” Gold Stone Energy Co Ltd had been approved by the National Development and Reform Commission as two of the three project partners to develop a national engineering research center for high efficiency solar cell equipment and technology. Gold Stone provides HJT production line equipment.
China's National Energy Administration (NEA) released statistics of residential PV installations in October that were registered as subsidized projects. The total installed and registered projects in mainland China achieved 1.93 GW, bringing the yearly cumulative installation capacity to 13.61 GW.
China's largest energy company, the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), will attempt to monetize the RMB1.18 billion (US$185 million) owed in renewable energy subsidies to the China Power International business it controls by taking ownership of the rights to the payments, which will be packaged into a trust as an underlying asset and used to issue asset-backed notes on the Chinese inter-bank bond market. China Power announced the arrangement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday.
Integrated PV company JA Solar announced on Wednesday plans to invest in new facility that will include 5 GW of module capacity and 2 GW of renewable energy. JA Solar signed the investment agreement for the comprehensive renewable energy facility with the local government of Chaoyang City, Liaoning Province. The new facility will include 5 GW of state-of-the-art PV module capacity and 2 GW of renewable energy capacity that will include wind, solar PV power and power storage. The total investment is valued at around RMB10 billion (US$1.55 billion) over a five-year period.

As the U.S. and global solar markets rapidly recover from disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a vision of optimal, resilient solar PV solutions to speed decarbonization and tackle the existential climate challenge was shared. Through a total of six hours of curated sessions that were moderated by Senior U.S. Editor David Wagman, U.S. Editor Tim Sylvia, global Editor in Chief Jonathan Gifford, and Associate Editor Ryan Kennedy, equipment manufacturers, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders shared their view of how to accelerate deployment in pursuit of national and global goals.
Watch here:
Karla Loeb, a member of the board of directors and the distributed generation chair of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) got things started with a spotlight on solar PV resiliency in an age of extremes. Under a shifting climate, disasters like what was witnessed in the winter storms of Texas, and Hurricane Ida are expected to persist in the future. A redefined grid, one that not only cuts climate-fueling carbon emissions, but one that is resilient to the weather events of our future is paramount.
Loeb shared, “We need energy where people live, not just in areas that support our industrial processes.” A distributed energy grid is less exposed to localized disasters and is better able to store, deliver, and perform auxiliary grid services under extreme events, including weather events and national security emergencies.
Her talk was followed by a panel featuring experts from Sandia National Laboratories, PV Evolution Labs, Enduans Solar, and VDE Americas. Under the moderation of Tim Sylvia, they shared strategies in bolstering PV’s defense from wind, hail, heat, fire threats, and more. We learned about the evolution of system components in an environment of increased risk, and how shifting risks due to environmental change factor into project insurance assessment.
An illuminating presentation was given by Claire Kearns-McCoy, senior project manager and solar engineer with Clean Energy Associates. Kearns-McCoy explained how electroluminescence (EL) imaging can be used to evaluate the quality of electrical contacts in solar cells.
She advocated for the use of EL imaging early in the installation process for field-based quality assurance. EL can provide a visual check for damage, defective modules, and proper installation techniques. Multiple steps of EL checks throughout the process can allow for problem remediation before an issue is widespread.
Next up was a deep-dive into module reliability from Hongbin Fang, director of product marketing with module-maker Longi. He reviewed the component ripple effect onset by the industry shift to larger-format modules. He shared that while adding thicker glass and sturdier frames to large-format modules would decrease microcracking, it would also increase costs and that Longi is instead focused on increasing overall efficiency to make up for some losses in cracking-related degradation.
Fang was joined by a panel that included Pedro Magalhães of Arctech Solar and Ben Damiani of Solar Inventions. With questions from Jonathan Gifford, the three dove deeper into how designs altered and adapted to the new large format. Balance of system issues are emerging, particularly in PV module electrical connectors, which many in the industry are calling for improved standards for safety and reliability.
A second fireside chat led by Tim Sylvia included software gurus Matt Campbell of Terabase and Aron Dobos of Nextracker. The three explored the factors that underly solar system underperformance, and how software tools can enhance performance. The cutting-edge solar project software uses 3D modeling, GIS, and Sim City-like construction simulators to model real-world possibilities, cutting costs and de-risking projects.
The first session wrapped up with a special presentation by Dana Redden, founder, and CEO of Solar Stewards. She explained why diversity, inclusion, equity, and justice need to have a center-stage position in the energy transition. Energy as an industry has a history of injustice along economic and racial lines, and the rebuilding of our energy infrastructure means we are at an inflection point in which we have the opportunity to restructure the way it is built and managed in a more inclusive and equitable way.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/19/talesun-focus-on-solar-tech-and-product-innovation-to-survive/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",VINCENT SHAW,"NOVEMBER 19, 2021",Talesun: Focus on solar tech and product innovation to survive,"
Dong Shuguang, President, Talesun Solar: I am not optimistic about the total installation figure for 2021, especially given China’s performance. We all know last year’s figure was around 125 GW. At the beginning of 2021, many people estimated installations would be between 155 and 180 GW this year. However, there have been so many challenges that have badly hit China’s figures.
Total PV installations for the first six months of 2021 saw just 13 GW added. Our experience is that the volume in the second half of the year would usually be 2.5 to 3 times that of H1, which will be around 32.5 to 39 GW. So, I think quite probably total PV installations in China in 2021 will be under 50 GW. The reasons for this are the price rises seen across the entire supply chain, especially in polysilicon, which pushed costs to a very high level and many planned projects have had to be postponed. This situation did not improve in Q3 and even now, many projects are still suspended.
The operation rates of many PV module manufacturers have also been lower than 60% since October and this will continue unless the polysilicon price drops.
The H1 market situation outside of China was as expected, with smooth progress and moderate growth; however, in H2, the negative impacts from the upstream cost rises began to trickle down. Contract implementation is particularly challenging (i.e., cost vs. profit balance) and this has hurt the reputation of China’s PV companies.
The European market has always had a high tolerance to cost; however, it has also experienced a slowdown since Q3. In H1, only the polysilicon producers experienced cost increases, but in H2, several other major materials like PV glass, aluminum frames, EVA films, silver, and copper all saw cost increases. There were too many black swans flying over the industry this year. My view is the whole world will suffer a much lower actual PV installation capacity than previously expected, and this dimness will continue into Q1 2022.
We have experienced logistical issues both in terms of traffic and increased costs. Despite ocean shipment costs stabilizing, and even slightly dropping in the past few weeks, we still see very high shipment costs compared to last year. For example, the quotes for 40-inch containers were 10 times higher compared to last year from China to the U.S., and six times higher from China to India.
China also experienced double control measurements (power control by the Chinese Government for both total consumption and energy intensity per GDP, which in some places caused power shutoffs and factory shutdowns) which influenced our production. Trade barriers and macroeconomic uncertainty are still potential risks, like the extra tariffs for imported PV goods to India, and global inflation from Quantitative Easing Monetary Policy by central banks in major economies.
We don’t plan to change our investment in our PV module lines because of the investment inertia, and we have placed orders for equipment. However, we are adjusting our expansion plans for solar cells, including changing some of the lines from the previously planned passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) technology to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon).
We believe that PERC still offers the best LCOE solution for solar PV farms, and it will dominate in the next two to three years. However, for future technologies, we have deployed multiple arrangements when installing our PERC lines to make them compatible with TOPCon. HJT seems to be a little far from practice and there are few manufacturers that can provide GW scale capacity. People are very cautious with it. Saying that in late 2021 or early 2022, Talesun will also produce and supply customers with HJT modules. Based on our advanced encapsulation technology and PV module manufacturing, we will outsource HJT cells and provide HJT modules. We think HJT is a very promising technology, but it still needs time.
All our current PERC lines are compatible with TOPCon requirements, and we estimate 20% of the lines and output will be TOPCon products by the end of 2022.
Personally, I am for large-size wafers because they increase conversion rates. I am against large power modules like 700 W or even 800 W products, however, because they represent no technical improvement. Talesun now focuses on 182mm based products, because we saw a mature industrial chain of 182mm that brings significant benefits to our customers. Compared to 182mm, I see very little improvement with 210mm sized modules. But there are a lot of uncertainties for both the manufacturers and end-users. We found most of our customers care more about the stability of products – something that has already been proved. The shift in size from 166mm to 210mm is too big and I think 182mm is a much better size.
Generally, Talesun has two R&D groups. One focuses on cell technology – now mainly on TOPCon. We have many micro-innovations in this area to keep our leading position in major product specifications like passivation, metallization, and others to reach better efficiencies and for cost control in future production. The other one is focused on PV modules. Our R&D group looks at the application of new materials for modules and some encapsulation technologies like high-density, tiny gaps between cells, etc.
Talesun has invested lots of R&D efforts into BIPV and we are extremely bullish about this market. As you said, BIPV is a real “Blue Sea” market; however, there are still many obstacles, like the standardization of products, security issues with systems, and value compensation for building materials that incorporate PV, etc. These issues and problems cannot be solved by solar PV companies solely, and government needs to get involved and provide policy support.
I think several principles have held up the company’s reputation. First, our pursuit of quality has given Talesun’s customers confidence regarding the stability of our products and systems. Second, we persisted in our commitments to customers and were unwilling to break any contracts, even if it meant a loss. In the past months, we have seen some Chinese PV module makers, even very large ones, start to re-negotiate with customers about signed contracts, due to the rising costs. We have not done that.
In terms of the kind of Talesun I would like to see in 10 years, I hope the company will grow to become a professional renewable energy enterprise focused on solar PV. With strong innovation capability, the company will have extended its R&D to focus on comprehensive aspects of renewable energy, even into the basic theory of solar. Furthermore, it is my hope that Talesun will gain many customers with deep cooperation for the design and manufacturing of solar PV products. But first, like Ren Zhengfei of Huawei said, the company needs to keep survival as the first target in today’s fast-changing world.

In the document, the two entities stressed that solar capacity is growing too fast in the country and that grid bottlenecks are becoming a serious issue, especially for the low-voltage network. “The pressure on the low-voltage grids represents a barrier for consumers and companies to continue investing in solar on the roof,” the white paper reads. “Energy storage can be a good way to remove that barrier, but unfortunately it is not yet financially attractive, partly due to the net metering scheme in place.”
The net metering scheme was modified by the Dutch government in 2020 and is expected to remain in force, if not modified, until 2030. Since these provisions were put in place, net metering payments for excess power fed back into the grid are planned to fall in value by 9% per year. These tariffs still ensure reasonable payback times and keep driving the country's residential PV market.
According to the two associations, if these rules are not amended and no incentives provided for storage, residential and commercial batteries may not reach commercial maturity in the Netherlands until 2028. If, instead, a rebate scheme covering 30% of the costs for buying and installing a battery is introduced, storage could already become viable by 2023.
The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency recently estimated the country could reach 27 GW of installed PV capacity by 2030. The report’s authors said the planned phasing out of net metering for rooftop PV was more likely to influence the type of projects installed after 2023 than overall volumes.
Dutch power and gas provider Liander – which serves the provinces of Gelderland and Noord-Holland and parts of Flevoland, Friesland and Zuid-Holland – recently said bottlenecks in the low-voltage grids may increase by 50% by 2030. In May 2020, the Dutch government said that grid operators were not obliged to compensate the owners of solar rooftops whose arrays are disconnected due to problems with grid capacity and voltage quality.
Liander recently implemented several measures to increase grid capacity in several Dutch regions afflicted by grid constraints, which are preventing more renewable energy plants from coming online. These include the deployment of two giant transformers and the application of congestion management to a bottleneck in the grid.
In November 2020, Netbeheer Nederland and the Dutch renewable energy associations De Nederlandse Vereniging Duurzame Energie (NVDE) and Holland Solar signed a preliminary agreement to ensure faster and cheaper grid connection of large-scale solar power plants to the network.

“The new manufacturing facility will produce monocrystalline PERC modules,” the company's CEO, Fahad Bin Omairah, told pv magazine. “We are targeting markets such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the United States, Europe and Africa.”
The factory will manufacture, in particular, M3 full cell panels, M10 half-cut products, and M12 modules with a 1/3 cut design. “Their nominal power range from 320 to 800 W,” Bin Omairah further explained.
The total investment in the new facility was SAR 700 million ($186.9 million). “This factory is aimed at boosting investments in solar energy and diversifying energy sources in our country, in addition to enabling integration with relevant government agencies and the private sector to support the creation of a domestic renewable energy industry,” Osama bin Abdulaziz Al-Zamil, Saudi Arabia's deputy minister of industry and mineral resources, said. 
“This represents a key milestone from Saudi investment showing its commitment to the solar industry, not only for itself but also, for the neighboring markets,” Ahmed S. Nada, president of the Middle East Solar Industry Association, told pv magazine. “Aligned with Vision 2030 of investing in future sustainable technologies, the Saudi factory is also a big step for local content while developing young Saudi talent and knowledge on solar industry manufacturing.”
The production equipment for the factory was supplied by Spanish PV equipment provider Mondragon Assembly.

Greek energy company Mytilineos has reached financial close on three of its solar farms in the southern New South Wales towns of Corowa, Junee, and Wagga Wagga, with a total of $104 million lent from ANZ, Societe Generale and Westpac.
The news marks Mytilineos’ first project financing in Australia, and the first project financing of solar PV projects by the company’s Renewables and Storage Development (RSD) business unit. Mytilineos’ specific renewables unit was formed after the company acquired Metka EGN in 2019, along with its NSW solar farm portfolio. The acquisition was part of Mytilineos’ strategic entrance into the Australian market, which the company says will be key for its extension into the Asia-Pacific region more broadly.
Mytilineos’ 120 MWp solar farm portfolio financing is structured to allow “money to be drawn for each project at its respective Commercial Operation Date (COD)” and includes a $95 million term loan and $9 million loan for ancillary facilities, it said.
The company noted it had managed to complete project construction in the first half of this year, seemingly referring to its Corowa Solar Farm which became fully operational in June. Its other solar farm in Wagga Wagga announced in April it would receive a 23 MW extension, though it is not clear whether that has been completed. In its statement, Mytilineos said its remaining projects are reaching “maturity stage” with construction slated for 2022.
Whenever the solar farms come online, the majority of the power produced within Mytilineos’ portfolio will be sold to supermarket giant Coles as part of a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The company expects the projects to produce 220 GWh annually.
In addition to this 120 MWp portfolio of solar farms in NSW, Mytilineos also owns the 110 MW Moura Solar Farm in Queensland which it acquired in December 2020. That very same month, the Greek company also bought the 75 MW Wyalong Solar Farm in New South Wales. As of December 2020, the company’s Australian portfolio sat at 400 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/19/us-landfills-could-host-more-than-60-gw-of-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 19, 2021",US landfills could host more than 60 GW of solar,"From pv magazine USA
The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)  released a report, The Future of Landfills Is Bright, that offers a guide to considering the value of solar power installed on landfills. The report indicates that more than 63 GW of solar power plant capacity could be located at less than half of U.S. landfills, generating 83 terawatt hours of electricity each year across all 50 states.
The plants also could generate more than than $6.6 billion annually in electricity revenue.
The report offers guidance to local jurisdictions for how to take advantage of these resources, including the considerations that must be taken when building on landfills, as well as how to create a financially viable marketplace for the sale of the solar electricity. It covers several necessary bureaucratic structures, and provides guidance on collecting the data necessary for siting projects on landfill.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, around 428 MWac of utility scale (greater than 1 MWac) landfill solar across 126 projects had been installed at the end of 2019. Notably, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are home to 73% of all U.S. utility-scale landfill solar projects.
Roughly speaking, if the projects cost $1.50 per watt to construct, it would cost a little less than $95 billion to build out the capacity that the RMI report envisions. Municipal electricity cooperatives could sell the electricity directly, or community solar programs might buy it, for 8¢/kWh, generating the $6.6 billion in first year revenue.
If the facilities were owned and managed by third parties, and the land was leased by municipalities at $1,000 per acre, then around $217 million a year in revenue could flow to the hosting jurisdictions.
Landfill sited solar capacity would nearly double the Biden administration’s goals to grow community solar sevenfold in five years, while increasing total U.S. solar power capacity by about 58% from 108 GWdc, the capacity reached at the end of the second quarter of 2021.
The report cited a lack of data: The RMI authors were able to locate public information on only 43% of the nation’s 10,000 closed landfills. Naturally, the report’s first recommendation is to broadly collect information about the remaining sites. Of course, once more information is collected, it must also be made available.
In order to assess the total potential of landfill solar, each site must provide key data. The site’s physical characteristics needed include the state of the landfill cap (the seal to keep the material in), settlement history, site grade, existing infrastructure and operations, on-site electricity demand data, as well as community concerns.
For those jurisdictions hoping to crunch their own numbers, RMI made available the criteria it used to develop its model for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. RMI estimates that solar could utilize 70% of the landfill land area considered, with a solar panel capacity of 9.5 watts per square foot.
Using the U.S. Department of Energy’s PVWatts calculator, both standard and premium panels were assessed and averaged together. The system was designed to be fixed, tilted at 20 degrees, with an azimuth of 180. Inverter efficiency was a realistic 96%, system losses 14%, and the DC to AC ratio was set at 1.2.
To calculate the potential employment opportunities generated by the construction, RMI assumed 11 jobs per megawatt, a figure borrowed from NREL’s JEDI modeling and ILSR’s Equitable Community Solar report from 2020.
Of course, once these pieces of land are recognized and deemed viable for solar projects, the most important piece of the equation will be ensuring that the billions of dollars invested in landfill solar projects have a chance to earn a fair return on the investment.
The report points out that in Massachusetts, certain regions included under the state’s SMART solar program have completely sold out. The program includes bonus incentives for building solar on landfill sites that have above average expenses.
Other RMI suggestions include equitable community solar program designs that take into account the local population when defining labor requirements, as well as local electricity savings. Another technique is to allow the landowning jurisdiction to make use of the electricity via net metering and remote net metering policies. These tend to produce the most efficient financial transactions.
The U.S. will need somewhere between 1,000 to 2,000 GW of solar power to electricity our transport and clean our power grid. Making full use of the 10,000 closed landfills across the nation to generate 10% of our electricity makes good sense.
