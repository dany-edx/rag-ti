“This new technology is aimed to solve the issues posed by the traditional low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) methods,” researcher Liao Baochen told pv magazine. “These are, among others, high maintenance costs and low deposition rates, especially for in-situ doping.”
The scientists described the proposed method as an innovative tube-type industrial plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technique. They claimed that it can provide high-quality, dense tunnel silicon oxide (SiOx) films at a low cost and high throughput.
They said it could be easily integrated into tube-type PECVD systems used for monocrystalline PERC solar module manufacturing.
“One deposition tool is sufficient to complete the deposition of all the thin film layers, making its fabrication process more competitive than conventional methods,” the researchers said.
The group built the cell with a G1 n-type wafer with a thickness of 170 μm and an area of 440.96 square centimeters. They deposited all the films at a temperature of 200 C and a cycle time of 25 seconds. They then controlled the SiOx thickness by adjusting the number of atomic layer deposition (ALD) cycles and annealed all samples in a tube furnace at 920 C for 45 minutes to facilitate crystallization and dopant activation.
As a final step, the academics screen-printed the cells on both sides with an aluminum-silver (Al-Ag) alloy paste for the front electrodes and Ag paste for the rear electrodes. They then fired the devices at a peak temperature of around 800 C using an industrial fast-firing furnace.
The research team tested the cells under standard illumination conditions and the best-performing device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 42.65 V, a short-circuit current of 17,74 A, and a fill factor of 81.0%.
The scientists also used 60 cells to build a 613 W TOPCon module that achieved an efficiency of 22.8%, an open-circuit voltage of 41.21 V, a short-circuit current of 18.17 A, and a fill factor of 79.5%.
“The cells were half-cut by laser and double-side laminated with two tempered glass panels to form bifacial modules,” they said.
They presented the new manufacturing process in “Atomic scale controlled tunnel oxide enabled by a novel industrial tube-based PEALD technology with demonstrated commercial TOPCon cell efficiencies > 24%,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The group includes academics from Nantong University, Chinese cell maker Tongwei, Singapore's Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, and China-based module maker Risen Energy.

More and more US homeowners are turning to rooftop solar, as energy bills and power outages are on the rise. Whether your goals are cost savings, more independence from the centralized energy grid, carbon emissions mitigation, or all of the above, it is a good idea to have an estimate of what your home’s solar project would look like before you begin gathering quotes.
This is where the SolarReviews website can help, by providing customer testimonials on installers and a handy Solar Calculator to estimate system size, production, cost, and savings. Based on a few parameters like zip code, average monthly bill, utility company, roof direction, and roof pitch, the calculator can generate a suggested system size and expected project savings over the lifetime of a system.
“It’s a truly open calculator,” Andy Sendy, SolarReviews CEO told pv magazine. “We educate consumers so they can’t get ripped off.”
The Solar Calculator is regularly updated with new assumptions, based on ever-shifting electric rates and available incentives and programs.
SolarReviews works with Genability, which actively feeds the latest utility rate and net metering structures into the calculator for up-to-date accuracy. It also integrates energy usage profile data from the US Energy Information Administration to estimate building energy use based on different climactic zones across the United States.
“This is the greatest effort that any website has gone through to provide a fully accurate estimating tool which isn’t behind any paywall or registration wall,” said Sendy.
People interested in battery energy storage can select a quote sized to their specifications.

SJVN Green Energy, a unit of state-owned hydropower producer SJVN, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Assam Power Distribution Co. Ltd. (APDCL) to develop 1 GW of floating solar in the Indian state of Assam.
They will build the proposed project on wetlands, with an estimated investment of INR 6,000 crore ($728.54 million). The deal is part of a broader agreement between the two parties to develop renewable energy generation in the state.
“In days to come, the aim is reach 5 GW floating power project capacity as the actual agreement [with SJVN Green Energy] translates into reality,” said Himanta Biswa Sarma, chief minister of Assam.
SJVN Green Energy will hold a 51% stake in the venture. APDCL will own the remaining 49%.
“Recently, the Assam govt signed another MoU with NLC Ltd for producing 1 GW of solar power. It has also received funding from the Asian Development Bank to generate another 1 GW of solar power in-house without any partner. The project will be developed by APDCL with funding support from ADB,” said Sarma.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/17/pcm-based-thermal-battery-to-store-solar-power-via-heat-pump/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NORWAY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 17, 2022",PCM-based thermal battery to store solar power via heat pump,"SINTEF, an independent research organization in Norway, has developed batteries based on PCM, which are able to store wind and solar power in the form of heat via a heat pump.
PCM can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
“The heat battery can use any heat source as long as a fluid carries the heat to/from the heat battery,” researcher Alexis Sevault told pv magazine. “For example, district heating is also coupled to our demo unit, for more flexibility in winter. In that case, water is the heat transfer fluid, since it is very well suited for most buildings. Our technology can also be used in industrial processes, using pressure heat transfer fluid, for example, pressurized CO2 for refrigerated or freezing industrial processes.”
The scientists embedded what they described as a “bio-battery” in a silver-colored container that hosts 3 tons of a type of PCM – a liquid biowax based on vegetable oil. It is reportedly able to melt at body temperature and becomes a solid, crystalline material when it becomes “cold” below 37 C.
The heat storage system also contains a heat exchanger for heat extraction.
“This is achieved with the help of 24 so-called cushion plates that release heat to the process water which serves as an energy carrier that removes the heat from the storage system,” the scientists explained. “Together, the PCM and the plates enable the heat bank to be both compact and efficient.”
The PCM absorb large amounts of heat by changing its physical state from solid to liquid, and then releases it when the material hardens. The battery is then able to heat cold water and release it toward a building's radiators and ventilation systems, thus supplying heated air.
“The PCM-based heat storage system is delivering exactly the performance we expected,” Sevault said, noting that his team tested the device for more than a year at the ZEB laboratory operated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). “We’re utilizing as much as possible of the building’s self-produced solar energy. We’re also finding that the system is very well suited to so-called peak shaving.”
According to the group's analysis, charging the bio-battery before the coldest parts of the day may help significantly reduce power consumption from the grid while taking advantage of fluctuations in the spot price.
“The system is thus much less sophisticated than a traditional battery – but it isn’t suitable for all buildings. As a new technology, investment costs remain high,” the group said.
According to Sevault, the proposed storage technology is much simpler than conventional batteries, as it does not require any rare materials, with a long expected lifetime and little need for maintenance.
“That being said, the specific cost in euros per kilowatt-hour is already comparable or lower than regular batteries, without being mass-produced yet,” he stated, without providing further details.
Other researchers at SINTEF recently developed a high-temperature industrial heat pump than can work with pure water as its work medium, and reportedly reach a temperature of up to 180 C. The machine, which the research group describes as the “world's hottest heat pump,” can be used with different industrial processes that rely on steam as an energy carrier and can reduce a facility's energy consumption by between 40% and 70%, as it enables the recovery of low-temperature waste heat, according to its creators.

“This is a single-junction, single cell with linear conduction width of 1.5 cm to simulate product-sized cells,” the company's managing director, Paul Moonie, told pv magazine. “The inorganic perovskite crystallizes at room temperature, so processing is compatible with common flexible substrates.”
The Australian perovskite solar cell maker said the result is a world record for inorganic perovskite solar cells.
“It was not certified by an independent entity, as there is no established independent certification for low-light solar cell performance,” Moonie said. “However, we do comply with all relevant international standards such as IEC 63163, including for long-term stability and durability testing.”
The company built the cell with roll-to-roll compatible coating technology. It designed the cell without a hole transport layer (HTL) and using carbon composite back contact, which it claims has excellent electrical conductivity.
“We are in the process of moving from semi-tech to full-scale production using this manufacturing technique,” he said, noting that, with further improving, the optoelectronic quality of perovskite and its interfaces, plus carbon composites-based back contact, may soon reach an efficiency of 40%. “Our aim is not just producing high-performance and long-life solar cells, but also utilizing low-cost materials. In saying that, our efficiencies are currently much higher than off-the-shelf indoor PV, and our potential customers are satisfied with our performance to offer advanced power solutions to their Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.”
In 2021, GreatCell acquired a solar module factory in Australia from Tindo Solar. In May, it announced plans to expand the factory.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/17/world-has-technical-potential-to-host-47-6-pwh-of-photovoltaic-thermal-panels/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 17, 2022",World has technical potential to host 47.6 PWh of photovoltaic-thermal panels,"Researchers from the Central European University in Hungary have estimated the global potential of photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) energy production on rooftops between 2022 and 2060.
Their model predicts that PVT systems currently have the technical potential to produce around 47.6 PWh, with the contribution on the PV side being around 29.5 PWh (62%), and that of thermal production 18.1 PWh (38%).
The study uses a high-resolution, geospatial energy supply model to estimate the useable building rooftop areas across eleven world regions and calculates the corresponding global and regional production that should be provided by rooftop PV-T collectors during the 39-year period. The model builds on an existing model called BISE, which has three major types of inputs: meteorological, building-related and technological parameters. According to the authors, the strength of their algorithm is that “it requires only easily obtainable and reproducible input data for meteorological and technological measures.”
The scientists assumed the electric and thermal efficiency of the PV-T collectors to be of 21.6% and 63.3%, respectively, as well as a temperature coefficient of -0.35% C for the PV unit. They also assumed the PV panels to rely on monocrystalline cells and an antireflective tempered glass. The thermal modules were assumed to rely on a flat plate collector and a copper absorber. For both technologies, degradation rates and possible technology advancements were not considered.
The model estimated total rooftop area values to vary between 3 billion square meters in Europe and 70 billion square meters in centrally planned Asia, including China, in the first year of the simulation period. However, only one-third of the total rooftop area was considered suitable for the installation of PV-T collectors.
By 2060, the highest installable rooftop area is expected in centrally planned Asia, Latin America, and North America. The lowest area is projected for Sub Saharan Africa, at 4.75 billion billion square meters, and Europe, at 1.2 billion billion square meters.
Total PV-T energy production potential is expected to be highest in centrally planned Asia, North America, and Latin America, with 9.7 PWh, 6.0 PWh, and 4.5 PWh, respectively.
“The most restrained potentials, on the other hand, are expected in Europe (0.24 PWh) and Sub Saharan Africa (1.28 PWh) where either the geographical (climatic) or the utilization potential of solar collectors may be reduced,” the scientists said.
Between 2022 and 2060, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are expected to see the greatest increase in PV-T energy production potential.
The scientists described their findings in “Estimating the global technical potential of building-integrated solar energy production using a high-resolution geospatial model”, which was recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.
“As the flexibility and the complexity of the BISE model allows and it could lead to even more robust estimations, our forthcoming studies will also prioritize simulations of solar potential undertaken at urban and neighborhood scale and supported by very high-resolution LIDAR-based rooftop information,” they said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/17/rooftop-wind-energy-innovation-claims-50-more-energy-than-solar-at-same-cost/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 17, 2022",Rooftop wind energy innovation claims 50% more energy than solar at same cost,"From pv magazine USA
A new bladeless wind energy unit, patented by Aeromine Technologies, is tackling the challenge of competing with rooftop solar as a local source of clean energy that can be integrated with the built environment. The scalable, “motionless” wind energy unit can produce 50% more energy than rooftop solar at the same cost, said the company.
The technology leverages aerodynamics similar to airfoils in a race car to capture and amplify each building’s airflow. The unit requires about 10% of the space required by solar panels and generates round-the-clock energy. Aeromine said unlike conventional wind turbines that are noisy, visually intrusive, and dangerous to migratory birds, the patented system is motionless and virtually silent.
An Aeromine system typically consists of 20 to 40 units installed on the edge of a building facing the predominant wind direction. The company said the unit can minimize energy storage capacity needed to meet a building’s energy needs, producing energy in all weather conditions. With a small footprint on the roof, the unit can be combined with rooftop solar, providing a new tool in the toolkit for decarbonization and energy independence.
Buildings and the built environment account for nearly 50% of all carbon emissions globally, according to Architecture 2030. Building operations contributes about 27% of emissions, while buildings materials and construction, and other construction industry energy use are estimated to account for another 20%. This represents an opportunity for buildings to be made more efficiently, and to adopt innovative technologies to generate emissions-free electricity.
“This is a game-changer adding new value to the fast-growing rooftop power generation market, helping corporations meet their resilience and sustainability goals with an untapped distributed renewable energy source,” said Aeromine CEO David Asarnow. “Aeromine’s proprietary technology brings the performance of wind energy to the onsite generation market, mitigating legacy constraints posed by spinning wind turbines and less efficient solar panels.”
BASF Corporation is currently testing the Aeromine system at a manufacturing plant in Wyandotte, Michigan. The patented technology was validated through joint research with Sandia National Laboratories and Texas Tech University.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/17/prospects-for-us-solar-electricity-at-0-kwh/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 17, 2022",Prospects for US solar electricity at $0/kWh,"From pv magazine USA
The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could become a transformative document, enabling a grand experiment in energy generation at a national level, according to a new report by Credit Suisse. It believes that the United States has an opportunity to become a global leader in clean energy, much like it is already in the fossil industry.
Among the many ideas discussed in the document is a striking prediction – there may be solar power projects whose levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) drops below a penny per kilowatt hour, bottoming around $0.004/kWh ($4/MWh) in 2029. We could see these prices as soon as 2025, and they could persist beyond 2030.
If we combine a few data points, we can see how this number is possible – and might even have room to go lower. First, the IRA will pay solar panel manufacturers up to $0.18/W when manufacturing modules. Each item along the module supply chain gets a piece – polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules.
Consider that it has only been a few years since First Solar told Bloomberg that their manufacturing costs were around $0.20/W – with the IRA, they’re on a pathway to a $0.02/W product. Since First Solar has nearly sold out for the upcoming few years, and may not feel enough pressure to reach pricing that low, this author doesn’t expect the most extreme lows to materialize. But according to this report, there are plenty of other solar module manufacturers that could get to an essential cost of $0.06/W to §0.10/W.
The lowest number could be pushed upward by demand, as some market projections suggest that we could see 100 GW of solar demand by the end of the decade.
The report also suggests that the United States might become a net exporter of solar modules to the global market, while pushing our natural cost of manufacturing modules toward $0.20/W near the end of the 2030s. That is still 33% greater than estimates for China’s estimated costs (per the chart, above).
Second, we have to layer on the Production Tax Credit (PTC). For 10 years after a project is constructed, it will receive an inflation adjusted tax credit for every kilowatt-hour generated. Larger projects tend to take the PTC in lieu of the Investment Tax Credit, mostly due to project scale and capacity factor.
Additionally – we can increase the PTC two times, by about one-third each time. The first increase will come from modules manufactured with domestic content, and the second will come from building solar in energy communities.
When we combine the cheap IRA solar panels with the PTC, we’ll start to see domestic solar power PPAs at $0.00/kWh at some point in the second half of the decade. PPAs below zero have happened before.
It is clear why Credit Suisse spent more than a hundred pages going far beyond just wind and solar in its report. That includes a lot of discussion about cheaply manufactured green hydrogen as well. Will the hydrogen be produced with $0/kWh solar? Hydrogen will have its own additional incentive of $3/kg.
*The article was amended on October 17 to reflect that the expected LCOE for large scale solar by 2029 is $0.004/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/17/iea-pvps-expects-polysilicon-prices-to-stabilize-by-end-of-2023/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 17, 2022",IEA-PVPS expects polysilicon prices to stabilize by end of 2023,"The IEA PVPS recently published its latest report on “Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2022.” The PV industry recorded higher prices across the upstream sector, mostly driven by high polysilicon prices. Other factors involved high silver and aluminum prices, increased logistics costs, and shortage of semiconductors. China remained the world’s largest producer along the PV supply chain, but Malaysia, Vietnam, Germany, the US, India, Norway, Turkey, among others, also gained space.
“I think that the global polysilicon manufacturing capacity will double by the end of this year, compared with the previous year. At the end of next year, I believe, the polysilicon price will be stabilized,” Izumi Kaizuka, principal analyst at RTS Corp., told pv magazine.
At the end of July 2022, the reported spot price for polysilicon was $0.38/kg, an increase from the $0.29/kg at the end of May 2021, and from the $0.10/kg at the end of December 2020.
“In 2022, the high prices [were] maintained for polysilicon due to the demand growth and to the shutdown of several plants, because of the electricity shortage in China,” said the report.
The solar industry used 604,812 tons of polysilicon in 2021, an increase from 497,300 tons in 2020, which amounted to 94% of the global of polysilicon last year. China was the world’s largest producer of polysilicon, accounting for 623,000 tons, followed by Germany with 65,000 tons, and Malaysia with 3,000 tons. Other countries are entering the market or reinstating their position.
“Already in Norway there’s some fronts, and also in Turkey we have manufacturing capacity. I also expect India to increase production … which should take 2 to 3 years,” said Kaizuka. “In the US, some of the polysilicon manufacturing plants had stopped operation, for example REC Silicon’s Moses Lake plant, but now they announced they are restarting the production for solar. The US manufacturing capacity is expected to increase, so the US [polysilicon] production may be active in the near future.”
For the time being, IEA PVSP expects China to remain the global top producer of polysilicon, but with the US import ban on products from Hoshine “future production locations might change”, the report reads. The recent Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) “is also expected to trigger an increase of the US polysilicon production for the PV sector.”
Bigger wafers
Global wafer production amounted to 233 GW in 2021, a 39% increase from 2020, with a production capacity of 415 GW/year, up from 218 GW/year the previous year. Volume and production capacity of polycrystalline wafers decreased, while those of monocrystalline increased “due to the demand for higher efficiency PV modules.”
The spot price for crystalline silicon wafers, which generally follows the price of polysilicon, was $0.78/piece for 158.75 mm to 161.75 mm wafers at the end of July 2022, an increase from the $0.74/piece in November 2021, and the $0.35/piece in January 2021, according to the report. Larger wafers of 182 mm were priced at $0.97/piece.
The past year marked a move to larger wafer sizes, with the market share of 182 mm (M10) to 210 mm (M12) wafers increasing from 4.5% in 2020 to 45% in 2021. Wafers of 158.75 mm to 166 mm accounted for around of 50% of total production.
IEA PVSP expects that the market share of large-sized wafers will increase further and that they will become major products by 2030.
China produced more than 97% of the world’s wafers and exported around 22.6 GW to other PV cell manufacturing countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Korea and India. The first four countries, alongside Norway, already have water manufacturing capacities, and Hungary, France, Russia, Turkey, and Spain also reported plans for new production capacities.
Cell production
Crystalline silicon and thin-film solar cell production reached around 241 GW in 2021, a 35.4% increase from 2020, and global manufacturing capacity was around 441 GW/year.
The spot price for monocrystalline-PERC cells ranged between $0.155/W to $0.18/W as of July 2022, depending on wafer size, an increase from the $0.12/W to $0.14/W in January 2021.The price level has reportedly been stable since November 2021, with some floatation according to demand. Soaring prices for silver, in the order of 22% in 2021 according to the Silver Institute, also played a role in cell’s higher prices.
China produced 82.2% of the global cell production, accounting for around 198 GW of solar cells in 2021, a 46.8% increase from 135 GW in 2021. Malaysia produced 13.1 GW, Vietnam 8.8 GW, South Korea 5.5 GW, and Thailand 5 W.
“Thailand and Vietnam are not subject to the safeguard tariffs by the USA and the production capacities are increasing in these countries,” the report said.
Europe, the United States, India, and Japan also reported production, for which the report did not include figures.
PERC and TOPCon technologies had a market share of 85%, up from 76% in 2020, according to the report. Technologies such as silicon heterojunction (STJ) and back contacts retained a market share of around 5%.
The share of bifacial solar cells reached 50% globally and is expected to reach more than 60% by the end of 2022. “One of the reasons of this growth is that bifacial products are exempted of the US safeguards duties. Also, the output increase with single axis tracker contributed to the market growth,” the report says.
Module output
Global PV module production increased to 242 GW in 2021 from 178.5 GW in 2020. High polysilicon prices also increased module prices. In July 2022, the average spot price was $0.256/W for a “typical monocrystalline polysilicon PV module”, according to the report. In January 2021, the average price was $0.192/W, which increased to $0.26/W in October 2021 and slightly decreased to $0.247/W in December 2021.
Glass and polymer materials reportedly also impacted the price of PV modules, with the price of glass having increased by 18.2% and the EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) price soaring 35% in August 2021, according to a statement issued in September 2021 by five major Chinese PV module manufacturers.
China produced 181.8 GW of modules in 2021, and exported the highest amount ever, 98.5 GW, according to the Chinese PV Industry Association. Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea, and the US made up the remaining top five of module manufacturers, with 16.4 GW, 9.1 GW, 8 GW, and 6.6 GW of production capacity, respectively.
The market share of crystalline silicon (c-Si) modules was 96.6% in 2021, with monocrystalline accounting for 88.9% of those. More than 80% of PV modules used half-cut c-Si solar cells, and shingled PV module technology was also adopted. Thin-film silicon technologies had a slight loss of market share in 2021, from 3.6% to 3.4%, with around 8.2 GW of thin-film PV modules being produced worldwide, 7.9 GW of which were produced by First Solar.
The report also includes a 2021 ranking of the top five manufacturers in terms of PV cell, module and shipment volume.
