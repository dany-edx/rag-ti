Saudi Arabian energy giant ACWA Power announced the financial close for the 200 MW Kom Ombo project, a utility-scale solar power plant in Egypt. With an overall investment cost of US$182 million, the Kom Ombo plant is expected to be commercially operational in January 2024.
ACWA Power announced a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Government of Egypt in October 2018 to develop, finance, construct and operate the Kom Ombo project. The plant will be located less than 20 kilometres from Africa’s biggest solar park, the 1,465 MW Benban complex, also developed by ACWA Power.
A financial package of US$ 123 million for the project was previously announced in April 2023. The package comprised of loans of up to US$ 35.6 million from the EBRD, US$ 14.4 million from the OPEC Fund, US$ 14.4 million from the AfDB, US$ 34.1 million from the GCF, US$ 14.4 million from Arab Bank and US$ 10 million from the SEFA under the COVID-19 IPP relief programme. The project already has equity bridge loans of US$ 14 million from the EBRD and US$ 45 million from APICORP.
The International Renewable Energy Agency's (IRENA) latest statistics show that Egypt hit 1,724 MW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of 2022.

Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (ISE) said it will support French startup Holosolis, a spinoff of EIT InnoEnergy, in building a module manufacturing facility in Hambach, near Sarreguemines, in northwestern France.
The site is at a now-abandoned factory project by REC. The Norwegian solar module manufacturer originally planned to build a 4 GW heterojunction panel factory there.
“HoloSolis' approach of building a PV production line from solar cells to PV modules while further developing the technology convinced us from the beginning,” said Jochen Rentsch, head of technology transfer in the photovoltaics division at Fraunhofer ISE. “We are very happy to be able to accompany the young company on its way to become a major European-based producer of PV components.”
Three European players – EIT Innoenergy, French IDEC Group, and TSE – founded Holosolis. EIT Innoenergy is an EU co-financed cleantech investor based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. IDEC Group is a significant local real estate player in France, while TSE is a key producer of solar energy in France and a leader in agrivoltaics.
Holosolis stands as a flagship initiative under the European Solar PV Industry Alliance (ESIA), which aims to establish a European production capacity of 30 GW annually by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/31/the-sunny-side-of-solar-in-brazil-is-job-creation/,"SPONSORED,BRAZIL",,"AUGUST 31, 2023",The sunny side of solar in Brazil is job creation,"In Brazil, Elera Renováveis, a subsidiary of Brookfield Renewables, has selected Huawei to supply inverters for the two phases of the 1.2 GWp Janaúba solar project in the city of the same name in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. It is one of the largest operational solar generation assets in Latin America.
The Janaúba project consists of 20 plants, each with a 50 MW generation capacity Grid connection has been carried out gradually, as each plant was completed.
Some 2.2 million bifacial photovoltaic modules, with rated capacities of 535 Wp, 540 Wp, and 545 Wp, were supplied by manufacturers for both first and second phases.
The 20 solar parks – which are spread over an area of 3,069 hectares – will generate enough electricity to power 1.8 million Brazilian households and will eliminate more than 4.3 million tons of CO2 emissions.
It is important to note that all the plants have power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The inverters chosen for the project were Huawei’s smart string inverter SUN2000-185KTL-H1 for the first phase, with 4,116 units, and 1,512 SUN2000-215KTL units for the second phase. In this regard, Alberto Lopes, Vice President of Engineering and Construction at Elera Renováveis, explains that “the Huawei string inverter was chosen by considering the benefit of distributed architecture, compared to other market options.”
“The main advantage,” Lopes adds, “is that should an inverter fail, the power lost is not so big, and Huawei inverters have extremely high availability.”
In addition to this, Lopes points out other particularities of the inverters: “In the Huawei smart string solution, the technology of the equipment, and the facility of the management of the information are a huge benefit for the quality and reliability of the energy’s commercialization.”
The project is located in the city of Janaúba, 553 km from the city of Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, and 879 km from the port of Salvador, the capital of Bahia state. Lopes says there were no major logistical problems. “The main difficulty was the lack of specialized local labor for electrical and mechanical activities,” he says. “Elera faced this issue by promoting training for the local labor force in partnership with EPC [engineering, procurement, and construction services] providers.”

Referring to the workforce employed, Lopes puts the figure at 3,689 employees during the construction of the first phase while the second phase required 2,245 people. “Seventy percent of the workforce was local, from Janaúba and the nearby community of Quem Quem,” he adds.
All in all, if indirect jobs are also added, this means the creation of around 11,000 jobs.
Finally, it should be added that the company has invested $10 million into the neighboring community for environmental and social projects, vocational training, and the rehabilitation of public spaces, among other actions.

The consortium behind the transaction includes local entities Comfit Composite Knit, Viyellatex Spinning, and Midland East Power.
The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has allocated 900 acres of land for the solar facility in Bagerhat district, near a 1,320 MW coal power plant, which is expected to be operational by 2026. The consortium plans to invest approximately $430 million to set up the power plant.
The BPDB, having obtained approval from the Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase, will sign a power purchase agreement with the consortium. The agreement will establish a 20-year commitment to procure electricity at a rate of $0.1020/kWh, governed by the principle of “no electricity, no payment.” The confirmation of the cabinet's support for the solar power plant proposal was conveyed by Sayeed Mahbub Khan, the additional secretary of the cabinet division, during a recent press briefing.
ACWA Power had previously inked a memorandum of understanding with the BPDB in November of the prior year, outlining their intention to develop 1,000MW of solar power capacity across Bangladesh. The company, headquartered in Jeddah, is presently evaluating potential locations, including Payra in Patuakhali and Mirsarai in Chattogram, for the establishment of an additional 700MW solar power plant.
ACWA Power is mainly owned by the Saudi government, with a 75% stake, while private entities hold the remaining 25%. Just last month, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina officially inaugurated the country's largest 200 MW Teesta Solar Power Plant in Gaibandha. The national grid also recently started receiving power from another utility-scale solar plant – a 100 MW array in Rampal that is owned by Orion Group.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/31/raygen-opens-4-mw-solar-hydro-plant-in-australia/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 31, 2023",RayGen opens 4 MW ‘solar hydro’ plant in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
RayGen has officially launched its first commercial concentrated PV and thermal storage project, following the successful commissioning of a 4 MW solar plant backed by 2.8 MW/50 MWh of long-duration storage at Carwarp, northwestern Victoria.
RayGen said the plant has been “exporting electricity day and night and has been charging our storage from our solar and from the grid … All component systems have demonstrated performance against specification.”
The company said an offtake agreement with energy retailing giant AGL for the entirety of the plant’s production will soon go into effect.
The Carwarp plant uses a combination of RayGen’s solar and hydro technology to produce 24-hour renewable electricity. The system features a field of smart, rotational mirrors that concentrate sunlight onto a tower-mounted receiver containing an array of PV modules. That solar energy is combined with the energy stored across two water reservoirs to create a ‘hot and cold’ solar hydro solution.
Melbourne-based RayGen said the Carwarp plant will add 4 MW of renewable power and 17 hours of storage capacity to the West Murray grid. The plant is expected to provide enough renewable electricity to power approximately 1,700 average Victorian homes.
RayGen Chief Executive Officer Richard Payne said the successful commissioning of the Carwarp plant is a significant milestone in the commercialisation of the company’s energy generation and storage technologies.
“This project has validated the performance of our modular system at utility scale,” he said. “In just four years, we have progressed from a concept for dispatchable renewable energy to a utility-scale reality.”
Payne said the project has provided valuable, real-world “lessons learned,” which have been incorporated into the development of much larger projects.
“Successfully delivering this project is simply an outstanding result and provides a launching pad to deploy much larger projects,” he said.
Markus Brokhof, chief operating officer at AGL, said the technology provides a possible solution to the challenge of long-duration energy storage particularly given its potential to be scaled.
“This innovative approach to long-duration energy storage using concentrated PV and thermal hydro storage greatly improves the efficiency and economics of solar plus storage, providing a potential solution for long duration energy storage,” he said. “The technology has the potential to be deployed at greater scale.”
The official launch of the Carwarp plant coincided with an announcement from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) confirming that it will provide an additional AUD 10 million ($6.5 million) in grant funding to accelerate the development of RayGen’s technology.
Payne said the new funding agreement will allow RayGen to “industrialise our supply chain, progress engineering for larger projects, and accelerate down the cost-curve … Our pipeline is part of the energy transition of this country. RayGen’s new approach complements other established solutions and offers the lowest cost pathway to a zero-carbon grid.”
As well as working with AGL to develop a plant at Liddell, RayGen is also working with Dutch company Photon Energy on a major project in South Australia. The proposed Yadnarie project would have a total solar generation capacity of 200 MWdc coupled with 24 hours of energy storage capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/31/new-techique-to-color-flexible-thin-film-bipv-vipv-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",VALERIE THOMPSON,"AUGUST 31, 2023","New techique to color flexible thin-film BIPV, VIPV panels","A group of researchers led by the Korea Institute of Material Science (KIMS) have developed a new optical technique to color flexible thin-film building-integrated and vehicle-integrated solar panels.
The proposed technology is reportedly able to exhibit different reflective colors and not significantly reduce solar cell efficiency. “We directly fabricated the cell using a transparent electrode based on hydrogenated aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) material and silicon thin film,” the research lead author, Jung-dae Kwon, told pv magazine.
The scientists also designed a multi-layer thin film with a refractive index difference of less than 5%, which they claim minimizes the reflection loss in the visible light region absorbed by the solar cell. “It can be applied to various absorbers for thin-film solar cells as it hardly reduces the solar cell efficiency due to color implementation,” they explained.
In the paper “Flexible multi-layered coloring transparent electrode composed of AZO–based materials,” published in Chemical Engineering Journal, the researchers explained that the hydrogenation of AZO causes passivation in vacancies of oxygen and zinc, strengthening the oxygen and hydrogen bonds, which delivers the desired electrical and optical properties.
They tested their approach on a thin-film cell based on amorphous silicon (a-Si). To achieve all three primary colors, the team used conventional vacuum sputtering deposition to fabricate a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) electrode made of six pairs of AZO and AZO:H on ultra-thin colorless polyimide.
The DBRs consist of alternating dielectric layers, commonly serving as reflectors and dielectric mirrors, and their multilayered composition alternates between high and low refractive indices, resulting in customizable reflection spectra.
The group stressed it was able to control color and conductivity by the thickness of the DBR layers, which they said resulted in  little difference in power conversion efficiency for each color, excellent flexibility, and durability under bending stress. The best results were achieved with a green-colored prototype, which had a power conversion efficiency of 5.45%.  The prototypes for all three colors withstood 600 cycles at a 6 mm bending radius. The power ratings were 1.14 W, 1.29 W, and 1.22 W per gram for blue, green, and red, respectively.
The researchers concluded that the methodology can be used for a variety of thin-film solar cells that require both color and flexibility in a low-cost process. Moreover, since the reflective color is implemented as an optical filter, it “can be applied to various fields such as image sensors, photolithography masks, and infrared shielding.
“We are still in the basic research stage, and commercialization will take time as there is no basis for large-area production,” Kwon concluded.

They conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE), which is a quantitative approach commonly used in healthcare to elicit preferences from participants, to examine the preferences of households for heat pump leasing options via an online survey. “The questionnaires and DCE designs were pre-tested with 12 experts and house owners to verify their adequacy and intelligibility.”
Respondents were asked to provide an answer on the preferred leasing model and their preference between leasing and purchasing. “Once respondents had selected their preferred leasing option, we asked them in a second stage to imagine that they now also had the option to purchase the heat pump for a specific price, paid upfront. We explained that the purchasing price included the installation costs and a two-year warranty, but no maintenance,” the academics explained.
An unspecified market research institute conducted the market survey between February and March 2022, which involved 1,582 single-family house owners spread across the three countries considered in the study. The final sample includes data from 915 single-family house owners who answered on a total of 9,150 hypothetical heat-pump leasing decisions.
The survey showed that monthly lease payments and lease contracts are crucial factors in decision-making, and that homeowners tend to prefer all-inclusive leasing products with lower monthly payments.
“Their average willingness to pay for an all-inclusive package relative to a basic package that would only include the heat pump and installation is similar across countries,” the researchers said, adding that German and Swiss households seem to be willing to pay more than their French counterparts. “Heating specialists, local energy utilities, and heat pump manufacturers could consider providing – alone or in collaboration – lease offerings in which the heat pump, installation, yearly maintenance, and potential repairs and part replacement costs are all included.”
Their findings can be read in the study “Preferences of homeowners for heat-pump leasing: Evidence from a choice experiment in France, Germany, and Switzerland,” published in Energy Policy. “Further research could focus on elucidating the influence of the current energy crisis on households' preferences for heating services, including heat-pump leasing,” they concluded.

AEMO says “imminent and urgent investment” is required to improve the reliability of Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM), with a new report warning of potential supply shortfalls in the national power grid over the next decade.
The latest “Electricity Statement of Opportunities” (ESOO) report – which projects the market demand and supply over the coming decade for the eastern mainland states and Tasmania – flags supply concerns, heightened risks from coal outages and the need to incentivise continued supply in the NEM.
AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said the report “highlights the pace of Australia’s energy transition and the urgency needed to deliver new investment to ensure reliable, affordable and cleaner energy for consumers … Over the 10-year outlook, we continue to forecast reliability gaps, which are mostly due to the expectation that 62% of today’s coal fleet will retire by 2033. To ensure Australian consumers continue to have access to reliable electricity supplies, it’s critical that planned investments in transmission, generation and storage projects are urgently delivered.”
The ESOO forecasts that electricity consumption and peak demand will grow in the next decade due to population growth and the electrification across all sectors of the economy, including transport and residential sectors, and the electrification of traditional gas loads.
Considering only existing, committed and anticipated projects as per the ESOO’s “central scenario,” reliability risks are forecast to exceed the “relevant reliability standard” in Victoria from this summer, in South Australia this summer and then again from 2028-29, in New South Wales from 2025-26, and Queensland from 2029-30.
The reliability gaps are larger than were forecast in the February ESOO update but AEMO said government programs and a pipeline of proposed generation and storage projects – totaling 173 GW of renewable energy generation and 74 GW of storage – have the potential to address the identified risks.
“These forecasts highlight the high value of solutions in which resources owned by consumers, such as residential electricity generation and storage devices, and increased demand flexibility, can help meet power system needs,” AEMO said. “With a high level of consumer participation and coordination of consumer energy assets and demand to help meet power system needs, the need for utility-scale solutions would be much lower.”
Australian Energy Council (AEC) Chief Executive Officer Sarah McNamara said she expects the new report will act as a spur to the private sector to invest in new generation.
“It also reinforces the need for careful coordination and prioritisation of the necessary generation, firming capacity and transmission,” she said, noting that the electricity industry is well positioned to meet the challenges outlined in the report. “There is still time to meet these challenges and realize these opportunities if the market is permitted to provide the price signals necessary to bring forward investment. Even if new investment were not forthcoming, it’s worth noting that most of the near-term reliability shortfalls relate only to the ‘interim’ reliability standard, which is a very conservative measure, and not the traditional reliability standard.”

They explained that sprinklers usually work at higher working pressure and more energy consumption than drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation systems, and that photovoltaics alone may have some limitations in solving issues derived from its intermittent energy supply. “The spraying quality cannot be guaranteed,” they added. “Therefore, energy storage devices are often needed for a stable energy supply.”
The CAES-PV irrigation system designed by the group consists of a water source, a 150 W water pump, a 240 W PV array consisting of two 120 W panels, a pressure tank made of carbon steel, a time-delay switch, and a sprinkler. The PV panels power the pump to draw water from the water source and inject it into the closed pressure tank.
“With the increased water in the tank, the air in the tank is gradually compressed,” it stressed. “When the internal energy of the air in the tank reaches the critical value, the valve of the tank opens and the internal energy of the air is converted into kinetic energy of the spray water, supporting the spraying lasts for a few seconds.”
The system performs this process in cycles triggering pulse spraying.
Through a series of tests, the academics found that the proposed CAES-PV sprinkler is able to provide stable standardized intermittent pulse spraying. “Reasonable selection of energy storage regulation factor and nozzle combination spacing can achieve a spraying uniformity coefficient of 91.5 %,” they specified, noting that the system can also provide high pressure and low intensity high-quality spraying.
The novel system design is presented in the paper “Solar photovoltaic coupled with compressed air energy storage: A novel method for energy saving and high quality sprinkler irrigation,” published in Agricultural Water Management.
“Due to the limited research in this respect, further research should be carried out in terms of the energy conversion efficiency of CAES-SPV sprinkling irrigation system, as well as soil water infiltration, soil microenvironment changes and their effects on crop yield and quality under low-intensity and long-term intermittent spraying,” the research group said, looking forward to improving the technology.
