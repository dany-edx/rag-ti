Specifically, the adoption of silicon anodes in lithium-ion batteries has been held back by their mechanical instability, which arises from uncontrolled volume expansion upon lithiation, the process of combining with a lithium-ion, and the subsequent formation of an unstable solid-electrode interface.
Presently, nanostructured silicon is most often explored as a solution to these issues, but it comes with it a set of drawbacks. They include supply gap, the difficult and expensive synthesis process, and the threat of fast battery dry-up. However, moving from nanostructured silicon to otherwise cost-effective and user-friendly micron silicon particles (SiMPs) only amplifies the aforementioned problems. But now, researchers from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science (JAIST) believes they have found a solution to the issues plaguing SiMPs.
The team described their findings in Journal of Materials Chemistry A. They reported a holistic approach to synthesizing novel highly resilient SiMPs consisting of black glasses (silicon oxycarbide) grafted silicon as anode material for lithium-ion batteries.
“Silicon nanoparticles might provide increased effective surface area but that comes with its own drawbacks like increased consumption of electrolyte as well as poor initial coulombic efficiency after a few cycles of charging and discharging. SiMPs are the most appropriate, low-cost, and easily available alternatives, especially when combined with materials that have exceptional structural properties, such as silicon oxycarbide black glasses. Our material is not only high performing but also conducive to scale opportunities” said Prof. Noriyoshi Matsumi.
The team designed a core-shell type material with a core made up of SiMP, coated in a layer of carbon. They then grafted the silicon oxycarbide black glasses on as the shell layer. The prepared material was used in an anodic half-cell configuration to test its ability to reversibly store lithium under different potential windows. It demonstrated great lithium diffusion ability, reduced internal resistance, and overall volumetric expansion.
The superior electrochemical properties of this new material were further established by the 99.4% retention of energy capacity, even after 775 cycles of charging and discharging. In addition, the material also exhibited great mechanical stability throughout the testing process, the researchers said.
The JAIST researchers have also reported the successful integration of black glasses grafted silicon microparticles as a negative electrode material in a full-cell when paired with a commercially available lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA) cathode.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/11/gallium-doping-keeps-p-type-in-the-frame/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 11, 2022",Gallium doping keeps p-type in the frame,"For several years, the world’s largest silicon PV manufacturers have investigated n-type technologies as a route to higher-performance products. Typically, these have been more expensive to produce, but come with the potential for higher efficiency and lower susceptibility to various degradation mechanisms that hurt performance over time, and therefore higher energy yields.
And in 2022, with the cost gap between n-type and p-type modules narrowing, and further improvements to p-type PERC technology in mass production proving difficult to come by, large-scale PV manufacturers are beginning to make the switch to n-type technology.
However, new research from Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE suggests that with a small change to their production, p-type wafers can achieve similar performance to n-type when integrated into the latest cell architectures.
“Leading wafer manufacturers see fundamental reasons why n-type Cz-Si wafers will remain more expensive than their p-type counterparts,” the researchers observe. “This contribution indicates that switching the doping level and doping species of p-type Cz-Si wafers towards higher resistivities and Ga doping offers an alternative that might be economically interesting compared to n-type material.”
PV manufacturers began to replace boron doping with gallium around 2019, as a solution to light-induced degradation caused by a reaction between boron and oxygen. But this switch has raised further questions over the effect of gallium, and there is plenty more research underway.
In this investigation, Fraunhofer ISE worked with a major silicon ingot producer to produce a full sized gallium doped silicon ingot, made to ISE’s exact specifications to achieve a resistivity range a full order of magnitude higher than usual commercial products. The group then selected wafers representing the complete length of this ingot, and used them to fabricate cells based on architectures similar to those moving toward the manufacturing mainstream with n-type wafers. These cells were then subjected to a range of performance and reliability tests, and compared to identically processed n-type TOPCon and heterojunction (HJT) cells.
The results of these tests were described in “High Lifetime Ga-doped Cz-Si for Carrier Selective Junction Solar Cells,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. For a tunnel oxide passivate contact rear emitter cell, similar to the TOPCon architecture gaining ground commercially, the best of the p-type cells showed a 0.2% efficiency advantage, while those used in HJT cells were 0.36% less efficient.
The researchers also noted that the cells were produced using processes optimized for n-type cells, and that adaptations could push the p-type efficiency higher. With respect to the TOPCoRE cells, these results already show a significant economic advantage thanks to lower wafer costs and higher efficiency.

There are also difficulties in sourcing foreign specialists for the commissioning of installations, it said.
Russia is struggling to establish the necessary infrastructure and legal frameworks for the replacement of imported components and technologies. However, Western sanctions threaten to disrupt both power generation and the prospect of localized equipment manufacturing, warned RREDA.
Several international companies have suspended new investments in the Russian renewable energy market, but no projects have been canceled yet. RREDA noted that the largest Western businesses with localized capacities in Russia – Fortum, Enel and Vestas – have opted to pull out of the country. But it said they are doing this in “a responsible manner” by respecting previously signed agreements.
Russian renewables companies now face a long list of challenges. Due to a lack of Western software, clean energy developers experience difficulties in building IT infrastructure. In addition, investors have been warning about the risk of defaults with some projects, due to higher interest rates on bank loans, according to RREDA.
Against this backdrop, the Russian government has delayed the competitive selection of new projects for construction under so-called “electricity provision agreements” from the second half of 2022 to the first half of 2023. However, RREDA expressed confidence that the construction of new renewable energy projects under the next stage of the electricity provision agreement program would continue as scheduled in the years ahead.
Russia currently has 2 GW installed solar capacity, including 1,650 MW that was built under electricity provision agreements. If all approved projects eventually see the light, the nation's installed solar capacity will grow to 4 GW by 2025, according to RREDA.

Following a net loss of $5.5 million in April-June 2021, shareholders in New Mexico-based Array Technologies had to shoulder a $15 million hit in the second quarter of this year. In its April-June figures, released this week, Array Technologies said business from STI contributed $72.7 million to a quarterly revenue figure that more than doubled year on year to $425 million.
The Albuquerque-based manufacturer highlighted the importance of the passage of Biden‘s Inflation Reduction Act, which concerns clean energy and health care subsidies and measures to pay down the national deficit. The blocking of the original, more ambitious Build Back Better Act by Democrat Senator Joe Manchin (West Virginia) had prompted Array Technologies to predict that $240 million worth of its US solar-project related business would be threatened.
The expected passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – which would spend $369 billion combating climate change and incentivizing clean energy, and would extend the investment tax credit for solar by another 10 years – prompted Array Technologies to state that $240 million will now be safe, even if the projects concerned will not take shape this year.
“The Inflation Reduction Act, when passed, provides meaningful clarity on the long-term incentive structure for the solar industry including investments that aim to tackle climate change,” said Array Technologies CEO Kevin Hostetler. “This clarity allows participants to confidently make decisions on future investments, therein accelerating the adoption of solar energy.”
The company balance sheet published this week showed that its cash pile fell from $368 million at the end of last year to $51 million on June 30. But total assets rose over that period, from $1.14 billion to $1.78 billion, in part thanks to leaps in goodwill and other intangible assets. Liabilities rose from $975 million to $1.5 billion over the same period.
In November, pv magazine reported the STI Norland acquisition would cost Array Technologies €351 million ($360 million) in cash plus €13.9 million in company stock, with STI shareholders entitled to up to €55 million extra this year, based on the Spanish company's gross earnings in 2021.

The UFLPA bans imports of solar panels that feature polysilicon produced by forced labor.
In a second-quarter update published this week, the US photovoltaics tracker maker said that its April-June revenue fell from $50.1 million in 2021 to $30.7 million. Hunkler said ongoing solar panel supply shortages are causing a “solar-module constrained US market.”
He warned that the current quarter which will represent “the low-water mark in terms of revenue” for FTC Solar. It expects a big rebound expected in the final three months of the year, but Hunkler acknowledged that the business is “still looking for incremental clarity on how much module supply will be available.”
FTC Solar said it expects revenue of $16.5 million to $19 million in the current quarter. It said new project wins will lift that figure to $75 million to $90 million in the October-December period. Despite the year-on-year decline in second-quarter revenue, it reduced its three-month losses from $52.4 million in the second quarter of last year to $30.7 million in the April-June 2022 period.
“We believe that successfully navigating UFLPA import restrictions on solar modules remains the last hurdle for the industry to overcome to ensure a very strong recovery in 2023,” said Hunkler.

Australian renewable hydrogen company Infinite Green Energy (IGE), formerly Infinite Blue Energy, is pushing ahead with what it says will be Western Australia’s first commercial-scale renewable hydrogen project.
The MEG HP1 project in Northam, which is now set to include a hydrogen refueling station, builds on the existing 11 MW Northam Solar Farm. Once fully operational, the facility is expected to produce up to 4 tons of renewable hydrogen per day for transport use by early 2024.
Infinite Green Energy has now secured enough land to potentially double the site’s production to eight tons a day, and now has room enough for a hydrogen refueling station and storage for eight hydrogen-powered trucks.
“IGE has the land, renewable electricity, project expertise, initial customer base and financing options to produce WA’s first commercial-scale renewable hydrogen in Northam,” said IGE CEO Stephen Gauld.
The hydrogen refueling station will be the result of a partnership between Infinite Green Energy and Western Australian fuel distributor Refuel Australia. Refuel Australia Managing Director Ian Burrows said the company is “thrilled to be working with Infinite Green Energy to bring renewable hydrogen into our product offering, starting with the planned Northam fueling station.”
“Renewable hydrogen will likely form a significant part of the fuel mix as the world moves towards net-zero carbon emissions,” said Burrows. “Hydrogen is particularly suited to the medium and heavy transport operators that form the core of our customer base. We are excited to be an early mover in the supply of green hydrogen.”
MEG HP1 appears to be a warm-up of sorts, with IGE more prominently showcasing its Arrowsmith Hydrogen Plant north of Perth. It said the facility will produce up to 25 tons of green hydrogen per day. Infinite Green Energy said the project will incorporate 65 MW of solar and 90 MW of wind in stage one, but it has not provided specific time frames.

Generac Power Systems, known as a specialist in backup generators, has announced that its PWRcell products enable AC-coupled battery storage, as well as AC generator integration. This means that with a new firmware update, Generac PWRcell battery storage products can accept up to 7.6 kW of AC power generated by third-party PV inverters.
The Generac PWRcell battery backup solution features a modular design that can scale from a three-module, 9 kWh capacity, 4.5 kW output, to a six-module, 18 kWh, 9 kW output. If more storage is needed, Generac reports that multiple PWRcell battery cabinets can be integrated to a single Generac PWRcell inverter for up to 36 kWh capacity and 11 kW continuous backup power. The PWRcell string inverters feature 7.6 kW and 11.4 kW models, with peak efficiencies of 97.3% and 97.7%, respectively.
By enabling AC coupling, solar homeowners now have a choice of adding a DC-powered PWRcell solar-plus-battery storage system to their existing array, or they can connect a new or existing Generac Guardian home standby generator PWRcell solar-plus-battery storage system.
“Generac is proud to lead the way in envisioning the future of energy through a robust offering of market-leading power solutions that enhance energy resilience and independence,” said Aaron Jagdfeld, Generac president and chief executive officer. “We continue to grow our portfolio of clean energy products, expanding the capabilities of solar-plus-battery storage solutions and giving our dealers and installers a wide array of options for their customers.”

The persistent supply difficulties with electronic components have affected the development of the company’s sales and earnings, as seen in its latest figures released on Thursday.
In the first half of the year, SMA sold PV inverters with a total power of around 5.8 GW – about one gigawatt less than in the first half of 2021. Sales fell from €488.3 million to €471.9 million year-on-year.
In particular, sales in the Home Solutions segment were lower because the high demand could not be met due to the shortage of materials. In the Commercial & Industrial Solutions and Large Scale Project Solutions segments, the higher prices ensured that sales remained at the previous year's level despite lower sales.
SMA's consolidated earnings were negative in the first half of the year. After a profit of €13.3 million in the same period last year, this time there was a loss of €10.6 million.
Despite the losses, the SMA Managing Board confirmed the March forecast for the 2022 fiscal year. The company expects sales of between €900 million and €1 billion and before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of between €10 million and €60 million. In the first half of 2022, EBITDA was €16 million.
In the meantime, SMA is issuing “a series of measures to improve its long-term ability to deliver,” said SMA Chief Executive Officer Jürgen Reinert. This includes the construction of a new gigawatt factory at the Kassel site, which is intended to double the company’s production capacity by 2024 in response to the growing demand for PV inverters and storage solutions.
“Our order intake is developing positively. But the continued tight delivery situation is having a significant toll on the development of sales and earnings,” said Reinert, adding, “As in numerous other industries, the difficulties relating to the supply of electronic components are also affecting European inverter manufacturers, illustrating once again the dependency of global supply chains on the Asian markets. We are expecting a significant improvement of the overall situation and profitable sales growth from 2023 onwards.”

However, a growing body of literature has been published that outlines the clear possibility of such a system and the technologies and investments it would require. A group of energy researchers, led by Christian Breyer of Finland’s Lappeenranta University, has conducted an extensive review of this literature, going back to Bent Sorenson’s 1975 paper “Energy and Resources,” published in Science. The group notes that since 2010, the number of published studies showing that 100% renewable energy can be achieved by 2050 has grown by 27% each year.
“A quickly increasing number of researchers conclude that the entire energy system demand can be met based on renewables,” said Breyer. “Doing so will actually be cheaper in the long term, while fulfilling sustainability requirements.”
The review paper, “On the History and Future of 100% Renewable Energy Systems Research,” was recently published in IEEE Access. It charts the historic milestones in the research up to its present- day status, and additionally seeks to address the major criticisms that continue to be leveled at it, including the cost, intermittent generation, materials, and current requirement for fossil-fuel energy to power manufacturing of renewable energy, among others.
The paper also addresses the “institutional inertia” of large agencies. It singles out the International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for particular criticism, on claims that they are slow to adopt the latest research demonstrating the possibilities of renewable energy technology.
“According to the United Nations, over 160 firms with $70 trillion in assets are committed to decarbonize the global economy, which means phasing out fossil fuels by 2050. Our research has shown that we have the technologies to implement a global energy supply based entirely on renewable energy,” said Dr. Sven Teske, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney. “The science clearly shows that a global 100% renewable energy supply is technically and economically possible. The next step is for our research to be included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s assessment reports, which are currently based on outdated energy scenario research.”
The paper shows that most of the literature on 100% renewables favors solar and wind as the primary generation sources, but there is less consensus on the optimal split between the two.
“In most transition pathways, solar energy and wind power increasingly emerge as the central pillars of a sustainable energy system combined with energy efficiency measures,” the paper said. “Cost-optimization modeling and greater resource availability tend to lead to higher solar photovoltaic shares, while emphasis on energy supply diversification tends to point to higher wind power contributions.”
And with both wind and solar well established and available, more recent research has moved focus to the less-known areas, and particularly the more difficult sectors to electrify.
“Recent research has focused on the challenges and opportunities regarding grid congestion, energy storage, sector coupling, electrification of transport and industry implying power-to-X and hydrogen-to-X, and the inclusion of natural and technical carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches,” Breyer said. “The result is a holistic vision of the transition towards a net-negative greenhouse gas emissions economy that can limit global warming to 1.5 C with a clearly defined carbon budget in a sustainable and cost-effective manner based on 100% renewable energy-industry-CDR systems.”
While congratulatory about the achievements this field has made since its beginnings almost 50 years ago, the group notes that there is still work to be done, reminding readers that no major 100% renewables study has yet included carbon dioxide removal technology, and potential issues of social justice, community disagreement and environmental degradation are not often taken into account by the models.
“The technologies are already there. The substantial evidence presented is already also empirical evidence in several regions and countries. The ability to exploit synergies across energy efficiency, electrification, district heating and electrofuels is certainly proven,” added Brian V. Mathiesen of Denmark’s Aalborg University. “Now decision makers have to stop all new investments in fossil fuels and focus on creating renewable energy based smart energy systems.”

Quanex has released a new product, the SolarGain Edge Sealant, which is a rubberized sealant for PV modules to protect against degradation due to moisture. The Edge Sealant is a polyisobutylene butyl rubber adhesive with integrated desiccant that has been designed to improve longevity, durability, and power retention over time.
Quanex said the sealant can prevent moisture ingress in modules, while also protecting cells, connections, and conductive coatings. The company said it can delay loss of power over a module’s lifetime by significantly delaying any degradation mechanisms activated by moisture, and that it can extend the useful life of a module by 10 to 15 years.
Quanex said emerging trends in the PV module market are driving the importance of moisture sealing. New technologies like perovskite solar cells and heterojunction (HTJ) cells have shown higher module efficiency, but they have also shown greater moisture sensitivity.
While it is commonly assumed that crystalline silicon panels are not sensitive to moisture ingress over the long term, recent testing by the company has shown SolarGain Edge Sealant’s ability to provide high levels of moisture protection in c-Si panels, extending lifetime power output.
Traditional ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulants have the potential to generate acid that can sap a panel of its power, due to the corrosiveness of the acid when exposed to moisture over time. Alternative encapsulants like thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) and polyvinyl butyral (PVB) have demonstrated higher potential to resist moisture ingress versus EVA, but are considerably more expensive and difficult to handle during the assembly process.
The sealant product is backed by Quanex’s 50 years of experience. Its various solutions demonstrate many of the same attributes required in solar module sealants, including UV resistance, flexibility through a wide range of temperatures, and the ability to delay the migration of moisture.

And with growing demand for energy storage coming from various industries and regions, it’s likely that we’ll see a few new battery concepts make their way into commercial production over the coming years.
Aqueous zinc batteries that couple a zinc anode with a manganese dioxide cathode have shown strong technical potential, and could be made from materials that are cheap, abundant and non-toxic. This type of battery, however, is still at an early stage in development and scientists have not fully understood the mechanism by which it recharges.
A group of scientists led by the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) have set out to clarify this by using the latest microscopic imaging techniques. They ended up making an unexpected discovery.
“Zinc and manganese separately have very favorable properties for high-quality sustainable batteries; however, when paired in a full system their intercalation – their rechargeability – has been debatable, with some recent studies suggesting zinc insertion and deinsertion in manganese dioxide is responsible for the rechargeability of the cells,” said Reza Shahbazian-Yassar, professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at UIC. “With this study, we showed there is actually no microscopic evidence of zinc reinsertion into manganese dioxide, and what was previously thought to be indicators of recharging was from positively charged hydrogen ions being inserted in the manganese, not zinc.”
The group observed that the structure of the manganese dioxide cathode is distorted and damaged by the uptake of hydrogen, further reducing its potential as a useful rechargeable battery. They described their findings in “Understanding intercalation chemistry for sustainable aqueous zinc–manganese dioxide batteries,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability. The group fabricated zinc-manganese dioxide and tested them over 100 cycles, recharging the batteries while using electron microscopy to see what was going on at the atomic level.
This improved knowledge of the battery’s mechanisms will open new doors in the future.
“The information we’ve obtained with these experiments reveals important atomic insights into the mechanisms of the zinc-manganese battery,” Shahbazian-Yassar explained. “Now that we know what is happening at the cell level, we have a compass for finding better strategies.”
