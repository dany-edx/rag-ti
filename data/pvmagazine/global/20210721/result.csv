Of last year's new additions, around 813 MW came from utility scale solar plants, and 500 MW from distributed generation arrays. The country's cumulative capacity reached 4,172 MW at the end of December and of this capacity, 2,372 MW is represented by large scale PV.
Referring to the distributed generation, SAPVIA said that around 20% of this capacity consists of residential systems, with the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment contributing the remaining share.
“The policy landscape continues to change as government and industry work to meet the increasing energy needs of the country while also striving to drive a post-Covid economic recovery,” SAPVIA spokesperson, Maloba Tshehla, told pv magazine. “The commitment of President Cyril Ramaphosa to amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA) and to raise the licensing exemption threshold for distributed generation facilities from 1 MW to 100 MW, should cause a rapid increase in the development of larger scale distributed generation projects.”
The SAPVIA figures were released on the day trade body SolarPower Europe announced, in its 2020 global outlook report: “South Africa has seen the start of a solar renaissance under its current president.”
According to the South African solar association, the Integrated Resource Plan, which aims to deploy another 6 GW of PV by 2030, will increase the PV installed capacity from 3% of the current total electricity supply to 11% by 2030. “The IRP electricity infrastructure development plan is based on least-cost electricity supply and demand balance, considering security of supply and the environment, and will result in a 400%-plus increase of solar PV by 2030,” Tshehla stated.
South Africa's Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy launched, in March, the long-expected fifth round of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP). The fifth round of the program was originally planned for 2018 and was then delayed several times due to the difficult financial situation of the country's state-owned utility Eskom, and a renegotiation of the PPA contracts initially awarded in the fourth round.
South Africa is seeking to reduce dependence on its state-owned utility for power supply. The troubled utility, which is currently unable to meet the country's power demand due to financial and operational issues, recently began considering renewables for its plant portfolio. Meanwhile, South African businesses are resorting to solar and renewables to improve their power supply. These include ArcelorMittal, South Africa-based chemicals producer Sasol, and several mining companies.

Canada-based vanadium mining company Largo Resources has announced that its U.S.-based unit Largo Clean Energy has signed its first supply agreement for its VCHARGE ± vanadium redox flow battery system, with Enel Green Power Spain, a unit of Italian renewable energy company Enel Green Power, which is itself part of the Enel group. Under the terms of the deal, Largo Clean Energy will provide a five-hour, 6.1 MWh system for a project in Spain whose start-up is scheduled for the third quarter of 2022.
The company's VPURE and VPURE + vanadium products come from one of the three largest vanadium mines in the world, the company's Maracás Menchen mine, located in Brazil. These compounds are used to develop's Largo's  VCHARGE ± vanadium redox flow battery technology.
Largo Clean Energy began, last year, the development of its vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) technology based on 12 patent families previously owned by U.S. storage specialist VionX Energy, whose assets it acquired for $3.8 million.
The battery employs a modular architecture based on 1 MW power and 2 MWh energy building blocks. A 1 MW system can be configured from 4.3 hours to 15 hours, while the 1.2 MW system can be configured from 3.6 to 12.6 hours. The 1.5 MW system will be configured from 2.9 to 10.1 hours, once it becomes available. The operating voltage range is 500 V to 800 V and the operating ambient temperature is -40 degrees Celsius to 45 degrees Celsius.
The reported DC efficiency is 78% and the AC efficiency is 68%. The battery lifetime is claimed to be of 20-plus years, with unlimited cycles. The company said the storage systems show degradation after 10,000 cycles, which is the equivalent of over 26 years, if cycled daily.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/21/maoneng-reveals-plans-for-240-mwp-480-mwh-big-battery-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 21, 2021",Maoneng reveals plans for 240 MWp/480 MWh big battery in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Maoneng is proposing to build a 240 MWp/480 MWh battery storage system (BESS) on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, Australia. It has already filed a planning permit application with the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. 
The company is going through a competitive tender process to select a contractor for the project. It said it aims to have the big battery completed by late 2022. Its proposed site is 6.7 hectares, flat, and largely cleared of vegetation, which makes it ideal for such a project, the company said. 
The Mornington Peninsula traditionally experiences fluctuations in its demand for electricity, primarily because of seasonal tourism. Maoneng’s co-founder and CEO, Morris Zhou, said the Mornington BESS represents an important piece of the puzzle here.
“A vital part of the Victorian government’s Renewable Energy Action Plan is the integration of energy storage. Our facility directly supports this strategy and will play a key role in local grid stability,” Zhou said in a statement.
Earlier this month, Maoneng submitted plans to construct a 225 MW/450 MWh BESS on a 30-hectare site at Gould Creek, about 20 kilometers north of Adelaide. The AUD 112.5 million ($82.3 million) Gould Creek battery storage project builds on the company’s Australian portfolio, which includes a deal to develop four large-scale batteries, each 50 MW/100 MWh in capacity, for energy giant AGL in New South Wales. The deal includes a 15-year contract that will allow AGL to call on capacity from the batteries at a fixed price. The batteries are expected to be installed by 2023.
Data supplied by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows that financial commitments for new utility-scale battery projects in Australia increased fourfold between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of this year, from 150 MW to 600 MW. The CEC said that at least 15 large-scale battery storage projects have been announced this year, representing more than 6.6 GW of capacity and AUD 4.3 billion in investment.
That number is likely to increase, as the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) proposed a new rule in April to bring new, ultra-fast frequency services into the National Electricity Market – services that will come largely from batteries.

The Commercial & Economic Feasibility Study for Enhancing Off-Grid Solar Inclusion in Sub Saharan Africa report commissioned by EU lender the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the India-based International Solar Alliance (ISA), divided the sub-Saharan nations with the biggest proportions of citizens without access to electricity into five categories.
Having removed 11 nations afflicted with armed conflict from consideration, the report, publicized by the EIB yesterday, mooted a solar home system aggregated buying program across the Sahel, given the nations its authors highlighted as fragile – including Zimbabwe alongside countries such as Mali and Niger – had either non-existent or very early stage off-grid solar markets.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
In common with three of the other national groupings described in the study – which was carried out by Swiss development advisory Dalberg – the researchers recommended an initial focus on customers in urban and nearby ‘peri-urban' areas. The two exceptions were a grouping of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania, where it was suggested well-established off-grid solar companies could be incentivized to serve more than a million refugees in UN camps; and nations with very early stage off-grid markets but not classed as fragile. In that latter grouping, which includes Madagascar, Malawi, and Sierra Leone, the report's authors highlighted the need to kick-start the off-grid solar market by reducing investment risks and driving demand by measures such as offering product guarantees.
The report also notably dismissed the role mini-grids can play in deploying off-grid solar on the continent, citing the lack of a persuasive business model for such community systems and the widespread roll-out of individual solar home systems which has already taken place.
Recommending more detailed deployment strategies for each of the five national groupings suggested by the report as a next step – as well as securing loans to help suppliers with working capital across the board – the study stressed the importance of some grant funding and concessional lending in a ‘blended finance' approach mixing public and private sources of investment. The need for public funds reflected the fact established off-grid solar suppliers have a tendency to want to market more products to customers with reliable payment records, leaving less affluent people continuing to live without electricity.
The 50-page report, dated June, draws upon in-depth interviews with ‘stakeholders' in Rwanda, Nigeria and Uganda including African government representatives, input from donor organizations and NGOs, and private-sector energy businesses.
With a glaring lack of input from any of those without access to electricity, or resident in refugee camps, the results of the interviews included a preference for results-based finance ahead of ‘pure' subsidy and a wariness of group-buying from off-grid solar suppliers, in both cases due to concern about possible distortions of the market. Donor entities stressed a preference for using the many existing funding streams set up to drive African off-grid solar, rather than setting up even more programs, and the report's researchers also noted representatives of the governments of Rwanda and Nigeria were more engaged in the EIB-ISA plans than those from Uganda.

Norwegian solar module manufacturer REC, a unit of Chinese chemical company Chemchina, has launched, on Monday, the second generation of its N-Peak solar modules.
The production of the solar modules, based on monocrystalline, half-cut, n-type PERT cells, is expected to start in August at the company's factory in Singapore. The first shipments to customers are planned for October.
The new product relies on 120 half-cells and has a power output ranging from 360 W to 375 W. The module efficiency is between 19.7 and 20.5%, depending on the output. The solar modules are also claimed to withstand loads of up to 7000 Pascal.
The company specified the module has a size of 1,755×1,044x30mm and a weight of 20kg. The maximum system voltage is indicated at 1000 V. The operating temperature for the solar modules is between -40 and 85 degrees Celsius.
With its twin design, the manufacturer also promises higher yields when the photovoltaic system is shaded. REC grants a 25-year product guarantee on the modules. The performance guarantee provides that the solar modules will still have 92% of their performance in the 25th year of operation.
REC originally launched the N-Peak module in June 2018. At the time, it was the first solar module in the world to combine n-type TOPCon cells with a twin design.

If built, the $2 billion project would be the world's largest floating PV power plant and would reach the same capacity as the largest ground-mounted facility currently in operation, which is a 2.2 GW plant located in China's Qinghai province.
The facility is planned to occupy a water surface of 1,600ha and to be coupled with a storage system with a capacity of 4,000 MWh.
Sunseap said the Duriangkang Reservoir provides more than 50% of the freshwater supply to Batam Island and that the floating solar panels will help to reduce evaporation, thereby retaining more water within the reservoir. “Simultaneously, the water will keep the solar panels cool, thereby generating more clean energy and creating a synergistic relationship,” it further explained. “Sunseap expects the solar farm to generate more than 2,600 GWh of electricity per annum, potentially offsetting over 1.8 million metric tons of carbon per year.”
“This hyper-scale project is a significant milestone for Sunseap, coming soon after we had completed Singapore’s first offshore floating solar farm along the Straits of Johor,” said Sunseap CEO Frank Phuan. “This investment by Sunseap will be a timely boost for Batam’s industries as they seek to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. At the same time, it will create jobs and transfer skills to Batam’s clean energy sector,” added BP Batam chairman, Muhammad Rudi.
The project will be financed with both bank borrowings and own funds. Its construction is scheduled to start next year and completion is planned for 2024.

SolarEdge has released a new series of inverters for commercial and industrial solar installers with modular designs in multiple variants.
The inverters offer what the company claims are improved uptimes through modularity and independently working units. Due to the modularity of the design, commercial and industrial installers will only need two-person crews to integrate the inverters into their solar arrays. 
A precommissioning feature for in-depth visibility allows installers to fully and automatically validate system components from smartphones before connecting to the grid. SolarEdge’s Synergy Manager enables service without the need to open inverter covers for reconfiguration or maintenance. 
DC oversizing of up to 150% is achievable with the new line of power converters, the company said. The devices also use built-in nighttime potential induced degradation (PID) rectifiers to reduce module performance degradation. Module-level monitoring is additionally integrated into the system. 
Thermal sensors are installed on terminal blocks for both AC and DC connections. The inverters can withstand surges with Type 2 AC and DC surge protection devices, and provide surge event alerts. Automatic NEC-complaint rapid shutdown has also been integrated into the new products.
