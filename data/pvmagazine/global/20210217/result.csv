With Bangladesh's Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) having determined the international standards which should be applied to such products in late 2019, an inter-ministerial meeting last week determined solar modules and inverters should join batteries and charge controllers on the list of restricted products attached to the Bangladesh import policy order. Such items are required to meet conditions set by the relevant authorities in order to be imported.
SREDA determined solar modules should meet International Electrotechnical Commission standards IEC 61215:2016, 60904-1:2013, 60904-2:2013 and 60904-9:2013. It was decided inverters should meet IEC 62109-1:2016 and 62109-2:2016, charge controllers IEC 62509:2016, and batteries IEC 61427-1:2016.
Solar manufacturers in Bangladesh have claimed sub-standard solar imports from China and India render them unable to compete on price and reduce public confidence in solar power when they fail to perform at the level expected.
A senior BSTI official has said SREDA has already approved the use of 17 Bangladesh Petroleum Corp laboratories for the testing and certification of solar products and said imports could also be tested by the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, and private-sector facilities.
Munawar Misbah Moin, president of the Solar Module Manufacturers Association of Bangladesh, said the move was long overdue. “We are producing … solar equipment in line with the standard set by SREDA,” he said, adding imports have not been saddled with the same obligation. “The government should take the matter seriously to stop [the] import of cheap solar equipment, for the sake of local industry,” Moin told pv magazine.
The nation's nine domestic solar manufacturers boast annual module production capacity of 100 MW, account for around 20% of the local market and can achieve power output ratings of up to 320 W at efficiencies of up to 19.5%, according to Moin.
Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, suggested compulsory membership of his organization by solar product importers would help deal with the quality fears connected with foreign devices. He welcomed the move to enforce standards but warned procedures should be put in place to prevent solar importers suffering financial losses because of any associated paperwork.

The company claims that the two products can be integrated with a clean, low-profile aesthetic through rapid installation which is claimed to take less than 45 minutes per kilowatt installed. “The two modules are designed and engineered at our headquarters in Cambridge, U.K. and manufactured by sub-contract partners in Asia,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, without disclosing details on current manufacturing capacity.
The smallest device, called the PV16-335, has a power conversion efficiency of 20.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 42 V and a short-circuit current of 10.3 A. The biggest panel, dubbed PV16-340, features an efficiency of 21%, open-circuit voltage of 42.4 V and a short-circuit current of 10.4 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.

Both products measure 1,686×1,000×69mm and weigh 21.7kg. “The new panels also mark a move away from a 156mm cell size for the company,” the manufacturer explained. “Cells of this size have been the industry standard for many years but many manufacturers are re-tooling factories to manufacture PV modules based on larger cell sizes and, for its new Clearline fusion panels, Viridian Solar has opted for monocrystalline PERC G1 cells at 158.75mm.”
The modules have an operating temperature coefficient of -0.38% per degree Celsius. They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 10-year product guarantee.
The panels are said to be compatible with a wide range of slates and tiles, include special fixings for different batten thicknesses and achieve the highest fire rating and wind resistance without modifications to the roof. “With a power output per square meter that ranks among the highest available, our new G1 panels will become the most cost-effective way to deliver many specifications,” Jamie Berryman, CSO at Viridian Solar said.

CEO and founder Abe Cambridge spoke to pv magazine about the company's investment model and project pipeline, and the solar financing outlook in African schools.
pv magazine: How does The Sun Exchange operate and what is its role and vision in meeting the demand for affordable clean power while cutting emissions in Africa?
Abe Cambridge: [The] Sun Exchange is the world's first peer-to-peer solar leasing marketplace. We leverage financial innovation and the power of the crowd to drive sustainable energy development and make the environmental, social, and economic benefits of solar accessible and affordable for all.
Through The Sun Exchange online platform anyone, anywhere in the world, can buy remotely-located solar cells and then lease them to power businesses and organizations in sunny emerging markets. Solar cell owners earn income from the generated electricity while schools, businesses, clinics, and other organizations gain access to affordable clean energy, reducing electricity costs and carbon emissions.
Our vision is to have all businesses and organizations in sunny emerging markets powered by clean, affordable, and decentralized solar energy–owned and financed by millions of people worldwide.
pv magazine: How do you run the ‘people-powered-solar' financing model at The Sun Exchange?
AC: First, [The] Sun Exchange identifies solar consumers such as businesses or organizations that want to ‘go solar'. Our engineers then work with local construction partners to determine the proposed solar projects' economic and technical feasibility, as well as environmental and social responsibility.
If the solar projects are accepted, [The] Sun Exchange then hosts online ‘crowdsales' of the solar cells tied to the project through our buy-to-lease solar marketplace. Individuals or organizations from anywhere across the world can sign up to be Sun Exchange members and purchase these solar cells for as little as $5 per cell. Once all cells needed for that particular project are purchased, the project then moves to the installation phase. Here, all the assets are fully insured for fire, theft, and damage for the 20-year lease term.
The business or organization where these solar cells are installed, also known as the offtaker, pays for the solar power at a pre-agreed price, billed per kilowatt-hour. Solar cell owners, or ‘asset owners,' receive a predictable and inflation-adjusted income for the 20-year lease period, paid in either local currency or Bitcoin. The payments are made through a convenient dashboard complete with digital wallets. This income stream is equivalent to a 10-12% internal rate of return (IRR).
Also, the consumer pays no upfront fee. [The] Sun Exchange covers installation, insurance, and operation costs. This results in an immediate cost reduction of at least 20%, with an average savings [figure] of over 40% for the 20 years.
pv magazine: What kind of solar projects, on-grid or off-grid, do you focus on at The Sun Exchange?
AC: [The] Sun Exchange focuses on commercial and industrial solar projects. To date, most projects have been grid connected. However, the Nhimbe Fresh project in Zimbabwe includes storage, to eliminate the farm's reliance on unreliable and expensive grid electricity.
pv magazine: What projects do you have ongoing and completed, and do you look forward to in the future?
AC: [The] Sun Exchange has facilitated solar financing for close to 40 projects to date. In addition to Zimbabwe, where the crowdsale for the Nhimbe Fresh solar project is under way, we have plans to expand into Botswana, Namibia, and several other countries.
pv magazine: Considering that most of the consumers you've connected with solar power in South Africa are schools, what impact do you feel your company has created?
AC: Schools that go solar through [The] Sun Exchange benefit extensively from solar power. In addition to cost savings, the schools reduce their carbon footprint and create valuable educational opportunities for learners to study renewable energy … blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and fintech [financial technology].
For instance, the solar project at Wynberg Junior School will offset 1,479.94 tons of CO2 emissions over its 20-year lifespan. The school can also use the monetary savings on [its] electricity bill to focus on [its] core mission: raising the future … leaders of South Africa.
pv magazine: From the solar projects you've completed in various schools across South Africa, how long does it take to implement solar energy usage in learning institutions?
AC: From the close of the crowdsale, it usually takes 6-12 weeks to bring the solar project online. The pandemic has caused delays in government departments, so projects currently take a little longer to roll out.
pv magazine: What are your thoughts on solar energy's potential on the African continent, especially for schools and small-to-medium-sized businesses?
AC: Africa has some of the highest solar irradiation globally but lacks traditional grid infrastructure and many countries are experiencing energy shortages that hamper economic growth. Solar can be quickly rolled out and it offers a clean and affordable way to power economies. Solar can reduce energy poverty and inequality and bring power to rural areas, farms, and schools that are not connected to the national grid.
The main challenge to date, for small-to-medium-sized solar projects, is a lack of financing. Most solar crowdfunding providers only offer debt financing solutions that are [neither] available nor viable for organizations such as schools, small-to-medium[-sized] businesses, and non-profits. High debt costs in emerging markets often increase running costs to businesses in the short term when borrowing money to go solar.
Through the Sun Exchange buy-to-lease approach, energy consumers access solar power at zero upfront cost and [secure] guaranteed energy cost savings, enabling NGOs, charities, and schools to go solar when, previously, finance was unavailable.
pv magazine: What is your take on combating climate change and how is The Sun Exchange actively involved in this effort?
AC: We can no longer delay action on climate change and it is up to every global citizen to take steps to mitigate climate change by reducing their carbon footprint.
Individuals worldwide who were previously unable to own solar–due to lack of funds or roofspace–can now own [and] earn income [from]–and offset carbon emissions [using]–solar cells located in emerging markets.
With the cost of solar falling exponentially over recent years, solar is now the cheapest form of energy available and this [is] the best way for businesses and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint while immediately saving on their electricity bill.
By connecting these organizations with people around the world who want to invest in solar, we provide a highly innovative and scalable solution that allows individuals and organizations to take proactive action on climate change.

Baywa re, the renewable energy unit of German conglomerate Baywa, has announced the creation of Novotegra GmbH, a new unit that will bundle all its business related to the production and sale of mounting systems for PV installations.
The company specified that its products will continue to be sold across Europe through Baywa re's wholesale companies and that the spin-off is intended to help expand the European business. The management of Novotegra will be taken over by Thomas Pfaff, who has been head of product management for Novotegra at Baywa re for many years. The new company will be based in Tübingen, in southwest Germany.
“We are very pleased that our system, the efficiency of which we have been able to continuously increase in recent years, has established itself so well in the market,” explained Pfaff. “Now we want to continue the Novotegra success story and further expand our activities.”
With the establishment of the new unit, Baywa re wants to expand services for customers and make them more efficient. “With this in mind, we expect shorter development times for new products as well as increased, and even better customer service,” said Frank Jessel, global director of solar trade at Baywa re.
The beginnings of the mounting system business go back to 1999, when the first solutions, made of galvanized steel, were sold under the name “tegra.” It was later renamed “alutegra” and, from 2007, it was called “novotegra.”
Baywa re claims to have increased the sales of its mounting structures fivefold over the past five years.

However, the figures paint a picture of a tough fourth quarter, year-on-year, compared to the final three months of the Covid-free days of yore in 2019. What is beyond argument is that the inverter maker–which describes itself as a “smart energy” business after venturing into storage tech–achieved an impressive year of revenue progress on the 2019 results despite the global travails caused by Covid-19, and despite that tough end to the year.
Solaredge, which published its fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results yesterday, shipped 1.36 GWac of inverters from October to December but nevertheless saw revenues fall to $358 million from the $418 million registered in the same period of 2019, just as the pandemic was stirring in China.
That meant gross profits in the last three months of last year came in at $110 million, from $143 million 12 months earlier just as R&D, sales and marketing and administrative expenses rose. Pre-tax profits in Q4 slumped to $24.8 million from the $61.6 million posted in October-to-December 2019, for a year-on-year fall in net income from $52.3 million to $17.7 million.
Far from capping a year of retreat, however, the close of 2020 failed to mask 12 months of revenue progress after Solaredge shipped 6.1 GWac of inverters in the period. That volume drove record annual revenues of $1.46 billion, mostly on the back of a record $1.36 billion raised from the sale of solar products, for a $300 million upside from the figure posted for 2019.
The revenue uplift was not sufficient to stave off an $18 million fall in gross profit, to $461 million, and rising R&D, sales and marketing and general administrative spending prompted a fall in pre-tax income, year on year, from $179 million to $164 million in 2020. That added up to a marginal fall in net income for last year, from $145 million in 2019 to $140 million. Not bad during a global health pandemic.
With Solaredge having freed up around $25 million in restricted bank deposits since the end of 2019, the company's cash balance has risen from $224 million, at that point, to an $827 million warchest on December 31. The inverter maker secured more payments owed from its customers and piled up more inventory, year on year–further prudent actions during exceptional market conditions.
And the company was optimistic enough to predict a rebound in revenues from the fourth-quarter figures, with expectations of $385-405 million during the current three-month window, on the back of predicted solar income of $360-375 million.

According to him, the Russian authorities are now considering solar power generation coupled with storage to replace diesel generation as a cheap and easy-to-implement power supply solution for remote areas, due to its perfect combination of economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and affordable logistics. “The size of the off-grid solar-diesel market in Russia’s Far East regions only, can reach 800 MW,” he further explained. “Several regions, such as Krasnoyarsk, Altay, and Tyva in Siberia, Chukotka, Magadan, Zabaikalskiy, and Yakutia in the Far East, are already on the way of building up PV power generation in a bid to replace diesel-fueled generation.”
According to Usachev, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of recently commissioned off-grid solar-plus-storage projects ranges from RUB14-22/kWh ($0.19-0.29), which makes it much more economically viable, compared to net diesel generation.

The development of similar projects is made possible by a specific regulatory framework which enables project developers to conclude an energy service agreement of up to seven years with municipalities that have an obligation to reduce diesel consumption. “Funds are remunerated according to the diesel volumes saved on a quarterly basis,” Usachev stated, adding that diesel can still be used as back-up power in case of shortage.
“Projects that have been in operation for a year show the diesel consumption dropped up to 30% and that electricity is being provided with no interruption during 24 hours per day and seven days per week,” he affirmed. With conventional diesel power generation, fuel supply constraints mean power is currently limited to between four and seven hours per day.
The Far East federal district is the largest and the least populated in Russia. The region has the poorest energy and transport infrastructure in the nation. Russian module manufacturer Hevel Solar and other companies have already built, there, several off-grid solar projects.

The technology could be used to wirelessly transmit power to Earth-based receivers, or to communication satellites.
The so-called “Photovoltaic Sheets for High-Specific-Power Space-Based Energy Harvesting” (PVS-EH) consist of modular, interconnectable, high-efficiency PV power sources fabricated on low-weight flexible substrates using scalable processing.
“The terrestrial PV industry pursues highly efficient but also increasingly large and heavy module sizes to reduce the balance of systems and installation costs at around 20 W/kg,” research coordinator Randy J. Ellingson told pv magazine. “However, PV modules for space-based solar power (SBSP) must enable very low launch weights in order to accommodate the goal of kilometer-squared array areas necessary for the generation of power at the scale of hundreds of megawatts.”
The scientists said that one space-based solar array build with the technology could include tens of millions of sheets. Its power capacity could reach up to 800 MW, they claimed. But moving forward, the US research group will apply its thin-film PV expertise to create lightweight solar sheet technologies that enable specific powers to exceed 1,000 W/kg.
“Technology will evolve from transitioning the current high-efficiency thin-film PV device architectures onto low-weight flexible substrates at laboratory scales, on the order of 1 cm to 10 cm in dimension, to the construction of deposition tools and process development for uniform, high-throughput of larger PV sheets demonstrating 20% conversion efficiencies under AM0 illumination,” Ellingson explained.
The researchers aim to develop and demonstrate tandem technologies such as perovskite on crystalline silicon, perovskite on copper, indium, gallium, and (di)selenide CIGS, as well as II-VI based tandems. The research does not include engineering interconnected arrays.
“As part of the effort to use c-Si as the narrow gap cell in perovskite tandems, UT will develop basic c-Si cell handling/finishing capabilities, including surface cleaning,” Ellingson said. “Aspects of the work include space-radiation induced degradation studies, to identify and ameliorate specific pathways associated with strong UV as well as cosmic particle irradiation.”

The Sarroch site covers a surface area of 734.56 hectares, 90% of which is occupied by the Saras oil refinery and its associated petrochemical plants and service operations. “Our Sarroch site is particularly suited–due to its size, location and structural characteristics–to develop and host a green hydrogen production project with clear potential for development and growth,” said Saras CEO Dario Scaffardi.
Green energy production should be ensured by a 20 MW electrolyzer powered by renewable energy produced on-site and the produced fuel is expected to be used as a raw material in the Saras refinery. The Italian energy company did not specify what kind of renewable energy technology will be used to power the electrolyzer.
“We are constantly seeking partnerships to identify the best applications for this technology, particularly in industrial sectors that cannot be electrified and with emissions that are harder to reduce, including the chemical industry sector,” Enel Green Power CEO Salvatore Bernabei stated.
Enel is also partnering with Italian energy provider Eni to deploy 20 MW of hydrogen generation capacity in Italy between 2022 and 2023. The two companies want to build two 10 MW electrolyzers at unspecified Eni refineries in Italy, “where green hydrogen appears to be the best decarbonization option.” Eni has recently completed a 31 MW solar plant at one of its chemical industry sites in Sardinia.
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Bernabei said he does not believe in CO2 capture technologies and that the production of ‘blue' hydrogen–with gas and CO2 capture–as well as that of ‘grey' hydrogen, produced with gas alone, are not being contemplated in the company's future strategy. Referring to electrolyzers, he said that Enel will test different types of electrolyzer and different business models around the world. “For example, electrolyzers can play a role in the ancillary market,” he stated.

LF Energy and Sony Computer Science Laboratories have developed a novel approach to automating the peer-to-peer distribution of renewable energy through microgrids.
Their Hyphae initiative aims to make microgrids more resilient. It envisions doing that by adapting the Sony business unit’s Autonomous Power Interchange System software to work with AC grids.
The partners said that enabling resilient, peer-to-peer microgrid energy trading will allow even the most remote communities to store and distribute energy without connecting to large-scale power stations or distribution networks.
As envisioned, Hyphae will enable the connection of buildings, homes, and energy-consuming devices to energy-producing devices like storage, EV batteries, and PV. At the core is physical peer-to-peer (P2P) trading.
The energy sector is a “complicated beast” that is shifting from centralized fossil-fired generation to distributed resources, said Dr. Shuli Goodman, executive director of LF Energy, in a recent interview with pv magazine USA. She said that the grid of the future likely will not be a grid at all, but something closer to the mass of branching, threadlike organisms known as hyphae that underlie forest structures. That means the future grid would be made up of cloud, data, artificial intelligence, 5-G communications, and edge computing, which brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed.
LF Energy is a Linux Foundation nonprofit seeking to accelerate the energy transition of the world’s grids and transportation systems through open source. The organization was recently invited to take part as the government of U.S. President Joe Biden worked to develop its climate plan. Goodman gave the incoming administration a number of recommendations, including the following:
Open source gained an advocate in the new administration when Biden named David Recordon – who has a background in open source, open standards, and security – to serve as the new White House director of technology.
The partnership with Sony that was announced on Feb. 16 is expected to bring LF Energy closer to its goal of building an interoperable AC- and DC-ready microgrid that is self-contained, operational off-grid, and able to connect to an electrical distribution network with utility oversight.
“I think we are at the very beginning of being able to harness, control, and optimize both supply and demand,” Goodman said.

SolarEdge e-Mobility has been selected by Fiat to supply full electrical powertrain units and batteries for the Italian automaker’s new E-Ducato light commercial vehicle.
SolarEdge’s e-Mobility division is new for the company, having arrived with its 2019 acquisition of  S.M.R.E Spa. Prior to the acquisition, S.M.R.E Spa had more than 15 years of experience developing end-to-end e-mobility solutions for electric and hybrid vehicles. Its technology can be found in motorcycles, commercial vehicles, and trucks.
Fiat’s E-Ducato vehicle has been in development for more than four years, and will be configured around three chassis models and two battery module configurations. The configurations consist of three battery modules with 47 kWh for a range of roughly 143 miles, or five modules with 79 kWh and a range of roughly 224 miles.
The vehicle also offers four electric charging options: standard AC charging, AC quick charging, AC quick+ charging, and a DC fast charge. All models are equipped to continue to drive and operate normally in the event of a module failure.
Fiat has released a promotional video for the new E-Ducato on YouTube.

Distributed energy producer EDL will build, own and operate a hybrid microgrid in the remote mining town of Jabiru, in Australia's Northern Territory. Working with the Northern Territory government, EDL’s Jabiru Hybrid Renewable Project will help the community transition from its recent history as a uranium mining town to a new future as a tourist destination in the heart of the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park.
Jabiru is held in native title by the Mirarr people. The town, as it is recognized today, has only existed since 1982, when it was established as a living community for the nearby Ranger Uranium Mine.
The project, which integrates 3.9 MW of solar generation and a 3 MW/5 MWh battery with 4.5 MW of diesel generation, is in line with broader efforts to rejuvenate Kakadu. It will also be EDL’s 100th site since it began 30 years ago with the development of the Pine Creek Power Station on the other side of the national park.
“Once completed, our hybrid renewable power station will provide Jabiru with at least 50% renewable energy over the long term, without compromising power quality or reliability,” said EDL CEO James Harman. 
The Ranger Uranium Mine is owned by Energy Resources Australia, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto. It was once one of the most productive uranium mines in the world. However, the mine ceased production on Jan. 8, after years of losses primarily attributed to the market slump following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. 
According to the Katherine Times, Kakadu is set to undergo a $276 million upgrade as part of a plan to rejuvenate tourism to the home of the world’s oldest living culture. Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley told the newspaper that “the park’s traditional owners want to see culturally appropriate tourism grow and we will work with them to achieve that outcome.” 
EDL will begin construction on the project in the months ahead. It expects the hybrid system to be generating energy by early 2022.
