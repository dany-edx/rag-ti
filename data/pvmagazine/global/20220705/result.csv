The factory has a capacity of 20 GW and should reach full utilization rate by the end of the summer. Jinko is currently increasing the manufacturing capacity of n-type products to respond to the technical shift from p-type to n-type solar modules. With the recent commissioning of two n-type solar cell manufacturing bases in Anhui and Zhejiang, Jinko reached 16.9 GW if n-type TOPCon solar cell capacity at the end of June.
Panel manufacturer DAH Solar sealed a deal with the government of Chaohu City, Anhui Province, to set up a 5 GW factory to produce n-type TOPCon solar cells and modules.  The company wants to invest $307 million in the new facility. The beginning of manufacturing activities is scheduled for the beginning of 2023.
Polysilicon and solar cell manufacturer Tongwei raised the price of all of its solar cells this week. The company priced its PERC 182 mm cells at CNY 1.26 ($0.19) per watt, up 5%, and its PERC 210 mm cells at CNY 1.23 per watt, up 4.24%. It also increased the price of its M6 cells by 6% to CNY 1.24 per watt. Tongwei's cell prices have been trending upward since the beginning of 2021
Energy giant China Power International Development will assume ownership of a raft of clean energy companies including more than 350 MW of solar generation capacity. The state-owned utility this week announced it will issue the equivalent of 14.19% of its stock in a deal worth CNY 5.78 billion to acquire facilities, including 294 MW of solar. It will also pay CNY 1.67 billion cash in a separate arrangement to acquire projects that include 56 MW of solar. The selling companies are subsidiaries of the State Power Investment Corporation Ltd, which is also China Power’s controlling shareholder. As part of the purchases, China Power will also have the right of first refusal to acquire any future clean energy projects the business units may wish to sell.
State-owned developer Beijing Energy International last week announced it had awarded a CNY 317 million engineering, procurement, and construction contract for the 150 MW first phase of a planned 300 MW agrivoltaic plant in Baise City, in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The contract was awarded to state-owned China Jikan Research Institute of Engineering Investigation and Design Co Ltd and private company Xi’an Boao Power Engineering Co Ltd.
Comtec Solar last week announced its auditors had calculated expected credit losses for 2021 would mean an annual loss of CNY 61.3 million ($9.13 million). The unaudited figures published by Comtec at the end of March had estimated an annual loss of CNY 44.9 million.
Solar developer Shunfeng International has negotiated a deal for state-owned investor Sino Alliance Capital to take receipt of a 70 MW solar plant in Xinjiang in return for writing off a CNY 664 million ($99.1 million) debt. Sino Alliance, which is indirectly owned by China’s Ministry of Finance, has been owed HKD 661 million ($84.2 million) since the end of 2020. The Shunfeng investor has agreed to take ownership of Shunfeng solar project company Xinjiang Pu Xin Cheng Da Energy Technology Ltd with the asset worth a nominal CNY 528 million. Sino Alliance will also agree to write off the other HKD 155 million it is owed by Shunfeng. The proposed project transfer, which would leave Shunfeng with 176 MW of solar generation capacity, will be subject to a vote by independent shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting. Shunfeng, which this week said it is owed CNY 601 million in three years’ worth of unpaid state solar subsidies, saw a proposed CNY 890 million sale of 132 MW of solar capacity to a state-owned buyer fall through in June, with the deal complicated by a court freeze on the developer’s assets. An updated list of overdue creditors published by Shunfeng indicated True Bold Global Ltd has been owed HKD 162 million since November 2019; the investors in a 2015 convertible bond (CB) have been claiming CNY 330 million since March 2020; backers of a 2016 CB have been owed CNY 255 million since October 2021; Rainbow Fort Investments has been due HKD 263 million since May 31; and the Hong Kong branch of China Minsheng Banking Corp has been owed HKD 141 million since June 30.

The platform can adapt to fuel purity, switching between different fuels. The natural gas engine YCK15N, which is based on this platform, has reportedly completed bench tests and vehicle road tests. Mass production is expected by the end of 2022. It can operate at -40 C. “The development of YCK16H provides a good technical platform for the application of single fuel of ammonia or methanol, ammonia-hydrogen blended fuel and diesel-methanol blended fuel, and lays a technical foundation for China to develop zero-carbon emission internal combustion engines.” The engine targets tractors and other heavy commercial vehicles in mountainous or plateau areas. 
Sunfire is installing a 2.6 MW high-temperature electrolyzer at Neste’s renewable products refinery in Rotterdam. The German company called it the world’s first multi-megawatt high-temperature electrolyzer to produce green hydrogen. Sunfire, which expects commissioning in early 2023, has delivered the first two electrolysis modules. “In total, the company will install 12 electrolysis modules on site, adding up to the world’s largest high-temperature electrolyzer installed in an industrial environment,” wrote the company. The electrolyzer is based on Sunfire’s SOEC (solid oxide electrolysis cell) technology. It operates at temperatures of 850 C, and produces more than 60 kg of green hydrogen per hour. “By using industrial off-heat, the electrolyzer processes water steam to hydrogen at highest conversion efficiencies. As the steam reduces electricity demand, Sunfire’s SOEC technology is the most efficient electrolysis solution on the market.” The Dresden-based company reportedly demonstrated an electrical efficiency of 84%.
Améthyste, ArianeGroup, Cetim, HDF Energy, Rubis Terminal, and Sofresid engineering have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop Elemanta H2, a multi-service power barge designed to supply green electricity and hydrogen to large ships at births. The French project aims to deploy mobile solutions providing shore-to-ship power services from green or low-carbon hydrogen, complementing the electrical grid, for container ships, cruise ships, and tankers. Elemanta H2, which will also enable hydrogen bunkering, will be commissioned in 2025. “The partners have identified the Port of Rouen and the Rubis Terminal location as a pioneer site because of its strategic position close to Paris,” wrote the companies. HDF Energy will manufacture the hydrogen fuel cell system to be embedded in the demonstration barge. “The objective is to standardize and replicate the solution, with higher power levels, in the main European ports, including future large hydrogen hub projects.”
A detailed joint feasibility study by bp and BOC, a unit of  Linde, has concluded that distribution of hydrogen as compressed gas via road trailer is the best option to stimulate the UK market for hydrogen fuel for heavy-duty transport in the near term. “Over the longer term, as the market expands into new geographies, both liquid and gaseous hydrogen have potential to play a role,” the companies wrote. bp and BOC are looking into collaboration opportunities to deploy an initial network for heavy-duty transport hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in the UK. They did not provide a timeline for the deployment.
Georgia Power, Mitsubishi Power, and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), validated fuel blending of hydrogen and natural gas at both partial and full load at Georgia Power’s Plant McDonough-Atkinson in Smyrna, Georgia. “The demonstration project was the first to validate 20% hydrogen fuel blending on an advanced class gas turbine in North America, and the largest test of this kind to date,” wrote the American company. 
Electric and hydrogen truck company Tevva launched the first hydrogen fuel cell-supported heavy goods vehicle (HGV) to be manufactured, designed and mass-produced in the UK. “Tevva’s 7.5-tonne hydrogen electric truck comfortably meets (and exceeds) demanding duty cycles for nearly all urban and extra-urban use cases,” wrote the company. The trucks, with a range of up to 310 miles (500 kilometers), are aimed for the European and, eventually, North American markets. 
Hyundai Motor has signed a multilateral MoU with public and private parties from South Korea and the Czech Republic to support establishing a hydrogen mobility ecosystem in the European country. The Czech Republic aims to introduce 50,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2030.
German development agency GIZ is partnering with the government of Tunisia on hydrogen production. As part of the initiative, Tunisia has launched H2vert.TUN, the country’s first green hydrogen project. “Over the next months, GIZ and the Tunisian Ministry of Energy will start by developing the national green hydrogen strategy — based on international best practice, multi-stakeholder consultations, and state-of-the-art technical studies,” wrote GIZ’s Sven Schuppener.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/05/heterojunction-solar-cells-with-lower-silver-consumption-via-rotary-screen-printing/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 5, 2022",Heterojunction solar cells with lower silver consumption via rotary screen printing,"A group of researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) in Germany has developed a new metallization technique for bifacial silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells that they claim may considerably help reduce the amount of silver needed for their production while maintaining high levels of power conversion efficiency.
The scientists utilized rotary screen printing (RSP) for the front- and rear-side metallization of the bifacial SHJ solar cells via the “Rock-Star” demonstrator machine developed by the Fraunhofer ISE itself in partnership with German automation company ASYS Automatisierungssysteme GmbH.
This machine is able to achieve a cycle time of just 0.6 seconds per solar cell, which means a throughput increase by a factor of 1.5. It can also achieve a throughput of up to 8,000 wafers an hour in an inline configuration. “However, certain technical challenges must be overcome until these technologies can seriously challenge the predominance of FSP [flatbed screen printing] in the field of solar cell metallization,” the scientists stated.

The RSP unit is based on a mesh-based cylinder screen with a partly opened emulsion layer that serves as a printing form. During the printing process, the cylinder rotates and the paste is printed through the open areas of the rotating screen by a polyurethane (PU) squeegee within the screen. The wafer is transported through the printing unit on a carrier with vacuum fixation.
“The printing form is based on a fine stainless steel mesh which is enhanced with a thin, electroplated nickel layer in order to increase the stability of the mesh,” the research team stated. “Compared to fine meshes used for FSP screens, rotary screens need a considerably thicker wire thickness to enable a sufficient stability during the printing process.”
According to the researchers, the RSP technique was successfully carried out on the demonstrator machine at 50% percent of the maximum machine speed (0.86 s per cell) and 70% percent machine speed (0.65 s per cell). “In a virtual production line, these cycle times would correspond to a gross throughput of approximately 4100 (50% speed) and 5500 (70% speed) cells h−1 on a single track,” they emphasized.

Through the proposed technique, the academics were able to produce a fully metallized bifacial silicon heterojunction solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 21.7%, which compares to an efficiency of 22.1% of a reference cell built with FSP — currently the dominating technology for industrial metallization of crystalline silicon solar cells with a market share of over 98%.
“Using RSP for the front- and/or rear-side metallization reveals an impressive reduction of the average wet silver paste laydown by 60–70% (fully RSP printed cells) and 49% (RSP rear side, FSP front side) compared to the FSP reference process,” they further explained. “This corresponds to a very low total silver consumption of 6-9 mg W for bifacial solar cells fully or partly metallized with RSP compared to 17 mg W.”
The group presented its findings in the study “Rotary Screen Printed Metallization of Heterojunction Solar Cells: Toward High-Throughput Production with Very Low Silver Laydown,” published in Energy Technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/05/france-simplifies-environmental-permitting-for-solar-up-to-1-mw/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,FRANCE",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"JULY 5, 2022",France simplifies environmental permitting for solar up to 1 MW,"From pv magazine France
The French government has published in its Official Journal new provisions to simplify the procedure for the environmental approval of PV projects with a capacity of up to 1 MW.
The new decree establishes that PV installations deployed on rooftops or parking areas will no longer be subject to environmental assessment. Furthermore, it states that all PV systems with a capacity of up to 300 kW will be exempted from requiring a preliminary environmental assessment and that installations ranging in size from 300 kW to 1 MW will be subject to environmental assessment on a case-by-case basis criterion.
Prior to these new rules, ground-mounted installations of 250 kW were subject to environmental assessments on a systematic basis, while installations on greenhouses and parking shades with a power equal to or greater than 250 kW were subject to these proceedings on a case-by-case basis.
According to French solar association Enerplan, these new measures will accelerate solar deployment across the country.
“We hope that these provisions will also help simplify the authorization processes for agrivoltaic projects,” Thomas Domblides, regional solar development manager at BayWa r.e., told pv magazine France. “For example, for an agrivoltaic project replacing agricultural tunnels or on an anthropized area, an environmental impact study had to be systematically carried out for any project of more than 250 kWp, even when there was no biodiversity.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/05/the-supply-chain-requirements-uk-solar-developers-will-have-to-grapple-with-under-cfd-scheme/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED KINGDOM",MAX HALL,"JULY 5, 2022",The supply chain requirements UK solar developers will have to grapple with under CfD scheme,"The UK government has published details of the supply chain development plans which must be drawn up by the developers of big clean energy plants who wish to be eligible to bid for contracts for difference (CfD) incentives.
A questionnaire published by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis) last week called for examples of three new technologies or innovative approaches used by developers as well as details on how projects would avoid modern slavery and labor exploitation throughout their “entire supply chain.”
Under the terms of the latest round of the government's clean energy auction scheme – which opened in December 2021 and had a project proposal deadline in January – developers planning sites with a generation capacity of more than 300 MW must provide a supply chain plan.
The content of those plans was put out for consultation last year and Beis has now published the questionnaire which the relevant developers must complete. Four sections, labelled green growth, infrastructure, innovation, and skills, will be scored and Beis noted: “Applicants that do not score at least 50% as a percentage of total marks in each section for their supply chain plan are unlikely to pass and to be issued with a statement by the secretary of state approving their supply chain plan.”
That instruction appears to indicate applicants can fail to score for individual questions which carry marks, ranging from the 25 points awarded for anti-slavery procedures, health and safety policy, and procurement strategy up to the 225 marks awarded for physical improvements to infrastructure.
Under “green growth,” applicants must indicate how much UK content their project will use, for components and spending; provide three examples of how they have encouraged suppliers to drive down their carbon footprint; and three ways they have tried to attract new suppliers, particularly small and medium-sized businesses.
The UK-content question carries 175 of the the 500 total marks allocated to each of the four sections, with the carbon footprint measures rating just 75 points.
The infrastructure section of the questionnaire requires developers to spell out five examples of infrastructure improvements; three cases of them mitigating project impact on communities and the environment; and to explain how their supply chain fits local strategies and what their community engagement approach is.
Under innovation, applicants have to present three examples of R&D investment they have made and the same number by their supply chain partners. The three innovative approaches or technological solutions required are eligible even if only used as demonstrators and the explanatory examples stated “activities may include sharing of data.”
In terms of skills, the requirements include five examples of how the developer and supply chain companies have identified and filled skills gaps plus an explanation of hiring strategy and the number of direct jobs and apprenticeships to be created by the project, per megawatt-hour of generation capacity.
Under the CfD incentive rules, contract applicants competitively bid to secure the lowest guaranteed strike price for the electricity they generate. Renewables plants receive the wholesale electricity price for the power they produce and when that figure is below the strike price agreed through the auction tender, the government will top up the difference. When the money received from the wholesale market for the clean electricity is higher than the strike price, the generator will hand the difference back to the government.
The current, fourth round of the UK's clean power auction program is the first to feature solar and onshore wind since 2015, with GBP10 million ($12.1 million) of the GBP285 million budget earmarked for those technologies. The government hopes the current auction will secure 5 GW of solar and onshore wind as part of a total 12 GW of new clean power capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/05/italy-publishes-new-national-guidelines-for-agrovoltaic-plants/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,ITALY",,"JULY 5, 2022",Italy publishes new national guidelines for agrovoltaic plants,"The purpose of the guidelines is to clarify the minimum characteristics and requirements a photovoltaic system must have to be considered “Agrovoltaic”. They distinguish two types of systems:
This is the height measured from the ground to the lower edge of the PV module. In the case of modules installed on tracking structures, the height is measured with the modules placed at the maximum technically achievable inclination.
The guidelines consider 5 types of requirements (A, B, C, D and E). First, it should be clarified that in order to be considered as a “basic” agrovoltaic system, the requirements of A, B and (possibly) D.2 below must be fulfilled.
The system has been designed and implemented to adopt a spatial configuration and appropriate technological options, which allow the integration of agricultural activity and electricity production, improving the production potential of both subsystems.
This condition is met when the intervention area is devoted, throughout the lifetime of the agrovoltaic plant, to agricultural cultivation, floriculture or livestock grazing, maintaining a significant percentage with respect to the ‘continuity' of the activity that was practised prior to the installation of the plant (also required by Decree-Law 77/2021). Therefore, it must be ensured that at least 70% of the surface area of the plots subject to the intervention (total surface area of the agrovoltaic system, Stot) is dedicated to agricultural activity, in compliance with Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).
Agricultural surface ≥ 0.7 ∙ 𝑆𝑡𝑜
The guidelines consider a percentage of the total area covered by the modules (LAOR), with a maximum LAOR limit of 40%.
The agrovoltaic system shall be operated, during its technical lifetime, in such a way as to ensure the synergistic production of electricity and agricultural products, without endangering the continuity of agricultural and pastoral activities.
The elements to be assessed during the operation of the system, aimed at demonstrating the continuity of the agricultural activity, are the following:
Based on the characteristics of the agrovoltaic systems analysed, it is considered that the specific electricity yield of a properly designed agrovoltaic system (PVagri in GWh/ha/year), compared to the reference specific electricity yield of a standard PV system (standard PV in GWh/ha/year), should not be less than 60 % of the latter:
𝐹𝑉𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑖 ≥ 0,6 ∙ 𝐹𝑉𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎r
The agrovoltaic system adopts innovative integrated solutions with modules elevated from the ground, aimed at optimising the performance of the agrovoltaic system in both energy and agricultural terms.
Considering the minimum height of photovoltaic modules on fixed structures and the average height of modules on mobile structures, limited to configurations where the agricultural activity also takes place below the modules themselves, the following reference values can be established to fall under types (1) and (3):
The agrovoltaic plant is equipped with a monitoring system to verify the impact on crops, water savings, agricultural productivity for the various types of crops, and the continuity of the activities of the farms involved.
The average values of the Agrovoltaic system must be guaranteed throughout the lifetime of the plant. Monitoring is not only useful for the verification of key parameters, but also for the continuity of agricultural activity in the area below the plants and for parameters to detect the effects on the benefits of competition.
Elements to be monitored during the life of the plant include:
This activity can be carried out by means of a periodic technical report, drawn up by an agronomist. The annual cultivation plans (indicating the species cultivated each year), the area under cultivation, the growing conditions of the plants and the cultivation techniques (planting layout, sowing density, use of fertilisers, phytosanitary treatments) can be attached to the report. Most importantly, the technical report must be issued by a third party other than the person responsible for the plant.
The agrovoltaic system must be equipped with a monitoring system that, in addition to fulfilling requirement D, allows verification of the recovery of soil fertility, microclimate and resilience to climate change.
So far, these are the conclusions of the guidelines on the requirements that agrovoltaic plants must have in order to be defined as such, both agrovoltaic and advanced plants (the latter, therefore, also for the purpose of access to incentives).
Finally, the guidelines define other reward elements for the purpose of access to NRRP contributions that are not analysed here for reasons of speed, as the guidelines refer to other conditions that will be established by a new decree of the Minister of Ecological Transition.

The new rules will apply to PV systems up to 1 MW in size. It will help the country to initially deploy around 100 MW of solar capacity, according to EPRA.
The owners of the solar arrays will need to pay grid-interconnection fees and cover the costs of either unidirectional or bidirectional meter installations. The approvals to operate under net metering will be granted within 60 days from the date of application, said EPRA.
According to the authorities, Kenya currently has around 100 MW of installed distributed generation PV capacity. Their owners are now resorting to storage or curtailment to manage excess power. Most of these installations were deployed between 2018 and 2019, when fiscal incentives were in place in the country and solar module prices were at their lowest levels, said EPRA.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Kenya had 147 MW of installed PV capacity by the end of 2021. New PV capacity additions reached 41 MW in 2021, while in the preceding three years, just 1 MW of solar power was deployed.

Australian direct air carbon capture technology has the attention of a conglomerate of technology giants, with the company deploying the technology, AspiraDAC, announcing its first customer. Officially, the customer is Stripe, which is making the purchase via Frontier – a partnership between Alphabet and Meta (the owners of Google and Facebook respectively) as well as e-commerce giant Shopify and consulting firm McKinsey.
Earlier this year, Frontier’s members announced they would spend US$925 million on carbon removal over the next nine years to stimulate and accelerate the development of carbon removal technology. AspiraDAC is one of six companies in the first round of spending, in which Stripe distributed  US$2.4 million. It is working in partnership with Australian start-up Southern Green Gas under an exclusive collaboration agreement to produce and deploy its solar-powered modules by the end of 2022.
Southern Green Gas’s prototype machine, developed in partnership with the University of Sydney, claims to suck CO2 directly from the air using solar power.

It is believed Southern Green Gas will build and deliver the machines to AspiraDAC, which will then begin capturing and storing carbon. “With Southern Green Gas pioneering this technology – harnessing Australia’s incredible solar power resource and world-class storage reserves – we are currently completing the demonstration phase of this project and are looking to enter the construction phase later this year,” Julian Turecek, Executive Director of AspiraDAC, said.
“What Frontier sees in AspiraDAC is the enormous potential in the range of technology developments we are ready to scale in the carbon removal sector,” he added. “The DAC [Direct Air Capture] solar-powered modules being delivered in this project are at the heart of the agreement with Frontier, being a global-first use of this technology.”
AspiraDAC and Southern Green Gas say they are currently working on the world’s first solar-powered DAC project of one tonne per day, or 310 tonnes per annum, made possible by funding from the Australian Government’s Carbon Capture Use and Storage Development Fund.

“Australia’s abundant solar energy potential means it is a perfect location for DAC, and with the use of solar-powered modules the facility can operate independently of traditional energy sources,” Turecek said. “Additionally, the compact nature of DAC facilities means production can capture equivalent CO2 emissions using less than 90% of the land needed in reforestation carbon capture projects. It is not without challenges, DAC technology is in its nascent stages, and agreements with customers such as the Frontier group will catalyze further development of the sector. This will increase our ability to bring down the costs per tonne of carbon to a competitive level to take removal to a megatonne scale within the next decade, and gigatonne scale the decade following.”

A first RfP, issued in November 2021, attracted 20 proposals from solar, wind, hydro and geothermal power generators in Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand to export clean power to Singapore.
The regulator said all those proposals – which amounted to 1.2 GW of electricity imports from 2027 onwards – would automatically be considered under the latest RfP.
Fresh proposals can be submitted until December 29, 2023, the EMA said.

The state-owned utility said the site now hosts 1,627 MW of solar. Another 1,233 MW of solar and concentrating solar power (CSP) capacity is being installed as part of the fourth and fifth phases of the project.
However, Dewa has yet to install the 250 MW of solar planned under the fourth stage of the project. Phase four also includes plans for a 100 MW solar tower and a 200 MW parabolic trough, as part of 700 MW of CSP generation capacity.

“The module can be used for either residential or commercial and industrial PV projects,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “It relies on gallium-doped p-type monocrystalline solar cells provided by Chinese manufacturer Tongwei and Aiko Solar.”
The new IF-HMW module uses 132 monocrystalline half-cut cells based on M1o wafers and busbar technology. It is available in nine versions with nominal power of 405 W to 505 W and efficiency spanning from 20.88% to 21.44%. The open-circuit voltage is between 35.13 V and 46.09 V and the short-circuit current is between 11-16 A and 14.01 A.
The smallest panel of the series measures 1,709 mm x 1,135 x 35 mm and the largest has a size of 2,075 mm x 1,135 mm x 35 mm. Its weight ranges from 21.2 kg to 26.2 kg.
It is built with 3.2 mm tempered anti-reflective glass and a 3.5 mm aluminum alloy frame. It also features an IP68 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new product comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.0% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.8% of the nominal output power.
Currently, Ifri-Sol has of module production capacity of 750 and plans to increase it to 1 GW by the end of this year. Its panel factory is located in Enfidha, in north-eastern Tunisia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/05/novel-photovoltaic-water-pump-from-spain/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 5, 2022",Novel photovoltaic water pump from Spain,"Spanish startup Acrosun recently unveiled a new solar water pumping system based on maximum power point tracker (MPPT) technology. The Benelus water pump can work for direct irrigation and with a water tank.
“With the tank filling control, we achieve maximum efficiency, as we can fill it during solar radiation hours, regardless of the flow rate and the power of the system,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Power electronics and the motor were embedded in the pump casing in order to make its installation easier.”
The special “StopFlow” function means the pump can stop working before the well runs dry. The manufacturer claims this helps to preserve the well and the pump itself. The system can operate in DC and AC mode and is available in three different versions.
“The three solutions are applicable to a wide range of installations,” the spokesperson said. “Our concept requires a lower number of pumping units and enables considerable savings.”
The Belenus 3H.140MW-10 weighs 17.5 kg and measures 110 cm. It can be placed at a depth of up to 150 meters and features IP69 protection. Its rated power is 3 kW and the operating DC voltage is between 60 V and 380 V. It can achieve a current of up to 10 A and its motor can reach 3,600 revolutions per minute (rpm).
The Belenus 2.5H.70M-16 has a power capacity of 2.8 kW and can achieve a current of up to 10 A, with the DC voltage range spanning from 60 V to 380 V. It weighs 16 kg and measures 96 cm.
The Belenus 2H.90M-10 pump shares the same characteristics as the other two devices. It weighs 16.5 kg, measures 100 cm, and has a capacity of 2.4 kW.
The Seville-based company is mostly selling its devices in Spain. However, it recently expanded its sales activities in Latin America and other international markets.
“Our solar pumps costs between €850 ($890) and €950 and are among the most competitive in the market,” the spokesperson said.

Tata Power has revealed plans to set up a greenfield 4 GW solar cell and module factory in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
It recently signed an agreement with the Tamil Nadu government to invest in the state. It will invest the sum over a period of 16 months. 
“The new plant in Tamil Nadu will integrate mono-PERC (passivated emitter and rear contact) bifacial technology with future n-type technology of tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TopCON) and will produce high-wattage modules with industry-leading efficiencies,” said the company. 
The facility will use autonomous mobile robots with lasers and cameras. It will feature smart manufacturing tools and technologies. The company expects the plant to directly or indirectly create more than 2,000 jobs.
Tata Power was one of the first companies to open a solar factory in India. In fiscal 2021, it set up a mono-PERC cell line at its existing manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, Karnataka. The Bengaluru plant has a production capacity of 635 MW of modules and 500 MW of cells.
