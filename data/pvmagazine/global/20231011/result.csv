Northvolt has announced plans to develop a fully integrated lithium-ion battery gigafactory in Quebec, Canada. The The Northvolt Six facility, just outside of Montréal. will be similar to the sustainability-centered design of Northvolt’s other facilities to accommodate 60 GW/h of annual cell manufacturing capacity.
The Swedish battery manufacturer produces lithium-ion cells based on Lingonberry lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide or NMC. They come in cylindrical and prismatic formats. The 2170 cylindrical cells are available in three formats: Energy, Power and Life.
Alternatively, prismatic cells are custom-made. The company assembles cells into battery systems for customers in energy storage and industrial markets.
Northvolt uses sustainable practices for its battery cell production, including wind, hydroelectric power, wastewater treatment, and materials recycling. It aims to recycle 50% of raw materials for cell production by 2030.
The company chose the strategic location of Northvolt Six in Quebec chosen due to its proximity to raw materials, renewable energy, and key US automotive manufacturers. The development of the first 30 GWh phase will begin by the end of this year, with operations starting in 2026, for an investment of $5 billion.
Northvolt secures funding through customer contracts, supply agreements, limited recourse financing, and collaborations with lenders and financial institutions. Major shareholders, including Volkswagen Finance Luxembourg SA, Goldman Sachs Asset Management funds, and Vargas Holding AB, play a significant role in Northvolt's development projects. The project will be led by Northvolt co-founder Paolo Cerruti, serving as CEO of Northvolt North America, headquartered in Montréal.

Terna, the Italian grid operator, has launched a public consultation for the GR.ITA 2 project. The €750 million subsea interconnection cable will connect Italy and Greece via two 250 km-long submarine cables with a capacity of up to 1,000 MW, as well as two 50 km-long direct current terrestrial cables.
“The new interconnection between the Italian peninsula and Greece will allow the safe management of the entire southern area and will favor efficient energy supplies, thanks to the possibility of enabling new resources through the coupling of the electricity market and maintaining the exchange of energy between the two countries even in the presence of maintenance operations,” Terna said in a statement.
The submarine cable will connect a new converter station in Galatina, southern Italy, with a station in Thesprotia, in Greece's Epirus region
“Terna, with the support of the Puglia Region and other regional administrations, has started the voluntary consultation process as early as 2022,” said Terna.
The project proposal will be presented in a series of events open to citizens and all stakeholders, scheduled from Oct. 13 to Oct. 25. The project aims to increase the interconnection capacity between the two countries, which is currently being provided by a 400 kV/ 500 MW submarine cable that was commissioned in 2022.

Bill Mulligan, Maxeon’s CEO, said in the statement that the company has decided to “streamline” operations, invest in new technologies and develop a mix between DG and utility-scale markets due to the “rapidly changing market and industry conditions.”
“We believe that Maxeon is well positioned to weather this market disruption and come out stronger on the other side,” he said.
The press release mentions that the company’s largest North America-based DG customer recently “breached their payment obligations” and the company paused shipments in late July as a result.
“While this customer has recently made several payments on their outstanding balance and is now close to becoming current, we continue to pause our shipments and engage in good faith towards [the] resolution of certain ongoing claims of breach under the Master Supply Agreement,” Mulligan explained.
“We do not have visibility into how quickly such resolution can be achieved. It is our position that we have firm quantity and pricing contracts in place.”
The 35-year-old Maxeon – based in Singapore but with a presence in 13 0ther countries – expects its third quarter 2023 revenue to be in the range of $224—$229 million, with shipments between 622 MW—632 MW. The company’s EBITDA, meanwhile, is slated to drop by roughly $30 million in Q3 2023 due to the reasons listed above and “inventory adjustments.”
The company will provide further details on Q3 2023 results and Q4 2023 guidance, as well as more information about restructuring activities, during its Q3 2023 earnings call, currently scheduled for November 15, 2023.

It said the facility is located in Ibeju Lekki, in the southern part of the city.
The project was launched in 2016 with a 10 MW semi-automated production plant. In 2020, the company secured financial backing from investor All On, a subsidiary of Shell. An initial grant of $50,000, provided through the US African Development Foundation's Offgrid program, was subsequently increased to $2 million to support construction.
“Our goal is to penetrate the Nigerian market before moving towards exporting solar photovoltaic energy to neighboring countries,” Chuks Umezulora, co-founder and CEO of Auxano Solar, said at the inauguration. “Our offering is aimed at both the formal sector – solar companies active in mini-grids, commercial and industrial solar suppliers – and the informal sector – importers of solar panels for resale.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that Nigeria had just 37 MW of grid-connected solar capacity at the end of 2022. The Nigerian government aims to meet 60% of the country's energy demand with clean energy by 2050.

Renaissance Solar and Electronic Materials (RSOLEC), a solar company with operations in India and the United States, has announced plans to focus on solar crystal growth and wafering in India. The company's long-term goal is to establish a prominent presence in the complete solar value chain.
Initially, RSOLEC will set ip a solar crystal growth and wafering facility with a yearly production capacity of 5 GW, with plans to expand to over 20 GW in the future. The facility is scheduled for commissioning in late 2025, and production will start in 2026.
RSOLEC is now evaluating multiple short-listed production site options that offer attractive opportunities. The announcement of RSOLEC's solar manufacturing plans in India follows its recent official launch and establishment, accompanied by a planned investment of approximately $300 million.
“With global reach and expertise in differentiated solar and electronic materials manufacturing, RSOLEC is set to revolutionize the industry with a strategic focus on solar crystal growth and wafering,” said the company.
RSOLEC said that for the next five years, it will mainly focus on crystal growth and wafering operations in India, with a significant contribution to the country's strategic solar manufacturing capacity. The company's long-term vision involves extending its manufacturing activities across the entire solar value chain.
It said its core objective is to establish a pioneering position in solar manufacturing with the lowest capital intensity, ensuring globally competitive production costs. Its roadmap outlines an ambitious goal of achieving a capital intensity below $35 million per gigawatt.
RSOLEC said its facility will feature the state-of-the-art Recharge Czochralski (RCZ) process, which can be adapted to the emerging Continuous Czochralski (CCZ) process for crystal growth. Wafer production will be based on the cutting-edge DCW platform, designed to produce thin wafers measuring less than 100 micrometers in thickness.
The main product will be high-quality silicon wafers characterized by low oxygen content, extended lifetimes, and controlled resistivity. These wafers will be compatible with all solar cell technologies, including TOPCon, PERC, HJT, and Tandem structures.
RSOLEC said it wants to produce crystals with uniform resistivity, potentially resulting in an average cell efficiency increase of 0.15%, a milestone not yet achieved in the solar manufacturing industry. For select customers with stringent requirements for low oxygen content, the magnetic Czochralski (MCZ) platform will be used. The facility will have the capacity to produce wafers in various sizes, including M10, G12, and G16.
Leveraging continuous technological advancements on existing platforms, the company said it expects an 80% improvement in productivity and a 40% reduction in production costs in a relatively short time frame.
RSOLEC, founded and supported by technocrats from five different countries spanning three continents, is headquartered in the US state of Delaware, and operates through its Indian subsidiary situated within the IIT Madras Research Park.
“RSOLEC is poised to contribute to the solar energy revolution and initiate the cultural transformation required for success in the dynamic solar manufacturing sector,” said Milind Kulkarni, chairman and CEO of RSOLEC. “Our differentiation lies in our technology-driven, low-risk innovations, positioning RSOLEC at the forefront of the solar industry.”

The Energy Transition Outlook 2023 – a 211-page document charting global and regional renewable energy trends until mid-century – prophesizes some solar PV’s LCOE will be already close to $0.020/kWh by 2025.
A reduction in unit investment costs, now valued at $870/kW, led to the decline, the report states. “As solar PV installations continue to double, these numbers are bound to drop, landing below $700/kW shortly after 2030 and shrinking further to $560/kW by 2050.”
The learning rate for solar is predicted to decrease from 26% to 17% by 2050, with the figure settling as cost components “adjust to decreasing expenses.” By the middle of the century, solar PV will retain its position as the world’s cheapest energy source, with a combined capacity of 15.3 TW – a 13-fold growth from 2022. But as solar grows so will storage, with the report stating, “We predict most of the global solar capacity additions to integrate storage”.

The Energy Transition Outlook 2023 expects solar to reach 54% of installed generation capacity by 2050, but only represent 39% of the world’s grid electricity generation. “The efficiency or the capacity factory of solar power stations trail behind other renewable energy sources like wind and hydropower,” the document states, “nevertheless, the underlying cause of solar’s rapid proliferation lies in its dwindling costs.”
DNV expects China and the United States to continue leading global solar PV installations for the next two-and-a-half decades, however, both countries will experience “a slight dip” by 2050 as they reach installation saturation. India, the Middle East and North Africa will creep up in the solar hierarchy, nearly tripling their shares, from 6% and 3% in 2022 to 14% and 12% by mid-century, respectively.
Solar taking over fossil fuel generation will differ per country and respective policies, with the report predicting solar surpassing fossil fuel generation in Europe in 2030 because of the region's, “world-leading decarbonization agenda and supportive solar policy.” But this “overwhelming surge in solar” will have a knock-on effect on other renewable energy generators and the nuclear sector, leading to a slight decrease in shares.

Non-fossil fuel energy – solar PV, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and nuclear – is expected to make up 52% of the primary energy mix by 2050, which is a different prediction from DNV's 2022 forecast, the new outlook report states.

Flexwave, a Taiwan-based developer of PV solutions for indoor-outdoor applications, has launched a solar PV unit intended to provide 10 years of self-sustaining solar power to remote small-sized electronics devices, such as wildfire detectors or gas monitors, as well as to Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
Dubbed Arc-Solar Box, the monocrystalline module relies on passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cell technology and is available in two versions with a power output of 1,250 mW and 3,050 mW, respectively.
The smallest device is embedded in an enclosure that measures 166 mm x 86 mm x 55 mm and hosts a PV module with a size of 110 mm x 60 mm. The larger version has an enclosure measuring 187 mm x 147 mm x 75 mm and contains a solar panel with dimensions of 134 mm x 104 mm.
The enclosure utilizes a waveguide technology that does not rely on conventional encapsulation, such as ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). “We use an optical encapsulant to substitute the traditional Glass/EVA, which shows good waveguide behavior and helps to collect the light from wider angles, just like a concentrator,” Daniel Chou, CEO, told pv magazine.
It also features maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and a charge control system that reportedly enables 10,000 mWh on a sunny day and 980 mWh on a cloudy day, based on measurements made in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
Furthermore, it has IP67 protection and includes a 5.0 V solar charge/battery controller. Optional features include a terrestrial and satellite communications module, environmental sensors, a rechargeable battery, and asset-tracking packaging.
The Flexwave technology is purportedly suitable for other cell technologies, such as organic photovoltaics (OPV), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), and gallium arsenide (GaAs) cells.
In February, the Flexwave module was validated with 14.48% efficiency under LED and 19.44% under a fluorescent lamp (TL84), by Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).
Referring to a study presented in September at the EU PVSEC event in Portugal that relied on a Real-Time One-Sweep (RTOS) method for I-V measurements and an indoor lighting simulator, Chou said, “With our technology, a mono-Si module could reach over 20% efficiency under fluorescent lamp for the very first time.”
The ArcBox is one of several original development manufacturing (ODM) products from the Taiwanese startup. It also offers a developer kit, Micro-EH, to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) for evaluation and prototyping. “The test kit helps our customers to understand the works of energy harvesters and quickly evaluate their system,” said Chou.
Design-in wins include the geo-location and user-access consoles in bicycles belonging to a leading Taiwanese bike-sharing fleet and the power modules inside Taiwan-based GlobalSat Worldcom’s GPS and terrestrial low range livestock asset trackers.
“As a young company, we keep looking for business that can solve problems and make profit, IoTs and distributed electronics are the major targets,” said Chou. “Although most of our business is ODM, more business connections on distribution will be welcome.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/11/coating-metallic-ribbons-for-aesthetic-implementation-of-bipv/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRIA,CZECHIA,EASTERN EUROPE,EUROPE,SWITZERLAND,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",Coating metallic ribbons for aesthetic implementation of BIPV,"A group of researchers in Switzerland has investigated the visual stability and electrical performance of black interconnect coatings used in PV modules. These coatings are utilized to improve the aesthetic appeal of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules, as they minimize their appearance on black back sheets.
“Interconnect hiding is often achieved through expensive and inefficient manufacturing steps, such as applying colored strips or bands with manual positioning,” the researchers explained. “A possible solution to modify the appearance of the metallic ribbons is to coat them with ink. Inkjet is one of the best technologies able to cope with the requirements of accuracy, resolution, and flexibility to coat the bright metallic ribbons.”
In a conversation with pv magazine, corresponding author Dr. Alejandro Borja Block added that “the cost of the manual process could be around 3 CHF ($3.32)/module, while an automated process could be 0.15 CHF/module approximately. It’s important to consider that many suppositions are made when doing these estimations, such as the automation degree of the equipment, lifetime of the equipment, consumables cost, cost of energy used, speed of the process, etc.”
In the paper “Stability of black interconnect coatings for solar photovoltaic module applications,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the research team compared three types of metallic ribbons – one was a commercially available black ribbon with no information about the coating used, while the other two were coated in the laboratory with UV-curable inkjet commercial inks.
The scientists tested the three ribbons in a sequence based on industry-standard IEC 62788-7-2. All coated ribbons were cut into 3 cm long strips and were then laminated in conventional glass-back sheet (G/BS) modules.
They then encapsulated the panels using three different encapsulants, with and without UV blockers. The three samples were left in the chamber for a total of 2,000 hours, equivalent to roughly 120 kWh/m2 doses of UVA and UVB irradiance (UVA+UVB), which corresponds to approximately two years of outdoor exposure in central Europe.
“The single most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison was that the color change only appeared on the UV curable inkjet inks, not on the commercial black ribbons,” the academics said. “Ink 1 produced the largest color change, a yellow halo in the surroundings of the coated metallic interconnects appeared. This could indicate diffusion of ink components into the encapsulant and degradation. Ink 2 produced a milder but still noticeable color change.”
After this test, the researchers dug deeper into ink 1, as it showed the most significant color change. They did it in two ways: first, by isolating the ink and the pure molecule 2-PEA to investigate whether it played an important role in the degradation observed; second, by creating a mini solar module and then coating its ribbons with the relevant ink.
The pure component samples were aged for 24 hours and 10 days, or UVA + UVB dose of 1.5 and 15 kWh/m2, respectively. “The pure component of the ink and flush, 2-PEA, polymerized after 1.5 kWh/m2, and it turned yellow after 15 kWh/m2,” the group emphasized. “This is due to the creation of carbonyl bonds in the substance, which are related to the oxidation of the molecule under UV light. The carbonyl index rose by 22% following the UV exposure of 15 kWh/m2.”
As for the sample coated module, it was aged for 6,000 hours or UVA + UVB dose of 360 kWh/m2. “The use of the investigated unstable ink would represent an aesthetical modification of color in the long-term demonstrating a potential long-term instability, but the electrical performance would be similar to a module without coated ribbons (less than 3% power loss),” noted the team.
Concluding their research, the scientists said they “discourage the use of 2-PEA monomer for PV aesthetic applications and suggest the use of UV curable inks with aliphatic monomers, which have better non-yellowing properties, in combination with UV blocker encapsulants.” They also added that “UV blocker encapsulants help mitigate the photodegradation of 2-PEA on G/BS laminates, whereas they do not fully mitigate the degradation for the ink itself.”
The team comprises academics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, Switzerland’s CSEM, Sustainable Energy Center, Austria’s Polymer Competence Center Leoben and the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.

Grid-forming inverters “are going to be needed once we get to very high levels of inverter-based resources,” said Ben Kroposki, organizational director of the UNIFI Consortium and director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Power Systems Engineering Center, at an RE+ conference panel discussion in September.
Solar, wind and storage resources are all inverter-based.
For 120 years, Kroposki explained, the electric grid has been based on synchronous generators, which can create the 60 hertz frequency used on the US grid to “black start” the grid after a complete blackout. Synchronous generators also synchronize to the existing frequency and provide other key functionality.
Most inverter-based resources installed to date use grid-following inverters. In the event that a large amount of generation goes offline, causing the frequency to fall below 60 hertz, generators that use grid-following inverters “try to keep online and inject power and keep the frequency stable,” Kroposki said. He referred to the solid red line in the graph above showing the modeled performance of a grid in which 73% of the generation uses grid-following inverters, following a sudden loss of generation.
The problem under that scenario, Kroposki said, is that the frequency drops below 59.5 hertz, shown with the dashed red line, in which case “the way to save the system is to drop some load,” resulting in a partial blackout, “and keep the rest of the system online.”
Grid-forming inverters, in contrast, can respond much more quickly to a frequency disturbance to maintain the frequency within range, Kroposki said, as shown by the green line in the graph. This capability is known as fast frequency response.
These modeling results were obtained by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council’s modeling and validation subcommittee.
The Texas grid operator ERCOT already occasionally reaches 71% instantaneous inverter-based generation, Kroposki said, which is very close to the 73% modeled in the scenario he described.
Some island grids are already past 73% instantaneous inverter-based generation, Kroposki said, including the Hawaiian Islands of Kauai and Maui, and Ireland.
Joining Kroposki in the panel discussion, Becca Jones-Albertus, director of the US Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office, said that an annual renewable generation percentage of 60% to 80% on a grid implies instantaneous generation of nearly 100% for the inverter-based resources.
Hawaii already requires grid-forming inverters for their large-scale energy storage projects, Kroposki said. He described a project on the big island of Hawaii in which the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is evaluating the performance of two grid-forming inverters made by different manufacturers, each with a capacity of at least 10 MW, working together on the island power system.
NREL is also rotating grid-forming inverters from different manufacturers through a 1 MW testing facility to ensure that they can all work together.
That type of technology validation is one key function of the UNIFI Consortium, while another is providing industry standards for grid-forming inverters. Consortium members are working to ensure that grid-forming inverters can provide voltage stability and regulation, damp oscillations, black start the grid, and provide cybersecurity.
The consortium is focused on helping commercialize grid-forming inverters, which are already available for battery storage. Grid-forming inverters for PV-only and wind-only projects are “about to hit the commercial market probably this year or next year,” Kroposki said.
Kroposki said the consortium offers a seminar series and other educational materials through its website.
UNIFI is an approximate acronym for Universal Interoperability for Grid-Forming Inverters. The US Department of Energy funds the consortium, which was formed last year.

While the number of electric cars on the streets has been rapidly growing in recent years, for aviation, short-haul flights are first in line for fuel exchange to electrified transportation given the limited energy density of batteries presently on offer.
In a new paper, researchers from the RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, Chalmers University of Technology and Uppsala University have quantified rising demand for airport energy from electric aviation and vehicles focusing on the airport in Visby, Sweden. They analyzed the potential techno-economical gains from installing solar and battery storage on site.
Their results show that substituting the short-haul flights with electric aviation increases the annual load demand by 89.4% and the annual peak power demand by 1 MW.
With PV alone, the grid demand reduces by 871 MWh through self-consumption (80%), the researchers found. They also observed, however, that peak reduction is modest and a consequence of the coincidence of PV output from 2.3 MW of arrays installed on-site and peak power demand.
Battery energy storage systems (BESS) further reduce grid demand, up to 18.3% compared to reference scenario with PV alone. The researchers also modeled BESS charge and discharge control in four ways, including a novel multi-objective (MO) dispatch to combine self-consumption enhancement and peak power shaving. They compared each model scenario for peak power shaving ability, self-consumption rate and pay-back period, as well as evaluated the BESS controls for annual degradation and associated cost.
They found that relative to the “PV alone” reference scenario, the newly proposed dispatch operation enhances self-consumption by 8.6% and “sufficiently shaves the power peaks.”
The MO dispatch operation also shows the lowest payback period of 6.9 years among the analyzed battery scenarios. It also reduces the battery’s idle period, resulting in an annual degradation (3.7%/a), which is in the same order of magnitude as the other dispatch algorithms (3.5–4.2%/a), the Swedish researchers reported.
The researchers discussed their findings in “Evaluating the role of solar photovoltaic and battery storage in supporting electric aviation and vehicle infrastructure at Visby Airport,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.

The city of Cottbus, Germany, now offers a solution for developers and integrators of large heat pumps in need of testing facilities. Fraunhofer IEG has launched Germany's inaugural test bench for large heat pumps at its Lausitz site. The facility features two testing benches designed for heat pumps with megawatt-scale outputs and high flow temperatures
Manufacturers, project planners and developers have the opportunity to use the open facility and validate new concepts, systems or projects and collect important data. This involves the development of new systems to market maturity, but project developers should also be able to optimize existing systems for their applications.
“With our research facility for large heat pumps, we are making a central contribution to the energy system of the future and supporting energy suppliers and manufacturers in finding the best possible heat pump for their application – whether process heat for industry or district heating networks at the municipal level,” said Mario Ragwitz, the head of Fraunhofer IEG.
One of the two test benches is designed to measure brine-water heat pumps with a performance range of up to 1 MW and flow temperatures of up to 90 C. Operations on the test bench are “close to reality” and therefore provide data for further development of prototypes. Among other things, sound propagation and the measurement of electromagnetic compatibility are possible.
On the second test bench, research is carried out for the city of Cottbus itself. In the future, a heat pump with several megawatts of power will supply the city's district heating network, using the heat from the “Baltic Sea” post-mining waters. However, this heat pump still needs to be developed.
At the test stand, Fraunhofer IEG operates a heat pump with 500 kW of power in continuous operation in order to obtain data for the model of the planned multi-megawatt heat pump. In the “FernWP” project, Fraunhofer IEG is researching the operating concept of the heat pump to supply the city of Cottbus.
The researchers are exploring potential heat sources and refrigerants for the project, while also assessing key technical and economic challenges.

Through the procurement exercise, the Bulgarian authorities expect to allocate 1,425 MW of renewable energy power generation capacity and 350 MW of storage.
Investment support will be provided to build a minimum of 570 MW of power generation capacity and 150 MW storage facilities, the announcement states.
The deadline for submissions is November 6, 2023.
The project is part of the National Recovery and Sustainability Plan (NRRP), which is a four-pronged policy adopted in 2020 aimed at facilitating economic and social recovery in Bulgaria post-COVID-19 pandemic. ‘Green Bulgaria’ is one of the policy targets – with BGN4,499 million ($2439.63) total planned expenditure – and focuses on building up sustainable management of natural resources and “allowing to meet the current needs of the economy and society.”
The policy states that “liberalizing” the country’s electricity market will be fundamental for the implementation and investment of projects, with a “national decarbonization fund” and “energy efficiency programme” also in the works, too.
The Bulgarian government committed to phasing out coal by 2038 in May 2021, and in May 2023 launched a scheme aimed at ramping up installations of solar water heating systems, rooftop PV arrays and batteries.
Bulgaria recorded 1948 MW solar PV installed capacity at the end of 2022, according to recent statistics published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Australian Minister for the Environment and Water Tanya Plibersek has approved the Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub (MREH), which will feature the largest battery in the Asia-Pacific region.
The 1,200 MW/2.4 GWh battery will purportedly power 1 million households. The project also includes a small solar component and could potentially expand to include hydrogen and battery recycling facilities.
The project is to be located on a 90-hectare site in Plumpton, 25 kilometers northwest of Melbourne. It is owned by Equis Development, with backing from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board.
Syncline Energy initially developed the project in 2021 under the name “Melton Renewable Energy Hub.” However, when Equis assumed full ownership of the project in 2022, it rebranded it as the “Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub” and committed AUD 1.9 billion ($1.22 billion) to its development.
Initially, Equis was aiming for the MREH to go into operations by 2024. The MREH website currently says that a “notice to proceed for construction is planned for late 2023 with commercial operations expected to commence in 2025.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/11/first-attempt-to-build-shingled-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",First attempt to build ‘shingled’ perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells,"A group of scientists led by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) have sought to apply for the first time the shingling interconnection technology to perovskite-silicon tandem (PVST) solar cells.
“The combination of PVST cells with shingling allows boosting the module efficiency even further due to the increase of the photoactive area through the absence of cell gaps,” the research's lead author, Veronika Nikitina, told pv magazine. “Technologically, shingling suits the temperature limitations of the PVST cells since the main factor for the choice of the processing temperature is the curing conditions of the electrically conductive adhesive.”
Shingled panels feature a busbar-free structure in which only a small proportion of cells are not exposed to sunlight. The cells are bonded with electrically conductive adhesive to form a shingled high-density string and the resulting strips are connected. The reduced number of busbars reduces shadowing losses.
“A significant advantage of combining PVST cells and shingling is the relaxed requirements on finger resistivity due to the relatively low cell current density,” the scientists said. “Additionally, shingling does not utilize ribbons and requires only one cell side to be printed with electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs).”
They also stressed that shingling utilizes less material while lowering thermomechanical stress in the panels. It also increases a cell's active area, thus raising the device's fill factor and power conversion efficiency. Furthermore, shingled solar modules have an improved shading resilience compared to non-shingled products.
The researchers used M6 (166 mm x 166 mm) precursors with a two-terminal (2T) configuration provided by solar perovskite specialist Oxford PV. Metallization with low-temperature silver paste by means of screen printing deploying 60 fingers and continuous busbar took place at Fraunhofer ISE whereas cutting the cells into 1/5 shingles with 24.5% efficiency was realized at Oxford PV’s plant in Brandenburg, Germany. Shingles were shipped back to Fraunhofer ISE in Freiburg for interconnection and module integration.
“The optimum number of fingers on the front side was determined by sweeping number of fingers while keeping the number of fingers at the rear side as well as finger dimensions and busbar dimensions constant,” they also explained, noting that they utilized cell-to-module (CTM) analysis to assess the impact of the number of fingers and shingle size on the module efficiency.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the 1/6 cut PVST cells with 25 % initial shingle cell efficiency would be able to achieve a module efficiency of 23.4 %.
The October issue of pv magazine, hot off the press today, turns the spotlight back onto agrivoltaics. We’ll consider how solar on farmland is taking root in Australia and South Africa, how agrivoltaic data harvesting could help more farmers take the plunge, and how an insistence on expensive minimum heights for agrivoltaic panels is hindering the technology in Italy.
“The feasibility of the shingling approach as well as module integration with PVST cells was demonstrated by producing full-format modules,” the group said, adding that it produced real bifacial glass-glass solar panels based on industrial production equipment, which reached efficiencies of up to 22.8 %. “Metallization of PVST precursors with low-temperature silver paste by means of screen-printing with subsequent cutting with laser scribe and mechanical cleave method was successful.”
The novel cell design was introduced in the study “Shingling meets perovskite-silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
