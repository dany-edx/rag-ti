The plant is divided into two sub-units with a capacity of 4 MW and 5 MW, respectively.
The first of the two facilities is aimed at covering the observatory's current and projected demand during the day, when the greatest energy demand is produced by the cooling systems of the multiple telescopes operating there, including the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which is the world's most advanced optical and near-infrared operational telescope.
The second installation is dimensioned to cover, also during the day under normal conditions, the total power demand of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which is currently under construction and set to become the largest optical telescope in the world with a main mirror of 39 meters in diameter.

The PV complex consists of 18,565 bifacial panels installed on trackers, distributed over 7.2 hectares of land, with a plant factor of 37%. Its construction took nine months and required a total investment of $10 million.
Excess energy from the plant will be injected into the National Electric System.
The start of operations of the ELT is scheduled for the end of this decade and it is claimed that it will be a telescope that will revolutionize astronomy since it should detect planets similar to Earth orbiting other stars. It could be the first instrument to find evidence of life outside our solar system.

German football club SC Freiburg has announced that German system integrator Badenova has completed construction on a 2.4 MW rooftop solar array on the roof of its Europa-Park stadium.
The solar facility is the world's third-largest photovoltaic system on a football stadium after a 4.2 MW system installed on the roof of the Ali Sami Yen Sports Complex Nef Stadium in Instanbul, Turkey, and the 2.5 MW array deployed on the roof cover of the National Stadium Mane Garrincha in Brasilia, Brazil.
The rooftop PV system in Freiburg is expected to be grid-connected in September, after the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) and testing and certification institute VDE will have certified the installation.
Around 6,000 heterojunction solar modules from Switzerland-based Meyer Burger were installed on a 15,000 m2 roof area. Badenova invested around €2.3 million ($2.3 million) in the system, which it will operate over a 20-year period.
“We want to set an example for sustainability and innovation not only for similar projects, but also with the quality and origin of the modules,” said Klaus Preiser, managing director of Badenova subsidiary Badenovawärmeplus.
“The project is a real milestone for our new Europa-Park stadium and it shows how important sustainability and environmental protection are to us at SC Freiburg,” explained SC Freiburg board member Oliver Leki.

REMC Limited, on behalf of Indian Railways, has invited bids to install 1 GW of grid-connected renewable power projects, with or without energy storage systems (ESS), for a round-the-clock power supply.
The projects can be located anywhere in India. The selected developer is to set up RE power projects on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. The nominated zonal railway will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement with the successful developer.
The RE generation (solar, wind, and hydro) components and the ESS may be co-located or located at different locations. 
“Already commissioned projects will not be considered under this RfS. However, projects under construction or not yet commissioned will be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other central or state schemes,” the tender document states.
A single developer can bid for 250 MW up to the entire 1 GW capacity.
In a separate tender, REMC has invited bids to set up an aggregate 1.548 GW capacity of land-based solar plants near the traction sub-station (TSS) at 25 kV connectivity. The capacity is to be installed on a build-own-operate basis across different zonal railways.

The trade body revealed that around 21,500 new PV systems were installed in the Scandinavian country in the first six months of the year, which would represent a 90% growth compared to 11,400 facilities connected during the first half of 2021.
“This growth rate is expected to increase during the third quarter, but will probably decline slightly during the fourth quarter. It depends to some extent on the availability of labor and materials,” the association stated, noting that over 46,000 PV installations are expected to be deployed for the full year compared to 26,540 solar arrays in 2021. In 2020, newly deployed installations stood at around 22,000.
Last year was the country’s best for solar deployment yet, with around 500 MW of new capacity added to the grid. The nation installed 400 MW in 2020, 287 MW in 2019, and 180 MW in 2018. Sweden’s operational PV capacity reached 1.59 GW at the end of December.
Most of Sweden's PV capacity is represented by residential and commercial arrays supported by a rebate scheme. The Swedish Energy Agency has devoted around SEK 4.8 billion ($511.2 million) to the solar rebate program for the 2009-21 period.

The announcement was given by minister Bojan Kumer on the same day the Slovenian government announced a plan to limit the maximum electricity prices for households and small businesses to between €0.081 and €0.118/kWh.
The details of the new solar plan were not disclosed. Kumer said, however, that it will include the development of large-scale solar parks, which have so far seen limited deployment in the country due to strict regulations preventing them from being built in agricultural areas. The minister specified the new solar plants will be built on suitable areas and will be open to crowdfunding from nearby communities.
The country's largest PV plant is a 6 MW solar park that Slovenian hydropower plant operator HESS built close to its 47.7 MW Brežice hydroelectric plant on the lower Sava River. In February, Slovenian energy and oil provider Petrol Group announced it would build three photovoltaic plants with a combined capacity of 22 MW in Knin, Croatia.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Slovenia's total installed PV capacity stood at just 367 MW by the end of 2020. Most of its existing capacity comes from rooftop PV installed in 2012 (122 MW), 2011, (54 MW) and 2010 (37 MW) under the national feed-in tariff scheme, which expired at the end of 2013, and a net metering scheme for PV installations up to 11 kW in late 2015.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/18/oil-and-gas-reservoirs-are-cheapest-options-for-underground-hydrogen-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,IRELAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 18, 2022",Oil and gas reservoirs are cheapest options for underground hydrogen storage,"A group of scientists led by the Dublin City University in Ireland has analyzed the prospects of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in geological formations in a comprehensive review and has found that depleted oil and gas reservoirs are the cheapest options.
In addition to oil and gas reservoirs, the techno-economic analyses considered hydrogen storage in aquifers, porous rocks, and salt caverns. “It should be mentioned that salt caverns do not exist naturally,” it explained. “Instead, they are artificial cavities in underground salt formations, that are created by the controlled dissolution of rock salt through water injection during the solution mining process.”
All these geological formations may ensure a series of advantages in terms of safety such as good gas tightness, high wall sealing thicknesses, and extensive subsurface depths. “It is worth noting that UHS can benefit from the technological maturity of the geologic storage of natural gas and CO2, which are associated with decades of established knowledge,” the researchers noted. “However, H2 is invariably more chemically, biologically, and microbially reactive, which presents unique challenges that are yet to be fully understood.”
Furthermore, compared to conventional natural gas storage, UHS has leakage issues, due to viscosity, the molecule size of hydrogen, and the lower density, which requires more pressure and in turn affects storage capacity.

The analyses showed that the cost of UHS depends on transportation, monitoring, storage, and injection cost, as well as the location and properties of the geological storage site. Capital costs included gas compression, transformer installation, piping, transformer installation, new well drilling, and wellhead equipment installation.
The researchers found that depleted oil and gas reservoirs are the cheapest storage option with a cost of $1.29/kg, while rock caverns offer the highest levelized cost of storage of $2.77/kg. Capital expenditure for gas and oil reservoirs was also the lowest at $0.73/kg and salt caverns had the highest capital expenditure of $1.51/kg. The academics emphasized that the operating expense was also lower ($0.11/kg ) when compared to salt caverns ($0.14/kg ), noting that depleted natural gas reservoirs have a lower construction cost when compared with depleted oil reservoirs.
They introduced their findings in the paper “Perspectives and prospects of underground hydrogen storage and natural hydrogen,” published in Sustainable Energy Fuels. “Despite the scarcity of economic data on natural hydrogen projects, it is expected that the overall economics of its extraction will not be too different from natural gas,” they concluded. “Nonetheless, this requires further substantiation via robust techno-economic analyses.”

They specified that their work is intended to fill a gap of knowledge on whether all crack types can lead to a significant drop in the output power generation of solar cells. “The crack issue in solar cells becomes worse as the thickness of the wafer is being reduced,” they stated. “This is the case because the reduced thickness makes it easier to develop extra mechanical stresses in the cells when assembled into a full-scale PV module.”
Their analysis was conducted on three-busbar solar cells, provided by an unnamed manufacturer, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.61 V, a short circuit current density of 38.8 mA/cm2, and a peak power of 4.72 W.
They used electroluminescence (EL) imaging through a digital camera with a resolution of 6k × 4k pixels and a camera lens of 18-55 mm. “The solar cell samples were connected with a power supply for biasing purposes under short circuit conditions,” the scientists said. “The percentage of the crack was computed by subtracting a cracked vs crack-free image.”

The UK group submitted the cells to solar illumination under varying irradiance of 100-1000 W/m2 and their temperature was kept constant at 25 C. Through these measurements, it found the solar cells were affected by crack percentages ranging from 1% to 58%.
The researchers explained that output power losses for the cells with crack percentages below 11% were insignificant, adding that these cells are relatively equivalent to non-cracked cells. “It is recognized that a hotspot is to develop if the crack percentage, which is essentially representing an inactive area in the solar cell, is in the range between 11 and 34%,” they also explained.
According to the academics, their findings confirm that small cracks have a negligible effect on solar cell output, and they develop no hotspots. They also found that a crack percentage of over 46% is also insufficient to develop a hotspot, as there is a significant inactive area in the cells, which means the localized heat can be critical but not enough area to develop a hotspot.
They presented the results of their work in the paper “Rapid testing on the effect of cracks on solar cells output power performance and thermal operation,” published in scientific reports. “There are still some critical questions to be answered/linked with this research work; an example, how do cracks or hotspots develop over time?,” they concluded. “This has to be investigated over a long-term period for solar cells operating in diverse environmental conditions rather than simply examining the solar cells under artificial indoor illumination.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/18/the-mobility-revolution-rising-gas-prices-supercharge-ev-adoption-in-the-us/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 18, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: Rising gas prices supercharge EV adoption in the US,"The adoption of EV in the US is picking up pace as gasoline prices soar to record levels. According to a national survey by the American Automobile Association (AAA), a quarter of Americans surveyed say they will buy an EV as their next automobile, with millennials most eager to go electric. Of those looking to buy a plug-in vehicle, 77% said the interest was driven by a desire to save on fuel costs. When comparing two popular EV sedans against popular gasoline-powered vehicles, the AAA found that fueling a gasoline-powered vehicle (about $70 for a full tank) is twice as expensive as charging an EV at a public station (around $20 per full charge) and about four times pricier than charging an EV at home (around $10 per full charge). In addition to fuel savings, EVs cost less to maintain because they don’t have spark plugs, need oil changes or air-filter replacements. However, upon the conclusion of a federally mandated 100,000-mile vehicle warranty, EV owners may need to cover the cost of new batteries, which range in price from $2,500 to over $10,000, the AAA notes. Even as more Americans lean into electric options, the AAA found lingering consumer hesitation surrounding price (cited by 60% of consumers), range (60%), and accessibility to charging (58%). Regarding the latter, data from the US Department of Energy suggests there are nearly 55,674 charging stations throughout the nation.
In the UK, EVs are expected to make up close to a third of used car sales by 2030. According to a report by LV= General Insurance, 31% of cars on the used market will be EVs by the time the government introduces a ban on sale of new petrol and diesel cars. “While the average annual running costs of electric cars are significantly cheaper than petrol or diesel cars, the sticker price remains one of the big barriers for drivers considering making the switch, which is why these projections for a thriving second-hand market by 2030 are so encouraging,” Gill Nowell, head of EV at LV= General Insurance said. In 2021, fully electric vehicles made up only 1.3% of cars on UK roads, numbering 399,981. That figure is expected to exceed 1 million in 2023 (3.1%) and 6.4 million in 2025 (6%). In 2021, EVs are only expected to make up 2% of the total second-hand car market with 129,032 sold. The figure is expected to grow steadily by 2026, when 1 million are expected on the road, equating to 15% of the used car annual sales market. Used EVs are forecast to rise to more than 3 million by 2030.
Volkswagen Group of America has teamed with recycling start-up Redwood Materials, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, to establish a closed-loop battery supply chain in the US. Redwood will work directly with Volkswagen Group of America’s network of more than 1,000 dealers to recover, safely package, transport, and recycle end-of-life EV battery packs from Volkswagen and Audi vehicles. According to Redwood, the batteries will be processed at its northern Nevada facilities, where more than 95% of metals, like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper, will be recovered and then used to re-manufacture anode and cathode components that it will supply back to US battery cell manufacturers. The partnership is “the first step in creating circularity for current and future vehicles” of Volkswagen, which is aiming for 55% of its US sales to be fully electric by 2030. In Nevada, Redwood says it already recycles more than 6 GWh of lithium-ion batteries each year, enough to power more than 60,000 electric vehicles — the “majority of lithium-ion batteries recycled in North America today.” Redwood previously partnered with Ford, Volvo and Toyota in EV battery recycling. The company is also planning to establish two recycling factories in Europe.
In Germany, Volkswagen has commissioned a fast-charging park at its electric car plant in Zwickau, which is supplied with energy largely from a so-called Power Storage Container (PSC). The PSC consists of 96 cell modules with a net capacity of 570 kWh, which were formerly installed as batteries in pre-production ID.302 and ID.403 models and have now been given a second purpose. According to VW, the advantage is this fast-charging infrastructure can be built nearly anywhere, even in places with a low-capacity grid connection. It is also described as a “cost-effective alternative to the transformer station.” The automotive power bank could enable high power charger infrastructure to be built in the future where previously only AC charging at a maximum of 11 kW has been possible, for instance in residential areas, according to the car maker. The charging park at the west gate of the Zwickau plant is made up of four charging stations, each with an output of 150 kW, which can also be divided into two outputs of 75 kW. This means that up to eight vehicles can charge at the same time. The electricity comes from an adjacent PV installation, from which Volkswagen Sachsen has been purchasing green electricity since 2017, among other  renewable energy sources. Three fast-charging parks will be in operation on the plant grounds by the end of the year. For the PSC, Volkswagen Sachsen is relying on a solution that Audi already successfully used as part of its charging hub  in Nuremberg. The container cubes consist of used lithium-ion batteries from disassembled Audi test vehicles that are used as buffer storage for DC electricity.
In the first half of the year, three major car manufacturers saw a big uptick in sales of electric vehicles. German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz said EV sales increased by 134% over the first half of the year to 45,400 units. The big increase in EV sales came despite an overall 16% decrease in car sales to 998,000 over the same period. Meanwhile, German carmaker BMW said sales of its fully electric BMW and Mini models in the first half of 2022 increased by 110.3% over the same period last year. Swedish EV specialist Polestar said it more than doubled its sales to 21,200 EVs, up from 9,510 cars in the same period in 2021. It expects to deliver 50,000 EVs this year, on the back of the removal of restrictions in China and the first portion of its big order book with Hertz.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has mobilized a financing package of up to $4.5 million for taxi company Sayohon in Tajikistan’s capital of Dushanbe. The financial package, consisting of an EBRD loan and a grant from the Bank’s Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change program supported by the Global Environment Facility, will allow Sayohon to procure 100 EVs and 30 charging stations as well as to create the necessary charging infrastructure. To date, the EBRD has invested €892 million through 152 projects in Tajikistan’s economy.

Like refrigerators, heat pumps use electricity to move heat from cool spaces or warm spaces, either making those spaces even warmer or cooler depending on the desired results. The technology – which is by no means novel – has received renewed attention across Europe and places like New Zealand as the question of how to decarbonize industrial heating comes into sharp focus. Around 44% of Australia’s final energy consumption comes from industry and of that 52% is used for process heat, according to consultants ITP.
The Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity, an industry and government not-for-profit alliance, was recently engaged by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to conduct modeling into the potential of heat pumps for Australia. It found that while, of course, heat pumps are no silver bullet, the technology could cut a “nice chunk” from Australia’s most difficult to abate emissions, the Alliance’s CEO Jarrod Leak told pv magazine Australia.
Moreover, Leak said heat pump technology has been poorly modeled in the past, leading to them being “grossly underestimated.” Its modeling found industrial heat pumps are both economically and technically feasible for applications where the required heating was below 90˚C,  and are often a superior solution to solar thermal or biogas.
There is a continued perception that heat pumps are too expensive to be viable for the industry though – something Leak disputes, saying the issue often is related to system oversizing and a lack of data. We’ll come back to this shortly, but first it’s worth looking at the technology’s most insidious issue: its bad reputation.
Unlike many other technologies needed for decarbonization, Leak says heat pumps will need to overcome their sketchy legacy to be embraced in Australia. Poor quality installs and equipment, as well as other issues with programs rolling out heat pumps, have given the technology a bad name in some circles. What’s worse, Leak fears these issues persist.
“There’s a whole bunch of cheap and nasty heat pumps that don’t work and are poorly supported,” Leak said. “There’s an offer on Facebook now to get a new heat pump for $33 because of a government rebate, and normally they cost about $3,000.”
Online, complaints revolving around heat pumps abound – something all but guaranteed to worsen with the installation of $33 systems. According to Leak, there isn’t enough being done in Australia to introduce minimum standards for heat pump technology – something our neighbor New Zealand is already addressing. This legacy, Leak says, has led to a cautiousness among government bodies and leaders, who are reluctant to fully endorse the technology.
Since the uptake of heat pumps in Australia remains comparatively low, there is also an education – or more specifically behavior change – component.  “It’s a different way of heating your house,” Leak says, noting that the heating offered from heat pump systems isn’t radiant like a gas heater, nor is it immediate. Rather, heat pumps need an hour or so to heat or cool a room and the temperature change is far more ambient. 
With the introduction of smart homes and the capacity for remote appliance control, these issues could become less pronounced.
Even with those issues, Leak believes the residential rollout of heat pumps is vital – even if the industry is where most of the benefit lays.
This is because, Leak notes, there’s very little attention is paid to industry technologies. Moreover, the case for heat pumps in residential houses is far easier and more compelling than for commercial buildings. Often, moving to heat pump technology is “not an easy transition for a lot of commercial buildings,” Leak admits. This is because commercial buildings usually lack the data needed to correctly size a heat pump.
“Because the technology on per kilowatt installed basis is somewhere between five and 10 times more expensive than traditional [boilers], you need to be more careful with it,” Leak says. “You cannot just flippantly change like for like.”
Leak says there is potential for heat pump technology to move further down the cost curve – although those savings would largely come from manufacturing. “There’s not much happening in terms of the technology but on the supply chain,” he says, noting suppliers optimizing their manufacturing locations and an increase in uptake would further depress costs.
“But it’s not a cost curve like solar PV,” he said. Where heat pumps and solar are alike though, is in the savings which come from increased installation proficiency – from which solar in Australia has been a massive beneficiary – and for which there is certainly room for heat pump prices to depress, according to Leak.
As is often the case with emerging technologies, government support is crucial. But compared to New Zealand, where the federal Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry fund (GIDI) fund has committed NZ$650 million (US$400million) to renewable process heating, about a quarter of which goes towards heat pumps, ARENA has spent only about AUD3 – 4 million, Leak estimates.
Part of this lack of funding is because of ARENA’s remit, which limits it to expanding renewable energy supply. Since heat pumps don’t strictly generate renewable energy, but rather support their application and reach, projects applying for ARENA funding would need to couple their heat pumps with a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) component from a clean generator.
Another battle for heat pumps is with the perceived shine of the technology. Put simply, heat pumps just aren’t as sexy as other new technologies and their potential investment market is far more modest. “We’re not talking billions,” Leak said. “When you talk about solar, hydrogen, batteries, it’s billions of dollars. We’re talking in the hundreds of millions of potential for, say, annual investment [in heat pumps].”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/18/theres-big-money-in-recycling-materials-from-solar-panels/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 18, 2022",There’s big money in recycling materials from solar panels,"From pv magazine USA
The question about what to do with solar panels at the end of their useful life is about to become moot as Rystad Energy analysis shows the incredible value of materials that can be extracted in the recycling process. Rystad estimates that recyclable materials from PV panels at the end of their lifespan will be worth more than $2.7 billion in 2030, up from only $170 million this year, and the value will approach $80 billion by 2050.
PV recycling is still in early stages, but it has been successfully implemented in Europe where the Waste Electrical and Electroni Equipment (WEEE) directive requires 85% collection and 80% recycling of the materials used in solar panels. In the US, California-based Solarcycle recently raised $6.6 million in growth funding to advance its solar recycling platform. Investors include some solar veterans such as SolarCity founders Peter and Lyndon Rive, and former CEO/CTO of Sunpower, Tom Dinwoodie.
Rystad projects that solar PV waste will grow to 27 million tonnes per annum by 2040, and they estimate that recovered materials from retired panels could make up 6% of solar investments by 2040, compared to only 0.08% today.
Not only is material recovery expected to be big business, but reclaiming the minerals will become increasingly necessary as the growing demand creates a short supply.
“Rising energy costs, improved recycling technology, and government regulations may pave the way for a market where more defunct solar panels are sent to recycling rather than the nearest landfill. Recycling PV panels can help operators save costs, overcome supply chain woes and increase the likelihood of countries meeting their solar capacity goals,” says Rystad Energy analyst Kristin
Based on the rate of installations in 2022 and assuming a 15-year lifespan for solar panels, Rystad looked at which regions and countries will benefit most from solar recycling in 2037. The findings showed that China will account for 40% of global installations this year, and when these panels mature in 15 years, the estimated recycling value will be $3.8 billion, out of a $9.6 billion global total. India will trail in second place with an estimated $800 million in value, followed by Japan with $200 million in estimated value. North America in 2037 is projected to be worth $1.5 billion, with Europe set to hold $1.4 billion.
The components in a solar panel with the highest value are aluminum, silver, copper and polysilicon. Silver accounts for about 0.05% of the total weight but makes up 14% of the material value, Rystad estimates. To recycle polysilicon requires an energy intensive process, which is why recycled polysilicon has a high price. Glass is not on the list of high value components because, while there’s a lot of it on solar panels, it has a low resale value.
Rystad estimates peak solar energy implementation in 2035 of 1.4 TW, by which time the recycling industry should be able to supply 8% of the polysilicon, 11% of the aluminum, 2% of the copper, and 21% of the silver needed by recycling solar panels installed in 2020 to meet the material demand. The result will be increased ROI for the solar industry, an enhanced supply chain for materials, as well as a reduction in the need for carbon intensive mining and refinery processes.
In September 2021, NREL scientists published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry. The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to $18 per panel for 12 years. The Rystad analysts point to the EU’s regulatory mechanisms for jumpstarting the recycling industry in Europe. And while policy can promote an industry, the economic potential of the solar recycling industry may be the greatest motivator.

Through the Department of Energy (DOE) the Biden Administration has announced a commitment of $56 million to spur domestic manufacturing and recycling of solar modules, with DOE announcing another $18 million to be directed toward overcoming challenges to commercialization for department-backed technologies.
According to DOE, the manufacturing and recycling funding is split between two initiatives: the FY22 Photovoltaics (PV) Research and Development funding opportunity and the FY22 Solar Manufacturing Incubator funding opportunity.
The Research and Development funding opportunity will make available $29 million to support projects that increase the reuse and recycling of solar technologies, develop PV module designs that reduce manufacturing costs, and advance the manufacturing of PV cells made from perovskites. $10 million of the project’s total financing will come from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, with these funds to be directed toward the recycling aspect of the program.
The remaining $26 million in funding will go toward the Manufacturing Incubator and will support projects aimed at commercializing new technologies that can expand private investment in US solar manufacturing. While any projects that ready new technologies and manufacturing processes for commercialization, DOE places a specific focus on boosting thin-film module manufacturing made from cadmium telluride.
“This administration wants to seize US leadership in solar energy, from manufacturing to recycling, and that means making the right investments to ensure these technologies are made right here at home,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. “Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, DOE is able to invest in our nation’s innovators so they can improve manufacturing and strengthen the domestic solar supply chain—lowering energy bills for Americans and businesses and driving toward an equitable clean energy future.”
Both of these funding avenues take a heavy focus on the commercialization of technology breakthroughs, a considerable hurdle when bringing innovation out of the lab. In additional support of this critical step in product development, DOE is investing $18 million in funding through the Technology Commercialization Fund for seven proposed National Laboratory projects focused on easing commercialization.
