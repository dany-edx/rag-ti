The scientists claim to have achieved a higher bifacial power density than any polycrystalline absorber currently manufactured at scale. They used cracked film lithography (CFL)-patterned metal grids to integrate the CuGaOx rear interface buffer in the solar cell.
“Common passivating layers, such as Al2O3 and other oxides, are highly resistive, need to be applied directly to the CdTe surface, and require a high-temperature CdCl2 treatment after they are deposited,” they said, noting that they used CFL to overcome this issue. “CFL is a low-cost method to pattern metal microgrids that have ideal properties for high resistance applications like CdTe.”
Researcher Chris Muzzillo said CFL is particularly suitable for CdTe cells due to its low cost. “We found that relative to photolithography, CFL has lower materials and equipment cost for patterning metal grids in III-V photovoltaics,” he told pv magazine.
Muzzillo and his team described their findings in “Cracked Film Lithography with CuGaOx Buffers for Bifacial CdTe Photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Nano-Micro Small. In all CFL processes, metal is grown directly on the semiconductor surface, resulting in high-quality interfaces with low contact resistance and improved durability.
In the proposed cell configuration, the CuGaOx/CFL grid samples’ showed superior passivation to their reduced gold (Au) coverage area, which in turn resulted in a higher open-circuit voltage for the solar cell. They also helped improve the device's fill factor from 70.8% to 73.3%.
“We estimate that the previous CdTe bifacial record, with 1 sun front and rear efficiencies of 12.5% and 7.6%, respectively, generates 16.3 mW cm−2 at 1 sun front + 0.5 sun rear,” the research group said. “On the other hand, our best CFL grid produces 20.3 mW cm−2 at 1 sun front + 0.5 sun rear—a 25% jump in record bifacial CdTe power density, and at 1 sun front + 0.1 sun rear, our cell has 39% higher power density.”
Muzzilo said that commercialization of the cell is up for consideration.
“Compared to bifacial silicon, the rear efficiency of bifacial CdTe remains relatively low,” he concluded. “We will continue to work on boosting front and rear efficiency, with a goal of demonstrating high enough added power density to justify the added process complexity of CFL-patterned bifacial CdTe.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/11/german-highway-pv-could-generate-up-to-200-twh-a-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,GERMANY,WESTERN EUROPE",MARIAN WILLUHN,"APRIL 11, 2023",German highway PV could generate up to 200 TWh a year,"From pv magazine Germany
In addition to floating PV arrays and agrivoltaic systems, motorways could be an ideal solution for the surface problem of photovoltaics. By 2030, up to 200 TWh of solar power could be annually generated along Germany’s autobahn network. The implementation of such a project would result in a smart grid, but the benefits would not stop there.
The project would entail steel-grid masts erected every 15 meters along the sides of motorways. PV modules would be installed on steel lattice girders hung between the masts. “Energy bands” made up of solar modules could stretch along the traffic axes between cities, industrial areas and airports.
The energy band concept stems from the Altes Neuland Frankfurt Foundation, which has developed the project. It says that if 80% of motorways and 65% of federal roads – a combined 45,000 kilometers – were equipped with bifacial PV arrays with 25% efficiency, up to 200 TWh could be generated every year.
If the full potential is exploited and construction processes are optimized, this could also be achieved at competitive costs, the foundation argues. Although the substructure made of steel-grid masts clearly exceeds the costs of conventional substructures, the masts would also have a service life of 100 years. New modules could be added again and again during this time at very little cost.
The idea initially arose from the space requirements for PV and wind power. Current electricity consumption in Germany is 560 TWh per year. With mobility and heat gradually being electrified, by 2050 it is estimated that 2,400 TWh of electricity will be consumed yearly. The foundation assumes that 1,000 TWh of this will also be produced in Germany. The area required for this would take up 2.5% of the federal territory, or three times the area of the state of Saarland.
The energy bands are intended as a direct current system. A 110 kV high-current cable would run underground. A mains connection would have to be set every 9 km to 87 km. The different lengths per network connection depend on the use of the module assignment. So it would be conceivable to lay one, two or three rows of modules on top of each other, to install cross bridges with modules and, if necessary, even cover the masts and motorway bridges with solar modules. There is space for between 2,000 and 20,250 modules per kilometer.
The Altes Neuland Foundation has also considered scenic landscapes. If an energy band leads through a town or past a forest, avenue trees or a particularly picturesque landscape, the energy band can simply be interrupted. In this case, the project planners can omit masts and modules and only continue with the underground cable. The energy band array would only begin again behind the village or forest, while both parts would still be connected by the underground cable.
The biggest advantage of such a system would be that the electricity is already distributed during production and is thus routed to the right places, the Altes Neuland Foundation notes. Motorways connect metropolitan areas, industrial areas and airports. In addition, there is a charging infrastructure for electric cars and electric trucks along such long-distance routes. In this way, the electricity would already be produced in the right place or could at least flow to the right place.
The energy bands would extend over hundreds of kilometers, so there would also be an opportunity to even out fluctuations in consumption and power generation across the entire system. According to the foundation's project data, if it rains in one place, the sun may shine elsewhere. Such a project is optimized even further if additional wind turbines are connected to the system. Smaller wind turbines can be placed on the masts and existing systems that are located in fields along the highways can also feed into the energy bands.
Although an expert analysis would be required for mast wind loads, it would still be easier than covering the motorway with PV systems, according to the foundation. The latter variant would require wind reports, drainage systems and lighting concepts. Researchers at the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT), Germany's Fraunhofer ISE and Forster Industrietechnik recently teamed up on a pilot project for motorway solar generation using PV rooftops.
The initiators of the project say their plan would face fewer problems with the provision of space and permits. Arrays would only be built 1 meter to 2 meters to the sides of roads. This area is owned by the federal government, so there would be no need for permits from many different landowners.
The starting signal for the expansion of the energy bands could begin on a small scale. A huge infrastructure project would not be necessary. Municipalities and investors could develop small sections. It would only be important that they are developed in such a way that sections can be joined together at a later point in time and that there is a legal and technical basis for trading in electricity along the sections.
Peter Birkner, a professor in Bergische Universität Wuppertal’s electrical energy supply department, has followed the development of the project and the feasibility study as a member of the scientific advisory board. He is convinced of its feasibility and says it is now important to put together a suitable consortium to develop a first section.
It remains to be seen how quickly such a consortium will be formed, but investors would have little to be concerned about. All technologies that are installed are already market-ready and have been tried and tested. The foundation argues that the necessary modules, steel pylons and underground cables have all been around for decades. Annual production potential of 200 TWh could be achieved as early as 2030, it says.

Its project partner, Air Liquide, designed and supplied the storage system. The filling tests are part of preparations for upcoming coupling tests, in which the liquid hydrogen storage system will be coupled with the fuel cell system to form a complete hydrogen-electric powertrain.
South Korean researchers have discovered that the global warming potential (GWP) emission factor of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system for residential buildings – fed with hydrogen from natural gas reforming (NG-PEMFC) – is more than double the GWP of a similar system fed with hydrogen from a PV-powered water eletrolyzer. “In the case of NG-PEMFC, the GWP was 3.72E-01 kg-CO2eq/kWh, the embodied carbon emissions due to using city gas during the life-cycle process was about 20.87%, the carbon emission ratio according to the reformer's combustion burner was 6.07%, and the direct carbon emission ratio of the air emissions from the reformer was 73.06%, indicating that the carbon emission from the reformer contributed over 80% of the total GWP,” the researchers wrote in “Potential global warming impact of 1 kW polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system for residential buildings on operation phase,” which was recently published in Energy for Sustainable Development. The GWP for the system fed with hydrogen from a PV-powered water electrolyzer was 1.76E-01 kg-CO2eq/kWh. The scientists noted that the embodied carbon emissions from PV generation during the life-cycle process accounted for more than 99% of the total GWP.
Wingcopter and the ZAL Center of Applied Aeronautical Research have launched a partnership to develop green-hydrogen-powered delivery drones. “The most important requirement for the development project is to increase flight duration while maintaining the Wingcopter’s characteristic flight capabilities,” said ZAL.
Germany’s Chemnitz region is applying to become a HyPerformer region, in cooperation with HZwo, under the HyLand regional funding program of the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV). BMDV is expected to make a decision by the end of April.

Low- and middle-income households currently heating their homes with oil can now apply to receive an upfront payment of up to CAD 10,000 ($7,413) towards purchasing and installing a new, electric, air-source cold climate heat pump. This includes up to CAD 5,000 from the Canada Greener Homes Grant (CGHG).
The rebate scheme does not specify what classifies as a cold climate heat pump, but the OHPA website says that “cold climate air source heat pumps have been designed to work in lower temperatures well below freezing and can now work down to -30 C temperatures.” The Canadian government estimates that homeowners switching from oil to cold climate heat pumps could save between CAD 1,500 and CAD 4,700 per year on energy bills.
“Electricity is the cheaper, greener, and more reliable way to heat your home,” said Seamus O’Regan, Canada’s minister of labor. “We want more people to make the switch from oil to electric heat pumps so their heating bills are lower — that’s why we’re helping to cover the cost.”
The cost of installation services such as electrical and mechanical upgrades, removal of oil tanks, and installation of backup electric heating systems is also covered by the grant. The funding can be combined with additional financial assistance from other existing federal, provincial, territorial, and utility programs, according to the OPHA website.
Residents of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, New Brunswick, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Yukon can apply to the scheme here. Residents of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island need to apply through their provincial programs.

It will be the country's first large-scale solar plant.
The project includes a 15 MW/30 MWh battery energy storage system, a 33/66 kV substation, and a 66 kV transmission line connected to the existing transmission line between East Asmara and Dekemhare, located about 1 km from the project site.
Financed through the African Development Fund, the PV plant and battery backup system is expected to increase generation capacity and grid energy to 185 MW and 365 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually.
The project is seen as instrumental in reducing Eritrea’s power deficit, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing the cost of electricity generation to $0.185/kWh. It is also expected to increase the share of renewable energy in the grid’s energy mix from 3% to 23%, creating temporary jobs during project implementation and long-term jobs after project completion.
“The project outcomes will boost socio-economic development that has suffered from massive and prolonged load shedding and consequently improve the quality of life of the people of Eritrea,” the bank stated.
It added that part of the grant will also be allocated to technical assistance and capacity building to improve the operational performance of the grid and the overall development of the Eritrean power sector. Technical studies for large-scale renewable energy projects are also planned to respond to electricity demand within the Eritrea Electricity Corporation (EEC) network’s interconnected system.
“Eritrea experiences inadequate, unreliable, expensive, and polluting electricity supply,” the bank noted. “The available capacity is 35 MW for a peak demand of about 70 MW. Consequently, frequent load-shedding periods affect businesses and the population.”
The project’s funding includes $19.5 million from the African Development Fund and $30.42 million from the bank’s Transition Support Facility (TSF).
According to the latest International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Eritrea's estimated cumulative solar capacity stood at 10.807 MW in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/11/remembering-shri-pranav-mehta/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,INDIA",,"APRIL 11, 2023",Remembering Shri Pranav Mehta,"From pv magazine Global 04/23
I spent four years working closely with Pranav Mehta and saw how his five decades of service shaped today’s Indian solar sector and contributed to India and the world.
A 31-year-old Mehta conceived, advocated for, and implemented the use of natural gas, rather than coal, for steelmaking. He left Tata Steel to join the Gujarat government in 1982 and, eight years later, his lobbying led to India’s first gas-based “sponge iron” steel plant, at Hazira. The site saved millions of tons of emissions associated with coking coal-based production and brought employment and economic benefits.
Mehta was honored with the Ministry of Steel and Mines’ National Metallurgist Award in 1990, presented at the Indian Institute of Metals, and he was praised by future president A P J Abdul Kalam at the ceremony.
As compressed natural gas advisor to Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation – an appointment made by then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi – Mehta was instrumental in reducing air pollution in the megacity of Ahmedabad and other cities in the state.
Mehta’s solar journey began in 2006 and, working with former state body the Planning Commission of India, he drove the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to produce India’s first solar policy two years later. From that initial goal of 50 MW of solar generation capacity, India now has 63 GW, and is the world’s fifth largest solar state.
In May 2013, Mehta founded trade body NSEFI to represent the whole solar supply chain, including regional, national, and international developers; manufacturers; engineering, procurement, and construction contractors; installers; and system integrators; including small and medium-sized enterprizes.
NSEFI works with central and state governments towards India’s goal of 450 GW of renewables capacity by 2030 and achieved the goal of making solar affordable in less than a decade, under Mehta’s leadership.
NSEFI also played an important role in co-founding the Global Solar Council at the COP21 climate change summit in Paris in 2015, along with other national solar associations. This step was an important recognition of India’s growing role in the global solar narrative. Later, in 2019, Mehta became the first Indian to chair the Global Solar Council and his tenure was marked by advocacy on global platforms, especially in developing countries, for the need to accelerate solar installation. Mehta was also the first Indian to sit on the seven-member steering committee of the International Renewable Energy Agency’s Coalition for Action, in 2019.
In view of the success of India with solar energy, and of Shri Mehta’s leadership and involvement in the industry, he was invited by governments and other institutions from 15 countries including the USA, France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, China, Taiwan, Qatar, the UAE, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Egypt to share his views and experience in the areas of policy advocacy, the planning of solar growth, skills development, and the application of solar energy to ensure sustainable growth. Through these global efforts and activity Mehta kept the Indian flag flying high worldwide.
Mehta has received accolades, both in India and across the globe. Key awards he was honored with include the Solar Visionary Influencer and Disruptor Award from the Abu Dhabi-based Cleantech Business Club, in 2019. This award had previously been received by Tony Seba, of Stanford University, and former German MP Hans-Joseph Fell.
Shri Mehta also received the Outstanding Green Activist Award from the Indian Federation of Green Energy, with the honor presented by Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Roads, Transport, and Highways, in 2019. The Indian solar champion received the Global Excellence Award in Renewable Energy 2017, from the Energy and Environment Foundation and then-energy minister Piyush Goyal.
Mehta’s efforts had a significant socioeconomic impact, in terms of catalyzing large investment, creating entrepreneurship in the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprize (MSME) sector – especially for young entrepreneurs – and he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium enterprises with the recognition bestowed by MSME minister Haribhai Chaudhari in 2017.
In Shri Mehta, the world has lost a climate warrior, the nation has lost a true son and energy ambassador, and the Indian solar industry has lost a visionary leader. The best tribute we can pay to him is to continue his legacy by taking forward his work and building on the foundations of his vision for a sustainable India and a sustainable world.

The US-based company recently achieved the final validation of its prototype solution in the Outdoor Autonomous Manipulation of Photovoltaic Panels (O-AMPP) project, funded by the US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office. It did not disclose the exact location of the pilot installation.
“The solar construction industry is facing unprecedented labor shortages while simultaneously facing an increase in demand for solar energy,” said Trent Mostaert, vice president of industrialization at construction engineering company Mortenson, a partner in the O-AMPP project. “We believe the O-AMPP system can address these challenges while improving safety, productivity, and efficiency for our workers. It will also enable solar project developers to scale output and production to the levels needed to achieve the Energy Department’s 2030 and 2050 renewable energy goals.”
The proof-of-concept robotic system consists of an autonomous working vehicle (AWV) featuring Sarcos’ Guardian XM robotic arm and an autonomous delivery vehicle (ADV). The solution uses cameras to identify where the PV panels need to be installed. The robotic arm then autonomously lifts up the panel using a vacuum system and places it approximately where it needs to be clamped to the mounting structure. “The arm then goes into a special mode where the person clamping the panel can easily move that panel however they need, in order to align it and attach it into the panels,” Sarcos explains in a video on its website.
The company did not share details on whether the vacuum system lifting mechanism would lead to mechanical stress on the PV modules. It says that the robotic solution’s benefits include lower soft costs for projects, projection multiplication, improved construction timelines and quality, and a safer worksite that reduces the risk of lifting and fatigue-related injuries.
The O-AMPP project started in 2021 and Sarcos expects to commercialize its solution by 2024. “Achieving this market validation and field test milestone is a mission-critical step on our path to commercializing our robotic solar field construction solution and, ultimately, enhancing safety and productivity in the solar field construction industry,” said Kiva Allgood, CEO of Sarcos.
Array Technologies supplied the tracker system used in the pilot project. Other industry partners included equipment manufacturer JLG Industries, automotive company Pratt Miller, and Mortenson.

A little over a month after Iberdrola announced its alliance with Exiom to build a 500 MW TOPCon solar module factory in Asturias, Spain, the energy giant has announced plans for a new PV module factory in Extremadura, Spain.
It has submitted a PV panel manufacturing project to the third call of the Innovation Fund, the European Commission's aid program for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies.
If successful, the factory will have a production capacity of 1.6 GW per year, equivalent to 3 million panels, and it could cover a third of the current demand in Spain, according to Iberdrola. “This new industry will boost local economic development with the creation of 500 direct jobs”, the company said.
Iberdrola has not disclosed the technology of the PV panels or any other details. The third call for small-scale projects of the Innovation Fund was launched on March 30 and ends on Sept. 30, 2023. It has a budget of €100 million ($109 million) to support projects with a capital expenditure between €2.5 million and €7.5 million.
The Solar + Storage Spain event, which combines a two-day conference, exhibition space and workshops, will take place in Barcelona on May 10 and 11. The conference's “Going global” panel will address how markets in Europe, China and the United States are competing to attract talent, companies and industry.

To date, the company has delivered nearly 150GW of solar modules globally by Q1 2023. 
Last year, the company signed distribution agreements with many global players in the solar space, including Aldo Solar for the distribution of 600 MW N-type Tiger Neo Modules in Latin America. That agreement made Brazil the first market in Latin America to make JinkoSolar's new N-type modules available.  
2023 starts with a launch 
JinkoSolar opened the new year with the launch of its second generation Tiger Neo panel, featuring a range of sizes suitable not only for utilities, but also for commercial and industrial, as well as residential applications. The new Tiger Neo family includes three series with up to 445Wp for 54-cell, 615Wp for 72-cell, and 635Wp for 78-cell, along with module efficiency up to 22.27%, 23.23%, and 22.72% respectively. The next-generation modules offer higher power with ultra-high efficiency and a further optimized temperature co-efficiency down to -0.29%/℃.  
The company reports that the panels achieve a higher rear-side generation with up to an 85% bifacial factor and allow for 15-20% more yield compared to conventional bifacial panels. The Tiger Neo line – which comes with a 30-year warranty – offers leading-edge reliability over its 15-year lifespan, as well as a hassle-free operation and maintenance experience thanks to its 1% initial-year degradation and 0.4% linear degradation.  
JinkoSolar also recently set a new company record, achieving a maximum solar conversion efficiency of 26.4% for its 182-mm and above large-size monocrystalline silicon TOPCon solar cell. This result, which breaks the company’s previous record of 26.1% set in October 2022, has been independently confirmed by the National Institute of Metrology, China (“NIM”).  
Progress on corporate sustainability 
JinkoSolar’s accomplishments as a green manufacturer received high praise in 2022, with Forbes China including the company on its 2022 list of Top 50 Most Sustainable Companies. It also won the Harvard Business Review Global Chinese Edition’s “ESG Innovator of 2022” award. PV Evolution Labs recognized JinkoSolar as a Top Performer in its 2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard, and Ernst & Young named the manufacturer as a Sustainability Awards 2022 Outstanding Company of the Year. 
ESG projects will remain important for JinkoSolar in 2023, as it was the first solar company to pass the 50% renewable-powered mark in 2022, and it is now working toward 60% by the end of 2023. This achievement includes its 12 manufacturing factories in four countries — including China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the United States, which run on a mix of hydro, solar, and wind energy it has developed or purchased.

Since the beginning of this year, developers have switched on 2,111 MW of distributed-generation systems and 1,351 MW of centralized capacity. At the end of 2022, there were 7,040 MW of solar centralized capacity and 17,616 MW of distributed capacity connected to the grid in Brazil.
At the beginning of this year, the Brazilian Association of Photovoltaic Solar Energy (Absolar) projected 10.1 GW of new solar capacity for 2023. If installations continue at the pace observed in the first 100 days of the year, an average of 21.1 MW per day, new distributed-generation capacity will reach 7,705 MW in 2023.

The transition to decarbonized energy is expected to require significant amounts of lithium and other battery materials to support grid-level energy storage, electric vehicles, and mobile devices. NREL has developed a software tool, the Lithium-Ion Battery Resource Assessment Model (LIBRA), to understand the dynamics of a steady supply chain of these materials.
Ongoing NREL research elucidates the need for supply chain strength for a clean energy future. The LIBRA model is helping researchers better understand the numerous factors that impact the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery materials supply chain – the key to the energy transition.
“Li-ion batteries offer performance, energy density, cost, and cycle-life benefits. However, electrification efforts are complicated by various intersecting factors, including differences in markets, operations, and policies,” said NREL. “In addition, Li-ion batteries may contain critical materials in short supply, such as cobalt, with few natural resources available domestically.”
LIBRA uses system dynamics modeling to analyze the supply chain and evaluate the economic viability of Li-ion battery manufacturing, reuse and recycling. The tool considers changes in costs, battery adoption scenarios and international actions, and how these factors influence long-term trends in the battery supply chain.
“Although LIBRA can’t predict the future, this model allows researchers to ask and answer ‘what-if’ questions to gain insights into a complex and rapidly evolving industry,” said NREL. “LIBRA offers a detailed and consistent approach to guide research and investments to secure the Li-ion supply chain, optimize recycling processes, and ensure resiliency and sustainability for nationwide grid and vehicle electrification.”
The system dynamics analysis in LIBRA track the supply and flow of materials and costs over time for manufacturing and recycling. It includes advanced feedback loops that inform changes throughout stages of the chain. As a result, LIBRA can offer insights into material availability and demand for lithium.
“For example, if we extend the lifetime of EV batteries to reduce the overall environmental impact of Li-ion batteries, how might that lower the availability of recycled materials? There are many factors at play,” said Dustin Weigl, a mobility research analyst at NREL.
The tool tracks the movement of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other elements through the supply chain. The model has repeatedly shed light on the economic viability of recycling of these materials. It has highlighted an opportunity for regional potential of recycling to offset mineral imports.
Among other insights, LIBRA offers useful data and analysis for:
“We are constantly updating LIBRA’s model structure and data based on the latest developments within the transportation and recycling industries,” said Weigl. “Technological advancements move quickly, but LIBRA is designed to adapt with next-generation cell chemistries, battery designs, and storage systems.”

It says that the factory will produce Megapack, Tesla's large commercial energy storage batteries.
Tesla's Megapack batters are known for their ability to store more than 3 MWh of electricity per unit, for high-density, utility-scale energy storage projects. The batteries can be integrated and installed with battery packs, inverters, and temperature control systems to stabilize the grid. The battery packs are designed to match with dedicated inverters. Megapack batteries can also be updated in real time via over-the-air (OTA) software to continuously optimize them.
Tesla says the Megapack factory will be its first major storage factory project outside of the United States. Zhuang Mudi, the deputy secretary of the Shanghai municipal government, said that the Tesla Megapack factory project will play a crucial role in promoting the development of Shanghai's energy storage industry.
In January 2019, Tesla started building its Shanghai gigafactory and completed it within a year. The Shanghai gigafactory supplied more than 710,000 electric vehicles in 2022. Since 2019, Tesla has continued to invest in Shanghai, partly by increasing the production capacity of the Shanghai gigafactory.
Reuters has reported that CEO Elon Musk plans to visit China in April.
