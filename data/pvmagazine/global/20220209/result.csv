You’ve heard of “floatovoltaics”, but Project Nexus takes a different approach by installing solar panels over canals. The concept grew out of a 2021 study conducted at the University of California, Merced and UC Santa Cruz, which found many advantages to mounting solar panels over open water canals.
The study showed that covering the approximately 4,000 miles of public water delivery system infrastructure in California with solar panels can generate 13GW of energy annually, equal to about one sixth of the state’s current installed capacity and about half the projected new capacity needed to meet the state’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030.
“Solar canals are an example of an energy-water nexus that offer multiple sustainability benefits. Using water canals for solar infrastructure conserves water while producing renewable electricity and avoids converting large tracts of land to solar development,” said Dr. Brandi L. McKuin, lead author of the study.
The Turlock Irrigation District (TID) is partnering with the Department of Water Resource (DWR), Solar AquaGrid, and the University of California, Merced in the $20 million project funded by the State of California. Groundbreaking on Project Nexus is scheduled for this fall, with the project expected to be complete in 2024 at multiple locations throughout the TID service territory. The project will include energy storage to study how storage facilities can support the local electric grid when solar generation is suboptimal due to cloud cover.
Solar AquaGrid LLC founders recognized the untapped opportunity to put a lid on evaporation by shading California canals, as is done in Europe, where canals are lined with tree cover, and in India, where canals are being covered with solar panels, and began their investigation, forming a unique public/private/academic collaboration to advance California’s Solar Over Canal initiative. The company commissioned the study at the University of Merced through the Sierra Nevada Research Institute and UC Water.
“Research and common sense tell us that in an age of intensifying drought, it’s time to put a lid on evaporation,” said Jordan Harris, CEO of Solar AquaGrid. “Our initial study revealed mounting solar panels over open canals can result in significant water, energy, and cost savings when compared to ground-mounted solar systems, including added efficiency resulting from an exponential shading/cooling effect. Now is the chance to put that learning to the test.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/09/making-the-case-for-perovskite-quantum-dots/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022",Making the case for perovskite quantum dots,"Quantum dots, tiny particles of semiconductor that can carry a charge, made from various materials have been investigated as possible solar cell materials. Those based on perovskites have proved particularly attractive to researchers working in photovoltaics, having already demonstrated efficiencies beyond 16%.
A group of scientists led by Dalian National Laboratory for Clean Energy in China noted that while more commonly researched bulk perovskites have reached solar cell efficiencies better than 25%, perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have a long list of other potential advantages over these, making them worthy of further research. The advantages include, according to the group: potential for high performance, fewer defects and better stability, simple fabrication methods, easy tunability to absorb different parts of the light spectrum, and production using more environmentally solvents.
Fully understanding PQDs, and realizing some of these advantages, however, will require a lot of work. The group at Dalian conducted a detailed review of recent progress with the material, outlining some of the next challenges for researchers. “The application of PQDs is only at its infancy and the highest PCE still cannot compete with the bulk perovskite-based devices,” they stated. “A series of scientific issues should be resolved by combining experimental and theoretical methodologies.”
The review, titled Perovskite Quantum Dots in Solar Cells, is published in full in Advanced Science. Among the issues that need to be resolved they find a need to better understand various aspects of PQD chemistry and composition. They note while studies have confirmed strong stability potential, more work is needed on the long-term effects of heat, light, and humidity on performance and stability. And they also note the continued presence of lead in the best performing devices is a problem, and work on replacing this, for example with tin, should be accelerated (though bulk perovskites are in a similar situation here).
More on the commercial side, the review finds little work has been done on actual manufacturing processes: “…methods for preparing PQDs are conducted in minitype glass instrument, for example, three-neck-flask, and the yield is in gram level,” they state. “Thus, the synthesis and post-treatment process should be advanced enabling the compatibility with large-scale synthesis and continuous production of large-area PQD films.” They do, however, reference one 2018 study that estimated the current cost for synthesizing a PQD at around $0.74/W, noting that this would need to come down significantly to compete with silicon PV.
Despite the challenges, the review concludes that the material’s potential advantages mean that PQDs will play a role in the future of PV. “Undoubtedly, PQDs are promising to be “game changer” in the field of photovoltaics, which has displayed great potential in large-scale manufacturing, low-temperature flexible fabrication and semi-transparent or tandem photovoltaic devices,” the group stated. “Certainly, it poses a higher challenge to scientific researchers with the purpose of bringing out the potentials and advantages of PQDs.”

Chase published the prediction in an article surveying the current state of solar, and its future prospects, for sustainable energy journal Joule which was also published on the ScienceDirect website.
The article, View from the Solar Industry: We Don’t Need COP26 to Shine, But What Should We Worry About? included Bloomberg's estimate for the volume of solar which will have been installed worldwide in 2030, with the analyst having estimated 183GW of photovoltaics were installed last year and this year will bring “comfortably more than 200GW.”
Chase cited the polysilicon shortage which drove up solar panel prices last year as one possible headwind, although the solar analyst expects the situation to ease with the arrival of new poly manufacturing capacity this year.
Shortages of land and grid connection points in some of the biggest solar markets could also pose problems for PV although Chase points out the industry's biggest developers don't seem to have been significantly slowed by those hurdles yet, with the solar expert adding: “Solar and wind deployment could not now be stopped if we wanted to.”
In terms of how much renewables are needed to hit a net zero world in mid century – with Chase remarking upon how much faster the scale of solar capacity is growing than that of wind – BloombergNEF's renewables-focused “green” scenario would require 5.3TW of solar this decade – with 1TW of it to power green hydrogen production – and 19.7TW by 2050.
Alternative routes mapped by the analyst lean on the nuclear and carbon capture, use and storage technologies which, as yet, are not developing with sufficient speed, and Chase sounded a positive note to readers daunted by the scale of the job required by remarking, in relation to historic forecasts for clean energy roll-out: “As analysts, we are far better at seeing problems in each country than we are at imagining transformative change to world energy systems.”

Solar project developer GCL New Energy, which wants to pivot to gas-fired hydrogen production, has secured permission from the majority of holders of US$420 million worth of senior notes to spend US$30 million of the funds raised by the issuance of the investments to a connected company to secure a year’s exclusive supply of Ethiopian natural gas. GCL will pay Poly GCL Petroleum for the fuel to fire hydrogen production at a planned plant in Djibouti, GCL New Energy announced on the Singapore Stock Exchange today. Hong Kong-listed polysilicon-making parent company GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd today said it is exploring the possibility of instead listing on the Chinese mainland.

pv magazine’s  UP Initiative has examined what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to workers, often far removed, who are involved in the production of their products and services.

IDG, which is owned by Hong Kong energy company Titan Gas Technology Holdings Ltd, on Friday announced an investment agreement with public entity Xuzhou National High-tech Industrial Development Zone Management Committee to back the development, which will also concern the manufacture of semiconductor cleaning equipment. The public partner will provide 21,600m2 of land, buildings for staff and other support, with IDG pledging to capitalize a US$30 million project company to construct the production base within two months of the investment agreement taking effect, with production slated to start in the first half of the year.
State-owned power company China Power International Development Ltd has published its, unaudited electricity sales statistics for last year, indicating it sold 49% more solar power in its wholly-owned plants than it had in 2020, up from 4.77TWh to 7.09TWh. That rise was eclipsed in scale by its coal plants, which generated 62.9TWh, up from 54.8TWh; and in terms of growth by its gas-fired facilities, from which the 1.06TWh of electricity sold was almost six times the 187GWh sold in 2020. China Power’s solar power sales by province ranged from 1.74TWh sold in Ningxia and 1.49TWh in Shanxi down to 4.84GWh in Jiangsu and 2.97GWh in Beijing.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/09/zinc-batteries-old-technology-brings-new-values/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022",Zinc batteries: Old technology brings new values,"Can you tell me about the Zinc Battery Initiative and why it was established?
The initiative is a consortium of battery companies and stakeholders that use zinc-based battery technology, as we realized it's very important to have a common voice to represent this industry sector.
We have a very wide spectrum of members with different approaches and we believe it's better to have a platform with different choices, almost like a menu, so you can best choose what suits your needs. And from what we hear, everybody wants safety and now, with supply chain issues and EVs being so successful, it’s not practical to rely solely on lithium.
What advantages do zinc batteries offer over other chemistries?
Zinc is very versatile and you can apply it to all kinds of applications and configurations, starting from very small formats. We just had a new member joining, Imprint Energy, which makes printed zinc batteries and they have found their niche in tracking sensors and the internet of things. Before zinc, they tried to use lithium-based technologies in a coin cell or other small formats but with lithium, there is so much packaging required to ensure safety. So, in the same volume, zinc-based technologies are almost 10 times better than lithium. Of course, in terms of energy density, lithium takes the win.
On the other end of the spectrum, if we look at large scale applications, there are zinc-flow batteries. One of our members, Australia-based Redflow, has just finished the installation of a 2MWh zinc-bromine system in California. We also have zinc-air flow batteries, such as the ones supplied by Canada’s Zinc8, where the size of your electrolyte tank determines the hours of storage. So you can go to 10 or 50 hours, even 100 hours of storage, but after that it makes sense to consider hydrogen.
These are the extreme ends, but there also is a lot in between. For instance, in data centers and server farms you need short-duration, reliable, instantaneous power, and this is where nickel-zinc excels. Two of our members, U.S.-based ZincFive and AEsir, are supplying this technology, and the latter one has recently secured financing for a gigawatt manufacturing facility in South Dakota. AEsir has … 30-year experience in zinc-based systems and is working on new cathodes they call rechargeable hybrid cathodes. They use lower cost components and circumvent nickel, the price of which has been rising.
What other configurations are there to see in the market?
There also are zinc batteries that are using low-cost, manganese-based cathodes. One of our other members, New York-based Urban Electric Power, is producing manganese-zinc batteries with an alkaline electrolyte and its focus is on residential storage. Also, we have two more members both looking at residential applications, Sweden-based Enerpoly and Canada-based Salient Energy, pursuing another way of doing manganese-zinc batteries. That is the newest approach in this chemistry, where manganese-dioxide is tweaked in a way that it works like a lithium-ion battery in mechanical terms and has zinc ions moving back and forth but with twice the charge than that of lithium. This tech can share production infrastructure with lithium-ion but it’s a water-based system, so there is no need for a dry room that lithium-ion batteries need as they don’t tolerate moisture.
Also, there are zinc-air batteries. Unlike flow batteries that require pumps and more moving parts, Canada-based e-Zinc has a system which uses a container that can be sized from two to 50 hours of storage. Their system is gravity based, with zinc generated in the upper section of the unit cell and moving to the lower section where it is used. We also have U.S.-based Enzinc among our members. They have commercialized a zinc sponge electrode and aim to get into the mobility market, to be used in e-bikes, golf carts or small-distance cars. In general, I think there's great opportunity for zinc-based technology. We know it works but it just needs to be applied and deployed at scale.
And from all these configurations that you just mentioned, which one has gone the furthest in terms of the deployment?
Those would be nickel-zinc systems for data centers and transportation hubs. On the upper end, we have the zinc-flow systems and zinc-air systems which are in demonstration phases. Many of these systems still are not in the stage when you can just go and buy a unit, but we’ll get there.
So what does the future hold for zinc-based battery storage systems?
Right now, the market share of zinc-based technologies is very little but we think it will go to around 25% by 2050. So based on [the] BloombergNEF NEO 2020 [New Energy Outlook report] forecast for storage batteries, and [the] percentage of zinc market share estimates based on consultation with French company Avicenne Energy, the zinc energy storage market share is forecast to stand at 10% in 2030, 18% in 2040, [and] 25% in 2050.
Another interesting aspect in the supply chain [is that it] can be completely westernized. Zinc is globally mined and refined in 50 countries so supply is secure and conflict free.

The first nickel zinc batteries were invented by Thomas Edison but quickly fell out of favor. What has happened in the meantime that we are now seeing all these manufacturers emerging?
The fate of all batteries is determined by application. You have a need, and then you have a certain battery type to go with it. In the 90s, there was so much research going into lithium, and zinc-based batteries were considered an old technology. But now, 20 years later, things are different. We also are aware of the problems with lithium-ion batteries and researchers are thinking what other types of batteries can be made and what is needed. So they were looking at the drawbacks of the zinc-based battery systems, such as shape change and dendrite formation, and resolved these issues. It’s a very old technology but often companies decide to use their secret mixes and don’t give away all their ingredients. Of course the common goal is to control shape change so that you don’t lose energy over cycles, as well as to address forming of dendrites and thus prevent an early system failure. Those two issues were the reason behind the short life in zinc-based batteries but they have been resolved.
Can you say something about the technology’s technical aspects?
Zinc-based batteries have a wide operating temperature range [of] between -40 degrees Celsius to 75 degrees Celsius, depending on the application and recommendations of individual manufacturers. Overall, [the] life of the systems depends on the chemistry you use, for instance in flow batteries there is no degradation, so you’ll probably shoot for 20 years but of course you’ll need some maintenance. This is if you do accelerated testing, and we’ll know the real lifespan in 20 years, as the installations are just starting.
Charge cycles depend on which cathode you use and what your chemistry is. For example, zinc-ion can last as long as lithium-ion batteries. In manganese-zinc and alkaline configurations, the cycle life will mostly depend on how deep you discharge, similar to lead acid but still better performance. For zinc-flow it could be, even, up to 20,000 cycles. Depending on the zinc-based battery technology applied, the energy density can be similar to lead acid batteries and can go from 70-150Wh/kg. With zinc-air systems, which has theoretical energy densities in excess of 1,000Wh/kg, higher values may be attainable
Where do the zinc batteries fall in with all the other available chemistries on the market and what are their best applications?
Nickel-zinc batteries are a great fit for data centers and server farms where, still, mainly lead acid batteries are being used today, as well as for military applications such as submarines. Then, manganese-zinc systems will be used in applications where two to six hours of storage is needed. As we go along with demonstrations and the need for longer-duration storage grows, we will eventually have zinc-based batteries providing baseload power in combination with renewable energy sources.

“The cost models are based on a bottom-up approach of the institute, in which typical layouts of the electrolysis plants are first designed and then technical parameters are determined by a steady-state simulation of the energy and mass balances in the systems,” the Fraunhofer ISE stated. “Based on these specifications, the cost shares of the individual subsystems and components are determined via price quotation from manufacturers and suppliers and via specific cost functions.”
In the study “Cost Forecast for Low-Temperature Electrolysis,” the scientists provided a comprehensive analysis of the cost structures
of alkaline and proton exchange membrane electrolyzers taking into account technology costs reported for 2020 and those projected for 2030.
Their analysis considered two electrolyzer systems, with capacities of 5MW and 100MW, for the alkaline and PEM technologies. “The PEM cell, stack and system components are designed for an operating pressure of 30bar,” the paper reads. “The AEL cell and stack design is oriented on well–proven and advanced chloralkali electrolysis designs including operation at atmospheric pressure, which makes additional mechanical compressors on the system side necessary to ensure a comparability between both technologies.”
For the AEL technology, the number of stacks was assumed to be two in 2020 and one in 2030, for the 5MW, project and 40 in 2020 and 20 in 2030 for the 100MW system. For the PEM electrolyzer, the number of stacks for the 5MW system was indicated at five in 2020 and one in 2030, while for the 100MW installation, their number was 100 in 2020 and 20 in 2030. “Due to technological progress and a scale-up in the active area, the specific stack costs can be practically halved within 10 years for both types of electrolysis stacks, from about €200/kWdc to below €90/kWdc for AEL stacks and from €380/kWdc to about €220/kWdc for PEM stacks,” the research group emphasized.
The rated current density for both AEL systems is expected to increase from 0.6A/m2 in 2020 to 1A/m2 in 2030. For both PEM electrolyzers, this value is estimated to increase from two to 3A/m2.
Through their analysis, the researchers found that the alkaline electrolysis costs are lower, compared to those of the PEM technology, due to the lower costs for the stacks. “However, depending on the system size, this cost benefit for the AEL systems is almost negated by the need for an additional mechanical compressor,” they further explained. “The compression unit contributes a large part to the AEL system cost as well, but offers strong cost reduction potential by sizing-up to larger capacities, halving the share on the overall costs from 5MW to 100MW system size.”
The cost for the 100MW alkaline electrolyzer is estimated to drop from €663/kW in 2020 to €444 in 2030, and that for the 5MW system to drop from €949 to €726. For the PEM technology, the cost for the 100MW facility should decline from €720 to €500, and that for the 5MW system from €980 to €730.
According to Fraunhofer ISE researcher Marius Holst, the costs of both technologies almost equalize when the effort for downstream compression is also taken into account. “In total, system costs of approximately €400 to €500/kW can be expected in 2030, but decentralized, smaller systems will remain significantly more expensive,” he concluded.

“The restrictions in the northeastern part of Estonia are not new,” a spokesman from state-owned energy company Eesti Energia told pv magazine. “Before, the restrictions have mainly covered wind turbines but now we see restrictions also for solar.”
He also stressed that there is currently no specific regulation on these kind of restrictions in Estonia and that, however, final approval by the Ministry of Defence is needed for the development of solar parks in the northeastern region in Estonia, which is the most suitable in terms of space and grid capacity for the construction of utility scale projects.
“Now, if the Ministry of Defence is of the opinion that national security could be somehow threatened, then it does not give its approval for new solar parks in the region, thus limiting the possible areas,” the spokesperson went on to say.
According to local media outlet The Baltic Times, the Estonian government said that the increase in the level of radio-frequency background radiation caused by new solar parks may reduce the reception distance of received radio signals.
The restrictions will affect, mostly, several projects under development in East-Viru county, where there are several depleted mines and surfaces with low agricultural value.
Estonia had an installed PV capacity of around 130MW at the end of 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The country is currently supporting solar through auctions for large scale renewables and a feed-in premium scheme limited to generators up to 50kW.

ReNew Power, a NASDAQ-listed Indian renewable energy developer, has revealed that it has set up the first wind-solar hybrid project in the Indian state of Gujarat at the Chlor-Alkali unit of Grasim Industries Limited.
The first phase of the hybrid project, with 17.6 MW of commercial-scale wind-solar capacity, commenced operations last week.  An additional 16.68 MW will be commissioned in the fiscal 2022-23 period as part of the second phase. The project is being developed by ReNew Green Solutions (RGS), the B2B arm of ReNew Power. 
ReNew Power will supply electricity for the plant via an open access mechanism, under a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grasim Industries. The two phases together have a total investment of INR 3.82 billion ($51 million) through an equity partnership. 
“As India strives to achieve net-zero by 2070, large-scale adoption of renewables by corporate India is key,” said Mayank Bansal, chief commercial officer at ReNew Power. “With corporates increasingly harnessing renewable energy, ReNew aims to develop around 250 MW of wind-solar hybrid projects in Gujarat for commercial and industrial consumers, as we have just done at Vilayat, Bharuch.”
Gujarat has aggressively supported the corporate adoption of clean energy. It released its solar policy in 2009 and was the first state to announce a hybrid policy in 2018. It has made hybrid plants attractive for investments by corporates by providing incentives such as a waiver on electricity duties.

The EU executive yesterday proposed a package of measures to address global semiconductor shortages which it said have caused factory closures in the bloc for carmakers and producers of health care devices, among other industries.
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
The commission made a recommendation that it work with member states to try and anticipate, and address, semiconductor shortages immediately while the EU Chips Act it has proposed is considered by the European Parliament and member state representative body the European Council.
The legislative proposal includes plans for the EU, member states and third-party nations already involved with EU programs to provide €11 billion to bolster European semiconductor R&D and innovation, as part of a plan to mobilize more than €43 billion of public and private investment to address the shortage. The commission also pledged access to funding for semiconductor start-ups, under the act's proposals.
The commission unveiled its measures on the same day as announcing the success of the latest bond issuance held to fund the bloc's NextGeneration EU Covid recovery package.
A €5 billion bond auction attracted bids for €64.1 billion worth of the 30-year investments and came on the heels of a €2.5 billion issuance last month to take the money raised since the fundraising program began last year to €78.5 billion. The EU wants to raise €50 billion in the first half of this year and has planned four more long-term bond exercises plus monthly auctions of EU-bonds and short-term EU-bills.

US start-up Rondo Energy announced the closing of a $22 million Series A funding round to support its technology, a renewable energy heat battery aimed at reducing the carbon impact of industrial processes. The funding round was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Energy Impact Partners. 
It is estimated about one third of global emissions can be attributed to heavy industry. And about 40% of that, or 10% of global emissions, comes from high-temperature industrial products like cement and steel. 
The Rondo heat battery offers a zero emissions source of industrial heat, storing solar and wind energy at temperatures over 1200°C. The company said it plans to begin manufacturing and delivering systems to customers later this year. 
“We believe the Rondo Heat Battery will prove critical to closing stubborn emissions gaps,” said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “The cost of renewable energy has been steadily falling, but it hasn’t been an option for industries that require high temperature process heat since there was no way to efficiently convert renewable electricity to high temperature thermal energy. Rondo enables companies in industries such as cement, fuels, food and water desalination to reduce their emissions while also leveraging the falling costs of renewables.” 
The system is designed to pull energy from solar, wind, and the energy grid, charging the battery intermittently, but delivering continuous heat. Rondo said the battery bricks are made of safe, widely available materials.
The company claims the heat battery stores energy with 98% efficiency, something that Peter Saundry, physicist and environmental technology professor at John Hopkins University, said was “way too optimistic.” Saunders said if the company can achieve efficiencies around 85-90%, then in his view the company has a “really good technology.” 
High-heat industrial processes need decarbonization alongside other sectors. This process of converting intermittent zero-carbon energy into continuous high heat or energy is an example of “indirect electrification.” Another example would be the production of green hydrogen, like the fuel produced in a partnership between Heliogen, a concentrated solar power facility maker, and Bloom Energy, a hydrogen electrolyzer.

Jusung Engineering will be responsible for developing the manufacturing processes and the equipment for the production of heterojunction products based on 182 mm M10 wafers.
Via the new partnership, Hyunday Energy Solution aims to commercialize heterojunction panels with a power conversion efficiency that is purportedly 23% higher than that of conventional PERC panels.
Jusung Engineering, which supplies equipment for both thin-film and crystalline silicon solar products, said last summer that it has developed an n-type single-crystal HJT solar cell with an efficiency of 24.45%. The result was certified by the Korea Energy Research Institute.

The Quartzsite RV Show is said to be the largest of its kind, drawing some 750,000 visitors to the Arizona desert each year. On display this year were two solar generators for RVs from Jackery, to provide clean energy on the road or while camping.
The generators are lithium batteries with a maximum power point controller (MPPT), AC/DC inverter, and numerous outputs, including USB, car outlets, and traditional wall outlets. The devices can be paired with up to four SolarSaga 100W panels, which feature built-in kickstands for quick setup. Altogether, the devices represent a fully offgrid and portable solar PV kit.
The 100W panels feature monocrystalline solar cells with up to 23% efficiency, said Jackery. The panels are encased with a laminated, splash-proof casing for durability, with zippered holsters to store the cables when not in use. The batteries and panels are backed by a 24- month warranty from Jackery.
The larger SG1500 model on display is a 1,534Wh lithium-ion battery with a stated lifecycle of 500 cycles to 80%+ capacity. Jackery said a fully charged SG1000 can power a 60W TV for 13 hours, an iPhone for 100 charges, or a  60W mini fridge for 17 hours.
