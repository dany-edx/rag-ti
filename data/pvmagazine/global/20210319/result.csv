The International Energy Agency (IEA) this week released a paper highlighting the merits of PVT, declaring the production of solar PV energy combined with energy from the heat transfer provides an increased yield per square meter.
Glen Ryan, co-founder of Perth-based solar PV innovator Sunovate, is among those who participated in the preparation of the Technology Position Paper on PVT and said the hybrid technology has the potential to improve conversion efficiency by diverting the heat away from the modules while utilizing the heat for an alternative purpose.
“Globally, heating typically accounts for more than 50% of final energy consumption, very little of which is powered by renewable energy,” Ryan said.
“PVT allows us to harness clean solar energy, improve PV panel output, and convert the heat removed for application directly such as space heating or enhancing it by combining it with heating appliances such as heat pumps.
“It’s a remarkable combination of technologies that is improving efficiency, output and longevity of PV modules and allowing more applications to access clean energy.”
The IEA said by combining electricity and heat generation within the same component, the technologies can reach a higher overall seasonal efficiency than PV or solar thermal alone.
By day the solar PV modules convert sunlight into electricity. With PVT, a solar thermal collector is added to transfer the otherwise unused excess heat from the PV module to a heat transfer fluid. By night, the technology transforms into a large heat radiative surface that can provide renewable cooling.
The IEA said the solar electricity production of an uncovered PVT module is not less than that of a PV-only module and can even be slightly higher if the collector is operated at temperatures below those of a PV-only module thanks to the thermal energy extracted and used.
PVT collectors can be uncovered, glazed, or concentrating. Depending on their type, PVT collectors can produce heat at temperatures from about -20° to +150°C and serve a wide range of applications.
PVT systems are already being used in residential, agricultural and industrial settings with the IEA saying payback times as low as four years have been observed in hotel case studies in Spain.
The Australian Photovoltaics Institute (APVI) said tests, including those conducted by Sunovate, found yields can more than double compared to PV or solar thermal alone. The efficiency is however dependent on the temperature of the heating application, with pool heating more efficient than space heating, and both are more efficient than hot water heating.
The APVI said the potential for PVT is particularly strong for commercial businesses where heating requirements are elevated during the day, such as agro-industrial processes (greenhouses, dairies) and solar water desalination operations.
The IEA report also indicated PVT provided increased solar PV efficiency due to removal of heat from the modules while the lifespan of the cells was increased due to less thermally induced degradation.
The IEA said PVT can also help address the emerging issues of space and network constraints, noting the hybrid technology uses the same area as a PV or thermal module to provide both electricity and heat, and in some cases cooling.
“PVT systems deliver high-yielding solutions per unit of area and maximize the existing electrical infrastructure through their distributed application,” the IEA said in the report.
The APVI said Australia is already home to a number of PVT technology manufacturers, as well as international distributors, but with 2 million m2 of PVT, that is 270 MW PV and 1.400 GW solar thermal installed worldwide over the past five years, the country has some catching up to do.
Australia had only 547 m2 of installed PVT capacity in 2019, well adrift of pacesetters France (485,000 m2), South Korea (281,000 m2), China (133,000 m2) and Germany (112,000 m2).

The factory will produce wafers with a size of 210mm. The company has invested RMB12 billion ($1.88 billion) in the new production. The facility is expected to begin manufacturing activities by the end of 2022.
The China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) forecasts between 55 and 65 GW of newly installed PV capacity for the domestic market in 2021. The new capacity will consist of 20-23 GW coming from the distributed generation segment and 35-42 GW in the form of utility-scale PV plants. CPIA General Secretary Wang Bohua  also predicted that total global PV installations would grow to 150 GW this year, with a YoY increase of 17% over 2020.
Manufacturer China Glass yesterday identified Fujian Longtai Industrial Co Ltd as the company it plans to take over. China Glass, which itself rebuffed a HK$1.64 billion (US$211 million) takeover approach from Xinyi Glass in December — announced plans to acquire an unnamed photovoltaic and solar glass business last month. The equity and cash required for the controlling stake in Fujian Longtai has yet to be negotiated. A cooperation agreement on the proposed takeover, announced yesterday, gives China Glass exclusivity for 12 months.
State-owned photovoltaic and display manufacturer Luoyang Glass Co Ltd yesterday signed an agreement to acquire a 60% stake in rival Jinma Investment and Kaisheng (Zigong) New Energy Co Ltd, with the capital injection required to be determined. As part of the acquisition, Luoyang will pay the investment management company a RMB100,000 (US$15,400) monthly fee from the date of acquisition for the rest of the year, with an extension beyond that open to both parties. Luoyang has exclusive rights to negotiate the takeover for the rest of the year.
Chinese power group Shanghai Electric has joined forces with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics to set up a hydrogen R&D center. The agreement aims to develop PEM electrolyzed water hydrogen production, accelerating the development of competitive PEM electrolyzed hydrogen products and promoting industrial applications and scenarios. “In 2020, Shanghai Electric's independently-developed fuel cell engine, which boasts a power capacity of 66 kW and can start in cold temperature environments of as low as -30°C, passed the inspection test of the National Motor Vehicle Product Quality Inspection Center,” the company said in a statement. “It adopts Shanghai Electric's proprietary hydrogen circulation system, which delivers strong power and impressive endurance, with the potential to replace gasoline and diesel engines in commercial vehicles.” Shanghai Electric also claims to have already developed green hydrogen integrated energy industry demonstration projects in Ningdong Base, one of China's four modern coal chemical industry demonstration zones.

The new energy technologies and nanomaterials (Liten) branch of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission claims to have developed a low-polluting and low-energy delamination process to recycle photovoltaic panels at the end of their lifecycle.
The technique consists of using a diamond wire to cut through the photovoltaic cells, separating the module's glass front face from the polymer-based backsheet. “Using a laboratory-scale version of the new process, it took just a half-hour to separate the two surfaces — which are only a few hundred microns apart — of a typical one-square-meter panel,” the scientists explained. “The recovered glass can then be recycled using a separate process.”
The French scientists added that a hydrometallurgical treatment can also be used to separate and recover the various metals from the powder produced during the wiring process.
A European project will begin soon to develop industrial equipment capable of processing several modules per hour. “This equipment will use a reel-fed diamond wire so that its wear can be monitored,” the research institute stated. “Solutions that cool the polymer to improve its cutting behavior are also being investigated.”
CEA Tech recalls that, as photovoltaic modules have a lifespan of around 30 years, more than 10 million tonnes of end-of-life or defective products should be recylced in Europe by 2025.
Today, the most widely used recycling solution is to crush the modules and use them as backfill in the construction industry. As for the thermal techniques, they remain expensive in energy and harmful to the environment, according to the CEA-Liten experts, who believe it is urgent to find new recycling solutions to recover metals such as silicon, silver and copper.

Green hydrogen produced in Chile may soon be exported to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, after Chilean Minister of Energy and Mining Juan Carlos Jobet signed a framework agreement with the port's authorities this week.
“The agreement will be key for the development of green hydrogen in Chile since Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe and, through it, around 13% of the goods destined to the European continent enters,” the minister said.
The move is part of the second phase of Chile's hydrogen strategy, which concentrates on exports, after the first phase focused on local consumption.
The Port of Rotterdam is a multi-energy port by nature, working with large oil and gas companies. In addition, it has a port community that integrates more than 3,000 commercial companies in the introduction of fuels and other materials, both within its industrial zone and for final consumers located elsewhere.
The Port of Amsterdam is currently working to establish infrastructure and facilities and thus facilitate the flow of H2 through co-investment and co-development of various large-scale projects. In this regard, the port and Chile's Ministry of Energy will establish a dialogue regarding cooperation to make viable one or more hydrogen export-import corridors between Chile and Europe.
The deal follows the agreement signed with the Singapore Ministry of Energy earlier this month to study the technical and commercial viability of supply routes from Chile and Latin America to Singapore and expand demand in Asian markets.
The Port of Rotterdam Authority recently said the production of green hydrogen was another building block in its sustainability plan. Electricity generated by offshore wind farms off the Dutch coast will likely be used to generate green hydrogen.
In March 2019, the Dutch Institute for Sustainable Process Technology launched the Gigawatt Elektrolysefabriek project, which aims to produce green hydrogen on a gigawatt scale from solar and wind parks. The Netherlands currently generates around 800,000 tons of “grey hydrogen” – produced from natural gas – per year. The Gigawatt Elektrolysefabriek project partners want to lay the foundations for the construction of green hydrogen electrolyzers in the 2025-30 period.
Furthermore, Germany-based Uniper and the Port of Rotterdam Authority plan to produce green hydrogen on the Maasvlakte, which is an artificial extension of the Europoort industrial facility.
Moreover, the Portuguese and Dutch governments signed in September a memorandum of understanding to connect their respective 2030 green hydrogen plans.

This is the main conclusion of the study “Balancing crop production and energy harvesting in organic solar-powered greenhouses,” published in Cell Reports Physical Science and written by scientists at the North Carolina State University in the United States.
In the paper, the academics proposed to use semi-transparent organic solar cells that primarily absorb wavelengths of light that plants don’t rely on. Furthermore, these devices can help manage light transmittance from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR), which has significant impacts on the thermal load of the greenhouse.
The scientists analyzed the growth of red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in a greenhouse equipped with organic solar cells coated with filters that can manage both near-IR (NIR) and long-wavelength (LW) IR. The filters were made with blend films such as FTAZ:IT-M, FTAZ:PC71BM and PTB7-TH:IEICO-4F combined with filters made of the conjugating-based polythiophene polymer PEDOT:PSS.
“The studies were conducted in a controlled environment growth chamber that allows for the comparison of plant growth and development under similar illumination, temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and water and nutrient supply,” the US group explained.
A control group of lettuces was exposed to the full spectrum of white light, while other lettuces were split into three experimental groups that were exposed to light through different types of filters. “The total amount of light incident on the filters was the same, but the color composition of that light was different for each of the experimental groups,” said research co-author Harald Ade. “Specifically, we manipulated the ratio of blue light to red light in all three filters to see how it affected plant growth.”
The experiment showed that lettuce growth proceeded unabated under the solar cells, as the different transmission spectra had no impact on the fresh weight of the plants. “Furthermore, we show that the reduced light intensity reaching the plants reduces the rate of photosynthesis per area, but also increased the leaf area (LA) and leaf number, thereby minimizing the impact on crop yield,” the scientists affirmed. “These results demonstrate the possibility of successfully growing certain crops under semitransparent organic solar cells (OSCs) and highlight that a thorough characterization of crop production is needed to assess crop productivity.”
Their analysis also showed that the organic solar cells contribute to reducing overheating in the greenhouse. “We show that for a greenhouse in Sacramento, California, the number of hours that the greenhouse overheats can be reduced from 280 to 82 h,” they emphasized. “Lastly, using organic solar cell electrodes that can also function as low-emissivity coatings was shown to significantly reduce the heating load of the greenhouse.”
In a study published in February, the same research team said the use of semi-transparent organic solar cells could reduce the carbon footprint of greenhouses by powering the structures in warm and moderate climates. The North Carolina State researchers said semi-transparent cells on greenhouse roofs act as insulators as they reflect infrared light, helping keep the greenhouse warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
More recently, solar-powered greenhouses were developed by researchers from the University of Cambridge, scientists from Canada's Université de Sherbrooke, and Australian start-up ClearVue.

The device measures 1,100 x 890 x 360mm and weighs 110 kg. It offers a reported efficiency of 99.01%, for a European rating of 98.52%. The device also features 1500 V (DC) technology and an ambient operating temperature ranging from -30 C to 60 C.
It is equipped to have up to 16 maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs and its MPPT range is 860-1300 V. The product also comes with IP66 protection, forced air cooling, and can be used in projects at altitudes of up to 5,000 meters.
According to the manufacturer, the inverter can be used with panels exceeding 600 W in power and modules designed with 182mm or 210mm wafers.
“In 2019, our SG225HX shocked the market and so far cumulated over 15 GW shipment worldwide,” said Sungrow Vice President Li Shun. The new SG320HX is redefining the super-high power string inverter, which will help Sungrow  customers to once again lower the levelized cost of energy, he added.
If used in a 100 MW project, the SG320HX would enable cost savings of around RMB 10 million ($1.56 million), or around RMB 0.10 ($0.0156) per watt.
The company will begin mass production of the new devices in the second half of this year. First shipments are expected to be made in September.
*The article was amended on March 29 to reflect that the SG320HX inverter is not an upgraded version of the SG225HX, unveiled in 2019 with a power rate of 225 kW, as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/19/hydrogen-shipping-vs-submarine-cables/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 19, 2021",Hydrogen shipping vs submarine cables,"An international research group has sought to establish which form of energy vector between hydrogen transport and high-voltage submarine cables is the most economical solution for energy transport among countries separated by water.
The scientists stressed that, as a general rule, the relative cost of electricity transmission, both in terms of power and distance, is higher than that for fuel transportation. They wanted to assess, however, if this principle would also apply to hydrogen transported through submarine pipelines or by ships in liquefied and compressed states, noting that transforming hydrogen into electricity does not happen without energy losses, and that hydrogen costs may vary depending on electricity prices. “The main source of losses originates from the electrolysis, regardless of the distance,” they stated. “For long distances, the permeation through the pipeline is noticeable.”
The researchers were also able to assess for the first time under which conditions it can be cheaper than the full electric alternative.
The academics outlined four different scenarios under three different electricity prices of $20/MWh or $5.6 per gigajoule (GJ); $40/MWh or $11.1/GJ; and of 60 $/MWh or $16.7/GJ. “The first two scenarios evaluated the power transmission of 2 GW between two shores separated by either shallow or deep waters,” they specified. “Whilst the remaining two scenarios analyzed the power transmission of 600 MW between an offshore platform, close to an offshore wind farm, and its hinterland, in shallow and deep waters.”
Their analysis showed that the competitiveness of hydrogen transport increases when the distance between the two shores is higher, depending on the electricity price. For example, in the first scenario, called Onshore to onshore shallow waters, at a price of $20/MWh, the cheapest option, for short distances, is the electric cable. When a distance of 1,690 km is crossed, however, hydrogen transport becomes the most competitive solution. At a price of $40/MWh, the hydrogen pipeline becomes the best option after 2,100 km and at a price of $60/MWh the threshold shifts to 2,480 km.
In the second scenario, dubbed Onshore to onshore deep waters, the three thresholds were found to be 760 km, 960 km, and 1,160 km, respectively.
In the first of the two offshore-to-onshore scenarios, called Offshore to onshore shallow waters, the hydrogen alternative becomes more convenient after 3,640, 3,960, and 4,250 km respectively, while in the second Offshore to onshore deep waters scenario, the favorable conditions for hydrogen materialize after 1,990 km, 2,150 km, and 2,320 km, respectively.
“For the offshore-to-onshore in shallow waters and deep waters, with a power rating of 600 MW, the electric cable is clearly the best energy vector,” the research group found. “In contrast, for the onshore-to-onshore scenarios with power rating of 2 with the electricity price at the exporting end cheaper than $40/MWh ($11.1 /GJ), the hydrogen alternative of the liquefied hydrogen ship represents better prospects than the electric solution for distances above 2,000 km for shallow waters and 1,200 km, for deep waters.”
It also concluded that the best LCOE option for short distances is the submarine cable, while hydrogen sent by ship is preferable when the distance exceeds 1,000 km and electricity prices are low. “From the results of this analysis, it can be seen that, under the assumptions made, the compressed hydrogen ship alternative does not present very good prospects of applicability in the future, unless some disruptive technological breakthroughs are made to significantly drop the associated costs or increase the capacity of the compressed hydrogen ships,” the researchers affirmed.
What makes compressed and liquified hydrogen ships still attractive, however, is that they can export energy almost anywhere, and that electrolysis and liquefaction plants are relatively easy to expand compared to marine cables. “I think that hydrogen and electricity have specific niches where each energy vector performs better than the other,” research co-author Rafael d'Amore-Domenech told pv magazine. More chemical energy vectors will probably appear in the future, and depending on the boundary conditions of each application, the “ranking” of the energy vectors will vary, he added. “I do not believe that they will compete. Instead, I think that all the alternatives will harmoniously complement each other in the future green economy.”
The findings of the research were presented in the study “Bulk power transmission at sea: Life cycle cost comparison of electricity and hydrogen as energy vectors,” published in Applied Energy. The research team comprises scientists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Spain's Technical University of Madrid.

AEMO said transmission authorities in South Australia had remotely switched off more than 10,000 rooftop solar systems and almost 30 MW of large-scale solar PV on Sunday afternoon with the state experiencing “near-record minimum demand levels for electricity from the grid” due in part to mild weather conditions, low energy needs from industry and large volumes of surplus electricity from rooftop solar passively feeding into the power system
Australia’s rapid uptake of rooftop and large-scale solar has delivered periods of very low demand, prompting the South Australian Government to last year introduce an initiative that provides transmission authorities with permission to restrict solar PV output as a way of mitigating the threat to the security of the National Electricity Market (NEM). Sunday was the first time the restrictions had been enacted.
With the Heywood interconnector, which links the state’s grid with Victoria, undergoing maintenance and scheduled demand forecast to dip to 400 MW, AEMO instructed transmission company ElectraNet to “maintain grid demand above 400 MW” for one hour during the afternoon.
“On Sunday, South Australia experienced near-record minimum demand levels for electricity from the grid,” an AEMO spokesperson said, confirming minimum operational demand had fallen to 358 MW, just shy of the 300 MW record set on October 11, 2020.
“At the same time, a planned outage of the circuits feeding the Heywood interconnector was taking place.
“To preserve system security in South Australia, AEMO maintained the minimum amount of synchronous generation to maintain system security.
“AEMO also needed to then direct ElectraNet to maintain grid demand above 400 MW from 3 pm local time for one hour.”

This resulted in ElectraNet curtailing a range of larger distribution-connected and residential solar customers, including those through the South Australian Government’s ‘Smarter Homes’ initiatives which mandates all new small business and residential solar PV installations must assign an agent to curtail generation in rare events threatening the security of the NEM.
About 10 MW of distributed solar PV was removed that way for the first time by electricity distributor South Australia Power Networks (SAPN) through registered agents.
Another 40 MW of rooftop solar PV was curtailed through SAPN’s enhanced voltage management system at seven substations and an estimated 17 MW of commercial solar PV was cut off through Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems.
AEMO said the ability to manage large-scale and residential solar customers is vital to support the ongoing transition to a renewable power system and warned system security concerns due to minimum operational demand are likely to become more common..
“Minimum demand events will become increasingly common throughout Australia as we continue to integrate rooftop PV installations,” the spokesperson said.
AEMO said it has been and continues to work with governments, government agencies, market bodies and consumers to support the development of a range of measures that seeks to enable greater amounts of renewable energy in the NEM and maximize consumer benefits.
This includes establishing Australia’s first distributed energy resources (DER) register, conducting engineering studies, trials and modeling to effectively integrate DER, and enhance inverter standards, market reforms and regulations.
In addition, AEMO said it is contributing to the Energy Security Board’s (ESB) post-2025 energy reforms, aimed at progressing a modern regulatory structure that will better support innovative market response to these situations.

In May 2019, the solar industry was faced with a disaster unlike anything ever seen before, when a massive hailstorm passed through West Texas. In the path of the storm sat 174 Power Global’s 178 MW Midway Solar Project, bolted to the ground and pointed to the sky on 1,500 acres near Midland.
Once the storm had passed, the industry learned that it had left behind the largest weather-related single-project loss in its history. More than 400,000 of the plant’s 685,000 Hanwha Q cell modules were damaged or destroyed; insurance losses totaled $70 million, and most everyone involved endured at least a few sleepless nights.
The event served as a wake-up call to the industry. It completely reshaped how weather risks are modeled, how project owners and operators mitigate against potential damages, and how underwriters insure projects against natural disasters.
How was it that the solar industry didn’t see this coming? The answer may be simpler than you might think. Although hailstorms are not new to the wide-open spaces of West Texas, solar projects are especially solar fields on a massive scale like Midway Solar.
It’s more common for solar projects to suffer catastrophic damage from wildfires. After all, much of the early solar market was focused on California, a state with high annual wildfire risk. Once development began to expand to the Southeast, hurricanes, high wind events, and flooding became of more concern.
In short, the rapidly growing industry wasn’t properly prepared for catastrophic hail because it had never before dealt with it.
Now that hail is a known danger, one step to mitigating it as a threat is to know now only where these storms happen but how often. The hail modeling sector has grown rapidly in the two years since Midway. And to better understand the evolution, pv magazine sat down with Peter Bostock and John Sedgwick of VDE Americas. The company provides technical due diligence and engineering services for solar power and energy storage systems.
The two said that historic hail threat prediction models were both general and minimal in nature, with developers relying on basic heat maps to locate what areas had severe hail potential. The two quickly realized that this approach would not be nearly enough, and that modeling needed to be done on a granular, site-specific basis.
“Even at a given location, there’s a size distribution,” said Bostock. “And if you map larger locations, there’s a broader spread to that location.”
To better understand what a future hail event could look like in a specific area, VDE has developed a tool that blends data from human storm spotters as well as from doppler radar.
Spotter data is useful because it can provide tangible context as to the size of the hail as well as its concentration and distribution. Spotter data are typically limited to high-population areas and common travel routes. Neither case applied to the Midway solar project in the expanses of West Texas.
Doppler radar also is used as it scans and tracks weather data constantly, typically at an 11-degree angle towards the sky. This means that the scanning elevation is higher as the distance increases from the radar center. This is better for tracking hail, which forms high in thunderstorms. The radar scans storm conditions and can offer rough predictions of hail size, but even these predictions are not always accurate.
But by overlaying spotter data with radar feedback data and finding correlations between the two, Bostock said that the radar data can be corrected for the likely size and concentration of the hail in real-time, providing a more accurate risk evaluation.
VDE used this approach to develop a tool that can predict the return interval, the likelihood of a certain type of hail occurring, and the expected size of hail across different locations.
As a result, Sedgwick came to the conclusion that preventing another Midway may be easier than first thought.
“When we initially started looking at it,” he said, “we certainly said ‘Oh my God, this situation is horrible.'”
VDE started by looking at how insurance companies addressed the problem from a top-down basis. That meant insurers looked at their actual losses and then used that dollar amount to calculate insurance rates, Sedgwick said. Instead, VDE elected to look at the issue from a different angle, using physics, trigonometry, and impact energy.
Sedgwick and Bostock said that by applying appropriate mitigation elements, operational elements, and equipment installed with appropriate stow management, the effects of hail can be significantly mitigated.
“What that tells me is that the issue is not as horrible as when we first started looking at it,” Sedgwick said.
Some 70% of solar insurance losses in the last 10 years have occurred since 2017, according to a report released by insurer GCube in early March. That reality has caused the insurance market to harden significantly over the past 18 months, with premiums increasing by as much as 400%.
That hardening may actually benefit the industry, however.  Experts who spoke to pv magazine pointed to the Midway catastrophe as an “eye-opening” event for the industry, with other storm events exposing what the GCube report referred to as “the weaknesses of a ‘soft’ and sometimes naïve insurance market.”
GCube asserted that the insurance sector hardening is a sign that the market is in a stronger position to provide coverage for the long haul for the solar energy sector.
For example, some insurers have begun to offer specific hail insurance programs, called parametric insurance. These programs trigger coverage when a measurable hailstorm event occurs that exceeds a predefined threshold. The trigger for coverage and payout is determined by the size of the largest hail that falls on the solar project site.
These policies are defined by their fast payout times, a factor that has long been a hindrance of natural disaster insurance for solar projects. The new policy designs mean that payments can occur anywhere from a week and 10 days after a storm, and without traditional on-site claims adjustments.
In a blog post for insurer Marsh, Michael Kolodner, U.S. power and renewables industry practice leader, outlined three criteria for insurers and PV developers to consider when trying to minimize hail risk.
First is modeling, as Kolodner stressed the importance of understanding each location’s relative exposures as well as the need to assess the frequency and severity of hailstorms to generate credible loss scenarios.
Second, he outlined the value of understanding what hardware should be used in hail-prone regions, specifically the value of trackers. While more expensive upfront, he said that trackers can mitigate a significant amount of hail damage, leading to overall lower losses in an extreme event and a lower long-term levelized cost of energy.
Third, Kolonder said that the market is quickly changing and with it the need for stakeholder communication.
While modules have been the focus of PV hail damage and take the brunt of collisions with the icy projectiles, mitigating damage to a system does not start with the module, but with the tracker.
For industry NEXTracker, this mitigation comes in the form of NX Navigator, a software and smart control system that includes a hail function. This function moves the entire solar array to a safer, 60-degree stow angle.
Kent Whitfield, VP of quality at NEXTracker has found that there is a generally negative correlation between hail size and wind speed, which may seem counterintuitive when thinking about a big storm. However, in severe hail storms with particularly large ice balls, those balls fall more vertically. By stowing the solar panel, it becomes easier to stop the hail from striking the module face straight on.
When it comes to smaller hail balls in higher wind events, the industry is better prepared, due to its experience with hurricanes. That means solar systems and their trackers, have been designed to mitigate damage due to gale-force winds. As a result, they are, already well suited to handle the winds that can accompany small-ball hail storms.
As might be expected, the issue for modules has always been with repeated, large impacts. For individual impacts, many module faces can withstand a single stroke from an ice ball upwards of 40 millimeters (mm) in diameter, or around the size of  golf ball, according to Whitfield, as well as up to 11 strikes of 25 mm hail. By stowing modules, not only is the risk of module face-strikes reduced, but the system is not further compromised by the increased wind speed.
On the hardware side of things, solar modules are designed to meet IEC 61215 and IEC 61646 standards, both of which test a module’s resistance to lab-produced, 25 mm hail. While this may show that the module can survive a pelting with up to 11 individual strikes, Bostock and Sedgwick said that the return interval for such a storm is once every year or two in West Texas.
What’s more, storms in Texas can generate hail much larger than the 25mm testing standard. That brings modules into a realm beyond their tested parameters.
Bostock and Sedgwick also have found that natural hail forms differently than hail generated in a lab. Natural hail generally forms as oblate spheroids, with some variety in shape from ball to ball. More uniform spherical balls are routinely used in laboratory test settings. Natural hail also typically has a lower density (especially when it comes to large hail) than lab-made ice balls of the same diameter. This results in lower energy upon impact than a lab-made hail of the same diameter.
The difference between natural and lab-made hail is not necessarily a bad thing. If the hail used for testing proves to be more destructive on impact and the module still survives, then developers may have greater confidence when it comes to using the product in the field.
It’s all about finding the right size and conditions for testing extreme hail impacts. “There’s a need for module manufacturers to assess what happens in real life when hail meets module and to do that in a much more thorough way than to just simply pass the necessary IEC tests,” said Bostock.
The reason that lab tests required for PV modules do not reflect the reality of hail in Texas and other states is simple: the tests weren’t developed with those areas in mind.
In an interview with pv magazine, NEXTracker’s Kent Whitfield said that the tests were designed when PV largely was economically viable only in California. As far back as 1977, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab recommended that developers looking to bring PV projects to the Great Plains states should prepare for hail up to 38mm in diameter or larger–50% or larger than today’s testing standards–occurring every six to eight years.
“Accepting the way that PV modules are tested today for hail might not be the right thing to do going forward,” said Whitfield. “What we as an industry need to consider is some sort of a differentiation.”
Whitfield said he expects the industry to take an “all-in” approach, in which it takes a collective look at existing testing standards and modifies the severity thresholds in a way that does not penalize all modules.
One last aspect that current testing doesn’t adequately account for is the non-visible damage that modules can suffer during a hail storm. A row of modules may appear unaffected for days or even weeks after the event, but the storm could have caused damage and microcracks at the cell level. Such damage wouldn’t initially be visible, but result in a host of performance issues.
While such damage may be difficult to test for, its cause is well known: kinetic energy. To Whitfield, the solution is ensuring a proper stow strategy that redirects and reduces a hail stone’s kinetic energy on impact. Mitigating and redirecting that energy effectively could reduce the impact damage of hail of all sizes.
In the end, cell-level damage mitigation comes down to monitoring in the weeks or months after a storm. And keep in mind that the mere presence of a microcrack doesn’t necessarily mean anything; it’s how that crack responds to natural heat fluxes and movements during operation that may manifest into a potentially harmful problem.
To Whitfield, the continued expansion of solar energy arrays into extreme hail-prone regions opens possibilities for the module industry. For example, module manufacturers could produce hail-resistant modules specifically for hail-prone areas. Those panels could undergo even more rigorous testing, qualifying them for a special tag or specification that the panels are suited for hail-prone regions.
As solar projects continue to be deployed in hail-prone regions of the U.S., then manufacturers may adjust their manufacturing processes to produce more resilient, that can survive a storm and then get back to the business of generating clean energy from the sun.
