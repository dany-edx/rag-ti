Most recently, India-based KPIT has developed a sodium-ion-based battery technology that it plans to license to prospective partners who could manufacture and commercialize this technology.
KPIT, which has a strong foothold in software development, integration, and validation for electrification programs for major OEMs in the global automotive space, has developed this technology in cooperation with the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) based in Pune. The scientific team made contributions to material synthesis, characterization, and battery testing.
“Lithium deposits are concentrated in very few places in the world and lithium processing is concentrated in one or two countries. That is why about eight years ago we started looking at alternatives to lithium and we wanted to look at those alternatives which were ubiquitously available across the globe and that's why we started working on sodium-ion technology,” Ravi Pandit, chairman of KPIT tells pv magazine.
Thus far, the company has developed multiple variants of its sodium-ion technology with distinct performance characteristics and energy density ranging from 100-170 Wh/kg.
“When we started working on sodium-ion batteries, the initial expectation of energy density was quite low but over the last eight years the energy density has been going up because of the developments that we and other companies have been carrying out,” Pandit says.
The current iteration of KPIT’s sodium-ion cells has an energy density of 110 Wh/kg and feature carbon-based anode and polyanionic cathode.
“We soon realized multiple advantages of sodium-ion chemistry such as power density. You can charge a sodium ion battery 100% percent in less than 20 minutes with 3C charging and still you can get a long life,” Pandit says. “We have been testing the cells for about 4,000 to 5,000 cycles with such aggressive charging. However, in real world you don't have to do 3C charge all the time and you don’t have to charge to 100% all the time so the actual cycle life can be much higher.”
According to Pandit, KPIT also has batteries with an energy density of 135 and even 170 Wh/kg which are showing stable behavior. However, the latter ones have not been run for 3,000 cycles. “We believe that we can even go to way up to 220 Wh/kg with different combinations of anodes and cathodes, which comes quite close to the lithium-iron-phosphate lithium-ion chemistry,” Pandit says.
In addition to power density and long-life perks as well as faster charging than lithium-ion batteries, Pandit also underlines excellent sub-zero and high-temperature tolerance with minimal thermal management as another advantage of sodium-ion battery technology.
“Unlike lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion can be discharged to zero and then safely transported,” he adds.
Sodium-ion technology has several use cases for automotive and mobility, especially for electric two and 3-wheelers and commercial vehicles. It also has promising applications in stationary deployments, such as UPS backups and grid storage, as well as in the marine and defense sectors.
“When we started, we were mostly looking at electric vehicle applications for sodium-ion technology because our key focus is on urban mobility,” Pandit says. “We see great possibilities for this technology is shared transportation, but also in personal vehicles. Combining sodium-ion batteries with fuel cells is particularly interesting for long-distance heavy-duty application.”
Since KPIT has developed the chemistry ground-up, it can readily tune it to different types of applications. “If you were to look at an energy density of 60 or 70 Wh/kg per and at charging at 1.5 C then you can easily expect 20,000 charge-discharge cycles which would make it a great fit for grid-scale storage applications,” Pandit says.
KPIT has already established a network of supply chain partners and is now actively looking for manufacturing partners, also among its OEM clients.
“Our technology was developed as a complete drop-in technology for the lithium-ion batteries, so we will need only small modification in the precursor stage or in the mixing stage to use the same manufacturing lines to produce sodium-ion batteries,” Pandit says. “This means that setting up a manufacturing plant can take anywhere between 10 to 12 months depending on the partner’s state of readiness so that is the time it will take for a launch in a commercial sense.”
According to Pandit, KPIT is already in contact with a company in Germany that does prototype manufacturing on a 10 MW production line and can be expanded to a gigawatt-scale.
“I believe sodium-ion will play a big role in the automotive sector even before 2030 and we’ll see significant scale in two years time,” he says. “In the stationary storage application, the possibilities are huge. Only pumped hydro will be able to match the price point of large-scale sodium-ion batteries.”
Before its latest technology announcement, KPIT was primarily engaged in the work on battery management systems, battery packaging, as well as the overall electric powertrain. In addition, it has also worked on fuel cells, which according to Pandit will be officially launched in the foreseeable future.

Several research projects are ongoing in Africa, North America, and Europe, with a network of researchers sharing information and data.
The HyAfrica project in South Africa focuses on the small-scale exploitation of local resources. The project, led by Prof. Adam Bumby, is currently in the process of identifying potential source sites. It will then work on quantifying estimated resources.
“There is no doubt that natural hydrogen forms by renewable natural geological process under the Earth's surface,” he told pv magazine. “However, the scale at which this production takes place has not been determined. So far, the only place where natural hydrogen is successfully exploited is a single hydrogen-bearing borehole in Mali, which runs a 30kW generator.”
Bumby said that not much effort has gone into the search for natural hydrogen until recent years. However, research activities could break this impasse.
“Our intention is to publish our findings in scientific journals and university dissertations, so the data will end-up in the public domain within the coming years,” he said.
The project falls under the LEAP-RE (Long-Term Joint European Union-African Union Research and Innovation Partnership on Renewable Energy) partnership. The HyAfrica consortium will receive funding until September 2025. Its findings should also be released by then.
Bumby said that the work is being carried out by the University of Pretoria and the University of Limpopo, whose funding is sourced from SANEDI – South African National Energy Development Institute. The other consortium members are the University of Evora (Portugal), the Leibniz Institute for Applied Geophysics (Germany), University of Mohammed Premier (Morocco), the University of Eduardo Mondlane (Mozambique), and the University of Lome (Togo), and the Fraunhofer Institute (Germany).
“Similar hydrogen exploration activities are also taking place on those three African countries undertaken by our consortium partners,” said Bumby, referring to projects in Morocco, Mozambique and Togo.
‘Natural' hydrogen
Current exploration activities in South Africa are still at a very early stage of development. Recent samples taken in Mpumalanga currently fall under the “natural” or “white” hydrogen category. Follow-up field trips and isotopic comparisons of all the hydrogen samples collected will provide a clearer understanding of the geological controls responsible for generating hydrogen in Mpumalanga, said the project members.
“We have measured numerous elevated levels of hydrogen throughout parts of Mpumalanga, but have not yet determined with geological source of that hydrogen, modeled the potential volume of hydrogen that might be produced, or researched how it could be exploited,” said Bumby. “With such preliminary data, it's difficult to predict if and when this research could be developed into producing electricity.”
The mission currently has no plans to commercialize and ship hydrogen to other regions, as it is difficult to contain and transport.
“Our idea in the current project is to use it ‘onsite' (ie at the top of the hydrogen-bearing borehole) for small-scale electricity production,” Bumby said. “Hydrogen can be burned in a tuned piston engine, which can power a ~30kW generator.”
At the moment, the South African national hydrogen roadmap does not include natural/white hydrogen, so it is not considered a commodity. But the HyAfrica project aims to raise awareness among relevant stakeholders that natural hydrogen might be able to contribute in some way to the South African energy budget.
Bumby said that “there are some similarities to natural gas exploration and hydrogen exploration, but a crucial difference is the mobility of these gases.”
Hydrogen is a tiny, buoyant molecule that moves more readily toward the surface, and it is likely that it is more difficult to trap under certain layers of strata than natural gas, because of this enhanced mobility, said Bumby.
“Natural gas exploration often focuses on identification of underground structures, such as arch-shaped anticlines developed in impermeable layers, that could concentrate hydrocarbons below the surface,” he said. “It is not yet known what geological strata and structures might be needed in order to trap appreciable amounts of natural hydrogen.”
Measurement activities are also different with respect to natural gas. The first stage of hydrogen exploration is made much easier by the mobility of hydrogen, said Bumby, adding that the current hydrogen exploration technology is less invasive than the one used to explore for and produce hydrocarbons.
“As hydrogen accumulations are more prone to leak to the surface than hydrocarbons, initial exploration is simply a matter of testing for hydrogen in surface soils, using quite simple, cheap equipment. A narrow (~15mm) shallow (~1m deep) hole is drilled in the soil, and a short probe connected to an industrial hydrogen meter is inserted into the hole,” said Bumby. “Typically hydrogen is only present in soils and in the atmosphere at a concentration of 0.5 ppm (part per million), so readings beyond that baseline value could be indicative of a leaky hydrogen reservoir at depth. More advanced exploration would involve drilling of much larger boreholes (similar in scale to those drilled to extract groundwater): several centimeters diameter and more than 100m deep, in order to try to intercept any trapped hydrogen below the surface. Certainly at this stage, hydrogen exploration is much less costly and disruptive than hydrocarbon exploration.”

Numerous local jobs could be created and Europeans may become independent of imports from regions of the world whose values they do not understand. Unfortunately, it will probably remain an unfulfillable dream for the foreseeable future, a wish on Santa's list that unfortunately went unheeded again this year.
Module prices are too low and show no signs of increasing significantly in the foreseeable future. New goods from the ‘mainstream' and ‘high efficiency' sectors have become cheaper again, even if the trend can be seen to be weakening, at least for high-efficiency modules. Delivery and production volumes have apparently been significantly reduced to avoid a further increase in inventories in Europe. For a few products, demand is already exceeding supply, and deliveries are being postponed until next year. However, the situation is different for PERC mainstream modules. Many retailers and manufacturers still have horrendous inventories that need to be reduced. For this purpose, new low-price offers are placed on the market almost every day.
For this reason, one can currently only come to the conclusion that investments in new European production facilities, wherever they should be set up, are not worthwhile in the foreseeable future. In order to be even remotely competitive in terms of price, European products would have to be subsidized for years. Because new production cannot be set up and scaled as quickly as the race against the omnipresent Asian competition would require. The gap with China is already too great and is increasing every day. The concept of economies of scale no longer works here – other ideas are needed.
The costs for such an undertaking would be immense anyway – with an uncertain outcome. If we fail, our situation will be even more disastrous than before the race between unequal opponents began. I therefore advocate a more creative and intelligent approach. Special applications, products adapted to the rules and needs of the construction industry, and multifunctional systems must be developed and brought to market readiness.
The large manufacturers who focus on efficiency and cost savings find this difficult due to the often complex and regionally different requirements. However, there are already numerous such think tanks, these small and flexible manufacturers of special solutions on the continent. Why not take the small but fine manufacturers out of their niche and support and build them up with the already tight budget until they become a truly competitive industry – for intelligently adapted photovoltaic products outside the mainstream?

“The size of the new record OPV module is 204 cm². The number of cells connected in series is 38,” Andreas Distler, Group Leader OPV Modules at FAU,  told pv magazine, adding that he expects the results to appear soon in the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) champion PV module efficiency chart.
The new result is a jump up from the current record of 13.1 % recorded for a 57-cell encapsulated module by Taiwan-based OPV specialist, Ways Technical Corporation (Waystech) and Nanobit.
In a press release, the team noted that the module is a solution-processed OPV, attributing the efficiency improvement to three aspects of the research project: the active materials used; the laser processing, which reduced inactive areas on the surface, and improved interconnects; and third, the use of simulations to establish a more homogeneous coating, which was done in partnership with a team from Georg Simon Ohm University of Applied Sciences in Nuremberg.
The research team included researchers from Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nürnberg for Renewable Energy (HI ERN), which is part of Forschungszentrum Jülich. “We are currently preparing a paper on the development of this new record module, which will disclose all the technical details,” said Distler.
In 2020, the same FAU team achieved 12.6% efficiency record on a module area of 26 cm2 and 11.7% on a module area of 204 cm2.

The company said in the announcement it would use the funds to accelerate international growth and expand low carbon technologies, especially heat pumps, leading to 3,000 new jobs in 2024.
Octopus Energy Group CEO and founder Greg Jackson said the company began manufacturing and installing heat pumps at the beginning of the year but now, “we now need to drive real scale.”
In September Octopus Energy Group unveiled its first heat pump – the 6 kW Cosy Octopus – consisting of a heat pump, home control system, smart tariff and other features. Jackson said the company had almost doubled its renewable generation portfolio to $7.6 billion over two years.
Australian energy giant Origin Energy, Japanese natural gas distribution company Tokyo Gas, Canadian pension fund Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and British investment firm Generation Investment Management, all invested in this latest round.
The UK Government announced in July 2020 that it would offer £5,000 grants to English and Welsh homeowners to subsidize the procurement and installation of heat pumps. In November this year, the UK Government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero announced applications for the heat pump grant program had surged following a £2,500 grant top-up.
Almost 30,000 heat pump grants have been awarded since the program began in May 2022, according to UK Government data, with 2,652 vouchers awarded recently following the recent top-up.
However, according to consultancy firm WSP, there are multiple laws the UK Government should revise if it wants to install 600,000 heat pumps by 2028.

Construction costs are estimated to be $800 million. The press release does not include details about the length or financial terms of the PPA.
In 2021 the South African government announced it had selected Project DAO among seven others to participate in the Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (RMIPPPP). The program was launched in response to the chronic short-term electricity supply gap affecting the country and its mining sector.
Meanwhile, the South African government trumpeted in August it had awarded project agreements to two wind-and-solar storage hybrid facilities as part of another RMIPPP round. The facilities are estimated to generate 203 MW of combined energy. Earlier this month the government announced it kicked off its most recent RMIPPP round calling for 1.8 GW of solar.
South Africa recorded 5.8 GW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Water management is becoming increasingly important to ensure a reliable supply of potable water and food production amid a changing climate.
Image: Reiner Lemoine Institute
A recent example of water mismanagement occurred in Montevideo, Uruguay, where a state of emergency was declared due to an extreme water shortage in the capital. The state of emergency permitted infrastructure to be extended in protected areas without social or environmental impact assessments. Lack of information raised questions regarding population impacts, the permanent character of infrastructure, water supply security, and compensation for livelihood losses.
The decision process in this emergency exemplified the role water crises can play in a climate-changed world, and should drive global efforts to reconsider water management plans. How will water resources develop? How should we assess current and future water availability for industrial-scale demand? What impact will the coupling of energy and water demand, through green hydrogen production, have and how can we start off well in the development of such projects?
With the Uruguayan crisis as an example, water use should be re-evaluated, improved, and planned with greater foresight. This includes in the development of industrial sites which will place additional water needs on top of the existing challenge of providing water for drinking and agricultural needs. Green hydrogen could play a central role in the energy transition as it could replace fossil fuels to decarbonize the industrial and transport sectors. In addition to renewable electricity, production of green hydrogen also requires water. As a minimum, the production of a kilogram of hydrogen requires 18 liters to 30 liters of water, depending on water quality.
Uruguay is a nation with great green hydrogen potential and an energy cooperation agreement has already been signed between the European Union and the South American state. Two hydrogen projects, spearheaded by German companies Enertrag and Linde, are already in the planning process. Additionally, the H2U project run by Uruguayan state-owned oil refinery ANCAP has identified the potential to generate 200,000 tons of green hydrogen per year for export, powered by offshore wind farms. Realizing that potential would translate to an estimated water demand comparable to that of a Google data center which was recently publicly contested as it would require the same amount of water as that consumed by 55,000 people.
This highlights that new projects should not exacerbate existing water scarcity. The economic development of project sites, including industries that might be attracted by hydrogen infrastructure, should be considered when estimating future water demand. It is imperative to require new industries to achieve a high degree of water recycling efficiency. Total water demand should then be compared to groundwater recharge rates, taking climate change into account.
Water scarcity has high humanitarian impacts and it is important to consider these in decision-making processes. Structural concerns can also accompany international projects. Historically, large-scale extractive industries serving international markets have failed to redistribute profits to local populations while area-intensive facilities can lead to loss of ownership by communities, and “land grabbing.” Joint-benefit models that promise to fund community infrastructure such as schools and hospitals can result in an increased dependence on the new industries funding them. Nations which import the product created by such industries avoid the risks of resource extraction and depletion in their own backyard, externalising existing tensions.
These concerns likely also hold true for green hydrogen plants, which could certainly exacerbate water scarcity. Many nations with green hydrogen potential suffer, or have suffered, from the unjust power structures rooted in colonialism and it is crucial not to reinforce such situations. Green hydrogen projects should benefit importing as well as exporting countries. This should not be limited to economic benefits but should also take into account the needs and sustainable development goals of producing countries, for example in the field of energy.
To ensure sustainable project development, potential green hydrogen exporting and importing countries should be responsible for building capacity, expertise, knowledge, and awareness of the abovementioned concerns. Joint development legislation for green hydrogen production, transport, and trade should also serve the needs of all stakeholders. Taking into account social, environmental, and cultural aspects may take longer than the current top-down infrastructure planning approaches but would create greater acceptance of, and support for sustainable projects.
Given the potential for international water-intensive projects, including green hydrogen plants, to increase water scarcity, policy makers and project developers should take the following actions.
Consider climate change effects in environmental impact assessments (EIAs): Independent EIAs, including for water use, must be mandatory for green hydrogen projects and should be considered in combination with other water users. Projects that can be expected to lead to reduced climate or other environmental resilience in a region should be excluded from state or international funding.
Ensure sustainable project implementation based on participation: Impact assessments should include local voices and the regulatory process should empower civil society to participate in decision making. This can ensure social aspects and opinions are fully considered rather than being given lip service to avoid public opposition.
Prioritise water management and hydrogen use for local populations and essential industries: While Uruguay has a right to water access in its constitution, other countries need to follow suit. Local water use and hydrogen application should be prioritised over export goals.
Foster research interaction with green hydrogen partnership countries: While the European Union is the largest research funding donor globally, only limited resources go to middle-income countries. With a green hydrogen partnership with Uruguay on the horizon, it is important to support bilateral research. Joint research between exporting and importing countries is key to shaping sustainable implementation of green hydrogen partnerships.

The results show that artificial habitats under the panels, or “biohuts,” are very beneficial for aquatic ecosystems.
The first surveys carried out by Ecocean on the 20 biohuts of the 18-hectare Bomhofsplas floating solar park, three years after installation, showed a considerable increase in the presence of aquatic fauna, for both invertebrates and fish.
Biohuts have a nursery function, protecting small fish from predators. They also serve as spawning grounds for fish and habitats for microorganisms and invertebrates.
At the same Bomhofsplas floating solar park, the water quality did not change after the installation of the solar panels. the University of Groningen measured water quality for more than 10 months. These measurements were carried out using sensors placed at different depths in open water and under the panels.
The company's experts also found that dissolved oxygen levels also remain at normal levels. The temperature differences under the panels have even been reduced compared to the open water area. The temperatures of the upper water layer, during warm periods, were lower under the panels and the cooling of the water, during cold periods, also occurred more slowly under the panels.
BayWa re also conducted a study on avifauna at the Weperpolder floating solar farm. Commissioned in 2018, the 1.5-hectare array is located near a natural area. The census campaigns aimed to measure the number of birds and geese before and after the construction of the floating solar park.
Observations indicate a high presence – and comparable to the initial situation – of birds and geese on the lake. Some of them – ducks and seagulls – even use floating photovoltaic installations as a resting place.
“This research effort allows us to improve our knowledge and the design of our parks. A large number of articles are published, but only a few are based on measurements, monitoring or solid scientific bases,” said Constantin Magne, a spokesperson for BayWa re in France.
BayWa re currently has 19 floating solar parks under construction or in operation, or more than 300 MW.

The successful projects from the third tender conducted under the New South Wales government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap have been announced with one solar project, one wind project, two lithium-ion battery energy storage system projects and one advanced-compressed air energy storage system awarded long-term energy service agreements.
The successful projects include the 350 MW Culcairn Solar Farm being developed by Neoen near Albury in the Riverina region and the 400 MW Uungula wind project being built by Squadron Energy near Wellington in the state’s central west.
The long-duration storage projects include a 275 MW/2,200 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system to be built by Ark Energy, a subsidiary of Korea Zinc, at Myrtle Creek near of Casino in northern New South Wales.
Another eight-hour lithium-ion battery, the 49 MW/392 MWh Goulburn River project being built by Lightsource bp at Merriwa in the Upper Hunter Valley, was also successful in this third tender round.
Hydrostor’s 200 MW/1,600 MWh Silver City compressed air energy storage project being developed near the outback town of Broken Hill rounds out the projects to be fast-tracked under the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap incentive scheme.
The government said the five projects are expected to be operational from 2028 and represent AUD 4.2 billion ($2.82 billion) in private sector investment in the state’s renewable energy infrastructure.
New South Wales Energy Minister Penny Sharpe the state has now locked in 5.79 GW of its legislated 12 GW renewable target for generation and 574 MW of the legislated 2 GW target for long-duration storage.
“[New South Wales] is now almost halfway there on our 2030 renewable generation target, and over a quarter of the way there on our long-duration storage target,” she said.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said the results of the latest tender round out a significant year for the New South Wales Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap tender program.
“AEMO Services has delivered three highly successful tenders throughout 2023,” he said, adding that participation in the tenders demonstrates “the market value and fit of our innovative financial contract, which offers projects exposure to market upside and reduces risk and cost to consumers compared to traditional schemes.”
But while pleased with participation levels in the first year of tenders, Verschuer said the state would need to continue development “at or near record levels” to remain on track to meet its minimum investment objectives.
Verschuer said AEMO Services will continue to deliver biannual tenders for at least the next decade.
The five projects announced in the third tender are expected to support an estimated 1,000 jobs over the project lifetimes, AUD 2 billion in local supply chain benefits, and enough generation to power 360,000 New South Wales homes per year.

The European Solar Test Installation of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) certified the result.
“Like the previous performance record, the device has an active surface area of around 9 cm² and an open-circuit voltage of over 1900 mV,” CEA-INES said in a statement. “Most of the efficiency records published internationally are for surfaces of 1cm².”
The scientists said the new result improves on the 27.1% efficiency they achieved for the same kind of cell in June.
“Our research teams are focused on simultaneously seeking the best efficiency and stability over time, on larger surfaces, to demonstrate the feasibility of industrialization as soon as possible,” the statement reads.
CEA-INES did not reveal any additional technical details.
Enel Green Power through its unit 3Sun is betting on an n-type heterojunction (HJT) cell with an efficiency of 25.5% for its new 3 GW solar module factory now under construction in Catania, southern Italy. It recently said this could result in module efficiencies above 24%.
From 2026, Enel Green Power plans to offer even more efficient solar modules based on tandem silicon-perovskite cells. The final products will reportedly reach efficiencies of around 30%.
CEA-INES and Enel Green Power have jointly developed DC/DC maximum power point trackers (MPPT). They are also working on high-efficiency bifacial PV panels. In addition, they achieved a power conversion efficiency rating of 24.47% for a gallium-doped p-type heterojunction silicon solar cell in March 2022.

Thermal energy storage developer Brenmiller Energy has finished commissioning a bGen thermal storage-based co-generation station at the State University of New York (SUNY), Purchase. It is expected to slash around 550 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year.
The project was developed along with the New York Power Authority and partially financed by a grant from the Israel-US Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation. Brenmiller intends to hand over the system to the university after training in mid-January.
The company’s thermal energy storage system essentially uses crushed rocks to store the energy from renewables or the grid, Gideon Sharir, managing director, US, at Brenmiller Energy, told pv magazine USA. The system heats this energy to up to 1,200 F (648.9 C), via internal heaters, and stores it until it is ready to be discharged on-demand in the form of clean steam, hot water, or air, said Sharir.
The SUNY system is part of a combined heat and power system. The project charges using electricity via embedded electric heaters and waste heat from the microturbine’s exhaust, and discharges to heat SUNY Purchase’s recreation center, which is one of the campus’ most energy-intensive buildings.
The project, which “charges” using both exhaust gas and electricity, is a demonstration site that showcases the full array of thermal energy storage capabilities, including its ability to charge with electricity and recovered heat, according to Sharir. It is distinct from the other projects in Brenmiller’s pipeline, which are designed to charge using only electricity from renewables or the grid. As a demonstration project, the SUNY system is relatively smaller in size – 450 kW/400 kWh – although Brenmiller’s other projects typically range from 10 MWh to 100+ MWh.
Turning over the operation of the project is a huge milestone for the company, said Avi Brenmiller, Brenmiller’s chairman and CEO.
“The benefits of our bGen, once demonstrated through this project, could enable broader adoption of our thermal energy storage systems in New York and across the U.S.,” Brenmiller said.
Thermal energy storage can play a massive role in the clean energy transition, according to Sharir.
Industrial heating demand accounts for about 12% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Because thermal batteries can reach extremely high temperatures at a cost that is competitive with natural gas, and are mature and reliable, industrial manufacturers are increasingly looking at them as a decarbonization solution, he said.
“As these technologies continue to gain traction, the thermal energy market is expected to yield trillions of dollars by 2040,” Sharir added.
However, the technology does face certain challenges to scaling up, including complex and outdated grid policies and supply frameworks, he said. On the one hand, market structures must be updated to take advantage of the benefits of thermal energy storage to reduce stress on the grid. On the other hand, regulators must allow thermal energy storage to participate in wholesale markets and access spot prices, he said.
“Overcoming both of these barriers will ensure that [thermal energy storage] can provide flexibility to the grid and cost-effectively enable industrial decarbonization,” said Sharir.

Solar energy production increased in major European electricity markets in the week of Dec. 11 compared to the previous week. The increase ranged from 97% in Portugal to 5.3% in France. The exception was the Italian market, where solar energy production decreased by 0.1%.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's solar energy production forecasts indicate that production will increase in Germany, Italy and Spain during the week of Dec. 18.


In the week of December 11, wind energy production decreased in the major European electricity markets compared to the previous week. The French market experienced the largest decrease with 44%. The Iberian Peninsula and German markets saw decreases of around 1.0%. As with solar energy production, the Italian market was the exception as its energy production increased by 92% with an output of 817 GWh, the third-highest weekly production.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's wind energy production forecasts indicate an increase in production for the French and German markets for the week of Dec. 18, while a decrease is expected for the rest of the analyzed markets.

Electricity demand
During the week of Dec. 11, electricity demand decreased in most major European electricity markets compared to the previous week. The decline ranged from 6.7% in France to 2.3% in the Netherlands. The exceptions were the Spanish and Italian markets, where demand increased by 4.9% and 3.1% respectively. The recovery in demand was linked to the holidays of Dec. 6, Constitution Day in Spain, and Dec. 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, celebrated in both countries.
The drop in demand was related to higher average temperatures compared to the previous week. Average temperature increases ranged from 4.7°C in Germany to 0.1°C in Portugal.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's demand forecasts for the week of Dec. 18, electricity demand will decrease in the markets of Italy, Great Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. On the other hand, an increase is expected in the markets of France, Portugal, Spain and Germany.

European electricity markets
Prices in the major European electricity markets decreased during the week of Dec. 11 compared to the previous week. The exceptions were the MIBEL market in Portugal and Spain with increases of 4.7% and 4.5% respectively. The Nord Pool market in the Nordic countries registered the largest price decrease with 24%, while the IPEX market in Italy registered the smallest decrease with 11%. In the rest of the markets analyzed by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices fell between 14% in the EPEX SPOT market in the Netherlands and 18% in the N2EX market in the UK.
During the second week of December, most of the European electricity markets analyzed had weekly averages below €90/MWh. The exception was the Italian market with an average of €110.14/MWh. In contrast, the Spanish and Portuguese markets registered the lowest weekly averages of €71.30/MWh and €71.32/MWh, respectively. In the other markets analyzed, prices ranged from €80.85/MWh in the market of the Nordic countries to €86.95/MWh in the British market.
On the other hand, the Nordic market registered the highest hourly price of the second week of December, €162.04/MWh, on Dec. 12, from 15:00 to 16:00. Throughout the week, prices on this market gradually decreased until reaching the lowest hourly price of €0.07/MWh on Dec. 17, from 4:00 to 5:00.
During the week of Dec. 11, the decrease in the average price of gas and CO2 emission rights and the decrease in electricity demand in most markets led to lower prices in most European electricity markets. Increased solar energy production in countries such as Germany and France also had a downward impact on prices.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's price forecasts indicate that prices could continue to fall in most major European electricity markets for the week of Dec. 18. Increased solar energy production in the Italian and German markets, along with increased wind energy production in Germany and France, could contribute to this behavior.
 

Brent, fuels and CO2
Brent oil futures for the Front-Month in the ICE market began Monday, Dec. 11, with a slight increase of 0.3% from the previous week's final session. However, on Tuesday, Dec. 12, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement at $73.24/bbl. This price was the lowest for the Front-Month since late June. After Tuesday's decline, prices rebounded over the next two days, reaching a weekly high of $76.61/bbl on Thursday, Dec. 14. Nevertheless, on Friday, Dec. 15, prices fell 0.1% to $76.55/bbl.
Declining US crude oil inventories coupled with rising demand led to price increases in Brent oil futures during the second week of December. In addition, further production cuts agreed by OPEC+ also contributed to the price increases.
As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front-Month, they reached the maximum settlement price for the week of €36.12/MWh on Monday, Dec. 11. This price was 6.4% lower than the last session of the previous week. On Tuesday, Dec. 12, prices fell by 3.9% compared to the previous day to €34.70/MWh. Subsequently, on Dec. 13, they recovered by 3.2% to reach €35.81/MWh, only to fall again in the following sessions to register the weekly minimum settlement price of €33.19/MWh on Friday, Dec. 15. According to data analyzed by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was the lowest since the beginning of September.
In the second week of December, abundant supply and high European storage levels, as well as milder temperatures, led to further declines in TTF gas futures prices.
As for CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, they experienced a decrease of 2.0% on Monday, Dec. 11, compared to the last session of the previous week. On Dec. 13, they reached their weekly maximum settlement price of €68.90/t, an increase of 1.0% compared to the previous day. In the days that followed, prices fell again to their weekly minimum settlement price of €66.35/t on Friday, Dec. 15. This was the lowest price for that year's December reference contract since October 2022.

“Prices for p-type products today are between €0.100 to €0.115 and we think that the magic limit below €0.10 will be reached in Q1 2024,” he told pv magazine. “Stocks will then shrink further and then prices will slowly recover in mid-Q2 2024.”
Van Bellen said these prices are for a minimum purchase of one container.
“Considering the newer types, the price goes toward €0.20/W,” he said.
Van Bellen said the number of modules stockpiled in European warehouses is lower than commonly thought. He questioned the amount announced by Norwegian research firm Rystad Energy in July, when it said 80 GW of solar modules were still unsold.
 “Assuming 400 W panels, 80 GW is the equivalent of 240,000 containers,” van Bellen said. “There are now 40 tier 1 manufacturers and no one we speak to has more than a few hundred to sometimes several thousand containers. Non-tier-1 manufacturers have up to several dozen. The medium-sized distributors have fifty to one hundred containers, and the large distributors have one hundred to two hundred and fifty. If we add up all the findings and inquiries, we arrive at 50,000 to 80,000 containers.”
Van Bellen said that Search4Solar doesn't have warehouses or stocks, but it works with the stocks of manufacturers, distributors, and installers.
“This means we are kept well informed and therefore have an accurate insight into European stocks,” he said.
He said that manufacturers will likely become more careful in the future about the amounts of stock they send to Europe.
“It is difficult to predict whether there will be a similar ‘normal' stock level in 2024,” he said, noting that distributors and installers will also probably purchase more carefully. “But at times of scarcity things will go back to normal. It remains a matter of supply and demand.”
Search4Solar claims to have approximately 8,000 registered members throughout Europe.
“Search4Solar is in terms of business model comparable to Bol.com or Amazon,” said Van Bellen.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/19/oci-cubicpv-announce-1-billion-silicon-supply-deal/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOUTH KOREA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 19, 2023","OCI, CubicPV announce $1 billion silicon supply deal","From pv magazine USA
Silicon solar wafer manufacturer CubicPV and South Korean silicon producer OCI announced an eight-year supply agreement in which Cubic becomes OCIM’s first US customer for its low-carbon, US-compliant silicon.
The contract, which Cubic reports is valued at approximately $1 billion, establishes a commitment for an annual supply volume by OCI, providing Cubic with the polysilicon it needs in order to begin manufacturing at its US plant
One year ago CubicPV announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the US Inflation Reduction Act, Cubic reports that the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain as well as create 1,500 new direct jobs.
The silicon supply from OCI reportedly satisfies US law, helping CubicPV to produce domestic silicon wafers to serve the US solar industry. Cubic reports that during the past six months it has produced “significant wafer volumes” using OCIM silicon, which meet or exceed customer specifications.
“This agreement with one of the world’s foremost leaders in polysilicon production is testament to our manufacturing capabilities and the progress against our US manufacturing plans,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO of CubicPV. “OCI’s high-quality, US-compliant silicon is in extremely high demand, and we are fortunate to lock-in our supply with a trusted supplier.”
Under the terms of the agreement, OCI will begin to provide silicon in 2025 from its manufacturing facility, which OCI reports is powered by clean, hydroelectricity.
CubicPV was formed from the merger of Hunt Perovskite Technologies and 1366 Technologies, a company that was founded in 2008 and headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts. 1366 Technologies was known for its direct wafer technology, which forms wafers directly, using molten silicon, instead of silicon ingots sawn into wafers. The advantage is less loss because it uses a kerfless wafer production that does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers, a time-consuming process that wastes material as silicon dust. Instead, 1366’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon.
CubicPV intends to produce M10 and G12 n-type wafers in its facility in the United States. The exact location has not yet been disclosed.
