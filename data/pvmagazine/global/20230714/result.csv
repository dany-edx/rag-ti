They say that between 64% and 69% of the hydrogen network could reuse gas pipelines and that expanding both the hydrogen network and the power grid would help meet net-zero emission targets, cutting costs by 9.9%, or €72 billion per year.
PlasmaLeap Technologies has showcased its green ammonia technology, a new plasma-driven path to ammonia synthesis, to Australian authorities. The ammonia reactor uses only air and water in plasma activation, leading to nitrogen oxides in solution, then used in electrochemical conversion to produce ammonia. “PlasmaLeap Technologies is on track to achieve energy efficiency rates of 20 kWh/kg ammonia in its large-scale reactors by the end of 2023,” said the Australian startup, adding that the technology provides on-demand zero-emissions ammonia feedstock for agriculture.
Ireland has published its national hydrogen strategy, focusing on hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors. “Prior to 2030, hydrogen will be produced from grid-connected electrolysis from surplus renewables,” said the Irish government, adding that the country will work on a 2 GW target of offshore wind for renewable hydrogen production by 2030. Heavy-duty transport applications are anticipated to be the first end-use sectors to develop, followed by industry and flexible power generation.Aviation and maritime are expected to be large high-priority end-users, but these sectors will take longer to develop, the government said. Industrial heating from hydrogen is expected to start in 2033 and hydrogen exports after 2038.
HPS Home Power Solutions has inaugurated the “world’s first grid-serving solar hydrogen house” with a full thermal and electrical supply near Berlin. Built as part of the “FlexEhome” research project funded by the German government, the house tests grid-serving performance, said said HPS Home Power Solutions. “Electricity is only given to or taken from the grid when it serves the grid,” it added, noting larger storage capacity compared to batteries and loss-free storage over longer periods.
The European Commission has published a call for expression of interest to set up a list of independent experts to assist the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking for tasks concerning the European Hydrogen Safety Panel. “The European Hydrogen Safety Panel will be composed of a multidisciplinary pool of experts (15-20 approx.) grouped in small ad-hoc working groups (task forces) according to the tasks to be performed and expertise,” said the contracting authority.

The CNY 8 billion Guohua HG14 project will be installed at a water depth of 1 meters to 4 meters, 8 kilometers off the coast. Monocrystalline 550 Wp PV modules will be used, along with a 220 KV substation to connect to the local grid. The entire PV plant is expected to generate 1.652 TWh of clean electricity per year when fully operational, meeting the electricity demand of about 550,000 households per year.
Eging PV has announced its performance forecast for the first half of 2023. The company expects to achieve operating income of about CNY 4.4 billion, around $611 million, in the period with a year-on-year increase of 27%. The net profit attributable to the owners of the company is expected to reach CNY 280 million to CNY 320 million, an increase of 1,086% to 1,255% compared to the first half of 2022. Eging said the main reason for the performance increase is due to rapid growth of module sales resulting from growing market demand and improvement of profit margin, which benefits from a drop in polysilicon prices.
JA Solar has announced a new private placement plan to raise around CNY 9 billion to meet its capital requirements for three major capacity expansion projects. It will inject around CNY 2.7 billion in its ingot casting and wafer cutting projects, with an annual capacity of 20 GW in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. It will also put around CNY 2.33 billion into cell production and 5 GW of annual module production in Qujing, Yunnan province. It will use around CNY 1.5 billion for a solar cell project with an annual capacity of 10 GW in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. It said the remaining CNY 2.4 billion will be used to shore up its working capital.

They considered two different characteristics of the feasibility of agrivoltaic systems: the potential of PV systems and their influence on the underlying farmland. They focused on three different setups: optimal tilted, horizontal single-axis tracking, and vertical bifacial.
The team developed a model that simulates the shadows on solar panels and on the ground, allowing to accurately analyze the reduced production output due to shadow losses for each simulated hour, rather than just assuming a general loss factor.
They found that the axis tracking setup produces a higher electricity yield, but when taking into account the daily generation patterns of the different configurations, the vertical bifacial produces a higher price-weighted electricity yield for some countries.
Their target was to maintain at least 80% of the land suitable for crops. In this case, for the high-radiation demand crops, the annual electricity yield for the tilt and bifacial vertical configurations is similar and limited to 30 kWh/m2. This corresponds to a capacity density of around 30 W/m2, which they used to estimate the potential for argivoltaics in different European regions.
“The potential for agrivoltaic is enormous as the electricity generated by agrivoltaic systems could produce 25 times the current electricity demand in Europe,” the researchers said in “Comparative analysis of photovoltaic configurations for agrivoltaic systems in Europe,” which was published in Progress in Photovoltaics. 
Overall, the potential capacity for agrivoltaic in Europe is 51 TW, which would result in an electricity yield of 71,500 TWh/year, the researchers calculate. Their analysis also finds that the eligible area is distributed quite unevenly across Europe, with some countries, such as Norway, having as little as 1% of their total area suitable for agrivoltaics. In other countries, such as Denmark, this percentage is as high as 53%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/14/indias-solar-glass-opportunity/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 14, 2023",The solar glass opportunity in India,"From pv magazine India
pv magazine: What is the current demand and supply for solar glass production in India?
Gautam Shahi: Currently, India can manufacture about 1,000 tonnes per day of solar glass, which is adequate for module production of 5-6 GW.
The country’s overall module production capacity, however, is 38 GW.
Hence, there is a massive demand-supply gap, with domestic production meeting only 15% of the solar glass requirement and the remaining imported from China.
For adding 35-38 GW of solar module capacity in the next three years or so, our solar glass capacity has to expand by 7-8 times to meet the demand.
pv magazine: What’s the potential for growth?
Gautam Shahi: Currently, our country has installed a solar power generation capacity of 66 GW, which the government targets to increase to about 300 GW by 2030. This will require substantial capacity addition in modules
We believe that for adding 35-38 GW of solar module capacity in the next three years or so, our solar glass capacity has to expand by 7-8 times to meet the demand.
pv magazine: Do you think the government policies are conducive enough to support local production and provide a level-playing field to domestic manufacturers?
Gautam Shahi: The government’s focus on ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, along with the impetus for module manufacturing through Production Linked Incentive (PLI) and Approved List of Models and Manufacturers schemes, will encourage domestic production in a big way.
Earlier, most of the modules, including glass, were imported.
The imposition of import duty on solar panels has fuelled module manufacturing in India, which will increase domestic consumption of solar glass as well.
pv magazine: What’s the case for new entrants?
Gautam Shahi: Getting the cost right, ensuring that the variability in the raw material, etc is being absorbed in the final product in the market, upfront high capital costs and technology have traditionally been some of the constraints for new players entering solar glass manufacturing.
Some of the existing large players are global companies and already have a good presence in solar glass outside India. Globally, from the technology perspective, they already had that technology but then the module production itself was in a very nascent stage in India. Now that a large solar module capacity has been established in India, the local demand for solar glass is also increasing and is likely to increase further.
However, with discontinuation of import duty on solar tempered glass last fiscal, the momentum on domestic capacity addition will remain slow. The government’s initiative to restrict imports or improvement in efficiency of domestic players to compete with imports will be crucial to kickstart the capacity addition for solar glass in India and will be a key monitorable.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/14/thermoacoustic-heat-pump-prototype-for-residential-building-heating/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 14, 2023",Thermoacoustic heat pump prototype for residential building heating,"A German-Chinese research group has designed a new heat-driven thermoacoustic heat pump (TAHP) system for residential heating that is claimed to offer a complementary solution to the existing heating methods.
“Our system can be used for applications such as waste heat recovery, solar cooling, and air conditioning in developing regions,” the research's corresponding author, Jingyuan Zu, told pv magazine.
The new system uses medium/low-grade heat sources such as solar, geothermal energy, and waste heat. “This feature is particularly advantageous for remote areas where electricity is not readily available,” the scientists emphasized. “Additionally, TAHP systems are characterized by their versatility in heat source utilization and high energy efficiency.”
The researchers stressed that, currently, TAHPs are still far from reaching commercial viability, although their “simple construction” indicates that their costs may be competitive. The novelty of their work consists of designing a single-unit direct-coupling thermoacoustic heat pump system, which they said is a TAHP typology that is intended to minimize complexities and performance issues.
The proposed TAHP design includes a single direct-coupling energy-conversion core unit and a phase-shifter unit, with the core being an engine stage and a heat pump stage. “The engine stage includes a heat-sink heat exchanger (SHXe), a regenerator (REGe), a heating heat exchanger (HHXe), and a thermal buffer tube (TBTe),” the group explained. “The heat pump stage consists of a cooler, which includes a heat-sink temperature heat exchanger (SHXh), a regenerator (REGh), a heat-source heat exchanger (HSHXh), and a thermal buffer tube (TBTh).”
The phase-shifter unit relies on two resonators (RT1 and RT2) and a cavity (CT), and it is used to achieve suitable acoustic matching.
The heat pump activates the self-excited thermoacoustic oscillation when the axial temperature gradient across the regenerator reaches a certain critical value. It then uses acoustic power to drive the heat pump stage, which transfers heat from the heat source to the heat sink. The HHXe is then heated by the medium/low-grade heat source, while the HSHXh is cooled by the air. Meanwhile, the SHXs maintains the desired indoor heating temperature via the circulating water.
The scientists tested the proposed system configuration through a series of numerical simulations using the Sage software, which they said is able to solve the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy in the gas domain. They then validated the results of the simulations by building a two-stage thermoacoustic heat pump system prototype.
A series of tests shows that the prototype is able to achieve, in typical heating conditions, a heating capacity of 5.7 kW and a coefficient of performance of 1.4, with a heating temperature of 300 C and a heat-sink temperature of 55 C.
“The introduced TAHP system demonstrates satisfactory heating performance under conventional heat pump operating conditions, capable of delivering an output heating capacity ranging from 3 kW to 7 kW, with a COP ranging from 1.28 to 1.42, when the heat-source temperature is 7 C and the heat-sink temperature falls within the range of 50 C to 70 C,” the researchers explained. “When considering both the energy and environmental savings, a total cost reduction of €1,629/year can be achieved.”
The heat pump concept is presented in the paper “Thermoacoustic Heat Pump Utilizing Medium/Low-Grade Heat Sources for Domestic Building Heating,” published in Energy and Built Environment. The research team is formed by academics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany and the University of Chinese Academy of Science.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/14/reusing-silicon-from-end-of-life-photovoltaic-modules-for-battery-anodes/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 14, 2023",Reusing silicon from end-of-life photovoltaic modules for battery anodes,"Scientists led by the Kunming University of Science and Technology in China have proposed to reuse silicon from discarded solar cells to develop silicon-carbon composite anode materials that could be used in battery anodes.
“The purpose of our work was to propose a simple and effective recycling method aimed to realize the value-added reuse of silicon materials in end-of-life PV modules,” the research's lead author, Shaoyuan Li, told pv magazine. “According to current conventional technical methods such as acid and alkali leaching, a tonne of end-of-life PV modules can recover 40 kg silicon material, which can generate a net income of $104.9. If the recycled silicon material is combined with graphite using a simple ball milling process to obtain a silicon-carbon composite anode, it can generate a revenue of $1,883.”
In the study “High-performance silicon carbon anodes based on value-added recycling strategy of end-of-life photovoltaic modules,” published in Energy, the researchers explained that the waste silicon powder (W–Si) needed for the battery anodes was obtained by pulverizing solar cell fragments with a vibration mill.
The cells had been previously mechanically dismantled from the modules and then cut into 6 mm x 6 mm fragments. These fragments were then soaked in a toluene solution for 24 h to dissolve the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant. “To further remove EVA, the EVA-wrapped cell fragments were placed in a tube furnace for pyrolysis at 550 C for 2 h under the argon atmosphere,” they said. ” Deionized water and ethanol were used for ultrasonic cleaning several times to obtain solar cell fragments.”
With these fragments, the research group developed the waste silicon powder by combining the recycled silicon with graphite using a simple ball milling process. The resulting composite material, called W-Si-rM@G, reportedly showed remarkable electrochemical performance.
“It had an initial discharge capacity of up to 1,770 mA h g-1, maintained a good specific capacity of 913 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g-1, and the average Coulombic efficiency reached 98.99%, which was only a 0.24% capacity loss,” Li explained, noting that the use of graphite created a buffer space for the volume expansion of silicon, which enhanced the cycling stability of the material. “Graphite had good contact with silicon particles, and the introduction of graphite greatly enhanced the electrical conductivity of the silicon material.”
Looking forward, the scientists said additional work is needed to build up a full and efficient value-added recycling industry for end-of-life PV modules, stressing the current difficulties of setting up profitable businesses in this sector without public support. “The recycling of end-of-life PV modules has certain economic feasibility, but it is not economical enough to maintain the smooth operation of an enterprise,” they stated.

These variations were driven by unusually persistent low pressure in the Great Australian Bight. This system set up persistent westerly winds that dragged cold and moist air from the Southern Ocean into south-east Australia. However, the Great Dividing Range along the east coast of the continent forms a natural barrier, which dries out these westerlies, giving rise to broadly sunny conditions across eastern New South Wales – great for solar production.
Australia has very high rooftop solar penetration, with over 17 GW of installed capacity across more than a quarter of households according to energy.gov.au. These installations are concentrated in the state capital cities, and so weather conditions in Melbourne and Sydney have an outsized impact on behind-the-meter generation.
Behind-the-meter rooftop solar totals from the Solcast API show that this weather pattern is continuing into July. In Victoria, inconsistent and cloud-affected conditions are causing peak daily solar generation to drop to as low as 25% of nameplate capacity. In contrast, New South Wales is experiencing steadier solar performance, with peak daily generation consistently between 40-50% of nameplate capacity

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Japan’s largest petroleum company, Inpex, says it will buy 50% of Enel Green Power Australia (EGPA) in a transaction valued at about AUD 654 million (€450.4 million), including approximately $230 million of debt.
Inpex, which operates the Ichthys LNG plant near Darwin, said the purchase will be made through its newly established subsidiary, Inpex Renewable Energy Australia. In a statement, Inpex said that upon the finalization of the transaction, it expects to jointly control EGPA, overseeing the company’s current renewable generation portfolio and continuing to develop its project pipeline.
“This ensures EGPA will continue to drive the energy transition underway in Australia, accelerating its contribution to achieve the country’s net zero target,” said Inpex.
EGPA’s operational assets include the 34 MW Cohuna Solar Farm in Victoria and its 51% stake in the Bungala 1 and Bungala 2 solar farms, which deliver a combined 220 MW of generation capacity into the grid in South Australia. It has also started building the 93 MW Girgarre Solar Farm in central Victoria and the 76 MW Flat Rocks wind farm in Western Australia.
Enel said it is also developing “a significant portfolio of wind, solar, storage and hybrid projects across Australia, alongside expanding its activities in innovative solutions within its retail and trading operations.”
Earlier this year, it said that it had secured initial approvals from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for a 96 MW solar farm and 20 MW battery energy storage system to be constructed at Quorn Park in the central west of New South Wales. It has also announced proposals for a solar and battery hybrid project in Bouldercombe, Queensland, and the retrofit of battery storage at Bungala.
Enel said the transaction is in line with its current strategic plan, which “envisages the implementation of partnerships in certain businesses and geographies to enhance value creation.” The closing of the sale remains subject to certain conditions, including clearance from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and Antitrust authorities.

PUC has approved Form Energy’s construction of a 10 MW/1 GWh iron-air long-duration energy storage facility for Xcel Energy. It is scheduled to be built on the site of the former Sherburne County Generating Station, which is a coal-fired generating plant on the banks of the Mississippi River. The project will replace a facility previously capable of delivering over 2.2 GW of coal-generated power.
Xcel plans to start construction in mid-2024, aiming to bring the site online by mid-2025. The project proposal submitted to PUC has been largely redacted, concealing many details, including specific cost information, from the public. This is somewhat ironic, given the “public” nature of the utilities commission.
The filing does disclose that the project’s location on a brownfield/coal site qualifies it for an additional 10% tax credit adder under the US Inflation Reduction Act. The filing also implies that the project might also be eligible for a 10% domestic content tax credit adder, as Form Energy has expressed commitment to ensuring their product’s qualification. In a recent development, Form Energy announced the establishment of a factory in West Virginia.
According to a different Minnesota PUC docket, a white paper from Form Energy (Docket No. ET-2/RP-22-75), prepared as part of the slower-progressing Cambridge Energy station, provides insights into the cost inputs for the financial modeling tools (see table below). Form Energy estimates the cost of iron-air energy storage hardware, under the “All-in Capital Cost,” to be between $1,700 and $2,400 per kW, with operating costs of $19/kW per year.
Although the hardware costs are two to three times higher due to its unique nature (100-hour battery capacity), Form Energy projects the operating costs to be less than half of those for eight-hour lithium-ion batteries.

Solar4America, a wholly owned subsidiary of SPI Energy, plans to begin manufacturing N-type heterojunction (HJT) solar cells in the United States.
This follows the company’s January announcement to increase solar module production to 2.4 GW at its factory in Sacramento, California. While the US Inflation Reduction Act has thus far incentivized many module manufacturers to begin production in the United States, cell and wafer manufacturing has yet to ramp up.
“The production of HJT solar cells aligns with our commitment to providing cutting-edge renewable energy technology while reducing carbon footprints globally,” said Denton Peng, chairman and CEO of SPI Energy.
HJT uses N-type monocrystalline silicon as a substrate, depositing silicon-based thin films with unique characteristics and transparent conductive films on the front and rear surfaces. By combining the benefits of crystalline silicon and amorphous silicon thin-film technologies, the company reports that HJT technology offers excellent photo absorption, passivation effects as well as exceptional efficiency and performance. Key advantages of HJT solar cells include enhanced conversion efficiency, superior energy yield, reduced degradation rate, improved weak light performance, and it is adaptable to thinner wafers.
Solar4America plans to begin manufacturing HJT solar cells in the United States by the end of 2024. This announcement adds to the company’s manufacturing plans, which includes not only cell but also wafer manufacturing.
Last year, SPI Energy registered its US solar wafer manufacturing business, SEM Wafertech, for production of wafers starting this year with initial capacity of 1.5 GW, with plans of expanding manufacturing capacity to 3 GW in 2024. At the same time, SPI Energy hired Franz Feuerherdt as vice president of sales and marketing to lead the Solar4America module production business. Feuerherdt joined Solar4America from Mission Solar Energy, and held prior roles at Flex and SolarWorld.
Formed in 2006, SPI Energy is based in McClellan Park, California. It went public in January 2016 and its EV affiliate, Phoenix Motorcars, went public in January 2022, with the companies trading on the Nasdaq.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/14/mixed-price-signals-for-solar-wafers-narrowing-spread-between-m10-and-g12-wafer-prices/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JULY 14, 2023","Mixed price signals for solar wafers, narrowing spread between M10 and G12 wafer prices","This week, the Mono M10 wafers trended flat after last week’s price notch upwards, reporting in at $0.351 per piece (pc).  Several sources verified this week that the price of Mono M10 wafers has grown to the level reported by OPIS last week, which is approximately CNY2.85 ($0.40)/pc.
One of the factors contributing to the price increase is the decrease in wafer stockpiles, with some inventory shifting to cell producers’ plants. Cell makers have increased wafer purchases in the previous few weeks when wafer prices were low. Fewer than 1 billion pieces of wafers are currently stockpiled at wafer facilities, equivalent to three to five days’ worth of production and regarded as a low inventory level, according to a source from a large wafer manufacturer.
Additionally, manufacturers are trying to recover profit now by boosting prices as the year’s second half starts, and so improve this period’s financial report, a source explained.

On the other hand, the prices of Mono G12 wafers saw a week-on-week fall of 5.75% to $0.475/pc, marking their lowest point of the year, according to OPIS' assessment.
According to a source from the wafer segment, the price reduction of Mono G12 wafers appears to be a pricing strategy rather than a price adjustment in response to supply and demand in the market. The price of G12 wafers per W must be comparable to or even lower than the price of M10 wafers per Watt if manufacturers are to emphasize the cost advantage of G12 wafers and grow G12’s market share.
While polysilicon prices are low, wafer manufacturers have accelerated their purchases of the material and raised operating rates, with the typical operating rate of wafer businesses having climbed to 80–100%, several sources claimed.
According to a source, overall wafer output is anticipated to reach 52 GW in July based on an average operating rate of 85%, representing a month-on-month growth of roughly 15%. Another source claimed that since at least two major wafer producers will release new capacity in the second half of this year, wafer market fundamentals will remain dominated by oversupply in the near future.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

It said it will use the funds to support its “high-efficiency onshore PV module production in Europe” (HOPE) project, including a 3.5 GW solar cell and module factory. It will probably built the facility at an unspecified location in Spain.
“The project is among the eleven selected candidates for EU funding in the funding segment ‘Clean Tech Manufacturing.' According to the EU Commission, a total of 239 projects applied in all funding segments, of which 41 were successful,” Meyer Burger said in a statement. “In the area of photovoltaic production, the Norwegian company Norsun was also successful with a project to expand wafer production. Norsun and Meyer Burger are already in a supply relationship for solar wafers for Meyer Burger.”
Meyer Burger signed a long-term wafer supply contract in February with Norwegian wafer manufacturer Norsun. The contract provides for rising purchase quantities as Norsun expands its wafer production capacity, in line with Meyer Burger's growth plans.
In October 2022, Meyer Burger also revealed plans to raise CHF 250 million ($291.1 million) via an ordinary capital increase, by issuing new subscription rights. The company is now targeting around 3 GW of new annual production capacity by the end of 2024, including 1.4 GW of module production capacity in Freiberg, Germany. It is also exploring plans to manufacture solar cells in the United States

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/14/desalinated-ocean-water-for-green-hydrogen-production/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 14, 2023",Desalinated ocean water for green hydrogen production,"From pv magazine USA
While electrochemical batteries can serve many of our needs from mobile devices to vehicles and grid-scale storage, applications such as heavy trucking and industrial processes require huge amounts of energy to be dispatched, making hydrogen an attractive option.
More than 80% of the cost of hydrogen goes toward the electricity needed to split the water atom in a process called electrolysis. When paired with low-cost, emissions free electricity sources like solar or wind, hydrogen production is considered “green hydrogen.”
Ohmium, a California-based company that develops green hydrogen electrolyzers, has found a partner in Aquastill, a provider of desalinated water systems. The two will work together to produce green hydrogen fuel from desalinated ocean water.
Aquastill’s desalination device uses waste heat as an input, and will make use of residual heat from Ohmium’s electrolysis process. This offers co-benefits in cooling Ohmium’s system while powering desalination.
The two companies are currently developing how to optimize integration of the systems, which are highly modular and can be scaled from megawatt to gigawatt scale. Offshore wind energy was identified as a potential electricity source for the modular system, and solar is often a great match due to its high modularity and ability to be installed on bodies of water.
“Utilizing Aquastill’s membrane technology to efficiently produce green hydrogen from seawater has the potential to be a game changer for companies operating in coastal or rural regions that want to affordably and sustainably decarbonize,” said Arne Ballantine, chief executive officer of Ohmium International.
Ohmium’s second generation proton exchange membrane electrolyzer produces at a rate of 9.0 kg per hour with a four-second ramp-up time. It is compatible with three-phase with 480 VAC/60Hz, 415 VAC/50Hz, or 400VAC/50Hz with optional DC integration.
The US Department of Energy (DoE) is targeting lower green hydrogen costs. Launched in 2021, the Hydrogen Shot program has a “1-1-1″ goal, targeting costs of $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade. In 2022 renewable energy-fueled hydrogen cost roughly $5 per kilogram, so this target represents a cost reduction of 80% in one decade.
The DoE's investments in green hydrogen are on the rise. In 2021, it supported $285 million in funding, and in 2022, the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request included the application for $400 million in funds for green hydrogen development.
