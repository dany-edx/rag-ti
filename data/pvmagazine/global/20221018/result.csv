The team obtained readily available lanthanum salts and trimesic acid, and these two precursor materials then self-assembled themselves into nano-scale “rods.” These nanorods were then impregnated with platinum at 900 C. The resultant platinum-lanthanum nanoparticles were then stress-tested for their performance in a fuel cell. “The resultant Pt5La alloy catalyst exhibits enhanced activity with half wave of 0.92 V and mass activity of 0.49 A·mgPt−1, which strictly follows the 4e transfer pathway,” the researchers wrote in “Ultra-stable Pt5La intermetallic compound towards highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction,” which was recently published in Nano Research. They said that the catalyst exhibits superior stability after 30,000 cycles of the accelerated stressed test, with mass activity retention of 93.9%.
Vattenfall, Swedish steelmaker SSAB, and Swedish state-owned miner LKAB have revealed new research showing the promising properties of hydrogen direct reduced sponge iron (H-DRI). Their HYBRIT project focuses on the use of hydrogen to produce ore-based steel, instead of coking coal. “Hydrogen-reduced carbon-free DRI produced with HYBRIT technology in the pilot plant is highly metallized and has superior mechanical and aging properties compared to direct reduced iron using fossil-based reducing gas such as natural gas,” said SSAB. The partners said they aim to start industrial production of H-DRI by the end of the decade, starting with a pilot facility in Gällivare, Sweden.
Salzgitter and Sunfire have completed the EU-funded GrInHy2.0 project with “record production” of roughly 100 tons of green hydrogen to make green steel. They have operated a high-temperature electrolyzer from Sunfire with an electrical connected load of 720 kW on the premises of Salzgitter Flachstahl since 2019. The partnership between Sunfire and Salzgitter is set to continue beyond GrInHy2.0. 
Sasol and ArcelorMittal have partnered to develop carbon capture technology and produce green steel. Under a joint development agreement, they will assess the potential of Saldanha, South Africa, as an export hub for green hydrogen and derivatives. They will also focus on ways to use renewable electricity and green hydrogen to convert captured carbon into fuels and chemicals, according to a statement.
Petronas and Heriot-Watt University have started a new research partnership, with plans to use thermochemical reactions to produce hydrogen from biomass and other waste materials. The GBP 1 million ($1.1 million) research project will also explore solutions to address scalability and storage to promote adoption globally. They will focus on using the estimated 4 million tons of waste and by-products created by distilleries in the United Kingdom and the approximately 127 million tons of agriculture waste generated for hydrogen production every year in Malaysia.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the two generation sources have reportedly grown to a record 39 TWh, up 13% year on year.
The study shows that the increase in solar and wind during this period helped to mitigate the impacts of drought across Europe, amid a 21% decline in hydropower generation and a 19% reduction of nuclear capacity.
“The record increase in wind and solar compared to last year avoided the need for 8 billion cubic meters of additional fossil gas at a cost of €11 billion ($10.8 billion),” the companies said.
The figure was calculated based on the average EU benchmark TTF day-ahead gas price for March to September 2022. The study assumed that solar and wind power replaced expensive gas in the electricity mix.
The European Commission’s REPowerEU plan has the potential to significantly reduce Europe’s exposure to costly gas imports, according to the report.
“With tight LNG markets sustaining high gas costs for the next years, governments need to support the clean energy ambition of RePowerEU, making it a core element of the energy price crisis response,” said Artur Patuleia, senior associate at E3G.

RenewSys has unveiled its DESERV Extreme series of bifacial modules. They are designed for utility-scale projects and rooftop applications.
The modules are available in front-side power outputs ranging from 565 W to 590 W. Open-circuit voltage is 53.14 V to 54.15 V, and short-circuit current is 13.39 A to 13.73 A.
They measure 2,469 mm x 1,137 mm x 35 mm and weigh 31.7 kg. And they all feature IP68 split junction boxes with three bypass diodes.
At 20% of bifacial gain, these modules will generate 708 W of overall power output. The additional gain from the back side of bifacial modules depends on factors like mounting (structure, height, tilt angle, etc) and albedo, colour and other characteristics of the substrate.
The panel has a Pmax temperature coefficient of -0.37% per degree Celsius, and its operating temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V (DC).
RenewSys provides a 10-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty on the panels.
RenewSys is an integrated manufacturer of solar PV modules and its key components including encapsulants (EVA and POE), backsheets and cells. It has a global presence with offices in India, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Singapore, UAE, and representatives in Europe, the United States, and Mexico.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/18/flexible-all-perovskite-tandem-solar-cell-with-23-8-efficiency-improved-voltage/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 18, 2022","Flexible all-perovskite tandem solar cell with 23.8% efficiency, improved voltage","An international research group has developed a flexible all-perovskite tandem solar cell with a mitigated open-circuit voltage deficit and reduced voltage loss.
“We've shown flexible tandem efficiency of around 24% on small area cells using the spin coating method as a proof-of-concept,” researcher Fan Fu told pv magazine.
Flexible all-perovskite tandem cells remain less developed than their rigid counterparts, due to a difficult deposition process for the cell's functional layers and a lower open-circuit voltage. This is due to high defect densities within the perovskite absorber layer and at the perovskite/charge selective layer interface.
“Over the past years, many approaches, including compositional engineering, additive engineering, interfacial engineering, and mixed-dimensional engineering, have been explored and the open-circuit voltage deficit has been reduced to values as low as 0.37 V in perovskite solar cells with bandgap of around 1.72 eV suitable for perovskite-Si tandems,” they said. “However, extending these strategies to mitigate the open-circuit voltage deficit in perovskites with even wider bandgaps of around 1.80 eV that are required for two-terminal (2T) all-perovskite tandems remains very challenging.”
For the device subcell, the scientists replaced the conventional hole transport layer (HTL), which is made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA), with another made with a self-assembled monolayer based on the 2PACz carbazole additive. They also passivated the perovskite layer through a postdeposition treatment (PDT) with 2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride (TEACl) and used an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).
They embedded the resulting perovskite subcell in a flexible two-terminal (2T) all-perovskite tandem device, which achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.8%, a high open-circuit voltage of 2.1 V, a shor-circuit current density of 15.1 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 75.1%.
“Notably, the open-circuit voltage of 2.1 V of our flexible 2T tandem solar cell is higher than the open-circuit voltage of the best performing rigid tandem (2.03 V) and flexible (2.0 V) tandem devices reported to date,” the scientists said.
They introduced the cell technology in “High-Performance Flexible All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Reduced VOC-Deficit in Wide-Bandgap Subcell,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
“Our next step is to replace all the spin-coated steps with an industrial scalable and cost-effective slot-die coating method and demonstrate flexible all-perovskite tandem modules with comparable efficiency as demonstrated in small area cells,” Fu said. “Commercial production will be considered once high efficient flexible tandem mini-module could be demonstrated using industrially scalable methods.”
The research group includes scientists from Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) and the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, Germany's Helmholtz-Zentrum-Berlin, and several institutions in China – Sichuan University, Jiaxing University and Soochow University.

The Chinese manufacturer describes the GoodWe ET 15-30kW Series inverter as a high-voltage device that facilitates energy back-up, peak shaving, and load management.
“The new hybrid inverter models represent an extension of GoodWe’s popular ET Series,” it said. “Meeting the needs of larger residential PV rooftops while also introducing a solution for small C&I systems, the 15 kW to 30 kW models allow for DC input current of 15 A for each string, thus matching well with high-power solar modules. Furthermore, the series offers up to 150% DC input oversizing to maximize energy production and achieve high levels of self-consumption and reduction of electricity bills.”
The inverter is available in five versions with power output ranging from 15 kW to 30 kW and a weight spanning from 48 kg to 54 kg, with all devices measuring 520 mm × 660 mm × 22 mm.
The new product has an efficiency of 98.0%, a European efficiency rate of 97.5 %, and a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency of 99.9%. The maximum input voltage is 1,000V and the MPP voltage range is between 200 V and 850 V. It also features has an operating temperature range of -35 C to 60 C and IP66-rated protection.
The inverter incorporates a lithium-ion battery with a voltage range of 200 V to 800 V and a maximum charge/discharge current of 50 A.
“In addition to the high-capacity range, the storage inverter is characterized by its strong overloading capability in back-up mode,” GoodWe said. “This feature enables uninterrupted operation even when surge power demand exceeds the inverter’s nominal power rating. Moreover, the ET Series presents peak shaving that balances power demand and grid power imported, to effectively reduce peak power demand from the grid. Thanks to dry contacts in the inverter, external loads such as heat pumps can also be flexibly activated to optimize energy consumption.”
The company says the new product enables a project configuration of eight batteries connected in parallel, with the total storage capacity of 131 kWh.
“This high-quality inverter can be combined with a range of battery capacities and brands, including the GoodWe high-voltage battery Lynx Home F PLUS+ Series,” said the company.
