The project is based on four salt caverns in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia with a potential to host a 500 MW storage system. Eneco will operate, co-develop, and finance the project through its German subsidiary LichtBlick, one of Germany’s largest green energy suppliers. Cavern construction is already underway, with handover of the first two expected in early 2027.
Phase one of the Ahaus project will use two of the site’s existing salt caverns to deploy Corre Energy’s multiday CAES solution to deliver 220 MW of compression capacity and 320 MW of generation capacity. The project is expected to use equipment by Siemens Energy. “Our first phase scheme at Ahaus is targeting 320 MW of generating capacity and a duration of over three days,” Corre Energy's spokesperson tells pv magazine, adding that the company is not ready to “give a MWh figure at this stage.”
The agreement will see Eneco acquire a 50% interest in the project, at economics to be agreed, comprising both development capital and construction equity. “The agreement, which is subject to respective board approvals, significantly de-risks Corre Energy’s pathway to both commercial close and FID [final investment decision],” Corre Energy said.
“This landmark agreement combines offtake, development, and co-investment arrangements to propel our first German project while showcasing the latest demand for our CAES solution,” said Keith McGrane, CEO of Corre Energy.
The transaction represents Eneco’s second agreement with Corre Energy following its 15-year offtake agreement for the ZW1 project in the Netherlands, announced in December 2022.
“By locking in long-term investment partnerships such as in Germany, we are accelerating the commercial development of our portfolio underpinned by long-term offtake arrangements. These arrangements are repeatable across the portfolio and for each project can capture c€1bn of net revenue over the duration of a 15-year offtake agreement.” said McGrane.
The partnership will enable Eneco to use the full capacity of the first phase of the project in Ahaus once delivered in 2027. At the moment, chemical company Solvay is still extracting salt from the caverns.
“We see a bright future for these storage solutions, and this second project with Corre Energy brings us closer to achieving the goals set out in our One Planet Plan: to be climate neutral in 2035, together with our customers,” said Kees-Jan Rameau, COO – Integrated Energy at Eneco.
According to the project partners, the CAES site in Ahaus is well located between increasing offshore wind power production in the north and the significant power consumption regions to the south. It is close to the future national hydrogen backbone grid (H2-Startnetz) and will complement the regional establishment of an industrial scale renewables-based green hydrogen value chain.
The project represents the first CAES facility to be developed, constructed, and operated in Germany since 1978 when the 321 MW Huntorf plant was commissioned as the world's first CAES plant. In recent years alone, several large-scale projects have been announced in the United States, Israel, Canada, Australia and China.
However, there has been a significant limit to the adoption rate of CAES due to its reliance on underground formations for storage.

Aerocompact says the investment will accelerate its international growth plan, leveraging its strong growth momentum and the quality of its solar mounting solutions.
“Our strong growth trajectory since the company was founded around ten years ago shows that there is enormous potential in our products and engineering services,” said Mathias Muther, the founder of Aerocompact, who retains a 40% stake in the company. “The entry of Trilantic Europe opens up the opportunity to accelerate our growth plan to expand our international market presence and seek potential acquisitions even further.”
The transaction is subject to approval by the relevant authorities. The financial terms of the deal have not been revealed. 
“We have been impressed by the quality of Aerocompact’s solar mounting solutions, the growth momentum shown across all its current markets, and the enthusiasm and vision of the entire team,” said Vittorio Pignatti-Morano, Trilantic Europe chairman. “Through our partnership with Aerocompact, we are confident we can accelerate growth even further and create a truly international champion in the solar mounting space, while also delivering on our investment sustainability commitments.”
Aerocompact has ramped up production of PV substructures at a new plant in Bulgaria. Its production line in Nüziders, Austria, which was mainly used for prototype construction, was shut down as a result, the manufacturer said.
The company's products are currently installed in more than 60 countries. It recorded roughly EUR 100 million ($108 million) of revenue for the first time in 2023.

According to a report from Swiss consulting firm Pexapark, 2023 saw 16.2 GW of disclosed contracted volumes, a 40% increase on the previous year. Deal count totalled 272 PPA announcements, a 65% increase from 2022.
Total solar PPA volumes were quadruple those of both onshore and offshore wind, accounting for 10.5 GW across 160 deals.
Pexapark says corporates played a significant role in driving the PPA market, securing 11.95 GW across 218 deals, a 28% increase in volume and a 66% year-on-year increase in deal count.
Utilities also saw a notable increase, securing 4.02 GW across 48 deals, more than double the 1.96 GW of 2022 and a 60% increase on last year’s 30 deals. Pexapark says utilities are evolving to address challenges like price volatility, intermittency and higher green standards.
Spain led the PPA market for the fifth consecutive year, totalling 4.67 GW, followed by Germany at 3.73 GW. Together, they accounted for 50% of the year’s volumes.
Italy (1.06 GW), United Kingdom (0.96 GW) and Greece (0.95 GW) rounded out the top five. Looking ahead, Germany is predicted to challenge Spain for the title of most active PPA market in 2024.
The consulting firm expects the PPA market to surpass 20 GW in 2024, as the market enjoys a stabilising pricing environment, decreased volatility, and growing maturity from both buyers and sellers in managing energy risks.
Pexapark expects new developments in hybrid PPAs, 24/7 green procurement approaches, PPAs for green hydrogen production, and multi-buyer PPAs to attract further attention in 2024.
It warns competition between contracts for differences (CfDs) and the PPA market could be a new challenge and says the introduction of new government credit guarantee schemes could expand the potential pool of offtakers entering the market.
“One of the main trends we see is the evolved role of utilities in the market, offering solutions to challenges posed by price volatility, intermittency and higher green standards,” said Luca Pedretti, Pexapark co-founder and COO. “Project owners, utilities and corporates are joining forces to leverage each other’s strengths, and the role of more structured PPAs will increase. Risk managers such as utilities have an opportunity to further evolve into ‘market integrators’ unlocking significant innovation in the market.”

The academics investigated, in particular, the timelines of 12,475 projects using PV, wind onshore, wind offshore, biomass, and run-off-river hydropower spread across 48 countries. “The regions are defined as per World Bank country and lending group classification and sorted continently into Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD groups, as those in the OECD group tend to be wealthier countries,” they explained.
Their analysis considered project size, technology, project and developer characteristics, project site, and a project's related market. They utilized project-level data sourced from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BloombergNEF) and other country-level data and environmental data from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Worldwide Governance Indicators, among others.
“We only considered projects where permitting and commissioning dates are recorded in the data and where a country has at least five transactions for any given technology,” the group specified. “The sourced data include details on installed capacity, names of actors developing the projects, project geocoordinates, permitting dates, and commissioning dates.”
One of the first conclusions drawn by the scientists is that, although PV is the technology that requires the least time to commission, the completion times for the deployment of utility scale solar plants in many countries increased from 2015 to 2022. “The findings further indicate that the mean time for deployment has increased for all technologies in the OECD and non-OECD groupings, except for biomass electricity in non-OECD countries,” they stated.
Referring to the critical factors that may delay projects, the academics said size has an “insignificant” impact and added that developers' experience is, instead, a significant predictor of commissioning times, although only for PV and wind onshore. “This is likely due to low experience build-up in the other technologies due to relatively low deployment compared to solar PV and wind onshore,” they emphasized, noting that the presence of a domestic developer or a state-owned company may speed up deployment.
The analysis showed that completion times for PV and wind onshore increased by 0.5 years and 0.9–1.2 years respectively for OECD and non-OECD countries. “The upward trend also holds for different regions within the OECD and non-OECD groupings, with only Europe and Asia-Pacific showing a reduction in commissioning times for small hydro RoR and biomass electricity respectively,” the researchers noted.
The analysis also showed that factors such as currency devaluation and GDP contraction, as well as the COVID-19 crisis, had a significant impact on project timelines. It also showed that the average project size for solar PV during the 2005-2022 period is 17.3 MW in OECD countries and 34.4 MW in non-OECD countries.
The research group presented its findings in the study “A global analysis of renewable energy project commissioning timelines,” published in Applied Energy. “Future research could strengthen the econometric analysis with other potential factors and variables, and potentially apply them to energy technologies beyond renewables, such as electricity storage or grid assets, which might shed light on the robustness of our framework,” the scientists concluded.

The company wants to sell the panels to automotive, consumer electronics, sensor, and LED component manufacturers. “The pilot line will produce 200,000 units per year, each unit measures 3.82 cm x 7.62 cm,” Solaires CEO Fabian De La Fuente told pv magazine.
The types of applications Solaires targets include self-charging electronic devices, wireless keyboards, smart door locks, electronic shelf labels, and sensors. Solaires says its modules can be standalone or paired with rechargeable batteries.
Solaires will produce the complete stack in-house.
“We have all the equipment to do so. Our manufacturing process is a sheet-to-sheet process for rigid glass substrates using slot-die coating, screen printing, laser ablation and lamination. We also have in-house quality control and testing equipment,” said De La Fuente, adding that the manufacturing equipment is commercially available and scalable.
The modules are based on perovskite tuned for indoor light absorption and have a power conversion of 35% in indoor light. Current prototypes have an aperture area of 17.22 cm2 and an active area of 14.70 cm2.
Under halogen lamp illumination at 1000 lux, the panels achieved a power density of 0.15 mW/cm2 and a power maximum power point (MPP) of 2.2 mW, with current MPP at 0.52 mA, and short-circuit current at 0.60 mA.
Under light-emitting diode lamp illumination at 1000 lux, the power density is 0.06 mW/cm2, the power MPP is 0.9 mW, the current MPP is 0.23 mA and the short-circuit current is 0.27 mA. The voltage MPP and open-circuit voltage are the same for both types of lamps, at 4 V and 5 V, respectively.
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
The company, which originated at Canada's University of Victoria, was founded in 2020. It started out as a producer of mixed halide perovskite solutions, a product it called Solar Ink, with an energy bandgap of 1.54 eV. It stood out from the competition due to its longer shelf life, according to De La Fuente.
Solaires will continue to sell perovskite materials in addition to manufacturing modules. “Our business model is to license our technology to manufacturers around the globe and includes providing materials, such as our perovskite ink and other unique layers in the full module stack,” said De La Fuente.
De La Fuente said that thin film technologies, particularly perovskites, excel in absorbing indoor light compared to silicon, due to their intrinsic material properties.

It consists of a new algorithm that uses machine learning techniques for processing and taking geostationary satellite images as input.
“We are committed to developing a daytime hourly intra-day cloud fraction (CF) prediction algorithm for small areas over PV plants,” they explained. “Our primary objective is to develop an innovative and easy-to-promote algorithm or system based on the key framework of the PredRNN++ model.”
The “NCP_CF” method receives input radiance data from the Himawari-8/9 satellite. It can reportedly process data centered at PV plants with spatio-temporal resolutions of 4 km. It then transforms these details into tiles, which are used for a prediction model.
The model is also said to be able to learn to predict long-term future imageries in various spatio-temporal tasks using recurrent-neural networks-based (RNNs) long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm framework. Modified for cloud forecasting, the novel system updates every hour, showing the most recent cloud images for the following four hours. Then, a cloud mask algorithm calculates the number of cloudy pixels over the PV plants.

The novel prediction system was tested on five PV plants located in China from 2019 to 2022. The results were then compared to observations from twelve ground-based manual stations and three all-sky imager stations.
As for the predicted cloud fraction (CF) data, the scientists found their system to have root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.21, 0.25, 0.3, and 0.35 for the forecast leading time of one hour, two hours, three hours, and four hours, respectively. The mean bias errors (MBEs) or the same leading times were found at −0.09, −0.08,−0.07, and −0.03 for the forecast.

“Our future mission is to further promote applications and improve the accuracy of this cloud cover nowcasting technique, especially for the forecast leading time of more than two hours, by using higher spatial-resolution satellite data and combining the short-term forecast data from a rapidly updated regional high resolution numerical weather prediction,” the academics concluded.
The research was conducted by scientists from Sun Yat-sen University, Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory, China Meteorological Administration, China General Nuclear Power Group, and the Beijing Keytec Technology. They presented their results in “Accurate nowcasting of cloud cover at solar photovoltaic plants using geostationary satellite images,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.

7,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/29/how-to-combine-residential-heat-pumps-with-photovoltaics-battery-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-01-29,"How to combine residential heat pumps with PV, battery storage","Fraunhofer ISE researchers have studied how residential rooftop PV systems could be combined with heat pumps and battery storage.
They assessed the performance of a PV-heat pump-battery system based on a smart-grid (SG) ready control in a single-family house built in 1960 in Freiburg, Germany.
“It was found that the smart control increased the heat pump operation by boosting the set temperatures,” researcher Shubham Baraskar told pv magazine. “The SG-Ready control increased the supply temperature by 4.1 Kelvin for hot water preparation, which then decreased the seasonal performance factor (SPF) by 5.7% from 3.5 to 3.3. Furthermore, for space heating mode the smart control decreased the SPF by 4% from 5.0 to 4.8.”
The SPF is a value similar to the coefficient of performance (COP), with the difference it is calculated over a longer period with varying boundary conditions.
Baraskar and his colleagues explained their findings in “Analysis of the performance and operation of a photovoltaic-battery heat pump system based on field measurement data,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Advances. They said the main advantage of PV-heat pump systems consists of their reduced grid consumption and lower electricity costs.
The heat pump system is a 13.9 kW ground-source heat pump designed with a buffer storage for space heating. It also relies on a storage tank and a freshwater station for producing domestic hot water (DHW). Both storage units are equipped with electric auxiliary heaters.
The PV system is south-oriented and has a tilt angle of 30 degrees. It has a power ouput of 12.3 kW and a module area of 60 square meters. The battery is DC-coupled and has a capacity of 11.7 kWh. The selected house has a heated living space of 256 m2 and an annual heating demand of 84.3 kWh/m²a.
“The DC power from PV and battery units is converted to AC via an inverter which has a maximum AC power of 12 kW and a European efficiency of 95 %,” the researchers explained, noting that the SG-ready control is able to interact with the electricity grid and adjust the system's operation correspondingly. “During the periods of high grid load, the grid operator can turn off the heat pump operation to reduce the grid strain or can also undergo a forced turn on in the opposite case.”
Under the proposed system configuration, PV power must be initially used for the house loads, with surplus being supplied to the battery. Excess power could only be exported to the grid, if no electricity is required by the household and the battery is completely charged. If both the PV system and the battery are not able to cover the house's energy demand, the electricity grid can be used.
“The SG-Ready mode is activated when the battery is fully charged or is charging at its maximum power and there is still PV surplus available,” the academics said. “Conversely, the trigger-off condition is met when the instantaneous PV power remains lower than the total building demand for at least 10 minutes.”
Their analysis considered self-consumption levels, solar fraction, heat pump efficiency, and the impact of the PV system and the battery on the heat pump performance efficiency. They used high-resolution 1-minute data from January to December 2022 and found that the SG-Ready control increased the heat pump supply temperatures by 4.1 K for DHW. They also ascertained that system achieved an overall self-consumption of 42.9% during the year, which translates into financial benefits for the homeowners.
“The electricity demand for the [heat pump] was covered by 36% with the PV/battery system, through 51% in domestic hot water mode and 28% in space heating mode,” the research team explained, adding that higher sink temperatures reduced heat pump efficiency by 5.7% in DHW mode and by 4.0% in space heating mode.
“For space heating, a negative effect of the smart control was also found,” Baraskar said. “Due to the SG-Ready control the heat pump operated in space heating above the heating set point temperatures. This was because the control probably increased the storage set temperature and operated the heat pump even though the heat was not needed for space heating. It should also be considered that excessive high storage temperatures can lead to higher storage heat losses.”
The scientists said they will investigate additional PV/heat pump combinations with different system and control concepts in the future.
“It must be noted that these findings are specific for the individual evaluated systems and can vary greatly depending on the building and energy system specifications,” they concluded.

The new plant has an annual capacity of 250 MW capacity and, according to the company is “highly automated.”
As for the providers of equipment installed in the production lines, the company’s CEO, Patrick Hofer-Noser told pv magazine, “We do not disclose the names except to say, we have chosen suppliers with a long track record serving the world’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturers.” 
The company hired an additional 30 people for the new factory, bringing its employee count to 150. 
To date, the Swiss company has installed over 20,000 solar roofs. It specializes in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), developing and producing solar solutions for roofs and façades, railings and overhead PV structures. “Besides PV modules, we also supply installation materials, consulting and planning services, training and tools,” said Hofer-Noser. 
Its newest module, dubbed TeraSlate, is available in a range of sizes and configurations, including solar thermal. Made to fit rooftops, it has features that meet the needs of architects and homeowners. For example, the profile is seamless, and frames are not bulky, according to Hofer-Noser. 
The modules are certified to hail class 5. “It means that the modules can withstand hailstones with a diameter of 5 cm at a speed of over 110 km/h without damage. For homeowners, this means extra security for their investment and a long service life for their building envelope,” explained Hofer-Noser. 
3S Swiss Solar Solutions’ flagship product is MegaSlate II, which comes in a range of colors and finishes including a matte or satin finish. “It is well suited for historical buildings [offering] the possibility of seamless homogenous surfaces. Many historical and classified projects have been realized in the last 20 years with this system,” said Hofer-Noser.

Australia's Pacific Energy has designed and delivered its first hydrogen standalone power system (H2 SPS) to serve as a platform to study the potential benefits of green hydrogen as an energy source, particularly for small regional and remote grids, which are common throughout Australia's Northern Territory.
The pilot 5 kW fuel cell with 8 kWh of hydrogen storage system has been installed at the Charles Darwin University’s (CDU) REMHART (Renewable Energy Microgrid Hub for Applied Research and Training) facility in Darwin. There the system can convert power from the university’s specialised renewable energy grid testing facility into green hydrogen.
Professor Suresh Thennadil, director of CDU’s Energy and Resources Institute (ERI) which will operate the generator and hydrogen storage system for industry partners, students and researchers, said the system will play an important role in further developing a sustainable and efficient energy cycle for hydrogen production and utilisation.
“The installation of a containerised hydrogen electrolyzer and fuel cell system significantly enhances our ability to study hydrogen production and its feasibility as an energy source for fuelling the grid,” he said. “This will also enable us to better understand the challenges and intricacies associated with incorporating hydrogen as an additional energy source as well as the durability of electrolyzers and other components under local climatic conditions. This upgrade provides a unique and flexible platform to study renewable energy systems, particularly small regional and remote grids, which are common throughout the NT.”
Pacific Energy Chief Executive Officer Jamie Cullen said the transportable containerized H2 SPS is an adaptation of the company’s solar-powered standalone power system, and comprises four electrolyzers developed by Germany-based hydrogen specialist Enapter, a 5 kW fuel cell provided by Swedish company PowerCell Group, a battery and inverters.
The system’s electrolysers use electricity to split fresh water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. The hydrogen component is stored in pressurised containment vessels until it is required to produce power. When power is required, the fuel cell combines the hydrogen gas with oxygen from the air, producing electricity that can then be fed into the grid.
Pacific said the system, which has already produced hydrogen and 5 kW of electrical output during testing, has the capability to supply 8.6 kW of three-phase power using its inverters and battery.
Cullen said he expects the system will play a critical role in developing the energy industry’s understanding of hydrogen as a renewable energy source, helping to “overcome some of the challenges we currently face when integrating hydrogen into the renewables mix.”
The company said the modular design of the system means it can be scaled with ease, using the same philosophies, concepts and safety system hardware used in CDU’s model.
The deployment of the Pacific Energy system follows the recent announcement from Boundary Power that it has developed a modular standalone power system that integrates solar with a hydrogen electrolyzer and storage system.
Boundary Power said its system, developed in conjunction with energy storage system specialist Lavo and inverter manufacturer Selectronic Australia, utilises solar power and a renewable hydrogen hydride battery to store and generate electricity when required, , doing away with the traditional back-up diesel generator.

Their data set, thought to be the largest of its kind for such a project, consisted of data from 25,000 inverters across almost 2,500 commercial and utility-scale PV sites in 37 states and US territories, equivalent to almost 8 GW of solar. The mean age of the PV systems observed was five years.
The researchers found a median loss in performance rate of 0.75% per year, matching similar values reported by previous studies. The analysis discovered systems in hotter temperature zones exhibited twice as much performance loss than those in cooler climates, at 0.88% per year and 0.48% per year respectively. Overall, 90% of systems studied saw losses in performance of less than 2% per year.
Chris Deline, a group manager for PV field performance at NREL, said the median loss in performance is a “crucial number.”
“First, it shows that our fleet of PV systems, on the whole, is not failing catastrophically, but rather degrading at a modest rate within expectations,” he said. “It's important that we quantify this rate as accurately as we can, because this small but tangible number is used in almost all financing agreements that fund solar projects and provides critical guidance for the industry.”
The short-term impact of extreme weather, such as flooding, high winds, hail, wildfire and lightning, was minimal in most PV systems studied. The median outage length after an extreme weather event was two to four days, resulting in a 1% median loss in annual performance. 
A total of 12 systems out of 6,400 experienced outages of two weeks or more. Most outages occurred because of flooding and rain, followed by wind events. Most systems in the data set experienced only one weather-related outage.
The researchers, however, found that when powerful enough, extreme weather can accelerate long-term degradation. Hail greater than 25 mm in diameter, winds over 90 km/h and snow of depths greater than 1 meter were found to lead to greater annual performance losses in PV systems, such as mechanical stresses cracking solar cells.
“We don't feel any of this analysis suggests that PV systems are unreliable or especially vulnerable to extreme weather. PV has demonstrated that it can provide backup power and save lives when surrounding infrastructure is damaged by extreme weather events,” said NREL researcher Dirk Jordan. “Yet, there are further measures we can take to improve the quality of equipment and especially installation best practices to increase resilience to these weather events.”
Ownership may lie with module manufacturers and PV testing organizations understanding the thresholds at which damage can occur. Then, the NREL says, the industry can begin to design for these conditions and create tests that subject panels to realistic stresses created by wind, snow and hail.
“High-quality installations are also key to increasing resilience against extreme weather. Standardizing installation practices, such as using through-bolting and mounting modules far enough from the edge of roofs in wind-prone areas, could help mitigate system performance impacts,” Jordan added.

Activity in the clean hydrogen sector is “surging” globally, fueled by maturing policies and early commercial-scale projects, including here in Australia, according to international energy consultancy Rystad Energy.
Artem Abramov, head of clean tech research at Rystad Energy, said he expects hydrogen projects will take off in 2024 driven by large-scale projects in Australia as well as the Middle East and Africa, along with maturing policies in Europe and the United States.
“2024 promises more than just momentum, it’s a year of clarity,” Abramov said, noting that several key feasibility studies are to be completed, which he expects will reveal promising new use cases for hydrogen consumption.
Abramov also said a series of global auctions and grants will be rolled out, providing essential insights into key aspects of the emerging clean hydrogen sector.
“These events will shed light on pricing dynamics, technological advancements and the eventual victors and contenders in this transformative landscape,” Abramov said.
Rystad Energy’s forecast comes just weeks after the IEA delivered what it described as a reality check on green hydrogen development, noting that despite announcements on plenty of new projects, progress in realizing them has been slow.
In the latest edition of its annual Renewables market report, the IEA said that more than 360 GW of renewable energy-powered electrolyzer projects with start dates before 2030 had been announced but only 3% of these had reached financial close or started construction.
Rystad expects that there will be fewer clean hydrogen project announcements this year compared to previous years with most of the effort in 2024 to be focused on realising projects.
The consultancy said this marks the start of the learning-by-doing phase for the clean hydrogen economy.
Rystad said any announcements of new projects will be more conservative and of lower risks. This will continue the trend that was seen in 2023, where only 17.6 million tonnes of hydrogen were announced, following the 30 million tonnes announced in 2022.
Abramov’s positive outlook for green hydrogen is part of Rystad Energy’s look at what’s in store for the energy sector in 2024.
Last year was a pivotal one for the energy world with the latest figures from the IEA indicating that global renewables capacity grew by 50%, reaching almost 510 GW, with PV accounting for three-quarters of the additions.
Rystad’s head of Renewables and Power Research, Carlos Torres Diaz, said the coming year will be another rollercoaster ride for the industry, with elections, supply chain issues and the maturation of nascent industries all on the cards.
“This year is expected to be another record breaker for the solar and wind markets, adding more than 510 GW of solar PV and wind capacity globally,” he said. “The resulting new generation from these sources, more than 900 TWh, will be enough to cover most of the growth in demand, helping limit the need for fossil-fuelled power generation. “
Diaz did caution that while capacity will continue to grow, governments need to put in place the right incentives for renewable energy projects to ensure the momentum continues.
