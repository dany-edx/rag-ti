Chinese module manufacturer Trina Solar claims to have set a new world record efficiency of 25.5% for its 210×210 mm monocrystalline n-type i-TOPCon solar cell.
The result was certified by the National Institute of Metrology of China.
The manufacturer said it will further develop the solar cell by using its production equipment from commercial manufacturing.
“We are very proud of these recent achievements,” said Chen Yifeng, head of Trina's Research and Development Center for High Efficiency Cells and Modules. “Trina Solar is deeply involved in cutting-edge research and development and is a pioneer in technological production and manufacturing, which contributes to the company taking a leading position with its efficient products.”
In June 2019, the efficiency of Trina's TOPCon solar cell stood at 23.22%. The record-breaking 247.79cm² bifacial device was manufactured using a low-cost industrial process, said Trina in a statement released at the time, on a large phosphorus-doped, cast-mono silicon substrate. That result was independently confirmed by ISFH CalTeC in Germany.

“The carefully chosen transparent backsheet has an excellent resistance to external influences, which means it deteriorates exclusively on a bare minimal level throughout its lifespan,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The even better feature of this transparent backsheet is that it provides such great transparency that it can easily be compared to glass-glass modules, while the price point of the product remains much closer to the standard solar products.”
The module is being offered with wattages of 260 and 300W, respectively. “Bisol Lumina has a specially designed matrix with bigger gaps between solar cells and 30% transparency rate, which makes it perfect for agrivoltaic projects that are currently a major trend in the solar industry, as well as skylights, sun shades, and car canopies,” the spokesperson said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/31/ukraine-invasion-reshaping-discussion-about-energy-pricing-renewables/,"GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,EUROPE,RUSSIA,UKRAINE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 31, 2022","Ukraine invasion reshaping discussion about energy, pricing, renewables","Prof. Overland, the war in Ukraine appears to have already disrupted the European and global energy landscape. Have we already crossed a point of no return? Do you believe the ‘back to normal' option can now be completely excluded?  
Yes, I am certain that we will not return to the status quo that existed before Feb. 24, 2022. Although there are many uncertainties and possible outcomes, I don’t see how a return to the past could happen.
Relations between Russia and Europe have always been complex when it comes to energy supplies. Europe may encounter big problems by completely cutting gas supplies from Russia, but Moscow will always need a buyer, and Europe may still be its best client in the decades to come. Do you really think Russian gas can be sold in other markets, such as Asia or elsewhere? 
In principle, a good bit of Russian gas previously sold to Europe could go to Asia. However, it would require new infrastructure such as pipelines or liquefaction terminals for liquid natural gas (LNG) and take some years to prepare. And LNG may be difficult now because it requires foreign technology and know-how and sanctions will cause a lot of problems. Access to capital will be a problem both for LNG and pipelines, though in principle the Chinese could provide it for pipelines. However, even if it worked out with new pipelines, they would eat up a bit of the profit and the lack of competition between buyers would reduce profits even more.
What could be expected if Europe loses access to Russian gas? And what's the likely scenario if gas supplies go back to normal?
If the Russian gas supply is lost, it may be a very tough situation for Europe. However, it may also help overcome the Putin regime in Russia, solving some of Europe’s long-term problems. High energy prices are usually a problem for politicians, but may be less so when the population knows they are due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How it will play out, I don’t think anyone knows.
Image: Norsk Utenrikspolitisk Institutt (NUPI)
Which countries can most easily find alternative solutions if Russian energy supplies are interrupted?
I believe Spain and possibly the UK are relatively well-positioned to handle this. Perhaps also the Netherlands, if they are willing to start producing from the Groningen gas field again for a short period to alleviate the situation. Perhaps the most exposed country is Germany. Although I am a big fan of Germany, it has to be admitted that it has brushed aside all warnings and made itself highly dependent on Russian energy, in the process in fact helping facilitate the Russian invasion of Ukraine and imperilling Europe’s energy supply. Thus Germany also has the greatest moral obligation to make sacrifices to help resolve the situation. So far we have not seen this.
I think it may be too soon to outline possible scenarios, but do you believe the current situation will really be a big driver for more renewables expansion in the short term in Europe and globally, as expected by many analysts? Do you see more challenges or opportunities at this stage? 
Yes, I cannot see how these developments can avoid leading to massive investment in renewable energy, probably also nuclear power. I think the only question is how fast it can be done, and here lack of labor and equipment and dependence on Chinese equipment will be important factors. Anyone who has acquired skills related to the installation of solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps or electric vehicles is guaranteed good work for a long time.
Higher energy and gas prices may be a good driver for renewable energy, especially for unsubsidized projects under bilateral purchase agreements. However, the current price volatility is discouraging this market trend. Do you believe this unstable scenario could last for a long time? What kind of impact could this have on clean energy development? 
As I can’t see how the conflict between Russia and the West over Ukraine can be solved, I expect fossil fuel prices to remain high for long. However the current war develops, it will be very difficult for Russia to give up Crimea, and it will be impossible for the West to accept the continued occupation of Crimea. And as this intractable nature of the conflict becomes clear to markets, they should gain confidence and their willingness to take long-term financial risk should grow.
We have seen many governments in Europe taking measures to support new deployments of solar, wind and heat pumps. Authorizations are now being given more easily in several countries and fiscal incentives are being awarded. Do you think that politics could now turn to renewables on a scale we have never seen before? Would this be a real mindset change? 
Yes, I think that is the direction we are going in. I expect to see a lot more regulatory easing than we have seen so far and it should also become easier to overcome ‘NIMBY' (not in my backyard) instincts, which are a major obstacle for renewable energy developments, especially wind power. This is because I think the invasion of Ukraine qualitatively changes the nature of many arguments and discussions about energy, pricing and what people must accept. In addition, Russia has also very actively been supporting right-wing populists all over the West who are anti-climate and anti-renewables, both major politicians and parties. The reduction of this support, both because of crackdowns from Western governments and because of less Russian money and access, should also help reduce resistance to new renewable energy installations.
Which countries will be the biggest winners and losers of this crisis?
In the short term, Russia and Ukraine are the biggest losers. Ukraine has been subjected to a gruesome attack, Russia is shooting itself in the foot with all the weapons it has. Tens of thousands of young Russian men are killed, wounded or traumatized; weapons worth billions and billions of dollars are destroyed; the economy is devastated; the most educated and dynamic young people are leaving; Russia has become and will remain a pariah among all developed countries; it will take decades or centuries for the Ukrainians to forgive the Russians. Unlike the weak sanctions after the occupation of Crimea, the current sanctions will have a more substantial effect. In the longer term, Russia will inevitably continue to be a big loser as long as Putin is in power, while Ukraine may emerge victorious and greatly strengthened. Concerning winners, other oil and gas exporters like Canada, Norway, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia are big winners.
The USA is also a big winner, both as a major oil and gas producers and because Russia’s aggression hugely strengthens the USA’s position in Europe, as well as that of NATO. Countries that are at the forefront of renewable energy equipment manufacturing may also see great long-term benefits, for example Denmark. The current developments will also reinforce the trend towards a geopolitical rebalancing based on the decline of fossil fuels and rise of renewables. The invasion also strengthens the Democrats within the USA, which is again good for the USA as long as Trump is the alternative. Russophobes of all hues are also big winners and can send a big thanks to Vladimir Putin.

“We are not on track to stop climate change and we have to be very aggressive at this stage,” said Francesco La Camera, the Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) during the opening session of the event.
“Germany wants to become fully energy independent from Russia,” said the German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, Annalena Baerbock during the same session. “Going alone, nationally, won't work. We need a common European approach, which means Europe may become the world's first continent in becoming climate-neutral.”
The German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Robert Habeck, said there is a need for a common European effort to reduce energy dependence on Russia, although he admitted this will not be easy to achieve, noting the high costs German households and businesses may be forced to face in the near future. “We need to upscale renewables and bring back renewable energy manufacturing to Europe, even if it will be costlier,” he said. “We have to ensure prosperity while protecting the peace.”
In a short conversation with pv magazine after the opening session, La Camera stressed the centrality of green hydrogen in the long transition phase that we are likely to experience in the years to come. “Green energy capacity and demand should grow together, but when we speak for hydrogen producers they all say they are ready, but demand is still too low,” he said. “The problem is that big energy consumers that want to transition from one fuel to another have to adapt their infrastructure and this is probably not the right moment to add these costs. If we want to accelerate this process, policymakers will have to take the right steps.”
According to La Camera, the world will increasingly rely on green hydrogen, although at the current pace it may not be enough to help reduce carbon emissions and comply with Paris climate targets. “We need incentives of any kind, from tax credits to investment support,” he said. “There are many tools available and reducing tax burdens on new investments by businesses that want to rely on clean and climate-neutral fuels is a key move in this turbulent transition phase.”
La Camera suggested a granular approach should be considered for implementing these policies, depending on the particular regional characteristics of each market. “And this is not only about hydrogen,” La Camera said, “because its development goes hand in hand with that of renewables. We need electricity grids that can absorb the huge potential we have. For example, in North Europe, we could add immediately enormous amounts of wind power, but we don't have enough network capacity. Improving and building infrastructures is one of our biggest task.”
According to IRENA Director-General, the market may help solve most of the issues that politics will not address. “Inevitable, the market will select the less expensive energy generation sources,” he said. “The problem is how quickly this scenario may materialize. Once we will have filled the gap between several sectors and the cheapest options, we will see an unprecedented deployment of renewable and green hydrogen. For this, creating a hydrogen demand is crucial and incentives for helping enterprises reconvert their energy supply to the clean fuel.”

The Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (Miteco) approved, on Tuesday, a new package of measures within the framework of the national plan, to respond to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine.
The promotion of renewables is one of the government's priorities and the regulations approved by the Council of Ministers include several measures in this regard, such as a regulatory framework for floating PV; regulations for the pipeline of renewable gases, such as hydrogen transport; and the release 10% of grid access capacity to absorb, approximately, an additional 7GW of capacity under the self-consumption regime.
Given the emergency caused by international energy prices, an accelerated temporary procedure is enabled, until December 31, 2024, to determine the environmental approval of new wind plants of less than 75MW generation capacity and new solar parks not exceeding 150MW in size. These plants will have to be located outside the Natura 2000 Network – which is a network of core breeding and resting sites for rare and threatened species, and some rare natural habitat types – and in low or moderate-sensitivity areas, according to the country's environmental zoning system for renewable energy.
The new measures also provide that, between 2023 and 2025, the distribution companies will expand their investment plans in the electricity networks by a minimum of 10% to facilitate the evacuation of new, small-size renewable generation and self-consumption facilities.
Furthermore, floating photovoltaic solar power generation facilities are now included in the hydraulic public domain that can be eligible for a concession, which will be temporary, for 25 years. A provision is also added that contemplates the installation of photovoltaic solar power generation on canals or other hydraulic works owned by the general state administration or other public entities.
The package also determines how the supply of renewable gases through isolated pipes – including renewable hydrogen – will be articulated. The regulated aspects include the consideration of activity of general interest and its declaration of public utility; the applicable procedure for the authorization of infrastructure; the negotiated access of third parties; and other measures applicable to the agents of the renewable gas supply chain.

The coating will be based on photoactive nanotechnology and commercialized under the brand name Exocoat. It is described by the two companies as a self-cleaning coating for glass substrates, activated by light. “Under light radiation, the coating creates radicals which breakdown any organic soil or contamination,” they said in a joint statement. “Airborne particles such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitric oxide (NOx) are also eradicated.”
The coating relies on a super-hydrophilic surface that makes the water spread out on the module surface immediately, thus avoiding light scattering effects upon rain. Furthermore, this surface is said to increase the self–cleaning effect by letting water flow under the dirt and remove it by gravitational forces. “A more practical method to follow the effects on the surface is its response to a powdered substance that would cause fouling, and the effect to water spray. The hydrophilic surface of the coating will be less statically charged and, as a result, will attract less dirt,” the statement reads.
Scientists from the two companies tested the coating on a carbon powder against a plate that was half coated with Exocoat itself. They sprayed water on the plate and found that the coated side showed full wetting and self–cleaning due to the water sheeting effect. “A vital point for the performance of Exocoat as self-cleaning coating is its correct application on the glass/solar panel surface,” said Arno Schut, innovation manager at Axcentive. “Incorrect application can lead to inferior technical performance. Axcentive has written application protocols based for hand and automatic spray application that were developed in the lab and need to be tested on site.”
The two companies are currently seeking to improve their technology by seeking spray equipment manufacturers.

In the current lab stage, however, the cost should be a little higher.”
The researchers explained that FA-Cs perovskites have high thermal and operational stability and that, however, their crystallization process suffers from complicated intermediate phase transition processes, which leads to more defects on their surface. “This increases the difficulty of forming uniform perovskites, thus leading to … large lattice distortion, element segregation, and defect centers,” they emphasized.
The scientists used a dual-functional isobutylammonium isobutyldithiocarbamate (iBA-iBDTC), instead of a conventional isobutylammonium iodide (iBAI), as an additive to improve the FA-Cs perovskite's crystal growth and the cell passivation. “This dual-functional additive has also significantly enhanced the uniformity of the perovskite film to ensure high device performance when enlarging the cell area”, they stated. The solar cell was fabricated with a glass-coated substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a titanium dioxide (TiO₂) layer, a fullerene derivative layer, a film made of FA-Cs perovskite, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The performance of the device was compared to that of a reference solar cell developed without the new additive. The iBA-iBDTC-based device was found to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.25%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.141V, a short-circuit current of 25.73mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.826. The control cell showed an efficiency of 22.39%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.113V, a short-circuit current of 25.76mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.781. “The charge, non-radiative recombination lifetime of the modified film exhibits a threefold enhancement,” the research group emphasized. “This helps to improve the carrier diffusion length of the perovskite film by about two times, indicating the defect induced charge loss is suppressed when the cell works.” The non-encapsulated FA-Cs iBA-iBDTC-modified device was also found to retain more than 95% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 hours of operation.
The academics used a conventional series-connected structure to fabricate a 4.5x4.5cm2 mini module with an active area of 10.4cm2 comprising four sub-cells, through a spin coating technique. The panel showed an efficiency of 20.5%, which they said is among the highest results for perovskite mini modules. “Overall, the exploitation of the cation-anion synergistic effect of these dual-functional additives provides more opportunities for promoting … PSC development and commercialization,” they concluded.
All the details on the solar cell and the related manufacturing approach can be found in the paper “Efficient, stable formamidinium-cesium perovskite solar cells and minimodules enabled by crystallization regulation,” which was recently published in Joule.

Independent climate and energy think tank Ember’s third annual Global Electricity Review shows that global solar generation rose 23% in 2021, increasing year on year by 188TWh to 1,023TWh. It was the fastest rising source of electricity generation for the 17th consecutive year.
Ember said solar generated 3.7% of the world’s electricity in 2021 and Australia is at the vanguard, sourcing 12% of its electricity from the renewable technology – the highest proportion of any major country in the world.
While solar generation rose 23% globally in 2021, wind supply gained 14% over the same period, increasing 227TWh to 1,814TWh. Together, both renewable sources accounted for 10.3% of total global electricity generation, up 1% from 2020. Combined, wind and solar are now the fourth largest source of electricity in the world.
David Jones, program lead at Ember, said the report demonstrated that wind and solar had arrived, with clean sources generating 38% of the world’s electricity in 2021.
“The process that will reshape the existing energy system has begun,” he said. “Even as coal and power emissions hit another all-time high, there are clear signs that the global electricity transition is well underway. More wind and solar is being added to grids than ever. And not just in a few countries, but across the world. We’re getting closer to that break-even where wind and solar can cover new electricity demand, but we are still not quite there. If we maintain those growth rates we see, we will be there shortly.”
Ember’s report analysed annual power generation data for 209 countries from 2000 to 2020. For 2021, data was added from 75 countries, which together represented 93% of global demand.
The report shows that 50 countries generated more than 10% of their power from wind and solar, with Australia’s shift to wind and solar energy in the past two years greater than anywhere in the world except the Netherlands.
Ember noted that the share of solar and wind in Australia’s electricity market rose from 13% to 22% last year. Jones said Australia’s renewable energy transition had been driven by the widespread embrace of rooftop solar and had occurred despite the federal government's support for fossil fuels.
“This is very different from many countries, where national governments lead the charge,” he said. “It’s very refreshing to see so many people embracing homegrown solar, even as the national government continues to push for more oil and gas.”
Despite the record growth in wind and solar, the report also revealed that coal-fired power generation saw its fastest growth since at least 1985, rising 9% in 2021 to 10,042TWh. The record rise in coal was not matched by global gas generation, which increased by only 1% in 2021.
This came in a year of rapid demand recovery, as 2021 saw the largest recorded annual increase of 1,414TWh in global electricity demand, up 5.4% and the equivalent of adding a new India to global demand, the report said.
