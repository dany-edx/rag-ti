Heat pumps cover around 10% of heating needs in buildings today, when they are used as a main heating device, said the agency.
“This corresponds to over 100 million households, meaning that one in ten homes that require substantial heating are served by heat pumps today,” the IEA said. “However, many more households use heat pumps only part of the winter or as a supplementary source of heating in regions where they are mainly used for cooling buildings.”
Across Europe, heat pump sales grew by 49% year on year in 2022. Nearly 3 million heat pumps were sold last year, with air-to-water devices proving more popular in Germany and Poland, and air-to-air units emerging as the technology of choice in the Nordics and the Baltic countries, as well as in Southern Europe. Italy, France, and Germany accounted for almost half of all sales in Europe, while the markets in Poland and Czechia doubled in size in 2022, according to the IEA.
Hybrid systems, which combine heat pumps and gas boilers, were reportedly a popular choice in Italy, as they accounted for more than 40% of sales in the air-to-water segment in 2022. While ground-source and water-source heat pumps are the most efficient technologies, they are also the most expensive and account for less than 10% of European sales, according to the IEA.
Heat pumps outsold fossil fuel boilers in French buildings for the first time in 2022, at a time when France introduced a national ban on gas boilers in new buildings. In the United States, heat pumps overtook gas furnace sales in 2022, after years of almost equal growth.
“Installations of heat pumps remain concentrated in new buildings and existing single-family homes,” the IEA said. “Apartment buildings and commercial spaces will need to be a priority area if solid growth is to continue.”
China manufactures around 40% of the world’s heat pumps, according to the IEA. The country is the largest producer and exporter of the technology, with most of its exports going to Europe.
The agency noted that continued growth in heat pump deployment will require secure and resilient supply chains. The five largest global manufacturers reportedly have their headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region. Supply chains for chips are particularly stretched thin at present, said the IEA.
The agency added that large-scale industrial heat pumps and district heating have a critical role to play in the decarbonization of heat. It noted that additional market statistics will be crucial to expanding deployment.

For PV, the document sets a 2035 solar target of 70 GW and provides a series of generic actions to support the deployment of rooftop PV and large-scale solar installations. It does not provide specific information on the financial support for the proposed targets.
However, it does contain a brief reference to one of the most ambitious solar power supply projects ever developed on a global level – a 10.5 GW wind-solar project under development in Morocco by UK-based Xlinks. The project will be linked via a submarine cable to the UK power system.
“The government is interested in the Xlinks project, a proposed large scale onshore wind, solar and battery electricity generation site in Morocco that would exclusively supply power to the Great Britain grid via high voltage direct current subsea cables,” says the document. “The government is considering – without commitment – the viability and merits of the proposal to understand if it could contribute to the UK’s energy security.”
Xlinks CEO Simon Morrish told pv magazine that this hows the “enormous potential” of the project. He said it “will help the UK accelerate its transition to clean sources of power, increase energy security, reduce consumer bills, and achieve net zero.”
In May 2022, UK investment firm Octopus Energy signed an agreement with Xlinks to develop the huge facility. If built, it will include 7 GW of solar capacity and 3.5 GW of wind in Morocco. The facility will also be connected to 5 GW/20 GWh of battery storage.
The wind-solar complex will be connected to the UK power network in Alverdiscott, Devon, and Pembroke via a 3,800-km high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line. The developer said this could include four separate cables, making it the longest subsea power transmission link in the world.
Xlinks plans to sell the power to the UK grid under a contract-for-difference scheme.
The April issue of pv magazine, due out on Wednesday, takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
“We are hoping to complete a bilateral negotiation with the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS),” Morrish told pv magazine in April 2021, when the project was launched. “But we could also compete in future auctions if there was an allocation for this sort of project.”
However, without the contract-for-difference option, the project will have limited chances of being implemented.

According to several Irish media reports, lawmakers will discuss the new measure as part of the finance bill this week.
In October, the Irish Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage announced revisions to planning regulations to allow homeowners to install solar panels on their rooftops without planning permission. Under the new rules, homeowners will be allowed to use 100% of their rooftop surfaces for PV systems, from just 50%.
Ireland supports rooftop PV operating under its net metering scheme, via a rebate program. The scheme is designed to deploy around 380 MW of solar capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/03/copper-thiocyanate-to-eliminate-moisture-leaks-in-perovskite-pv-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 3, 2023",Copper thiocyanate to eliminate moisture leaks in perovskite PV cells,"Researchers at India's Department of Science and Technology have fabricated a perovskite solar cell with a hole-transporting material (HTM) made of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN), which is an inorganic semiconductor with a wide energy bandgap of 3.9 eV.
In “Dual-functional inorganic CuSCN for efficient hole extraction and moisture sealing of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells” – recently published in Material Advances – the scientists explained that CuSCN has emerged as a stable HTM to replace Spiro-OMeTAD precursor as the latter leads to moisture ingress into the cell, which in turn degrades the perovskite absorber and reduces solar cell performance.
“With good transparency in the visible and near-infrared regions, appropriate band positions of CuSCN-based devices show matching efficiencies,” they said. “Solution-based low-temperature processability, cost-effectiveness, and reproducibility have made industrial viability feasible.”
The scientists built the cell with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a titanium oxide (TiO2) electron transport layer, a halide perovskite known as α-formamidinium lead iodide known as α-FAPbI3, the CuSCN HTM, and gold (Au) metal contact.
“MAPbI3 films were deposited by a one-step process,” they said. “The perovskite films were then spin-coated with the hole transporting material, followed by the thermal evaporation of Au at a pressure of 10−6 mbar. For the HTM-free architecture, the MAPbI3 films were coated with gold without any HTM deposition.”
The academics analyzed the performance of the solar cell and compared it with that of a reference solar cell with the same configuration and a Spiro-OMeTAD HTM. The measurements showed that the CuSCN-based device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 10.1%, which compares to 10.0% for the reference cell.
“The CuSCN-based cell retained 70% of its initial efficiency due to the robust nature of the CuSCN HTM, which is reflected in the devices exhibiting a high water contact angle,” they said.
They noted that the cell consists reduces moisture leaks in the device, which is common in cells that use Spiro-OMeTAD.
“The role of the CuSCN–Au interface here is shown to only act as a protective layer to the perovskite film by preventing moisture ingress, unlike the spiro–Au and MAPbI3–Au interfaces, which facilitate easy penetration,” they concluded. “This study shows that blanketing the perovskite with the CuSCN HTM serves as a moisture protection layer without any modification at the interface or in perovskite absorber layer.”

Austria has launched a new subsidy scheme for residential batteries. The Ministry of Climate Action and Energy is providing a total of €15 million ($16.1 million) to support the installation of new storage systems and the expansion of existing systems used in combination with renewable energy.
Storage devices with storage capacities between 4 kWh and 50 kWh will be eligible for support. The flat-rate subsidy is €200/kWh of usable storage capacity.
Interested parties must initially register for the program on the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund website and then file for construction permits. The battery storage systems may not be ordered or set up prior to registration. Participants will have 24 months to complete their projects.
The program states that the systems must be fully installed by authorized installers and the ratio of usable storage capacity must be at least 0.5 kWh per unit of installed renewables capacity. The battery storage systems must be operated for at least 10 years.
“In Austria we already have technologically mature storage solutions that can be rolled out widely,” said Climate and Energy Fund Managing Director Bernd Vogl. “With the funding, we can manage to integrate these technologies into the system and improve the power supply in those regions where the grids are not sufficiently developed or where significantly more renewable electricity is produced than is used.”

Spain's Ministry for the Ecological Transition has recently started to review approvals for numerous projects that combine PV with wind power. The developers include Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, renewables producer Acciona, project developer Forestalia, energy company Ignis , and Enel Green Power, the renewable energy unit of Italian utility Enel.
Iberdrola is the developer with the largest share, split into 11 proposals, including some initiatives to hybridize existing plants and some to develop new hybrid schemes. The Spanish utility wants to build a series of solar plants to be connected to existing wind facilities in Spain.
Acciona, meanwhile, has submitted a proposal to hybridize a wind power facility with a 31.4 MW solar plant in Albacete, and another proposal to connect a wind plant with a 26.5 MW PV array in Jerez de la Frontera. It says it plans to hybridize two wind facilities in Palencia with a 31 MW solar facility and a wind power plant in Albacete with a 52 MW solar farm.
Ignis has submitted a proposal to build a 282.2 MW hybrid plant in Zaragoza, while Enerpal has revealed plans to build a 30 MW solar installation close to a wind plant in Palencia.
Madrid-based Grupo Arrate says it wants to build a 107.8 MW hybrid park in Albacete and a 171.2 MW installation in Olmedilla. Enel Green Power, meanwhile, says it plans to deploy a 259.2 MW plant in Teruel. In addition, Forestalia says it wants to couple a 42.5 MW solar plant with two existing wind facilities in Zaragoza, totaling 126 MW of capacity.
Spain currently hosts one of the world's first hybrid wind-solar projects – a 3.3 MW demonstration project built in 2018 by Portuguese utility EDP and Danish wind specialist Vestas near Cadiz, Andalucía, in southern Spain.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/03/australian-manufacturer-reveals-1-mwh-sodium-chloride-battery-design/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 3, 2023",Australian manufacturer reveals 1 MWh sodium chloride battery design,"From pv magazine Australia
Perth-based Altech Batteries has unveiled the design for a new 1 MWh GridPack non-lithium battery energy storage system. It developed it for the renewable energy and grid storage market, as part of its joint venture collaboration with German research organization Fraunhofer IKTS.
The launch of the “plug-and-play” GridPack comes just six months after the two sides signed a joint venture agreement to commercialize Fraunhofer’s Cerenergy sodium alumina solid state battery technology, which relies on sodium ions commonly found in table salt and avoids using rare and expensive metals such as lithium, cobalt, graphite and copper. Altech Batteries said the technology eliminates exposure to critical metal price rises and supply chain concerns. Fraunhofer has estimated that the cost of producing Cerenergy batteries should be about 40% cheaper than lithium-ion batteries, which currently dominate the global energy storage market.
The joint venture is commercializing the sodium chloride battery technology, with plans to construct a 100 MWh production facility on Altech’s land in Germany. It is anticipated that the facility will produce 10,000 individual 10 kWh Cerenergy battery modules every year to provide grid storage solutions to the market.
While the development of the manufacturing facility continues, the companies have now launched the design of the 1.0 MWh GridPack. Each GridPack, to be housed in standard shipping containers, will feature to 20 individual 60 kWh battery packs connected to a power management system. Each unit will have a distinct rating of 600 V (DC) and 100 amp hours and will be able to be arranged in a series to achieve the required rating of several thousand kW for grid functioning.
Altech said the GridPacks are modular and stackable, which reduces their footprint, and have a “plug-and-play” feature that makes them easy to install in remote locations. The company said there are no moving parts such as cooling fans and the batteries can operate in any climate without need for thermal management – a key advantage of sodium-alumina solid state batteries over lithium-ion alternatives.
With a projected lifespan of more than 15 years and unlimited cycling, Altech said it is confident that the technology will become the “preferred choice” for companies seeking a reliable and long-lasting energy storage solution.
“These 1 MWh GridPacks will offer significant benefits for the fast-growing renewable energy and grid storage sectors,” the company said. “They are an excellent means of stabilising the grid by providing a source  of  backup  power  during  periods  of  high  demand  or  when  renewable  energy  sources  are  not producing at capacity. They are also a cost-effective solution for storing and distributing renewable energy across a variety of applications, including grid-scale storage, microgrids, and electric vehicle charging.”

Unlike “regular” big batteries, SATA projects are operated to mimic transmission line flows by injecting and absorbing power. In such applications, they can be used to bolster or even replace existing power lines, thus offering infrastructure planners a new, versatile solution for transmission transition.
With several SATA projects in their pipeline, Fluence has now launched Utrastack, its “highest performance energy storage product to date.” To meet the complex requirements of TSOs, the new system comes with a set of advanced features, including fast response times in under 150 milliseconds, NOC interface and IT security, and high availability of more than 99%.
With such capabilities, Ultrastack can deliver a broad variety of patent pending controls applications and services, including reactive power and voltage regulation, black start, virtual synchronous machine, synthetic inertia, primary frequency control, emergency power contribution, auto gen control, and power oscillations damping.
Fluence now has several SATA projects in its pipeline. In 2021, it deployed a 1 MW/1 MWh in Lithuania, which served as a proof-of-concept for storage being an integral part of the power transmission network and maintaining grid stability and reliability through emergency power, frequency and voltage control, and synthetic inertia response. This has been followed by the ongoing rollout of four 50 MW / 50 MWh SATA projects in Lithuania.
In Germany, Fluence is currently in the process of supplying TransnetBW, the TSO in the state of Baden-Württemberg, with the 250 MW Netzbooster (Grid Booster) project. The system will be tasked with increasing the efficiency of the existing grid infrastructure and easing congestions by providing backup capacity to maintain power system stability in the event of network failure.
There are two more 100 MW grid booster projects in the planning which Germany’s TenneT has not awarded yet. On top of that, an additional 750 MW are being proposed by German TSOs, according to the first draft of their bi-annual network development plan 2037/45 published last week.
Elsewhere in Europe, Red Electrica is planning a tender for a SATA project to increase the utilization of interconnectors from the mainland to the Balearic islands. Meanwhile, a gigawatt-scale SATA pipeline is being formed in the UK where National Grid ESO procures grid-stability services, such as short circuit level and inertia, from privately-owned assets, under its Stability Pathfinder Phase 2 program.
Although the application of BESS as transmission assets is still in its fledgling stage, some market players and analysts see considerable promise in it. Research group S&P Global forecasts 17 GW/50 GWh of energy storage systems to be deployed globally through 2030 to enhance or defer investment into upgrading existing electricity network infrastructure.
