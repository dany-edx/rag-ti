The majority of Greece’s transmission and distribution lines belong to state-owned utility the Public Power Corporation (PPC).
Greece’s environment and energy minister, Kostas Skrekas, said €2.1 billion was the highest offer for the privatization of a public enterprize in the nation’s history. 
The PPC this month revealed the interested bidders also included Luxembourg-headquartered private equity group CVC Capital Partners; the Mitsubishi Banking Corp-owned First Sentier Investors Group; and New York-based investor KKR Group, as the eight-month sale process entered its final stage.
The windfall is much greater than the utility could have expected two years ago, as high borrowing costs and record losses hamstrung the electric company.
The New Democracy government elected in 2019 shifted energy policy towards renewables and has pledged to phase coal out by 2025. Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his cabinet have also adopted a new electric vehicle (EV) law and are preparing the country’s first energy storage policy and tenders.
The part privatization of the distribution grid will enable the PPC to pay down debt and finance its investment plans.
With the company under new management since the election, and having pivoted from coal towards solar, EV and storage investment, stated plans to devote a chunk of the nation's post-Covid, ‘recovery and resilience facility‘ EU funding towards upgrading the distribution network give a pointer to where some of the Macquarie cash is likely to be diverted.
A greener energy system will require a more powerful and dynamic electric distribution network, able to accommodate and manage higher amounts of intermittent renewable energy. 
With the EU funding needing to be matched by private investment, €2.1 billion is not a bad start.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/13/keeping-track-of-chlorine-in-perovskite-stability/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2021",Keeping track of chlorine in perovskite stability,"As our understanding of perovskite solar cells improves, scientists are looking deeper and deeper into the material to observe the structure, the way electrons flow through it, and any obstacles limiting the performance.
Defects in the material, particularly at the boundaries between crystal grains, have been shown to cause problems, causing the structure to quickly degrade when exposed to UV light or moisture. Among the many approaches suggested to solve this, doping the cells with chlorine has shown significant improvements.
However, scientists have struggled to explain why chlorine had these effects, or whether it even remained present in the material after deposition. This was the starting point for a group of scientists led by the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST). “The research community had no idea why they were seeing these improvements,” explained OIST scientist Afshan Jamshaid. “Once added, the researchers couldn’t track the chlorine – they couldn’t tell whether the chlorine was incorporated deep into the perovskite material, stayed at the surface or even left the material during the manufacturing process.”
Aiming to provide a definitive answer, Jamshaid and the group set out to fabricate chlorine doped perovskite solar films and pry into their structure right down to the atomic level, to confirm the presence or absence of chlorine. Using an imaging technique called scanning tunnelling microscopy, they observed dark depressions on the surface of the films, which were not present in samples without the chlorine doping.

They were then able to calculate (with the help of collaborators at China’s Soochow University) that these dark patches were spots where chlorine had replaced iodine in the perovskite structure. And since more chlorine appeared to be present at the grain boundaries, they now suspect that chlorine serves to reduce the number of surface defects in the material, increasing its stability. Their work is described in full in the paper Atomic-scale insight into the enhanced surface stability of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite by controlled deposition of lead chloride, published in Energy & Environmental Science.
The group also trialled different deposition times, varying the final concentration of chlorine in the material. Through this, they are able to claim that 14.8% represents the ideal surface concentration of chlorine to boost stability. Any lower, and the improvements would be less pronounced, any higher and the chlorine will start to drastically alter other properties of the perovskite.
They plan to continue investigating how chlorine behaves as a dopant for perovskites, with the next step to create a fully operational solar cell based on a chlorine doped perovskite layer. “…fundamental studies like these are so important – they help device engineers pin down the most optimal manufacturing process without as much trial and error,” said Jamshaid. “By understanding how the dopants improve the material, it can also guide us towards new chemical mixes that might work even better.”

Described in the paper 24.58% efficient commercial n-type silicon solar cells with hydrogenation, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the novel technique consists of incorporating the hydrogenation step in the chemical passivation for the tunnelling oxide, polysilicon contact, during the high-temperature firing for metal contact formation. When applied to this process, hydrogen diffuses from the dielectric layer to the silicon dioxide/crystalline silicon and passivates interfacial defects. “The hydrogenation process was developed at UNSW and is incorporated into the production of n-type TOPCon ‘HOT’ solar cells in a fully industrial environment at JinkoSolar,” the researchers emphasized.
The cells were fabricated with monocrystalline 251.99 cm2 n-type silicon wafers that were diamond wire cut and pyramid textured using an alkaline texturing solution. Tunneling oxide was thermally grown on the cell rear side through a thermal oxidation furnace. Both sides were then passivated with a stack of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD), and hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx) layers, deposited through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). “Front silver/aluminium and rear silver contacts are screen printed with nine front busbars,” the scientists explained. “Cells are fired in a belt furnace to form the contacts, which also simultaneously allows hydrogen to diffuse throughout the bulk of the silicon.” The cells were then exposed to the hydrogenation treatment and heated to up to 600 degrees Celsius in a chamber for around one minute, which allows hydrogen to bond to dangling bonds and defects.
By measuring the performance of the solar cells, the researchers found that the cell's average open-circuit voltage increased by 7 mV, from 696 to 703 mV, and the average fill factor from 82.03% to 83.07%. “These improvements indicate enhanced bulk passivation and slight surface improvement from the dedicated hydrogenation process, above and beyond the hydrogenation that occurs during the firing process,” the Chinese-Australian team stated, noting that the average cell efficiency grew by 0.64%, from 23.51% to 24.15%.
The research team also developed a champion cell with an efficiency of 24.58% which was confirmed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This device also showed an open-circuit voltage of 10.45 V and a fill factor of 82.5%. “This result highlights the potential for incorporating an additional hydrogenation process following firing for the manufacture of commercial n-type TOPCon solar cells,” it concluded.

“The facility will have significant power generation capacity to meet peak demand, provide significant storage capacity to enable a larger penetration of renewable energ[y] and, because of its close location to two large demand centers, will alleviate increasing transmission loads on the grid,” the international financial institution said in a statement. “As a result, a more environmentally friendly and reliable supply of electricity will benefit consumers in Java and Bali.”
The $800 million facility is planned to be located 40km west of Bandung in West Java and will occupy an area across two water reservoirs in West Bandung regency and Cianjur regency. According to a document published last year by state-owned utility PT PLN (Persero), which owns the project, the plant will consist of four units with a capacity of 260 MW each and the facility's total pump capacity will be 1.1 GW and will be provided by an underground power plant. The generation duration is estimated at 6.5 hours per day and the pump duration at maximum input, at 8.5 hours per day.
One of the two dams is located at 75.5m and is already built, on the Cirumamis River while a second dam is planned to be constructed at 98m on the Cisokan River. A tunnel will connect the power station to the reservoir and two transmission lines will link the facility to the Cibinong-
Saguling network, which cannot handle additional load as it has almost reached its capacity limit. “Main construction activities are expected to take 50 months and are planned to be operational between 2024 [and] 2025,” the report reads.

An article posted on the site yesterday reported the Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects (KAPP) – which has taken over the tender for the gigawatt-scale solar field from the Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) – has received project proposals from companies vying for the engineering, procurement and construction services contract.
Previously reported as a 1 GW and 1.5 GW project, the solar field – which Energy and Utilities referred to as Al-Dibdibah – is now set to have a generation capacity of “up to 3 GW,” according to the trade news website, although the Dubai-based media organization also referred to the latest plans as a “1.5 GW project.”
The article appears to confirm a story reported by New York-controlled regional news website Zawya Middle East in January, that the project has been combined with the Shagaya renewables field being planned 100km west of Kuwait City. Berlin-based cleantech advisory Apricum wrote in a pv magazine article in June, that “Al Dibdibah” is part of the Shagaya project.
Energy and Utilities wrote bids had been received for a submission date of last Tuesday which had been extended from June 27 and July 27. The original, KPC tender for Dabdaba was supposed to have been completed in March 2018.
Dubai's Energy and Utilities report stated Shagaya has 50 MW of concentrating solar power generation capacity, plus 10 MW of solar and 10 MW of wind, installed as part of a pilot project, and implies Dabdaba will comprise the second phase of the clean power facility. Phase III, described as ‘Al Abrag' by Apricum, is expected to feature 1.2 GW of photovoltaics as part of a 2 GW extension of capacity which will take it to “almost 4GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030,” according to Energy and Utilities.
pv magazine is awaiting a reply from KPC about the status of the tender, having contacted the state entity in July last year and in January. The English-language version of the website of KAPP – the state body tasked with generating private-sector investment – had no updates related to Dabdaba this morning.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/13/solar-in-uncommon-spaces/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2021",Solar in uncommon spaces,"From pv magazine USA
Solar is at the forefront of climate mitigation efforts, but comes with some environmental baggage of its own. One concern is the amount of land needed for the energy revolution, especially as more utility-scale solar projects are brought forward.
In July, for example, developers of a proposed 850 MW solar plant in the desert north of Las Vegas pulled their application with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in the wake of local opposition. Residents argued that the array, proposed to cover more than 14 square miles, would be an eyesore and could hurt area recreational activities.
A study by Clemson University estimated that energy production for domestic use and export will rise by 27% by 2040. Roughly 124,000 square miles of land will be needed to site all of the related facilities. With spacing requirements included, nearly 500,000 square miles of land will need to be dedicated to new energy production – an area larger than Texas.
To be sure, locations across the built environment (rooftops, carports, and the like) are common places for solar installations. The benefits of these distributed sites are numerous. But if the nation is to rapidly hit clean energy penetration targets, then large-scale projects with big footprints are needed as well. 
Not all large-scale solar deployments need to be sited on vacant spaces or farmland, however. Three options include floatovoltaics, landfill solar, and highway rights-of-way. Let’s have a look at each in turn.
Land or sea?
Floatovoltaics are a hot PV trend set to double in capacity in 2021. The structures largely take land use debates off the table, as the solar array floats on top of a body of water. Typically, these installations are found buoyed-up on a lake or basin, where the water is calmer than the ocean.
Dual-use locations are often sites for these projects. Reservoirs, hydroelectric dam water sources, and wastewater treatment ponds are all potential candidates to host floatovoltaics. 
Take the Far Niente Winery in Napa Valley, California, for example. Completed in 2008, it is widely considered to be the first grid-connected floatovoltaic array in the world. To meet annual demand of 800,000 kWh, the solar array uses 2,296 panels, 1,200 of which sit on top of the winery’s irrigation reservoir, reserving nearby vineyard space for grape production.  
The buoyant structure that supports the panels was a simple, yet clever solution. Pontoons made of 18-inch ribbed pipe filled with styrofoam sit beneath the panels and are attached to four concrete mounts. The array can freely rise and fall 18 feet as water is used, and the concrete mounts prevent the modules from rotating and ensure an optimal azimuth.
What’s more, the array reduces evaporation by covering and cooling the water. This same effect also prevents the spread of unwanted algae. In turn, the pond benefits the panels, acting as a stable thermal mass that regulates temperature, slowing panel degradation and increasing efficiency.
An example of how such projects be effective comes from the Sembcorp Floating Solar, a 60 MW FPV array on the Tengeh Reservior in Singapore, which recently entered service. The system’s 122,000 Trina Solar 210 Vertex dual-glass modules, which cover a surface area the size of 45 football fields, deliver green energy from Singapore’s main reservoir of drinking water via a 25-year power purchase agreement with the National Water Agency.
Singapore’s Public Utilities Board said it selected Trina Solar modules due to their double-glass protection, which will aid in making them durable enough to perform in wet and humid conditions for 25 years. The panels are supported by high-density polyethylene (HDPE) floats. The floats are UV-resistant, a necessity to protect them from degradation.
When evaluating the effectiveness of floating PV, cost is likely a first concern as these structures have unique construction mounting (or docking) needs. However, cost parity may be closer than one may expect. Floating PV has slightly higher capital costs, but lower operation and management costs, no land costs, and increased efficiency benefits the cost structure.
According to Stetson Tchividjian, director of business development at D3Energy, an FPV developer, the price to install floating solar is about 10% to 15% higher than land-based PV. However, O&M cost reductions may help close the gap. If the externalities that stem from developing otherwise-useful land are included, then the economics behind floating solar may keep a project above water.
Landfill opportunity
Landfills and other contaminated brownfield sites are another area for growth. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency tracks solar-landfill topping installations as part of its RE-Powering America’s Land initiative, and has recorded an 80% rise in installations in the last five years. Nearly 60% of the tracked projects sit on landfills, and more than 90% of the RE-Powering projects are solar PV.
Most of the sites are either municipally or privately owned, with about 1.5 GW of the 1.8 GW installed capacity falling under those ownership structures. Two-thirds of the projects sell power back to the grid, and 22% of the tracked sites are community solar projects. Nearly 70% of these facilities offer 1 MW or more of capacity.
Massachusetts currently leads the field with 30% of the country’s landfill projects. EPA said that a favorable policy climate is important to supporting brownfield sites. Massachusetts’ SMART Program offers enhanced incentives for landfill and brownfield development and built a fast-track for the approval process of these projects, hence the state’s leadership in this arena.
New Jersey and Illinois have also made strides in policy and utility involvement, said the EPA. One of the largest is the 50 MW Sunnyside solar facility, planned to top a 240-acre Houston landfill and enter service by the end of 2022. Sunnyside’s procurement came as a result of the city’s Climate Action Plan.
Typically, installers are not allowed to penetrate the landfill’s surface, and mounting hardware and foundational structures must be adaptable and lighter than in a conventional ground-mount design. For example, mounting supplier Solar FlexRack provided cast-in-place racks for a community solar landfill development south of Provo, Utah. The mounting system used lighter ballasts with internal bracing and fewer components than a typical solar mount.
Lighter mounts, less expensive land, and environmentally minded policy are all drivers that can push costs down for solar landfills. 
Highway PV 
Highway right-of-way (ROW) areas offer unique qualities that lend themselves to solar installations. For example, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) explained that ROW areas offer ease of access to the adjacent solar facilities and transmission lines often follow highway alignments.  What’s more, ROWs have well-maintained vegetation and few trees or other shading elements.
The CDOT study noted a number of potential safety and quality issues with ROW PV. The top concerns included snow drift and deposition, panel glint and glare, water quality management issues, driver safety in collisions, and safe access for maintenance.
As a result of the study, CDOT created a series of tools for properly siting solar projects. The tools included glint and glare hazard models, array siting criteria, an impact matrix and mitigation strategies.
Highway ROW solar has been deployed in Europe for more than 30 years, and innovations continue to be introduced. For example, a Belgian consortium created two testing facilities to develop PV-equipped noise barriers for use where land and policy constraints make ground-mounted solar plants nearly impossible to install. 
The dual-use structure must first function as a sound barrier, which may limit the accompanying PV production. Modules are covered with a transparent sound dampening layer that the researchers said cut production by about 30%.
In the United States, the land area available for ROW installations can be tight and is generally best left for highway interchanges and exits, according to a study by the University of Texas at Austin’s Webber Energy Group. 
The study found that most states have more than 200 miles of suitable interstate frontage available. That amounts to between 440 and 6,600 acres of preferable install site area per state. Each state had an identified potential of anywhere from 127 to 1,814 GWh per year, with Texas sitting in the top spot. California and Illinois ranked second and third in potential.
The Texas researchers identified a need for GIS data to better support the development of ROW solar. Iowa was the only state included in the that had completed detailed highway interchange profiles to facilitate the transition to solar site planning.

The project is the first solar power station planned by the company, which currently owns and operates 6.4 GW of hydropower assets across the country and is also planning to build both onshore and offshore wind power plants.
According to Romanian media outlet Profit.ro, the new solar park will require an investment of ROL193 million ($42.6 million) and will be the main bulk of a plan to deploy 50 MW of PV capacity in the country, with the remaining 5 MW being represented by small-scale floating PV arrays spread across its numerous hydropower plants.
Profit.ro also reports that in March, Hidroelectrica was interested in acquiring a 153 MW PV project under development by local real estate developer Portland Trust. In August, however, the project was bought by Israel-based renewable energy company Nofar Energy.
Romania's PV project pipeline has increased considerably in recent months. In early September, the Romanian energy supplier OMV Petrom – majority-owned by Austrian business OMV – said it wants to build a 111 MW solar power plant at a former chemical plant in Işalniţa, Dolj county, in southwestern Romania. Furthermore, there is a 700 MW project that is set to be spread across the municipalities of Grăniceri and Pilu, and another one under development by CE Oltenia, which wants to deploy 310 MW at one of its coal power facilities.
In May 2020, the Romanian government introduced more favorable rules for power purchase agreements.

The Renewable Energy Pipeline proposed by Indonesia's Department for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (Energi Baru Terbarukan dan Konservasi Energi) and the Danish Energy Agency has called for 2,379 MW of solar generation capacity to be added next year, as part of 6,713 MW of new projects by 2025, and 14,867 MW by 2030.
Far from being over-ambitious, the authors of the document stated developers have already committed to around 2.82 GW of new solar by 2025, and 7.87 GW this decade.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
With Indonesian solar tenders having recently established prices of around $0.04/kWh, and expected to hit $0.037 in the next round of awards, the report's authors estimated new solar farms will be competitive against legacy coal plants in 2023.
Similar cost calculations, however, prompted the authors of the study to discount widespread deployment of solar-plus-storage projects at this stage as the price of energy storage tech would reduce competitiveness. The document states the Indonesian grid can cope with the scale of intermittent renewables planned in the strategy without the need for energy storage at this point.
The regional plan considers five renewable energy technologies, although it acknowledges the risk associated with the suggested dominance of geothermal – alongside hydro – in many regions, given the uncertain nature of the costs and lead times associated with the former. Discounting geothermal would require another 7 GW of solar by 2025, the study stated, for 13.7 GW of new photovoltaic capacity by that stage.
Although the largest volume of new generation capacity is envisaged in the Java-Bali region – 1,058 MW next year, 3,298 MW by 2025, and 6,738 MW by 2030 – solar would supply only 1.8% of the renewable electricity needed in that zone to keep Indonesia on track with its clean energy targets.
PV modules would generate around 2% of the clean power needed nationally under the proposed regional plan and the solar contribution would amount to 4.5% in Nusa Tenggara, achieved by adding 131 MW of generation capacity next year, 161 MW by 2025, and 511 MW this decade. Some 401 MW of solar in Kalimantan next year, as part of 924 MW in four years' time, and 2,504 MW by 2030, would see photovoltaics supply 3.7% of that region's clean electricity.
Just 15 MW of panels in Papua next year, as part of subsequent totals of 75 MW and 255 MW of new solar, would see PV generate 2.5% of that region's clean electricity, and Sulawesi would rely on solar for 2.3% of its renewable energy, thanks to 279 MW next year, as part of 2025 and 2030 numbers of 729 MW and 1,629 MW, respectively.
Solar's smallest contribution is suggested in Maluku, which would require just 25 MW of project capacity next year, towards 55 MW in 2025, and 155 MW in 2030.
In terms of already planned capacity, Java-Bali has the highest figure, with solar developers having announced 4,195 MW of opportunities. The next highest figure is the 943 MW of solar projects planned in Sumatra. The latter region is earmarked to have the next largest volumes of solar added after Java-Bali, under the regional proposal, with 471 MW required next year, as part of 1,471 MW by 2025, and 3,075 MW by 2030.

“The overall investment plan will include a 3.1 GW production capacity expansion in Korea, with the plan being to expand Q Cells’ Korean production capacity to 7.6 GW by 2025,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Some of the funds from this investment pledge will be steered towards TOPCon and tandem perovskite technology … however, the 1.5 trillion figure is intended to be invested into a number of avenues.”
“The expanded production capacity will include perovskite and TOPCon lines, but it is as yet undetermined what precise capacity this will be,” the spokesperson went on to say, without providing further details.
The South Korean market is expected to see the deployment of more than 15 GW of PV capacity by the end of the decade and several domestic manufacturers are competing to secure a slice of this cake, including module manufacturer Hyundai Energy Solutions, among others. Hyundai is planning to build a 1.37 GW facility and recently opened a 750 MW panel factory in Eumseong county, in South Korea's North Chungcheong province, which brought its current module capacity of 1.35 GW.
South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (Motie) introduced carbon footprint rules for solar modules in May 2020. These rules are similar to those applied in France, where large scale solar tenders take low-carbon manufacturing into account, as well as the price developers agree to accept for the power generated. South Korea, like France, has an extensive nuclear power generation capacity which aids the low-carbon efforts of domestic solar panel manufacturers.

The Norwegian consortium includes floating PV specialist Ocean Sun, independent research organization Sintef, software provider Prediktor, the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), and Norwegian solar industry body the Solenergiklyngen. 
“[A] Scatec power plant will be planned, for hybrid hydropower and floating solar right from the beginning, as a first in the world,” Ocean Sun CEO Børge Bjørneklett told pv magazine. “Normally, floating solar power is an add-on to existing hydropower plants but this project will be developed specifically as a greenfield combo plant with overall low LCOE. PV and hydropower are complementary on a seasonal basis and hydropower can convert intermittent PV into higher-value steady power.”
The project includes the development of a platform for planning, scaling, and optimizing the operation of hybrid power plants. According to Bjørneklett, the optimization of the two power-generating elements gives benefits for water remediation technology and the dimensioning of the reservoir and the basin, as well as for defining early production levels from the solar plant during the construction phase. The project will also explore adaptations of the Ocean Sun system for amphibious use during the gradual filling of the reservoir.”
According to him, reduced water evaporation and PV cooling effects will be of key importance in the project. “Together with Prediktor and internet-of-things experts, the consortium will develop novel control mechanisms for the optimization and fine-tuning of the hybrid power [plant's] production,” the CEO stated.
No more technical or financial details of the project were revealed.
Scatec recently acquired the SN Power hydropower operator belonging to Norwegian state-owned private equity business Norfund. SN Power has 2.5 GW of hydro assets in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. “Hydropower and solar PV are complementary technologies, resulting in new project opportunities, for instance floating solar on hydro reservoirs,” said Scatec Solar CEO Raymond Carlsen in October 2020, when the operation was finalized. “With this transaction, we see great potential in broader project origination and geographical expansion into growth markets in South East Asia and sub-Sahara[n] Africa.”
Ocean Sun has developed an innovative design for floating PV projects at near-shore locations and in semi-sheltered waters. The patented system consists of PV modules on floating membranes, inside buoyancy rings anchored to the seabed. with four mooring points and 12 lines.
Sintef recently unveiled a special floating structure that Norwegian energy company Equinor wants to deploy in offshore waters. The structure is built with an anchoring system that is claimed to give the installation enough freedom to cope with the waves.

India aims to develop the world’s largest clean energy program by 2022, with 175 GW of renewable energy capacity, including 100 GW of solar power. By 2030, the country’s power demand will be 817 GW, with more than half of that coming from clean energy and 280 GW coming from solar energy alone.
One of the key selling features that have helped solar power become the world’s fastest-growing energy source is cost reduction, which has just encountered a snag due to recent increases in solar module pricing. Solar module prices have increased by 18% since the beginning of 2021, after plummeting by 90% over the previous decade.
The value of projects awarded in the last six to nine months will be impacted by a rise in solar PV module prices. The government intends to impose a 40% basic customs duty (BCD) on solar modules and a 25% BCD on solar cells beginning April 1, 2022. This is one of the first stages toward the capacity secured by developers through the procurement process over the last six to nine months at rates ranging mostly between INR 2.00 ($0.03) and 2.25 per unit (kWh), with units scheduled to be commissioned over the following 12 to 15 months.
The price increase is mostly due to a significant increase in the price of polysilicon, a vital input for cell and module manufacturing. Metal prices have recently increased, putting pressure on the overall capital cost of solar-generating installations. Chinese module manufacturers have recently hiked their costs by more than one-fifth and have started canceling contracts to provide equipment.
For most solar power projects in India, imports are heavily reliant on PV modules. Therefore, if PV module prices continues to rise, it will be a near-term headwind. It has a significant influence on solar projects in two ways: It delays them past their deadlines and slows the uptake of solar power, precisely as numerous major economies have begun to recognize the role of solar power in reducing climate change.
PV module components account for roughly 50% to 55% of total project costs. Therefore a sustained increase in module prices of about 4% to 5% per watt will have a 12 to 14 basis point impact on project developers’ debt service coverage criteria. The tariff increase needed to counterbalance such a module price rise is expected to be around 20 to 22 paise per unit. The impact on the imported PV modules is expected to raise the overall bid tariff for the upcoming auctions by around 55 to 60 paise/unit. After accounting for the dual impact, the solar bid tariff is projected to remain below the INR 3/unit.
As the notification for cells and modules takes effect in April 2022, both the module price behavior and the completion of supply contracts by Chinese module original equipment manufacturer (OEMs) will continue to be important factors for solar power providers. The considerable ambiguity surrounding the deadlines for the inclusion of Chinese module providers on the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) may have an impact on the solar power sector’s incremental bidding activity.
The cost of solar panels has risen, and investment returns may suffer as a result. This sharp surge in prices has alarmed developers who have won projects that are yet to be commissioned, as 85% to 90% of solar modules used in India are imported from China.
Modules account for a huge percentage of a project’s total costs, and since independent power providers (IPPs) have lower margins in the Indian solar energy sector, even a small increase in module pricing will put them under more strain. For projects that have already signed a power purchase agreement, the increase in module costs has an influence on the internal rate of return. Unless the customer is willing to pay a higher electricity tariff, large-scale projects that are yet to negotiate PPAs with utilities may be delayed.
The polysilicon shortfall is expected to last at least through the first half of 2022. Other raw material prices, such as silver and glass, are also on the rise, so it will affect the entire ecosystem.
The viability of all the projects will be a major concern. About 50% of projects will be able to keep themselves viable depending on the number of days they get to work after the delivery of panels. Large project developers are finding it difficult to maintain their projects profitable after buying panels in the final phase of development, that is, 10 to 12 months after signing the PPA. The significant rise in steel prices, as well as the uncertainty surrounding safeguard duty, have contributed to their misery.
The recently established Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme will improve solar panel availability in India, stabilizing project costs in the future. Distribution companies are experiencing financial difficulties, and tariff changes are sporadic and insufficient. As a result, most private players cannot rely on power markets alone to stay profitable. They have to rely on repeated injections of liquidity through schemes like UDAY (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana) and entities like Power Finance Corporation Ltd. Because it’s impossible to forecast where the next subsidy will come from, scale and sprawl develop.
Large corporations integrate vertically to ensure that they are one of the beneficiaries of any subsidies that are implemented. The unpredictability of knowing where the next subsidy will come from leads to scale and sprawl. Large companies integrate vertically to make sure that wherever the subsidies kick in, they are one of the beneficiaries. As long as some arm of the Indian state is paying or injecting liquidity, solar companies can use it to keep the rest of the power business afloat.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/13/south-australian-electricity-networks-rooftop-pv-trial-set-for-launch/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2021",South Australian electricity network’s rooftop PV trial set for launch,"From pv magazine Australia
Sept. 23 will mark the start of SA Power Networks’ (SAPN) 12-month Flexible Exports Trial, which has the potential to double the amount of rooftop PV participating in the South Australian electricity network, by using smart technology to manage the flow of solar exports in response to congestion signals.
New and upgrading solar customers in parts of the grid that can’t handle more solar feed-in at certain times of the day, for short periods of the year, will no longer be limited to a year-round 5 kW of solar exports. That measure was introduced to protect grid stability, but it has proved to be a blunt instrument that unfairly affects new solar customers, compared to those who got in early and have been unrestricted in their exports.
“We are in the early stages of this new technology, and Flexible Exports is a world first that will help us accommodate more solar on our network,” said Mark Vincent,  SAPN’s general manager of strategy and transformation.
Flexible Exports will initially allow new systems connecting in the most solar-loaded of Adelaide’s southern suburbs to make a great leap in export capacity, if they are prepared to install compatible smart inverters – from either the Fronius SnapINverter Primo series or the GroWatt MIN-TLX line – paired with the energy-management technology of Australian company SwitchDin’s Droplet gateway.
“Based on network conditions experienced over the past 12 months, the flexible option would allow customers the opportunity to export 10kW for 98% of the time,” said Vincent.
To put it another way, intelligent flexible connection technology will allow new solar-equipped customers in the operating radius of the Sheidow Park substation, where more than 46% of households already have solar on top, to export more energy by reducing exports only when the network is actually constrained.
Flexible Exports “will quantify the extra value this can create for solar customers in constrained areas compared to zero-near-zero export limits, informing the business case for DNSPs to invest in this capability,” said the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), when the project was announced in July.
ARENA is supporting the AUD 4.84 million ($3.6 million) project with AUD 2.08 million in funding. It said it aims to verify a system that can give customers “greater choice, the ability to export more from their solar panels, access to cheaper energy, and improved security and quality of supply – all without costly network upgrades.”
Participation is not mandatory. Those in the shadow of Sheidow Park substation who would prefer to use other inverter brands will still be connected, but with a 1.5 kW export limit, because on a few occasions each year – typically on mild-sunny days in spring, when solar is pumping around the middle of the day, and the demand of air conditioners has not yet cut in – the system can no longer cope with more exports at even 5 kW.
Existing customers and those upgrading in other parts of the network that aren’t congested are not affected by the Flexible Exports Trial, and will continue to be able to export up to 5 kW.
As the trial begins, Fronius and SMA inverter providers in Australia are simultaneously working to provide inverters with built-in capability to manage flexible exports, such that they won’t require the mediation of the Droplet tech. And the range of Droplet-compatible inverter systems will also be expanded over time.
The specially enabled inverters will automatically adjust their export limits every five minutes in response to locational, dynamic limit signals issued by SAPN, the distribution network service provider (DNSP).
“We expect that once we have proven the technology and assessed the customer experience that this will become a standard offer for new solar customers in South Australia from mid-2022,” Vincent said. “It is part of our plan to double the amount of solar that we can accommodate on our network by 2025.”
SAPN was instrumental in proposing what has become a controversial rule change by the Australian Electricity Market Operator, which, in brief, will allow networks to apply to upgrade the distribution network — whether with innovative fixes such as the dynamic exports being trialed in this project, or with physical upgrades to the system — to support greater solar integration, and charge solar customers a tariff for those upgrades.
In an interview with pv magazine Australia in June, Bryn Williams – network strategy manager at SAPN – said the rule change would support changes to the ability of the network to host more distributed renewable energy.
“In the future, we can consider pricing arrangements that pass on the component of our costs associated with enabling more energy to be fed in, to the people who are using that, separate to charging for simply maintaining the network etc which will continue to be recovered through the normal charges on energy consumed from the grid,” he said.
Energy Networks Australia, the industry body representing gas and electricity distribution and electricity transmission networks, welcomed the commencement of the 12-month trial.
ENA Chief Executive Andrew Dillon said he believes “the SA trial will have implications not only for the rest of Australia, but internationally.”
