The lab-scale coin-cell prototype has achieved lifetime battery charge rates as fast as three minutes with more than 10,000 cycles. The scientists published their results in Nature and other journals last year. Now, Harvard’s Office of Technology Development has granted an exclusive technology license to startup Adden Energy to develop innovative solid-state battery systems for use in future rapid-charging EVs. The company recently closed a $5.15 million funding round to help it scale Harvard’s lab prototype toward commercial deployment. It aims to develop the battery to a palm-sized pouch cell, and then to a full-scale vehicle battery within the next three to five years. “If you want to electrify vehicles, a solid-state battery is the way to go,” said Xin Li, associate professor of materials science at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and a scientific adviser to Adden Energy. “We don’t see any fundamental limit to scaling up our battery technology. That could be a game changer.”
Prologium has announced its first overseas gigafactory. The Taiwanese solid-state battery cell manufacturer said the facility, which will be built in Europe or the United States, will have an annual capacity of 120 GWh when completed. In Europe, the company has initiated a feasibility study for potential sites in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom. A final decision will be made in the first quarter of 2023. Construction is planned to take place in three phases and investments are expected to reach $8 billion over the next 10 years. ProLogium estimates that the plant will create more than 6,500 jobs by 2031. Earlier this year, Prologium announced big investments from Mecedes-Benz and Vietnamese EV manufacturer VinFast. The company plans to launch its first 3 GWh production plant in early 2023, with a significant proportion of its production capacity reserved for VinFast.
SVOLT said it is making significant strides in solid-state battery development. It recently produced a first batch of 20 Ah cells with sulfide-based solid electrolyte, which made it the first battery manufacturer in China to demonstrate the production of this type of solid-state cell. The prototype solid-state cells have an energy density of 350 Wh to 400 Wh/kg, promising a range of more than 1,000 kilometers for EVs. SVOLT recently completed abuse tests, such as a 200 C hot box test and a nail puncture test in which its new 20Ah cells survived unscathed. SVOLT’s Wuxi Lithium Battery Innovation Center and the Ningbo China Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences established a joint research center for solid-state battery technology in April 2021. Since then, it has filed 187 patents. The company plans to further expand its R&D in the field of solid-state batteries, as well as in new process technologies to further develop the technological basis for mass production.
Factorial Energy – a US developer of solid-state battery cells for EVs, backed by Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Hyundai Motor – has begun construction of a new production facility near Boston. It will house Factorial’s pilot production facility, which will manufacture automotive-sized solid-state batteries at pre-production speed and volume. Factorial will invest $45 million in the facility, which is expected to begin operations in early 2023. Last year, the Massachusetts-based startup announced a major breakthrough when it achieved a capacity retention rate of 97.3% after 675 cycles for its 40 Amp-hour (Ah) solid-state product at room temperature.
Toyota has announced an investment of up to JPY 730 billion ($5.2 billion) for EV battery production in Japan and the United States. The new facilities, scheduled to start production between 2024 and 2026, will increase Toyota’s battery production capacity by up to 40 GWh. Specifically, the Japanese carmaker will invest around JPY 400 billion in Himeji Prime Planet Energy and Solutions. The battery joint venture between Toyota and Panasonic specializes in prismatic automotive batteries. It will also invest JPY 325 billion in its newest North American facility, Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina.
Honda and LG Energy Solution have announced plans to build a new $4.4 billion lithium-ion battery plant in the United States to meet demand in the rapidly growing North American EV market. The plant will have an annual production capacity of approximately 40 GWh. The pouch-type batteries produced at the new joint venture plant will be supplied exclusively to Honda facilities in North America and will be used in Honda and Acura electric models. While the location for the joint venture plant is yet to be finalized, the two companies aim to begin construction in early 2023, in order to enable the start of mass production by the end of 2025. In August, Honda’s Acura subsidiary announced its first all-electric model. The Acura ZDX SUV is based on the Ultium platform from General Motors and is scheduled for market launch in 2024.
BMW Group said it is commencing in-house, small-scale production of fuel cells for its iX5 in Munich, Germany. The small series of hydrogen cars will go into service in the next four months for test and demonstration purposes, targeting the premium segment. The fuel cells generate a high continuous output of 125 kW/170 hp, paired with an electric motor featuring fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and a battery that enables the powertrain to deliver 275 kW/374 hp. BMW has collaborated with Toyota Motor on fuel cells since 2013.
Ganfeng Lithium announced plans last week to invest CNY 21.3 billion ($3.07 billion) in four new production centers. Solar power storage devices will be among the products to be produced at a CNY 6.2 billion fab in Xinyu, Jiangxi province, with an annual production capacity of 10 GWh to be built by October 2023, and at a separate, 6 GWh, CNY 3.5 billion site nearby. A CNY 9.6 billion, 20 GWh facility in Chongqing will make solid-state lithium products for electric vehicles and other transport uses. It is set to have a two-year timetable, with construction to start three months after the land paperwork is signed. A fourth, CNY 2 billion fab will produce 2 billion units per year of small polymer lithium-ion devices for items such as consumer and wearable electronics. Ganfeng Lithium last week posted first-half net profits of CNY 7.35 billion.

Longi has added another half-cell model to its HiMO5 monocrystalline solar module series.
The new product is based on M10 wafers with 66 solar cells and a newly designed frame. The Chinese solar panel maker said it was specially developed for the European PV market. The special module configuration also enables installation in landscape format, as the panels can also be fixed to the short side of the frame, it added, noting that it designed it this way to optimize the installation of solar modules in ground-mounted systems.
Longi claims that the new modules make system planning significantly more flexible, especially in the power plant segment, thanks to the landscape format. The modules are compatible with standard mounting systems on the market.
With the option of fixing it to the short side of the frame, there is less installation and material expenditure than witb conventional solar modules of comparable size. As an example, Longi noted that six-row landscape format systems can be implemented, which would otherwise require significantly more mounting rails and module clamps.

Royal Dutch Shell and Green Tie Capital have signed a framework agreement to develop more than 2 GW of solar projects in Spain.
A Shell spokesperson told pv magazine that the new projects will be spread throughout Spain. Some of them already have grid connections, while others will allow Shell to participate in upcoming grid capacity auctions.
Shell entered the Spanish renewables market in 2018 and its project pipeline has since surpassed 1 GW, the spokesperson said. Its energy marketing and sales team has signed several solar power purchase agreements in Spain with companies such as Solaria.
Earlier this year, Shell bid for Q-Energy's 1 billion PV portfolio, which included 4.5 GW of projects under development and 80 MW of operational assets. Naturgy and Verbund also competed for the portfolio and the latter was the final winner.
“This new partnership expands our activities in Spain. It is a firm step toward the growth of the onshore energy business in southern Europe,” said Roberto Jiménez Chaves, Shell's general manager for onshore energy in Europe.
Seville-based Green Tie Capital has developed more than 3 GW of ground-mount projects in Spain.

Mecwin has unveiled its new Li Power Lite series of wall-mountable lithium battery inverters. The all-in-one systems come in 1,100 VA and 2,100 VA ratings, with operating voltages of 12.8 V and 25.6 V, respectively. 
The system’s built-in lithium (LFP) batteries can be charged with solar as well as grid electricity. 
“Since this is a hybrid version, it will auto-select solar power source first for battery charging and support load during the daytime, which reduces the power consumption for battery charging and saves the electricity cost for our users,” said the company. “This inverter also has an inbuilt battery management system that helps to keep every cell in healthy condition and enhances the life of LFP batteries.” 
Lakshmi Narayana Pacha, the CMO of Mecwin India, noted that tubular [lead-acid] batteries are widely used in India for inverter applications.
“These batteries are unsafedue to acid spillage and require frequent maintenance and large space,” said Pacha. “[In comparison], our Mecwin Li Power Lite series is wall-mountable, zero maintenance, and highly safe with inbuilt BMS.”
The system supports AC loads like computers, lights, fans, TVs, routers, and printers. It is recommended for individual homes, farmhouses, retail shops, restaurants, and internet cafes.
The 1,100 VA model supports an 880 W load and provides two hours of power backup at full load and four-hour backup at 50% load. The 2,100 VA model supports a 1,680 W load and can give power backup for two hours at full load and four hours at 50% load. 
Three 330 Wp panels can be connected to the 1,100 VA system, whereas the 2,100 VA system can take a maximum of six panels of 330 W each. The 1,100 VA system uses a 12.8V, 86 Ah LiFePo4 battery with a storage capacity of 1.1 kWh. The 2,100 VA system uses a 25.6V, 86Ah LiFePo4 battery with a storage capacity of 2.2 kWh. The 1,100 VA system measures 455 mm x 530 mm x 235 mm and weighs 23 kg.

Analysts say the government should have paid more attention to renewable energy to avoid the electricity situation it faces now.
Last week, Bangladesh’s junior power minister, Nasrul Hamid, said the government is now focusing on renewables generation to overcome the current power crisis. He said research is underway on solar, wind, water and waste. The government is also looking at hydrogen fuel and has lowered imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to price increases, he said.
“We have plans to generate 5,000 MW more electricity from renewable sources for which setting up of 32 projects are underway to generate 1,442 MW of power,” said the minister.
He added that a process is now underway to generate 4,632MW of power from renewable energy, via 76 more projects. At present, 910.82 MW of electricity is generated from renewable energy sources in Bangladesh – mainly from solar.
Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, said more renewable energy is the only way to overcome the electricity crisis.
“Had the government gave proper attention on renewable energy generation in time, the present shortage of electricity could have been met from there,” he said, noting that 4,000 garment factories in Bangladesh could host rooftop PV arrays.
“The government will have to extend cooperation to renewable energy generation like what has been given to other energy sources to help flourish clan energy production,” said Barua.

It said the Integ M 3-8kW has a modern appearance, advanced performance, easy installation, and stable long-term operation.
“It supports PV input current up to 15 A, which is compatible with all mainstream solar modules in the market to prevent power loss due to the current limit of high-power modules,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
There are seven versions of the inverters, with nominal power ranging from 3 kW to 9 kW, an efficiency rating of 97.6%, and a European efficiency of 97.0%. They measure 534 mm × 418 mm × 210 mm and weigh 27 kg.
The maximum input voltage is 600 V and the MPP voltage range is between 100 V and 550 V. The inverters also feature IP65-rated protection and have cooling systems based on natural convection.
“On the battery side, products with a wide battery voltage range of allow flexible battery capacity configuration,” the spokesperson said. “Furthermore, with a big charge/discharge current of up to 30A, the inverter can charge and discharge the battery in a shorter time with a higher power which can satisfy the higher demand of energy consumption or trading.”
The new product also features 10ms UPS-level switching, which results in an imperceptible speed of power switchover when power outages occur. It can therefore ensure the continuous operation of the uninterrupted load, the manufacturer said.
“From the user's point of view, the product's intelligent design such as bidirectional data management of OLED display and APP and WIFI configuration via APP makes the setting, debugging, monitoring, and management of the equipment more convenient,” the spokesperson added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/05/zinc8-to-manufacture-its-first-zinc-air-batteries-in-us-market/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2022",Zinc8 to manufacture its first zinc-air batteries in US market,"From pv magazine USA
Zinc8 Energy Solutions has announced that its inaugural commercial production facility will be built in Ulster County, New York. Based upon comprehensive analysis done by the company, the recently announced US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) manufacturing production credits provide distinct and direct benefits to Zinc8, influencing its production plans in the United States.
Zinc8 Energy Solutions has developed a proprietary flow battery technology that it claims is able to deliver power in the range from 20 kW to 50 MW that can store and discharge energy durations from 4 to 100 hours. Scalability and higher capacity is achieved with an increase in the size of storage tanks that hold zinc particles. The modular battery can be configured to support a wide array of long-duration applications for microgrids and utilities, as well as for commercial and industrial projects.
Unlike lithium-ion technology, which requires new stacks to scale, Zinc8 says it has completely decoupled the linkage between energy and power. This means that scaling Zinc8’s technology can be accomplished by simply increasing the size of the fuel tank and quantity of recharged zinc fuel.  According to the manufacturer, the technology promises zero capacity fade over an extensive lifetime, and the batteries are non-flammable, non-toxic and sustainable with stable supply chains for mass production.
The company chose Ulster County in upstate New York after Senator Chuck Schumer personally called the CEO of Zinc8, Ron MacDonald, to urge the company to expand their operations in New York state and particularly to Ulster County.
The Canadian company was enticed to move to the USA as a result of the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit included in the IRA, which provides incentives to battery manufacturers as well as to critical mineral processing companies. Every eligible battery cell will receive a $35 credit, scaling with the capacity of the battery, with incentives to last at their initial level until 2029, before phasing down from 2030 to a phase out stage beginning in 2032.
There is also $10 billion support available for construction of clean energy tech factories, or for retrofitting existing factories with tools and production lines to make clean energy equipment and components.  President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $6 billion incentives to support R&D and production of batteries in the United States, which bolsters the domestic supply chain.
“This represents some direct and beneficial credit opportunities for Zinc8,” said MacDonald. “It is abundantly clear that with the introduction of the IRA, US policymakers, led by Senator Schumer, are taking real action by introducing incentives that benefit both the climate and the economy. We have received tremendous support both at the federal and state level as we continue to analyze possible sites for our first manufacturing facility.”
Zinc8 signed a letter of intent to move into iPark87, which is the former TechCity campus now being redeveloped as an EPA cleanup site. Schumer said that with Zinc8 as an anchor tenant of iPark87, the Hudson Valley could see up to 500 new, good paying clean energy jobs.
“Zinc8 is the jolt of electricity the Hudson Valley needs, and is proof positive that when you invest in fighting climate change you are investing in creating good-paying jobs, new economic growth, and a brighter future for our communities. As the EPA officially begins cleanup of this once-contaminated asbestos dumping ground, I can think of no better way to usher in a renaissance for Ulster County than by making this the foundation for supercharging the fight against climate change with an investment in clean tech manufacturing,” said Schumer.
In January, Zinc8 said it would install its technology at a New York City housing complex in a trial run by the New York State Energy Research and Development Agency (NYSERDA). The plan is for a 100kW/1.5MWh zinc-air energy storage system (ZESS) to be installed at Fresh Meadows Community Apartments in Queens, New York, to support and enhance the economics of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system currently under construction, along with an existing photovoltaic system.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/05/sundrive-achieves-26-41-efficiency-with-copper-based-solar-cell-tech/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2022",SunDrive achieves 26.41% efficiency with copper-based solar cell tech,"From pv magazine Australia
SunDrive has achieved an efficiency result of 26.41% on a full-size silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cell featuring its copper-based technology. It used large-scale production processes provided by China-headquartered equipment manufacturer Maxwell Technologies.
Sydney-based SunDrive said the results, which improve upon the 26.07% efficiency mark the company announced earlier this year, have been officially verified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany. The company said the improvement of the HJT cell, with a total area of 274.3 square centimeters (M6 size), had been observed in all three key performance parameters, including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc) and fill factor (FF). It attributed the improvements to “several equipment and processing upgrades.”
SunDrive said Maxwell’s latest generation chemical vapor deposition (CVD) equipment incorporates bifacial microcrystalline silicon layer deposition, further improving the rear-side passivation and contact resistance. In addition, more transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers were applied using Maxwell’s latest physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating equipment.
SunDrive said fabricating the solar cell electrodes using the company’s copper plating technology rather than traditional silver screen printing had also played a key role in the efficiency improvements. SunDrive, which replaces the silver used in conventional solar cells with the cheaper and more abundant copper, said it has refined its copper plating chemistry and processing sequence, achieving feature sizes of less than 10 µm with an aspect ratio close to one.
“What we have shown is that copper can effectively take silver’s place on these next-generation solar cell structures, but more importantly, efficiencies can be further increased beyond levels attainable with silver,” the company said.
With solar PV set to play a major role in the world’s transition to a clean energy future, SunDrive co-founder Vince Allen said copper is the key to unlocking the floodgates of more efficient solar cell structures and its use in place of silver could allow solar technology to reach its full potential.
“The solar cells that will provide the majority of the world’s future energy needs will be vastly different to the solar cells we have today,” Allen said. “Efficiency, cost and material scalability are fundamental for continued growth in solar adoption. Copper is around 100 times cheaper per kilogram and around 1,000 times more abundant than silver. And aside from the abundancy and cost benefits of copper, we have found we can improve the efficiency above and beyond what is attainable with silver.”
SunDrive will now push ahead with plans to establish a pilot production line by mid-2023, with scale up to market entry later in the year. While no location has been identified for the planned production facility, Allen said Australia has many of the ingredients required to host a solar manufacturing industry.
“We recognize that countries are increasingly competing in this space, however with the right policy setting, Australia has the potential to be a global solar manufacturing powerhouse,” he said. “We have the need – we have the fastest growing rooftop solar market in the world and Australia will likely also be home to the five largest solar farms in the next decade. We have the people – many of the world’s top solar executives, scientists and engineers were trained at Australian universities and we have the ability, today’s commercial solar cells were invented here in Australia and Australia has held the efficiency world record for 30 of the last 40 years.”
Allen said the nation is also blessed with resources deemed critical for the clean energy transition.
“Australia is in the top three for global reserves of every major mineral required to make a solar panel which no other country can claim,” he said. “Australia also likely has the greatest opportunity of any country to not just reach net zero but to help other countries reach net zero – it is the sunniest and windiest continent in the world with an extremely large land mass and very low population density.”

The European Commission waved through the plan this week under its state aid rules, with an unspecified proportion of the budget for the program to come out of the Covid-recovery funds secured from the EU by the member state.
pv magazine understands energy storage developers will have to offer a minimum discharge duration of two hours to be eligible for the program, with the total volume of storage capacity to be commissioned dependent on the results of a bidding process.
Under the program, energy storage project developers will bid competitively to secure the lowest annual support grants they will receive annually over the first decade their facilities operate. Successful bidders will also receive an investment grant during construction of their projects, with the Greek government committing to issue project awards next year and developers pledging to have them operational before 2026.
“Increasing available electricity storage capacity in the system is key to [making] grids more flexible and better prepared for a future in which renewables form the backbone of the decarbonized electricity mix,” said commission vice president responsible for competition, Margrethe Vestager. “The Greek aid measure we have approved today, which will be partly funded by the [Covid] Recovery and Resilience Facility, will contribute to the development of competitive markets for electricity system services while helping Greece meet its emission reduction targets.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/05/nano-grid-home-runs-solely-on-dc-power/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2022",Nano-grid home runs solely on DC power,"From pv magazine USA
While most homes run on alternating current (AC) power because that’s what comes from the utility lines from the grid, researchers at Purdue University decided to switch a home over to all direct current (DC) power.
Why? Back in the late 1800s Thomas Edison had a dream of a DC-based electrical infrastructure, but that dream lost to George Westinghouse’s AC system. In recent years, however, with renewable energy sources generating DC power, it would make a home more efficient if the electricity did not have to be converted to AC.
“We wanted to take a normal house and completely retrofit it with DC appliances and DC architecture,” said Eckhard Groll, the William E. and Florence E. Perry Head of Mechanical Engineering, and member of Purdue’s Center for High Performance Buildings. “To my knowledge, no other existing project has pursued an experimental demonstration of energy consumption improvements using DC power in a residential setting as extensively as we have.”
The project to transform a 1920s-era West Lafayette, Indiana home into the DC Nanogrid House began in 2017 under Groll’s direction. The first years were spent renovating and upgrading the infrastructure, and they added insulation and new windows to increase the home’s energy efficiency.
Rectify Solar provided a full installation of solar panels on the roof, while industry partners supplied new appliances and HVAC systems.  The rooftop solar system brings the all-electric home to net zero. Rectify installed Panasonic 330 panels rated for 14.3 MWh annual production, inverters from CE+T America, and a lithium iron phosphate POM Cube 20 kwh battery system, rated at 12.5 kW continuous power.
“Large-scale distribution of DC power through a house in the 21st century is really uncharted territory,” said Jonathan Ore, a 2020 Purdue Ph.D. graduate who served as the lead researcher on the project. “You can’t just go to the hardware store and buy DC circuit breakers or other critical distribution systems. We had to create this infrastructure from scratch.”
Purdue researchers, in collaboration with Rectify Solar, developed and jointly own a patented distribution system that enables the house to integrate both DC power from solar panels, wind turbines or battery storage with AC power from the local utility.
“The creation of the 380 V DC load center was definitely a challenging and rewarding experience,” said Phil Teague, co-founder and CEO of Rectify LLC. “We used biomimicry and the neural connections of the brain as our inspiration, and added smart technologies and control mechanisms. Transitioning to DC can simplify homes, buildings and the grid as a whole. This project helped me realize that DC is not only the future, it always was.”
“A DC-house can potentially sustain itself for short periods of time by generating its own renewable energy and detaching from the grid through the help of on-site stored energy,” said Ore. This ultimately minimizes the strain on the outside grid in emergency situations. Events like the Texas storm are perfect illustrations of how a DC-house can benefit individuals and the community.”
To monitor the DC home for its comfort and usability, graduate students are living in the home full time. They’ve installed sensors in every room to detect whether people are present so that the HVAC system only heats or cools the areas of the home that are in use.
“This gives us the opportunity to perform both cutting-edge research on energy-saving opportunities and observe its potential benefits in a truly real-world setting, rather than just relying on simulations,” Groll said.
“It’s been really amazing to see the interest in this,” Ore said. “We started this project as just a proof of concept. But as our country experiences more and more issues with the grid, companies are actively seeking to integrate our work. People are interested in it from every aspect: from the electrical side, from the thermal side, from the automation and management side. This is a perfect testbed to experiment with those technologies.”
Purdue innovators have worked with the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization to patent this technology. The researchers are seeking OEM partners to continue developing their technology and to take it to market.
As a result of this project, Phil Teague will be speaking at RE+ in Anaheim next month about this project on the topics of “DC is the Future, It Always Was”, and “DC Microgrid Design-Build Lessons Learned”.

Malta’s system stores electricity either directly from a power plant or from the grid. It does this by converting electricity into thermal energy (heat and cold). The heat is stored in molten salt, a proven method of storing thermal energy, and the cold is stored in an antifreeze-like solution with components and subsystems derived from the liquefied natural gas industry.
“The full-scale PHES system offers high potential system performance up to 60% round-trip efficiency and can store energy for more than 10 hours,” said SwRI Group Leader Dr. Natalie Smith, the project’s lead investigator. “PHES is a promising, versatile technology that can be applied to many different energy sources without geological or geographical restrictions.”
Under US Department of Energy (DoE) funding, SwRI has successfully commissioned the small-scale demonstration system that uses simple recuperated cycles for both modes of operation with air as the main working fluid. The facility is intended to demonstrate operation, verify system control strategies, and validate data.
While the SwRI pilot is laboratory-scale, a full-size Malta PHES system will be able to store more than 100 MW of power for eight hours to eight days or longer (1,000+ MWh). One such system is being developed in partnership with Siemens. As announced last year, the two companies are designing turbomachinery components that will support long-duration energy storage systems that could scale over time to the gigawatt range as well as a range of services that the PHES will be able to provide to grid operators, including synchronous inertia, reactive power, and fast ramping. 
In another project using a DoE grant, Malta has partnered with Duke Energy to assess the socio-economic, environmental, and operational issues behind converting retiring coal units into long-duration, zero-emissions energy storage systems.
The two companies said last year they would  look at integrating Malta’s 100 MW, 10-hour pumped heat energy storage system into existing infrastructure at a Duke Energy coal plant in North Carolina.
Malta has also garnered investment from physical commodities trader Trafigura and teamed up with engineering and construction company Bechtel to speed the rollout of long-duration energy storage.
