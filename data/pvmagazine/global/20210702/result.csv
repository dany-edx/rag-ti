The Indian State of Madhya Pradesh hosts a 500 kW solar project by the side of a lake without using any foundation for the PV panels. The project at Bada Talab in Bhopal uses cantilever (a beam anchored at only one end to vertical support) frame to support the panels on the retaining wall of the lake.
The project uses 1,540 solar panels running for 1.2 km by the side of the lake.
“The project illustrates that rooftop solar program really means decentralized solar program and is not limited to rooftops,” said Manu Srivastava, principal secretary of the Madhya Pradesh government's New and Renewable Energy Department, announcing the PV installation as the winner of an award by India’s Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.
The entire operations were completed in just 100 days. “Some operations were done at night since the lake is by the side of VIP Road, one of the busiest roads of Bhopal. The staff climbed onto a suspended scaffolding platform. During the installation, the water level was at its highest and solar panels were installed by staff standing on boats,” Srivastava said.
The PV installation produces around 750,000 units annually, which is supplied to the Karbala pumping station. The pumping station pumps 40,000 cubic meters of water to a water treatment center at Shyamla Hills. The solar project leads to annual savings of almost INR 5 million ($67,000). 
The project would help offset 15,375 tonnes of CO2 emission over its lifespan, which is equivalent to planting 24,600 teak trees.
The project has been implemented by State Discom MP Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd with financing from the government of India, the government of Madhya Pradesh, and Bhopal Municipal Corporation. The World Bank provide technical assistance. The project was executed by Madhav Infra Projects Limited, led by Amit Khurana.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/02/do-engineers-dream-of-solar-panel-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 2, 2021",Do engineers dream of solar panel efficiency?,"From pv magazine USA
In its last quarterly earnings report, Meyer Burger noted that its 27%+ efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar panel would potentially hit the market in 2023. The solar cell in this panel has already been tested at 29.52%.
In late June, JinkoSolar noted in its quarterly earnings report that it expects to successfully test a laminated perovskite solar cell over 30% efficiency by the end of the year. The company also said it had completed the construction of a “high-efficiency laminated perovskite cell technology platform.”
Also in late June, 1366 Technologies merged with Hunt Perovskite Technologies with a goal of offering a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell whose efficiency is 30% greater than the best solar cells on the market.
A reminder: 1366’s CEO told pv magazine USA just six months ago:
In fact, not only do I believe that multiple gigawatts of tandem will be sold before the end of 2022, I am also confident that in a decade’s time, tandem will command more than 50% of our industry’s market share.
The more tempered members of our industry remind us, though, that historically speaking, scaling up solar panel technology from lab to market takes decades.
One professional wondered what JinkoSolar’s “technology platform” really is, and whether it’s appropriate for investors to consider it seriously yet. And another industry watcher expects the 1366 Technologies’ prediction of multiple gigawatts of tandem cell manufacturing capacity in place before the end of next year to fall flat.
This author won’t let any of that rationality dampen our excitement.
The greatest benefit of increased solar panel efficiency is that on a per-watt and per-kilowatt hour basis, everything is cheaper.
In the image above, created by LONGi Solar, there is a comparison between a 380 Watt solar panel and a 425 Watt unit. The units are the same size, but the 425 Watt model has 11.8% more wattage, due to improvements in efficiency. A 380 Watt model found online – LR6-72HPH-380M – had a 19% efficiency.
Note that in the rate-of-change column, hardware and land savings total 7% when shifting from a 380 Watt to the 425 Watt unit on a 1 GW ground-based power plant.
Now imagine that we have a 30% efficient solar panel: that’s a 57% increase in electricity production over the 380 Watt unit. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll pretend benefits scale linearly with the LONGi comparison above. That means the 7% system savings turns into almost 35% savings.
These construction cost savings generally scale with electricity cost savings. Solar is already being proclaimed king of cheap energy generation. If we knock another 35% off construction costs, exclusively from improvements to solar panel efficiency, that’s some pretty sweet icing on the cake.
Three additional benefits result from breakthroughs in solar panel efficiency. First, local land savings result in a reduction in local pushback. Second, a lower carbon footprint results from reduced equipment, transport, and labor needs. And of course, a massive boost to efficiency would certainly reinvigorate the spirit of the entire solar industry, for a third benefit.
The first two benefits are straightforward. For instance, pv magazine USA covered the fight to build what was the largest solar power plant east of the Rockies in 2019.
This fight highlighted that while solar is as popular as apple pie, there has still been a drop in its popularity due partially to agricultural and rural pushback. It also revealed concern about the environmental aspects of manufacturing massive amounts of polysilicon, and the subsequent recycling of those solar panels.
If land use is reduced by one-third and electricity used to manufacture is also reduced by one-third, then it seems logical to assume that the pushback should drop off to some degree as well.
 This image is from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) Best Research-Cell Efficiency Chart. Many readers know this chart not because it is directly applicable to their lives, but because it’s just so darn cool to see the blistering progress that solar technology has achieved in recent years.
Records are cool, lasers that beam energy to specialized solar cells are cool, and even carbon-nanotube solar pipe dreams are cool (even if we never figure out how to manufacture them) because that’s simply how life, and innovation, works.
If – or, more likely when – the solar manufacturers of the world sort out the manufacturing challenges behind tandem perovskite+silicon solar cells, it will open a clear path towards 34-35% efficient solar cells (the current speculative peak efficiency value of this product).
Already multi-layered solar cell products are common in expensive markets – the International Space Station for instance – but it is still too expensive for practical surface-based electricity generation.
We will finally see multijunction high efficiency products for the common person.
Of course, multi-layered products are currently available for purchase. Panasonic’s HIT goes way back, and REC’s Alpha product was released less than two years ago. But these products haven’t yet fulfilled the promises of our efficiency dreams.
Those efficiency dreams, without a doubt, lie deep within the minds of Fraunhofer’s and NREL’s researchers, as we can see from the aforementioned 68.9% solar cell, which absorbs laser blasts, or the 47.1% six layer solar cell, which is manufactured with surprisingly achievable technologies.
As our planet experiences record heat waves as a result of carbon emissions, killing our most vulnerable, it’s nice to have something to dream about.

According to the Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association (MPIA), this uptake relates to the NEM Nova scheme, or Net Offset Virtual Aggregation, which enables commercial and industrial PV system owners to sell excess power to the grid at market price or system marginal price (SMP). The amount of subscribed capacity in just three months is higher than the total NEM uptake in its first three years following its start in 2016.
“This is a testimony of high awareness among the energy consumers in solar energy adoption and the success of government’s program in driving the national renewable energy agenda,” the association stated. “MPIA is urging for more NEM quotas allocation to drive the national solar agenda forward and meet the rising demand for solar.”
The NEM 3.0 scheme also includes another two sub-schemes: the NEM Rakyat program for residential systems, which will allocate 100 MW and grant a net metering tariff over a 10-year period; and the NEM GoMEn program for government ministries and public entities, through which another 100 MW will be assigned under the same conditions as the NEM Rakyat.
Net metering replaced Malaysia's feed-in tariff incentive scheme in January 2016. In May 2017, Malaysia made the system more attractive and in 2019, with the NEM 2.0 program, the surplus power generated by the PV system was for the first time paid on a “one-on-one” offset basis, which meant that every kilowatt-hour injected into the network was offset against a kilowatt-hour of electricity taken from the grid. Under the previous regime, exported energy carried less value than consumed grid power.
At the end of 2020, the country had around 1,439 MW of installed solar generation capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The Malaysian government is also supporting large-scale PV through a series of tenders.

As part of the collaboration, a green hydrogen working group will be created as part of the Chilean-German Energy Association (AEE) to identify viable green hydrogen projects, facilitate the development of supply chains abroad, share knowledge and experiences in terms of safety standards and procedures. The partnership also aims to advance the development of certification systems for low carbon emissions and promote the joint development of research, pilot and demonstration projects. Altmaier referred to the H2 Global program, a German government initiative that seeks to import green hydrogen and support electrolyzer projects abroad. He added that cooperation with Chile was important because Germany's major energy sector players were seeking new trade routes for imports of green hydrogen as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels. Also on Tuesday, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held a video conference. According to the Chilean government, one of the focuses was the development of clean energy sources and green hydrogen. In December, the German ministry announced its support for Highly Innovative Fuels (HIF), the first eFuels project to be developed in Chile, which consists of the generation and use of green hydrogen to produce methanol and gasoline. The German government will support the project with €8.2 million ($ 9.76 million) through Siemens Energy.
The Uruguayan Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining (MIEM) said it has found significant interest from “important actors” in the energy sector and hydrogen in particular, paving the way for the next stage of its H2U initiative. Since 2018, an inter-institutional group has been analyzing how to develop green hydrogen in Uruguay. In this framework, pre-feasibility studies were conducted to carry out a pilot project for the production of green hydrogen to supply trucks and buses. “After the process was closed, efforts began to focus on processing and systematizing the information received in order to refine the drafting of the specifications of the call for proposals that we hope to be developing in the second half of 2021,” reads a note released on Tuesday. According to MIEM, the pilot project could be in heavy transport, production of green fertilizers, or production of green ammonia as fuel for ships.
Texas oil field services company Baker Hughes and engineering, procurement and construction company Samsung Engineering have announced a collaboration with regards to low to zero-carbon projects utilizing carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen technologies. For now the focus is on key Korean customers with projects across refineries, petrochemical plants, water treatment and air pollution prevention applications. “We are positioning ourselves as a green solution provider, and we will continue to invest in technology and develop new projects for pursuing carbon neutrality,” Duckkyu Moon, senior vice president and head of Samsung Engineering's Solution Business Division, said in a statement Tuesday.
Norway-based consultancy DNV expects global demand for hydrogen as an energy carrier to grow from practically zero in 2019 to 24 exajoules (EJ) a year in 2050. “Uptake will mainly be in the manufacturing and transport sectors, adding to the continued non-energy uses of hydrogen such as fertilizer and feedstock,” reads a recent report. According to DNV, hydrogen from fossil fuels is likely to play an important role in establishing hydrogen as a significant energy carrier. DNV expects it will take at least another decade for green hydrogen to become competitive. “The paths of different hydrogen colours will be dependent on available resources, policies, carbon prices, and the risks investors take – and all of these parameters will vary regionally.” The consultancy sees green hydrogen (solar PV) production costs in Latin America and Africa already in the range of $2 to $3 per kilogram. “This will further encourage a global green hydrogen import/export market.” DNV also addressed the competition between electrolysis technologies, focusing on alkaline electrolysis (AE), solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), proton exchange membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM). “Costs are predicted to decrease by 50% solely on the basis of economies of scale. This should enable SOE to compete with AE and PEM by 2030,” reads the report, adding that “AEM still requires the most development.”
Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed a novel valuation framework for hydrogen storage that they claim can help utilities, regulators, energy suppliers and researchers assess the economic benefits of storing the clean fuel. Called the Hydrogen Energy Storage Evaluation Tool (HESET), the new framework is an adapted version of PNNL's Energy Storage Evaluation Tool (ESET), which was created by the research group in 2013. It is able to assess individual system components, different hydrogen flow pathways, various grid and end-user services, and multi-dimensional couplings. “This tool is unique in that it allows for modeling of stacked revenue streams, like grid services and several different hydrogen end uses,” said PNNL researcher Di Wu. Stored hydrogen may be used for grid services such as frequency regulation, capacity value, deferral of transmission, distribution equipment upgrades, demand charge reductions, and demand response, he added.


Bouygues Energies & Services and supply chain specialist FM Logistic have agreed to  deploy a green hydrogen project powered by solar energy in the city of Orléans. Green hydrogen will be distributed via private and public stations deployed by Bouygues throughout the city. The H2HUB Loiret project aims to produce up to 800 kilograms a day of renewable hydrogen in the long term near an FM Logistic site. According to a company spokesperson, interviewed by pv magazine France, the energy to power the electrolysers will come from solar panels installed at the regional level, the location and quantity of which have not yet been announced. Solar panels on the roof of the Escrennes logistics platform, operated by FM Logistic for cosmetic companies such as Sephora, will provide additional power. The amount of energy needed and the capacity of the electrolyser will ultimately depend on the amount of hydrogen that local authorities and companies will be willing to buy, the spokesperson added.

According to the statement, the total investment for this polysilicon capacity is RMB 14 billion, around $2.1 billion. Construction of the facility will take place in two phases of 100,000 MT each, with phase I estimated to be completed and commissioned by the end of 2022, followed by phase II. Tongwei has a total 80,000 MT polysilicon capacity and 150,000 MT under construction. By the end of 2022, the company will have a total polysilicon capacity of 330,000 MT, including the new expansion plan, and the figure will grow to 430,000 when phase II of the project is finished.
Chinese glass group G-Crystal announced on Thursday that its Malaysian unit completed construction and commissioned its glass production lines for thin-film PV panel products. Work on the facility started in 2018 with a planned capacity of 500 metric tons of PV glass per day. The company has signed a supplement agreement with First Solar for the next 10 years, G-Crystal added.
In its latest market observation, released Wednesday, Taiwan-based market research company PV InfoLink reports that the price of polysilicon remained stable from last week. The main deal price is around RMB 200 ($30.90) per kilo, with no change from last week. Due to lower capacity utilization on the wafer side, the high quote of poly was rejected by downstream users. Cost pressure eventually spread from downstream modules and cells to wafers. Due to high inventory and lower capacity utilization, wafer orders dried and wafer makers had to cut prices, especially on large-sized wafers like 182 mm and 210 mm, both of which suffered around 10% reductions. Cell prices also dropped slightly due in part to higher pressure from high inventory and the likelihood of a potential deal with module makers. Module prices also dropped because of upstream cost cutting. However, generally the market is still cool with high prices and low consumption.
Independent shareholders at state-controlled manufacturer Luoyang Glass will vote on the proposed RMB 182 million ($28.2 million) acquisition of glassmaker Qinhuangdao North Glass Co Ltd at an extraordinary general meeting on July 21. Luoyang wants to acquire a 60% stake in the target company from the China Yaohua Glass Group Co Ltd warehousing and sales entity which is itself controlled by Luoyang’s ultimate owner, China National Building Material Group. The deal would remove duplication and competition for Luoyang, which said the investment would also enable it to “optimize the layout of its photovoltaic glass business segment” and “expand production.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/02/new-approach-promises-reduced-impacts-in-lithium-mining/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHILE,GERMANY",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 2, 2021",New approach promises reduced impacts in lithium mining,"Availability of certain materials, and the environmental impacts of their mining, is a major challenge to achieving targets for decarbonization and renewable energy deployments in multiple regions, and ensuring that the energy transition to renewable energy is made as sustainably possible.
Lithium, an essential material for energy storage and many other applications, is at the center of this debate. In northern Chile where much of the world’s lithium is produced, problems are already emerging with high water consumption in one of the world’s driest regions. And these will need to addressed to ensure local populations do not lose out as a result.
A project funded by the German government is investigating a novel approach, one that combines geothermal energy generation, extraction of lithium and other valuable minerals, and production of clean drinking water. “The use of the limited freshwater resources in northern Chile for mining regularly fuels conflicts with the local population,” says Thomas Kohl of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) – one of the German research institutes involved in the project. “With a novel type of plant, it is not only possible to generate electricity in a climate-friendly way, but also to extract drinking water and even mineral resources at the same time.”
Novel process
The concept begins with geothermal energy generation – brines are pumped from the ground at high temperatures and used to generate electricity. The brines then go through two stages of concentration, which leave behind drinking water and brine saturated with minerals. The project, named ‘BrineMine’ has set up a demonstration of the process at Insheim geothermal power plant in western Germany, which has shown that the process can run using only excess heat from the power plant.
While it mostly relies on new combinations of existing technologies, the scientists note that dealing with the buildup of silicates that could damage the equipment required some innovation, and developed a new process which they describe in a paper published in Geothermics. “Conventional strategies for silicate removal would greatly impair the extraction of the resources. Without water treatment, the technical plant components would be damaged,” explained KIT scientist Valentin Goldberg. “Our silicate removal method is fast and effective. Most importantly, it has no negative impact on raw material extraction.”
In Chile, meanwhile, work is underway to examine the economic potential of this approach and identify the minerals and concentrations that could be available at different sites across the country. The next steps for the project will be to develop processes to extract minerals from the concentrated brines. This will be complex, requiring site-specific concepts depending on the contents of a particular bring, however, the group remains convinced that its approach has the potential to greatly reduce the environmental impacts of mining.
“Compared to conventional mining methods the raw materials are already dissolved in thermal waters and do not have to be leached out of a hard rock deposit…” they state in an article published in Oil Gas magazine. “…efforts in terms of mining and infrastructure as well as land use are greatly reduced compared to conventional open-pit mining. Consequently, Brine Mining has a great potential for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly raw material production.”

Swiss research institute Agroscope and energy company Romande Energie are building an agrivoltaic project with the support of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) at a site owned by Agroscope in Conthey, in the canton of Valais, Switzerland.
They are building the project with special transparent concentrator PV panels provided by Swiss startup Insolight. The Theia (Translucency and High Efficiency In Agrivoltaics) modules have an efficiency rating of 30% and purportedly let through up to 78% of sunlight.
“Combining two usage modes based on Insolight’s optical micro-tracking technology, these modules focus light on high-efficiency solar cells,” Insolight said in a press release. “When aligned, the optical system can generate energy (E-MODE), but it is also possible to unalign it to ‘leak’ the light (MLT-MODE). The solar modules therefore act like a ‘smart’ shade adjusting the amount of light they let through.”
This makes it possible to optimize the photosynthesis of plants during the seasons and reduce the negative impact of high summer heat on the yields and quality of agricultural products, while recovering the rest of the light in the form of electricity. Starting from July, the panels will be tested for four years on a 165-square-meter surface area. They will replace protective plastic tunnels on strawberries and raspberries.
“Dynamically adjusting the light transmitted to the plants paves the way for increased protection from climate variations and possible increases in crop yields thanks to the matching of the light to the needs of the plants and the lowering of the temperature during heat waves via the shading effect,” said Bastien Christ, head of the berries and medicinal plants group at Agroscope.
pv magazine has previously reported on Insolight‘s module technology. The company – founded by three researchers from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne – has developed panels that rely on expensive III-V multi-junction solar cells from an undisclosed manufacturer.
The cells only cover 0.5% of the panel surface and are covered with protective glass and optical lenses to concentrate and direct sunlight onto them at around 100 times the intensity of standard solar glass. The cells are reportedly able to track the sun through horizontal movement.

They aim to achieve this by promoting renewable energy technologies, such as household and mini-grid solar solutions, especially in rural areas with little access to electricity. ARE has signed similar agreements in Benin, Nigeria, Zambia, Tanzania, and Cameroon.
Challenges
During the second edition of the Sustainable Energy Forum for East Africa (SEFEA) on 22-24 June 2021, ARE and the East African Centre of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Efficiency (EACREEE) found that the main challenge in Africa is connecting project suppliers with investors.
The MOU aims to address this and SIAZ and ARE have said they will work together with the Zambian Development Agency (ZDA), which is mandated to develop and oversee investment trade in the country. Energy is one of the critical sectors ZDA plans to develop, with a key focus on renewables.
According to research conducted by GET.invest, clean energy investment volumes grew between 2017 and 2018 from £52.8 million to £62.8 million. In that same period, foreign capital accounted for 79% and 83% of total clean energy investment, respectively.
Decentralized solar energy
The MoU will include joint advocacy to create a sustainable decentralized solar energy market. SIAZ is leading the way by shaping a public sector-led off-grid task force and has redrafted the fiscal exemptions for solar products by removing import duties and VAT for solar equipment. For example, there is no import duty charged on solar panels, wind turbines, or batteries. However, there is a VAT rate of 16% on wind turbines; other renewable technologies are exempt.
SIAZ is also working closely with the Ministry of Energy, the Off-grid Taskforce Secretariat, and the Ministry of Finance to improve regulations and tariffs in the country.
Knowledge exchange
The MoU is the result of virtual study tours carried out by ARE, SolarPower Europe, and the National Renewable Energy Association, and supported by the European Program GET.invest.
A spokesperson for ARE told pv magazine, “The results focused on knowledge exchange of best practices between African and EU associations on how to run associations and how to address common challenges, including fundraising and member acquisition and retention, policy development and adapting to the Covid-19 pandemic.” Networking between national renewable energy associations from Africa and Europe and the facilitation of potential partnerships and future joint activities were also discussed.
The associations have said they will work together on a number of activities, continued the spokesperson, including joint advocacy to create a conducive and enabling environment for a sustainable decentralized renewable energy market, and to promote the use of renewable energy technologies in Zambia by means of knowledge and information dissemination, networking between public and private stakeholders, institutional capacity building as well as targeted business development and market intelligence support for decentralized renewable energy (DRE) companies.
Specifically, they aim to cooperate on targeted skills development and capacity building activities for renewable energy stakeholders in Zambia to create local jobs and enhance the capacity of the sector to raise increased financing for renewable energy projects and businesses. This will be achieved by spearheading in-person or virtual “DRE Investment Academies” or similar trainings for Zambian and international DRE project developers and other stakeholders, with the aim to provide additional fundraising and technical support.
Finally, the MoU states that the partners will support services for Zambian renewable energy actors who work to address energy access, energy security and climate change challenges in Zambia and conduct research to foster the market for renewable energy technologies.
Committed
Zambia's Government is committed to delivering universal electricity access for all Zambians by 2030. Overall, it aims to deploy 500 MW of solar PV by 2023, in order to further reduce the country’s chronic power shortages. The sub-Saharan country currently relies on 2.8 GW of installed power, around 85% of which comes from hydropower. Its access to electricity is about 31%.
This March, Zambian energy company Greenco Power Services Limited (Greenco), a unit of Mauritius-based Africa Greenco Group, announced it was seeking independent power producers (IPPs) for a pilot PV project with a capacity ranging from 10 to 40 MW that is planned for an unspecified location in Zambia. “The pilot project is likely to be the first project in Zambia to take advantage of the new open-access regime introduced by the government of Zambia under the Electricity Act 2019 and the Energy Regulation Act 2019,” said the company in a statement issued at the time.
“SIAZ is excited to have this formal partnership with ARE. We are confident that this partnership will help the solar industry and its members create an enabling environment for a sustainable decentralized solar energy market and promote renewable energy technologies in Zambia,” said SIAZ chairperson, Matanda Mwewa.
He continued: “SIAZ recognizes that the industry has challenges, but in those challenges, there also lie opportunities. We believe that the partnership between SIAZ and ARE will have a mutually beneficial feedback loop, which will allow both to learn from each other and develop next-generation solutions that will shape the future for Zambia and Africa at large.”

The module relies on PERC cells with a size of 210mm and features an efficiency of 21.2%. “The latest multi-busbar technology also ensures better light trapping, lower series resistance and improved current collection resulting in more uniform loads and better performance,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “An aesthetically versatile monochrome look and simpler product options means that 510 W Vertex modules will suit a variety of rooftops.

The new product has been designed for commercial rooftop projects and comes with a 15-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty. “Intense rounds of performance and quality testing have been undertaken with the modules exceeding the industry standard hail test (35mm) as well as snow and wind loads (6,000 Pa and 2,400 Pa respectively),” the module maker stated.
Trina launched its 635-660 W Vertex series last summer. It also unveiled a 670 W version of the Vertex panel in March.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/02/lng-and-hydrogen-untangling-a-complex-relationship/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JULY 2, 2021",LNG and hydrogen – untangling a complex relationship,"German utility Uniper announced plans in April to set up a hydrogen hub near Bremen with the establishment of an import terminal for green ammonia. It originally planned a floating LNG terminal. Similarly, German energy giant RWE is exploring hydrogen imports via a planned LNG terminal near Hamburg.
LNG and hydrogen might seem to be in direct competition, but the relationship is more complicated. Both LNG and hydrogen developments heavily depend on the supply side, said Sjaak Poppe, spokesperson for the energy transition of the Port of Rotterdam.
“LNG is a transition fuel: better than the diesel and HFO, but not zero emission, which hydrogen is (if it’s green hydrogen). In the coming years there is not enough green electricity to produce enough green hydrogen to replace all the current use of fossil fuels and feedstock, so LNG is a very attractive fuel for the next few decades, reducing emissions in both CO2 and small particles (air quality),” said Poppe. “Both LNG and green hydrogen offer opportunities for companies to develop new business models and for governments to achieve climate targets and create wealth. As the Port of Rotterdam Authority, we want to contribute to this.”
The Port of Rotterdam Authority is currently involved in several projects looking at the use of hydrogen as a transport fuel throughout the chain, from production and transport to import and transit.
The relationship between LNG and hydrogen also depends also on the time frame, explained Thierry Bros, professor of international energy at Sciences Po.
“LNG and hydrogen are unlikely to compete in the short to mid-term in Europe. Hydrogen could displace some pipe gas first as locally produced hydrogen will need to find some demand,” Bros told pv magazine. “It could be blended with gas first (non dedicated pipes). Imports/exports of hydrogen could happen mostly under the gas phase via repurposed pipes (mostly dedicated hydrogen pipes in this case). Transporting liquid hydrogen is only going to be done later and mostly perhaps only for Japan that has no pipe gas access. Liquid hydrogen is a very inefficient way of transporting energy and it could be better in Europe to keep importing LNG and do some CCUS.”
In general, experts expect both competition mechanisms and synergies between LNG and hydrogen.
“LNG is more advanced in technology readiness level, but hydrogen and ammonia are the only fuels which can comply with the future emission targets,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH, a diversified shipping and logistics group that is headquartered in Antwerp. “The use of low flashpoint fuels such as hydrogen and LNG use the same design philosophy and require similar safety measures and equipment. Training programs to use these fuels are similar as well.”
The relationship will also be country-specific, as the prospects of hydrogen and LNG heavily depend on existing infrastructure.
“For Estonia, I do not see hydrogen and LNG to compete in the near future. This is simply because Estonia currently lacks a proper gas pipeline infrastructure suitable for hydrogen. Recent research outcomes show that Estonian pipelines can not carry a high percentage of hydrogen even if mixed with methane. So the odds of competition between hydrogen and LNG are rather low,” Ivar Kruusenberg, the founder and CEO of PowerUP Energy Technologies, told pv magazine.
But this does not mean there is real competition, Kruusenberg said, noting that they will most likely complement each other.
“It can be expected that the early adopters of LNG are also the first to shift to hydrogen, which includes the transport sector as well as what becomes to the small-scale heat and power generation,” he said. “Companies that were earlier investing in LNG are shifting to hydrogen due to the green deal goals that the EU is aiming to achieve by 2050. When we talk about 100% sustainable energy, hydrogen does trump over LNG. In fact, the existing LNG infrastructure will only help in the transition to hydrogen distribution.”
Keeping considerations on CO2 emissions aside for a moment, there is possibly a stronger level of competition between LNG and hydrogen in the transportation sector.
“Until recently, LNG was only used to transport methane over the oceans and then to transform it into gaseous form for injection into the gas grid. Recently, however, LNG started to be used in liquid form (at atmospheric pressure in an isolated reservoir). Diesel and gasoline are widely used around the world because they are liquid, the easiest physical form to handle,” Samuel Furfari, the president of the European Society of Engineers and Industrialists, told pv magazine. “Therefore, LNG in this liquid form has a huge advantage over gaseous natural gas. This justifies the development of LNG as a fuel for heavy transport (trucks, trains, ships) or to use methane in SMEs located in areas that the gas networks do not reach. Instead of dreaming of using methane transformed into hydrogen to use it as fuel, it is much more rational from an energy systemic point of view to use LNG directly. Simpler, cheaper and available now without any risk.”
Hydrogen still needs to reach maturity. However, this will require massive investments.
“In some of these cases, green hydrogen will replace the use of natural gas, but could at the same time promote life extension of gas infrastructures, converting them to carbon-neutral gases,” said Diogo Almeida, head of hydrogen business development at Lisbon-based Galp Energia. “For this to succeed, hydrogen needs to reach technological maturity and economic competitiveness, requiring massive investments and time, during which natural gas will the best option available to reduce carbon footprint and improve life quality of many communities.”

All PV systems connected to the grid in Germany generated around 7.99 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity in June alone, setting a new record for solar power generation.
According to the Energy Charts published by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunofer ISE), the previous record had been set in June 2020 with 7.3 TWh.
The share of photovoltaics in net public electricity generation reached 20.6 percent in June. This means that a fifth of the electricity that came from the grid was generated by PV systems. Lignite power plants also achieved 20.6 percent but only 7.96 TWh last month. PV was therefore the largest source of electricity. The share of 20.6 percent, however, is not a new record for photovoltaics — in May 2020 it accounted for 20.8 percent despite lower generation values, as demand and electricity generation at the time was significantly lower due to the coronavirus crisis.
With 4.48 TWh (11.6 percent) in June, wind power lagged behind nuclear power plants, which contributed 4.95 TWh, or 12.8 percent, to electricity generation. Overall, the share of renewables in June was 48.3 percent, according to the Energy Charts.
Last month, electricity consumption rose by around 10 percent and was mainly covered by lignite power plants. Gas and hard coal power plants, on the other hand, suffered from the significantly higher fuel prices, which are due to the much higher demand worldwide.
Overall, the generation of renewables in the first half of the year declined significantly compared to the two previous years, which was mainly due to the lower share of wind power. By contrast, fossil fuel production — which had declined continuously in recent years — was initially on the rise.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/02/australias-unsafe-solar-installation-standards-under-fire/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 2, 2021",Australia’s ‘unsafe’ solar installation standards under fire,"From pv magazine Australia
More than 2.68 million rooftop solar PV systems have now been installed in Australia. But REA Global Director Michael Mrowka has declared that changes to national installation standards are urgently needed in order to defuse a “ticking time-bomb” created by unsafe and poorly designed solar installations.
Mrowka said rooftop solar safety standards, particularly those relating to the controversial DC isolators that were mandated in Australia in 2012, have not kept pace with technology and industry changes.
“One example is the AS/NZS 5033 standard that mandates rooftop solar isolators, which have become the largest single cause of solar fires in recent years,” he said. “Combine that with low-cost Chinese products that can be quite dangerous as they age, especially when poorly installed, and you have a ticking time-bomb that can cause electrical shorts and fires.”
Standards Australia has launched a review of AS/NZS 5033. The draft standard has received more than 680 submissions during the public comments stage, which closed last month.
Mrowka told pv magazine that an update on the installation and safety requirements standard is expected in December. But he is far from confident it will deliver the changes the industry is seeking.
“The safety issue is very difficult because governments have given out so many rebates for what may be potential fire hazards that this could be another pink batts installation debacle,” he said, referring to a government-funded insulation scheme that was abandoned in 2010, following the death of four workers and a string of house fires.
Founded in 2006, REA Global designs and installs solar PV energy generation and storage systems for residential and commercial customers. It installs an estimated 15,000 modules per year. The Brisbane-based company also designs and manufactures solar modules and is progressing plans to establish offices in New South Wales and Victoria.
“We’ve been part of the industry for 14 years and 10 years of that as an EPC company designing, installing and maintaining solar systems,” Mrowka said. “We’ve seen a lot of industry changes and one of the biggest issues in the industry is the application of the current technology which is critical. We’ve got a fundamental flaw where higher voltage systems are being installed with DC rooftop isolators that are not fit for purpose.”
Data provided by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) shows that more than one in four Australian homes have rooftop solar modules. The market is now on track to eclipse all previous records in 2021. However, that uptake has delivered unintended consequences, with Fire and Rescue NSW statistics showing that PV-related fires have increased fivefold over the past five years.
Isolation switches have been blamed for causing almost half of solar module fires. Mrowka is one of many in the industry who is lobbying against their mandated installation, declaring that the safety mechanism has caused more harm than good.
“They’re not designed to be sitting on people’s roofs,” he said. “If we could change one thing to improve this situation, it would be to mandate rapid shutdown and panel-level monitoring and communication.”
The United States is among nations that are pursuing rapid shutdown capabilities for rooftop solar. Mrowka said it is something that also needs to happen in Australia to avoid the situation in the United States, where some first responders won’t respond to fires at homes with solar on the roof until after dark.
“They understand the risks and they’re not putting themselves at risk, to the detriment of the homeowner whose house is burning down,” he said.
Mrowka said the simple solution is to install a micro-inverter system that does not use high voltage DC. He noted that REA Solar exclusively uses technology manufactured by California-based Enphase, which has rapid shutdown capabilities built in.
“The problem with current solar systems is that when you pull the fuse in the street or you cut power to home, energy flowing from the solar system to the inverter is still live and can’t be circuit-protected,” he said. “We install our solar panels with Enphase micro-inverters which let us circuit-protect the system because it runs 240 volts alternating current from the panels, so the homeowner can shut them down, just as with lights and power in the home.”
Mrowka said it is also important that the industry addresses the lack of education and information provided to consumers regarding the costs associated with micro-inverters and DC isolators, which require ongoing maintenance.
“It’s not us versus them, of AC versus DC, it’s an education thing. If you get a DC system, we’re not saying the thing will catch on fire, we’re just saying that if it’s not maintained, over time you’re at a greater threat of it catching on fire. If you maintain the system, there shouldn’t be a problem but because companies are selling low-cost systems, they’re not providing that awareness to customers that there are maintenance costs involved,” he said. “They’re not telling them the rooftop isolators need to be maintained each year. They are failing to educate the customers. They either don’t understand it themselves or they don’t want to disclose it to the customer for fear of losing a sale. It’s really frustrating the lack of education that’s being provided in the industry.”
In addition to its rooftop solar focus, REA Global is also pursuing projects in the electric vehicle space. Mrowka recently took delivery of a new Porsche Taycan, for example. As an experienced driver, he said he plans to race the car, which will be powered entirely by solar.
“It can do a quarter mile in 10 seconds,” he said. “It blows everything away. We plan to do some promotional events and racing to raise general awareness that the future of motorsport will be green and electric.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/02/exploring-the-depths-of-europes-oldest-grid-connected-pv-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 2, 2021",Exploring the depths of Europe’s oldest grid-connected PV system,"The TISO‐10 (TIcino SOlare) PV system was grid-connected in 1982 on the roof of what today is the SUPSI PVLab at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland, located in the country's Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, where it has operated almost uninterruptedly for almost 40 years.
Measurements of the array’s performance were taken for around 35 years from 1982 to 2017, when the Swiss Federal Office for Energy (SFOE) tasked two scientists — Alessandro Virtuani, senior researcher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), and Mauro Caccivo, head of the SUPSI PVLab itself – and their teams to analyze the huge amount of collected data. “We had to go through an incredible mass of paper and it took almost two years to sort out all relevant information,” Caccivio told pv magazine.
40-year-old panels
The array was built at a cost of around CHF 284,000 (around $309,000 today and $475,000 at the time) and the 288 modules used for the project cost around CHF 21 ($22.9 currently and around $37 at the time) per watt. The glass-backsheet products, with a power output of 37 W each, were provided by Arco Solar, which was first acquired by German conglomerate Siemens and then by Germany-based solar panel manufacturer SolarWorld in 2007. “When the modules were bought in 1980, Arco Solar was one of the world’s largest manufacturers and had around 1 MW of annual production capacity,” Caccivio specified.

Although the electrical layout of the system changed several times, following replacements of the inverters, all the modules aged together, always exposed to outdoor environment and sunlight and never refurbished or revamped, with only very few exceptions, in which junction boxes and by-pass diodes were replaced.
“These modules have an impressive mechanical robustness,” Virtuani and Caccivio emphasized, noting, however, that their weight and mechanical dimensions, as well as the thickness of their solar cells, are not representative of what could happen to a solar array in terms of cracks to a PV system built with modules manufactured today or in recent years.  “But these modules can tell us a lot about humidity penetration and yellowing,” they stated. “Each panel was encapsulated with a backsheet made of steel foil functioning as a barrier to water ingress, which is sandwiched by Tedlar layers on both sides,” they explained, adding that the product, although it resembles more the structure of a glass/glass panel rather than that of a conventional glass/backsheet panel, is closer to what today we would define as a glass-glass panel.

The 10% efficient modules have an open-circuit voltage of 21.5 V, a short-circuit current of 2.55 A, and a fill factor of 68%. Each of them measures 121.9 × 30.5 x 3.8 cm, weighs 4.9 kg, and is based on 35 monocrystalline cells with a diameter of 102 mm. “Today the cells are much more sophisticated and may include surface passivation layers or more complex patterning structures,” Virtuani said. “This complexity may potentially make cells weaker and expose them to higher degradation rates.”
Overall, the inverters were changed five times. The first devices, which had been provided by Abacus controls, were replaced after 10 years with a new product from Invertomatic and the system design was also modified, with longer strings and the number of modules was slightly reduced. At a later stage, SMA inverters were installed and the system design returned to its original configuration with 288 modules. The solar modules are the only components of the system that have never been changed.
Different yields
The modules’ performance was not the same for all the panels and the researchers were able to divide them into three groups, with the best performant ones showing almost no signs of yellowing, while the other two groups exhibited medium and high levels of yellowing. “In the third group the yellowing was so intense that some panels ended up having a brown color,” Virtuani said. “The long-term electrical performance and aging of the panels is highly correlated to their respective groups and to the behavior of the encapsulant used to manufacture them.”
Chemical analysis performed in recent years confirmed that the three encapsulants are made of the same base polymers but their three respective suppliers used different additives in the encapsulant formulation, explaining the varied performance. “As in many cases with PV installations, the devil is in the details,” Virtuani stated. “By just changing a single element, in this case the supplier of the encapsulant, the entire performance of a PV array can be compromised,” he added. “Which shows that the bill of materials matters. A lot!”

Due to the fact that extracting the polymers from the module is a destructive technique, the researchers could only conduct the chemical analysis on a limited number of modules, but they excluded other degradation causes, as the yellowing is an issue that relates exclusively to the encapsulant materials. “On the other hand, the modules have shown no signs of humidity penetration,” Caccivio explained.
The three encapsulants were all based on polyvinyl butyral (PVB), a thermoplastic polymer that has been used since the early 80s to encapsulate PV modules and has since been replaced by ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). “A former Arco Solar manager confirmed that, at the time, the encapsulant is likely to have been PVB and that three different suppliers of PVB were used by the company”, the scientists highlighted.
Three groups
Around 21.5% of the modules showed an annual degradation of -0.2% per year, which should correspond to the value promised by the manufacturer, while another group representing 72.9% of the panels showed an annual degradation of between -0.2% and -0.7% per year. “Most of the panels in the second group have also performed well, meeting initial expectations,” Caccivio stated, noting that this group can be further split into two sub-groups relating to the different encapsulants.
From 1982 to 2017, the modules of the first group degraded overall at most by 13% and those of the second group by up to 21%, although half of them did not exceed the 20% threshold. According to the Swiss group, around 70% of the modules used in the array would still satisfy a performance warranty that module manufacturers are presently considering to apply to the technology of tomorrow, which means a lifetime of 35 years.
The analysis also showed that 87.5% of the module suffered some type of minor front delamination and problems with several junction boxes, but these issues were equally distributed among the three groups. The overheating of the junction boxes, however, had a lower impact on the modules of the first group. Furthermore, some modules showed cracks, backsheet degradation, internal circuit corrosion, hot spots, and burn marks, among others.
The first and most important lesson learned from studying the PV installation and modules “is that bill-of-materials (BOM) matters,”  the researchers stated, adding that the choice of materials is as crucial today as it was forty years ago.
 Revamping or replacing?
When asked about the future of this PV system and that of aging installations in general, and if revamping or repowering may be a better option than letting old arrays keep generating power, although with lower yields, the two scientists offered different perspectives.
“Economically, it may be preferable implementing revamping and repowering, or eventually replacing the old array with a completely new system,” Caccivio said. “However, the European Commission has established a 40-year lifecycle for the solar modules and, reasonably, we have to use solar products until the end of their lifecycle or until 80% of its original performance is provided.” The studied PV system has shown that a portion of it has lost only 0.2% of its original efficiency and is still abundantly over this 40-year threshold, he added.
Image: SUPSI PVLab
According to Virtuani, it is possible to extend the lifecycle of a PV system by implementing proper maintenance. “If the PV system works out well, it can operate for over 40 years,” he explained. “On the other hand, several business plans, currently, are being developed on a 30-year time frame. But nothing forbids us to extend PV system operation for longer than planned, if the systems and modules are operating well.”
He also said that prolonging the life of a PV system over the 30-year limit may also depend on the applications the PV system has. For example, an array powering a water pump doesn’t need to operate at full capacity and it may probably be used for much more than its owner may expect.
The results of the two researchers were presented in two different papers: “35 years of photovoltaics: Analysis of the TISO‐10‐kW solar plant, lessons learnt in safety and performance—Part 1 and “35 years of photovoltaics: Analysis of the TISO‐10‐kW solarplant, lessons learnt in safety and performance—Part 2,” which were both published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/02/solar-101-goldilocks-your-pv-project-to-make-it-just-right/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 2, 2021",Solar 101: ‘Goldilocks’ your PV project to make it just right,"From pv magazine USA
If you’ve been following along with pv magazine USA’s Solar 101 series, you should have a strong handle on how to pick your panels, find a contractor, and determine how much electricity your home might generate.
All this technical knowledge is useful, but we’re  still left with a nagging question: Exactly how much solar power should I install?
The best answer is often the simple one. Review your bills and ask, “how much electricity do I actually use?” Your solar contractor will use this technique to establish a baseline “just right” size for your solar power project.
Matching your panel production to your household’s use might seem like a pretty obvious answer, since offsetting electricity usage is typically the goal of a residential solar system purchase. But there are several good reasons to choose a larger system – or even a smaller one.
In fact, there are a number of good reasons to choose a solar system that appears undersized in comparison to your estimated electricity usage. The most obvious reason is that your roof may not be big enough for your solar array to fully cover a home’s electrical needs. If that’s the case, then the decision is already made and you can move on.
A second reason to go smaller is net metering. In some places, full credit is given for daytime-generated, net-metered solar electricity. That means that all the electricity exported to the power grid on a sunny spring day is available for heating on a cold winter night. When the electrical grid works as a “virtual battery,” electricity requirements can often be met with fewer panels.
However, plenty of other places, like Utah, have very low net metering credits. In a situation where net metering credits are low, it can sometimes make economic sense to size your system small enough so that it is not exporting to the grid.
Economics, of course, do not rule everyone’s decision. Another reason to build a smaller system is that a home might become much more energy efficient in the future. If your house needs more insulation, new windows, LED lights, smart thermostats, or other efficiency upgrades, then this author recommends completing those upgrades first.
The final reason is, of course, money. Solar can have some pretty high upfront costs. If the return on investment isn’t high enough, or if the larger cash outlay just doesn’t make sense, then going a bit smaller might be the best option.
Solar sizing
On the other hand, there are times when you might want to intentionally build a solar system larger than your current electricity bill. The most common reason is the expectation that household electricity demand will increase. This is most common among consumers who wish to buy an electric car, or switch from a fossil-powered HVAC system to more efficient electric heat pumps.
Roughly speaking, if the average electric car gets three miles per kilowatt-hour of electricity, and drives an average of 12,000 miles per year, that car will add about 4,000 kWh to an electricity bill. The exact number of solar panels needed to cover that additional use varies by region and roof angle.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s PVWatt’s solar generation calculator is among the best free tools to estimate your project’s yearly output before you commit.
Another common upgrade, a heat pump, varies depending on how much it is used and where you live. For instance, a recent Vermont heat pump study of well-insulated northern homes estimates that cold-climate heat pumps use on average 2,085 kWh per year for heating and 146 kWh per year for cooling. Obviously, in places like Florida, Texas, and other hot southern climates, yearly cooling electricity usage is significantly greater.
Roughly speaking, in order to generate 2,000 kWh (for a heat pump) or 4,000 kWh (for an electric vehicle) in a year, you’ll need an additional 1,500 W or 3,500 W of solar panels, respectively.
Key exceptions
Those of you in hot climates will be pleased to learn that installing solar panels on a roof add an additional layer of insulation to your attic by preventing the sun’s rays from heating your roof in the first place. They also absorb 20% of the sunlight and turn it into electricity, instead of allowing it heat your home.
These additional tools can reduce cooling loads and make it easier to meet your home’s electrical needs with fewer panels, or less expensive (and usually less efficient) panels.
In some places, like Massachusetts, you can apply excess electricity generation credits to someone else’s electricity bill if they’re in the same power grid “load zone,” or even sell those credit in a “community solar” type model. This is often referred to as remote net metering.
These considerations  can make all the difference as you decide on how to size your rooftop solar array.
