The team claims it achieves “complete conversion of methane with more than 99% recovery to pressurized hydrogen.” The optimized reactor solves two problems related to scaling proton ceramic reactors (PCERs): matching the spatial distribution of heat from compression with the extent of chemical reactions through a stacked reactor, and the lack of interconnect materials with high electrical conductivity and chemical stability up to 800 C. The PCER stack is a series of six barrels, each with six single cells connected electrically in parallel. It also uses a newly developed Ni-based glass-ceramic composite interconnect. The process aims to improve efficiency in the extraction of hydrogen from ammonia, methane, and biogas by coupling endothermic reforming reactions with heat from electrochemical gas separation and compression. The researchers described their approach in “Single-step hydrogen production from NH3, CH4, and biogas in stacked proton ceramic reactors,” which was recently published in Science.
Stanford University has launched the Stanford Energy Hydrogen Initiative research and education program to fund the development of key technologies, policies and financial mechanisms. Stanford teamed up with eight corporate members, who will invest almost $1 million dollars in new research in the initiative's first year. The program will focus on both green and blue hydrogen. 
ZeroAvia  has announced plans to collaborate with Shell on two commercial-scale mobile refuelers for use at its research and development site in Hollister, California. Shell will also provide compressed, low-carbon hydrogen supplies to the facility and other locations in the western United States, ZeroAvia said.
First Hydrogen has said that its two MAN-based fuel cell-powered light commercial demonstrator vehicles, equipped with Ballard Power Systems' fuel cells, are on schedule to commence operational testing in June. It said the two vehicles, currently being built by AVL Powertrain UK, “are expected to be road legal by September 2022 allowing for trials with major fleet operators. It is anticipated that these trials will be carried out with a significant number of fleet operators and buyers based on the interest which has already been generated.” The vehicles will reportedly have more than 500 km of range capability.
Hydrogen Systems has announced the establishment of a new hydrogen center in Riyadh. “The Hydrogen Energy Center of Excellence focuses on technology transfer and advanced manufacturing of solutions,” Hydrogen Systems said.
Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser, a subsidiary of Nel ASA, has received a purchase order from an undisclosed Indian oil refinery for an alkaline electrolyzer. The project will use hydrogen for oleochemical production. The purchase order has a value of approximately €2 million ($2.1 million) and delivery of the equipment is expected in mid-2023, said the company.
ScottishPower and UK-based Storegga have announced plans to build a series of green hydrogen projects in the Scottish Highlands. “The initial project phases will be focused in the Cromarty Firth region (north of Inverness) and will provide green industrial heat across the region for a range of customers including distilleries and transportation sectors;” Storrega said. “The projects are expected to deliver hundreds of M.W. of green hydrogen production capacity before end of the decade, with plans for the first project to be operating by 2024.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said in a recent report that over the short term, ammonia and existing pipelines appear to be the best options to transport hydrogen. “Over 120 ports already have ammonia infrastructure and 10% of global production is already traded,” said IRENA. “Once renewable ammonia is produced, it could be blended at any ratio with fossil-based ammonia without any change in properties (with a certification scheme in place), making initial trade easier.”
Air Products, Dutch tank transport specialist Schenk Tanktransport, and Dutch tech company TNO are collaborating on a new plan to develop hydrogen trucks and a public hydrogen refueling station. “This project is in cooperation with the Port of Rotterdam to create the largest hydrogen refueling station in the Netherlands, initially supplying three zero-emission trucks from Air Products, Schenk Tanktransport and other early hydrogen adopters in the Rotterdam port area,” said Air Products.
Sunshine Hydro has launched a AUS 2 billion ($1.4 billion) “Flavian” pumped hydro and green hydrogen project in Queensland, Australia. The company reported that it has secured the land and expects to make a final investment decision in 2025, with energy production likely to start from 2028.

With conventional dry-cleaning tools, direct contact between the moving parts and the panel surface can cause microcracks in the cells. The Cleo-Tech solution addresses this problem by ensuring that only the soft nylon bristles of the brush come in contact with the cells during the cleaning process. Its cleaning brush measures 1 meter and clings end-to-end on the panel’s aluminium frame to do the cleaning, thus avoiding direct contact of the moving parts with the cells. 
“The cleaning tool weighs 5 kg. It uses a heavy-duty brushless DC motor that can last up to four years without maintenance. The roller brush is made of very thin and soft nylon bristles that perform dry cleaning without damaging the anti-reflective coating of the PV panel. The operator can easily replace the brush on-site,” Rohan Kaundal, founder and partner at Cleo Tech, told pv magazine. 
Kaundal said a single person can clean anywhere from 60 to 100 panels per hour, depending on their familiarity with the tool. It is powered by a 24V, 10,000 mAh lithium-ion battery. It weighs 2 kg and can easily be carried like a backpack by the operator.
Cleo Tech can customize the tool according to specific site installation and design parameters.

Chinese customs statistics show that it exported 9.6 GW in January, 14 GW in February, and 13.6 GW in March, up sharply from the preceding year.
Risen Energy said this week that it has signed a $2.16 billion purchasing deal with wafer supplier Shuangliang Eco-Energy, to secure 1.57 billion wafers over the next two and a half years. The wafer sizes might change in line with market requirements, said Risen.
Sunova Solar has revealed plans to release new solar panels featuring next-generation TOPCon cells at Intersolar Europe this week. The new products are based on 182 mm wafers, with N-type TOPCon cell tech and bifacial double-glass modules. The panels feature 144 cells each, with power ratings up to 575 W and module efficiencies of 22.2%.
Xinte Energy backtracked this week on plans to establish a group to serve as a corporate representative of the Chinese Communist Party, following a revolt by the holders of its Hong Kong-registered shares. The holders of 63.5% of H-shares in the TBEA-owned polysilicon maker and solar developer recently vetoed a proposal by the board to establish a “Communist Party” entity to implement strategic decisions of the party and China's State Council. The board issued a revised set of amendments this week that did not feature the contentious article. The matter will be voted on at the next annual general meeting in Xinjiang, which has been pushed back from May 20 to May 24.
GCL New Energy will hold a vote on May 31 regarding its latest proposed project sale. It wants to sell off another 30 MW of generation capacity to state-owned Hunan Xinhua Water Conservancy and Electric Power Co. Ltd., after shifting 499 MW of solar fields to it since August 2021. The latest transfer would prompt an expected net gain of CNY 12.6 million ($1.87 million) on the book value of the projects, as part of an anticipated net windfall of CNY 143 million, which the developer said it would use to pay down debt. GCL New Energy’s liabilities could also fall by CNY 142 million if the sale is approved. The sale would leave the developer with 753 MW of solar generating capacity across 34 projects.

Rystad Energy has named the top-performing solar farms in April, with Western Australia’s Greenough River 1 and Merredin arrays coming in second and third behind Queensland’s 50 MW Kidston project.
The AC capacity factor at Kidston, which is owned by Genex Power, increased by 26.4% compared to last year. The Kidston Solar One Project is an integral generator for the Kidston pumped hydro project.
Growing slightly less at 25.5% AC capacity factor was the 10 MW Greenough River 1, owned by Bright Energy Investments (a joint venture between DIF Infrastructure, Synergy and Cbus Super). Similarly, the 100 MW AC Merredin Solar Farm, which was last year bought by Sun Energy from Risen, saw its capacity factor increase by 25.4%.
The analysis came from Rystad Energy Analyst Dave Dixon, who noted that overall, April 2022 ended with all Australian utility PV and wind assets generating 2,895 GWh, “up from 2,345 GWh (+23%) in April 2021,” Dixon said on LinkedIn. At a state level, New South Wales was the top performing state, generating 820 GWh from utility solar and wind, Dixon said. Victoria came in second with 713 GWh, and South Australia third with 511 GWh.
In terms of wind, the top utility assets were mostly in Western Australia and Victoria, with Western Australia taking out four of the top seven spots.
“The best performing utility wind assets for the month were Goldwind’s / Nebras Power QSC Stockyard Hill 1 wind farm (48.4% CF) in Victoria, followed by APA Group’s Badgingarra (44.5% CF) and Infrastructure Capital Group’s Mumbida wind farm (43.5% CF) both located in Western Australia,” Dixon noted.

S-5!, a manufacturer of metal roof attachment solutions with non-penetrative solutions, has launched a new electrical conduit clamp for metal rooftops.
The CanDuit clamp secures and supports conduit for wire management and fastens “home runs” – the electrical cable that carries power from the main circuit breaker panel to the first electrical box, plug or switch in the circuit – to metal roofs for solar PV systems, in combination with any S-5! clamp or bracket.

The CanDuit is made of electro-zinc coated steel, guarding the clamp from potential corrosion, and is available in 14 different sizes across residential and commercial applications. It is designed with two halves that clamp around a pipe or conduit with an EPDM liner pad that protects against abrasion and a threaded M8 stud that allows for attachment to S-5! products – providing easy, organized securement without scratching, corrosion or other damage to the roof.
According to S-5! CEO Rob Haddock, the product was developed as a response to customer needs, as the company was apparently approached multiple times about solutions for attaching tube-shaped objects to metal roofs. The relationship between pv systems and metal roofs is one that S-5! knows well, and, according to Haddock, the company jumped at the opportunity to fill an industry need in its area of expertise.
Solar PV mounting systems for standing seam roof installations must be mechanically attached to the panel seams only via seam clamps in order to preserve the roof’s design features and warranties. Additionally, metal roofs will outlast the service life of a solar PV system, so it is critical that the mounting system and all attachments protect and maintain the durability of the roof. The CanDuit fits this mold for both of these needs, attaching directly and securely to roof seams, preventing any damage that would be caused by movement over time.

Solar in the queue totaled 676 GWac/~845 GWdc of capacity at the end of 2021. About 85% of the new capacity came from solar plus energy storage facilities. Solar coupled with energy storage now totals more than 285 GWac of capacity in the queue.
Essentially, the utility-scale California solar power market is now a solar-plus-storage market. In total, there is more than 400 GW of energy storage capacity in the queue.
The EMP team notes that the number of hours of energy storage is not available. This author estimates that the average battery has at least two and a half hours of storage capacity, which would put the total hours of capacity beyond one terawatt hour.
 
Around 80% of the total solar capacity is scheduled to come online before the end of 2024, but only 13% of all solar projects have a signed interconnection agreement. The report points out that in some markets, interconnection is secured before a project finds an off taker. In these markets, some projects that get approved for interconnection do not get built.
This point is brought home when the full sample is shared and we see that almost three times as many projects are withdrawn than are operational:
The completion rate of solar, across all regions, is 16% – lower than the national average.
And if we’re doing analogies, the proof is in PJM’s pudding. The grid management group states that it is overwhelmed with solar power and wind applications, and that it proposes to shut down all new interconnection applications for the next two years as it reassesses its processes.
From 2015 through 2021, the report sees that the time it takes to get from from submission, to interconnection, to approval for interconnecting has increased sharply to greater than three years — except in Texas’ ERCOT territory.
Among all of these challenges, one statistic shines a light. Last year, pv magazine USA reported that the current queue already meets 85% of the estimated 1.1 TWac of capacity needed to clean the US power grid. EMP’s report, released this year, confirms that number.
 
Additionally, the volume of capacity covered in this document only includes utility scale projects from 85% of national utilities. For instance, the hundreds of megawatts of capacity being deployed in Hawaii, the gigawatts of New York Community distributed solar, and the Massachusetts’ behind the meter market, are not counted.
At a minimum, 6.6 GW of the capacity deployed in 2021 would not have made the list.

The two leaders agreed to set up a new €4 billion ($4.2 billion) investment initiative to invest in various sectors of Greece’s economy, with a clear focus on renewable energy, hydrogen and the greening of industry. Renewables developer Masdar, which is fully owned by the Abu Dhabi government’s Mubadala Investment Co., also signed three memoranda of understanding (MoU) with its Greek counterparts.
It signed the first MoU with Athens for the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects on Greece’s “eco-islands.” The issued press release did not identify the islands, but it was likely referring to Greece’s recent “Gr-Eco Islands Initiative,” which was launched in November.
Mubadala Investment signed the second MoU with Greece’s Kyoto SA  to establish a joint venture focusing on the development of onshore renewable energy projects. But the deal is not the first time Masdar and Kyoto SA have agreed to cooperate. In May 2021, a joint venture between Masdar and Finland’s Taaleri signed an agreement with Kyoto SA and Autohellas SA to build a 65 MW solar farm in Viotia, central Greece. The project has secured a generating license from the Greek energy regulator and is expected to participate in future Greek renewable power tenders, in pursuit of a premium tariff. A generation license is a prerequisite for a project to bid in Greece’s tenders.
Masdar signed its third MoU with Greece’s Motor Oil. The two sides mainly to build offshore wind power plants in Greece. In addition, Motor Oil signed a separate agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) to examine potential supply routes for Emirati liquified natural gas (LNG) to Greece. The Greek government has set up an ambitious plan to become Europe’s LNG getaway, with a number of new LNG terminals under construction. A lot of gas producers are now eyeing partnerships with Greece as a result.
It remains to be seen firstly whether the new €4 billion investment initiative will flourish, or what direction it will take. There is always the danger that such press releases are used for greenwashing, while most of the investments focus on fossil fuels.
New tenders
Greece’s environment and energy minister, Kostas Skrekas, told Greek reporters in April that the ministry is now preparing two new joint renewable energy tenders for later this year. The auctions will focus on PV and wind power, with plans for each of them to award 1 GW of renewable power capacity. Greece’s last round of renewable power auctions took place in May 2021.
Skrekas said last year that Greece was preparing to auction 700 MW of battery storage capacity by the end of 2021, but his pledge did not materialize. However, the battery storage tenders could take place this year, too. The Greek Ministry of Environment and Energy recently pushed a new bill for public consultation, and it introduces an energy storage framework for the country for the first time ever.
The bill includes provisions for floating PV and marks Greece’s second effort to reform its renewable energy licensing regime, by streamlining all licenses under a so-called “one-stop shop.” The public consultation period ends this week. As soon as the new bill becomes law, Greece can host its first auction for energy storage.

Lauding the progress of the huge solar field, the state-owned utility said last week the site has 1.53 GW of operational solar generation capacity and developers are working on a further 1.3 GW, with the fourth and fifth phases of the project still underway.
Last year, DEWA announced the commissioning of the first 300 MW stage of the 900 MW fifth phase of the project. It said it expected to add a further 217 MW by the end of 2021, with the later panels set to be installed as part of a fourth phase, which includes 250 MW of PV and 700 MW of concentrating solar power (CSP) capacity. A press release issued by DEWA earlier this year then said that a total of 514 MW had instead all arrived as part of the fifth phase of the project.
The figures quoted last week by DEWA hint that the park is 3 MW short of the capacity it was hoped would have been installed by the end of 2021, with none of the fourth phase yet commissioned. The latest announcement also appeared to indicate that the 100 MW solar tower and 200 MW parabolic trough associated with the CSP section of the project are still not operational, despite DEWA having stated they would be commissioned last year.
Saudi energy company ACWA Power, which is 50% state-owned, and regional body the Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC) are developing the fifth phase of what is planned to be a 5 GW solar site by 2030.
ACWA and the GIC entity owned by the states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, won the contract to develop the AED 2.06 billion ($561 million), fifth phase of the solar field and will own 40% of the facilities installed, with DEWA retaining the balance. The development partners agreed to accept a then-world record low solar tariff of $0.016953 for each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by the project's fifth phase.
DEWA last year said the fifth phase is set to be completed by next year. The announcement released by the utility last week stated the solar field will have an eventual investment cost of “up to AED 50 billion.”
