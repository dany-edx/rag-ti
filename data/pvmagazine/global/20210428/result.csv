And many in the industry are optimistic that the approach will eventually bring about a “step change” in battery technology, greatly improving the capacity, lifetime and safety of lithium-ion batteries.
Swapping out the current generation of liquid/gel electrolytes with a solid material could eliminate any fire risk from the battery, as well as improving energy-to-weight ratios and removing the additional “energy redundant” packaging materials required to hold a liquid, among several other advantages.
The key development though is that the solid electrolyte would allow for the use of a lithium-metal anode, with far higher energy density than the graphite that’s commonly used today. Though there is research into integrating lithium-metal with liquid or semisolid electrolytes, all-solid-state is viewed by many as the best approach.
But lithium metal's tendency to form dendrites – branching structures that grow from the anode into the electrolyte and can cause short circuits and battery failure – is an issue for solid-state batteries as well. With ceramic-based solid electrolytes, dendrite formation can lead to cracks in the electrolyte and short-circuiting in the battery cell.
Given the solid nature of the battery and the tiny scale at which these mechanisms occur, observing and understanding how they progress is a difficult task. A group of scientists led by the UK-based Faraday Institution seeks to address this in new research, where they use sophisticated imaging techniques to observe the batteries in operation, building on earlier insights gained from imaging the batteries after operation. “Ex-situ and destructive methods, involving sectioning the ceramic electrolyte and imaging the lithium metal within using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, have proved valuable in demonstrating the problem,” the group explains. “However, it is important to follow the development of cracks and the ingress of lithium metal into the ceramic during operation of the cell in order to understand the mechanism of dendrite penetration and cell failure.”
Using X-ray computed tomography – an imaging technique similar to the CAT scans used in medicine – the group followed the progression of cracking and lithium ingress into the electrolyte, in a battery comprising a solid argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) electrolyte sandwiched between two lithium metal electrodes. Their results are found in the paper Visualizing plating-induced cracking in lithium-anode solid-electrolyte cells, published in Nature Materials.

Their observations confirmed that the cracks propagate through the electrolyte ahead of the lithium dendrite, proceeding along a path where the electrolyte porosity is above the material’s average. “Continued Li ingress widens the cracks and drives their propagation, but from the rear, not the crack tip,” the group explains. They note that even once a crack grows the whole way across the electrolyte, no short-circuiting occurs until later on when lithium has filled the crack completely.
“We show that cracks propagate through the electrolyte far ahead of the lithium dendrites, rather than the lithium metal driving the crack tip forward,” the group explains. By confirming that dendrites drive the crack formation from the base of the crack and that no lithium metal is present in the tip of the crack, the group is able to suggest better strategies to suppress both mechanisms. “Our findings suggest focussing more attention on blocking dry crack propagation to block dendrite propagation, for example by ceramic toughening and crack block-ing, including strategies such as fiber reinforcement and transformation toughening”, they conclude.

The plan envisages deploying agrivoltaic systems with a total capacity of 2 GW which would be enough, according to estimations by the government led by Mario Draghi, to generate around 2,500 GWh per year.
The investment will target “the implementation of hybrid agriculture-energy production systems that do not compromise the use of land dedicated to agriculture but contribute to the environmental and economic sustainability of the farms.” The plan includes financial support for monitoring activities, according to the plan's draft document.
The investment aims to make the agricultural sector more competitive by reducing energy supply costs “currently estimated at more than 20% of the variable costs.”
On Tuesday, the Italian parliament approved the plan. The government will now send it to the Brussels authorities for approval. The European Commission requires EU member states to spend at least 37% of the grant and loan support provided by the bloc's NextGenerationEU recovery funding cash on projects which support its climate objectives.
The Italian recovery fund also includes €2.2 billion for energy communities. “This investment aims to secure the resources necessary to install approximately 2,000 MW of new electrical generation capacity,” reads the draft plan, according to which these funds could also cover energy storage systems.
The government wants to achieve “international industrial and knowledge leadership” in the fastest growing transition sectors, investing in Italy-based supply chains and reducing dependence on imported technologies including PV, hydrogen electrolyzers, and batteries. The Mediterranean country plans to devote €0.68 billion to innovative renewable energy technologies, including offshore systems.
To complete the investments in renewable energy, another €1.92 billion will be set aside for biomethane.
In total, Italy decided to devote €23.78 billion of its EU recovery funds to renewable energy, hydrogen, smart grids, and mobility. According to the draft Covid-recovery plan, the largest chunk of that figure will target sustainable local transportation (€8.58 billion), followed by investments in renewable energy (€5.9 billion), energy infrastructure (€4.11 billion), and hydrogen (€3.19 billion).
As part of the total €59.33 billion investment in the energy transition – and apart from the €23.78 billion above – the Italian government included €15.22 billion for energy efficiency, €15.06 billion for environmental protection measures, and €5.27 billion for a circular economy and sustainable agriculture.
Italy is the main recipient of the EU's €750 billion NextGenerationEU plan. It is set to receive €191.5 billion in loans and grants between 2021 and 2026.

The developer's chief shareholder is garment manufacturer Hirdaramani, which employs around 25,000 workers in Bangladesh, and WindForce made its debut on the Sri Lankan stock exchange last week by announcing its intent to expand its overseas generation portfolio.
In the wake of an LKR3.2 billion ($16.4 million) float, Windforce MD Manjula Perera reportedly told local media the developer was interested in expanding into Bangladesh and Cameroon after recent ventures into the Senegalese clean power sector, and on top of its existing foreign portfolio.
With WindForce having 30% of its generation capacity in Uganda, Pakistan and Ukraine – and having secured a 30 MW solar plant in Senegal and tendered for a 100 MW project in Pakistan, Perera reportedly stated a desire to raise overseas generation to 40% of his company's renewables fleet.
Neither Perera nor WindForce chairman Ranil Pathirana have responded to pv magazine‘s requests for comment and chief financial officer Rizmin Razik would confirm only that the company is working on possible Bangladeshi renewables projects “in the early stage.”
The company has 218 MW of clean power generation capacity, 120.8 MW of which is in Sri Lanka, and is due to commission a 10 MW solar project in Uganda on May 10.
Of the money raised in the initial public offering, LKR2.31 billion ($11.8 million) has been allocated for a wind power project in Mannar Island, Sri Lanka and a solar plant in Senegal. Some of the remaining LKR890 million could be heading to Bangladesh, with the nation having attracted investment interest from developers in Saudi Arabia, the United States, India, China, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Canada, Norway, South Africa, China, and Hong Kong.

The special configuration of the proposed solution, according to the company, is able to convey surplus electricity generated by the rooftop array to an electric underfloor heating system which, in turn, transfers the energy to the foundation concrete.
“Due to its high mass density, concrete is an excellent heat storage [resource],” said my-PV managing director Gerhard Rimpler, noting that the solid construction element absorbs heat and releases it again with a time delay. “This way, solar energy is only converted into heat where it is needed, directly in the floor,” he further explained.
This approach is being tested by the company at its new headquarters, under construction in Sierning, Upper Austria, which will also host a 100 kW PV system deployed on the rooftop and a facade, and which has a building surface of 858m2. “It goes without saying that we are also proceeding completely according to our guiding principle of ‘cables instead of pipes,’ for our new company headquarters,” Rimpler stated.
Around 40 kW of electric heating wires have already been cast into 25cm to 50cm thick concrete. “The heating load of the low-energy house constructed with lightweight timber is significantly lower than 40 kW, but the excess energy can be temporarily stored by the construction element activation and released again later,” the company specified.
The proposed solution, which was tested through a series of simulations, is claimed to help reduce the building's annual costs for water and power by around 67%, compared to standard heating. “The house of the future is solar-electric. This now also applies to heating in corporate buildings,” Rimpler affirmed.

Roger Savage, of British engineering firm Buro Happold Ltd, said the policy frameworks set up to support such trade zones could overcome investor reluctance to back energy infrastructure in African countries because of a wider lack of policy support.
The energy infrastructure needed to support African economic zones could not only drive on-site renewables generation capacity but could also have wider grid benefits, said the Buro Happold group director, at an event organized by the Africa Economic Zones Organization (AEZO), which comprises government departments, private companies and chambers of commerce concerned with such trade parks.
“Our view is that special economic zones, and energy infrastructure that's delivered in conjunction with them, can really be a hub and a catalyst for meeting the needs of the wider area,” said Savage. “By addressing these challenges, we can maximize the benefits of [the] green transition, then support social-economic development, industrialization and trade, which can lead to long term prosperity.”
Mini-grids established to power economic zones could supply surplus electricity into national grids, said the director, who noted such business parks aggregate demand for renewable power to the level required to make clean energy generation capacity feasible.
Referring specifically to solar, Savage said: “The main challenge here is really around aggregating demand and tackling the issue around transmission and distribution networks. By solving these challenges and making solar projects bankable, the shift to green energy becomes more feasible.”
The director added, the supportive policy network and raised investor confidence associated with economic zones might speed up the adoption of more advanced renewables technology which is available in other global markets but yet to make its mark in Africa.
Stressing the need to embrace the energy transition, AEZO secretary-general Ahmed Bennis suggested governments could consider clean power policies, such as low-carbon tax incentives and attracting manufacturers associated with green product supply chains.

“More than 40 gigawatts of solar power for the first time!” tweeted, yesterday, Bruno Burger, head of energy charts at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.
The record result, of 40.7 GW, was achieved on April 27, at 1 p.m.
The favorable weather situation, with a sunny sky and low temperatures, had previously set new photovoltaic generation records on Friday and also at the weekend. According to German power provider Eon, a total of around 515 million kilowatt-hours of solar power were fed into the grid on Saturday and Sunday, which is more than ever for an April weekend.
Previously, according to Energy Charts, the highest photovoltaic output, of 37.7 GW, was reached at 1:30 p.m. on Friday. This exceeded the old record of June 1, 2020, when 37.2 GW was reached. 
According to the latest statistics from Germany's Federal Network Agency, the Bundesnetzagentur, the country had an installed PV capacity of over 54.3 GW at the end of February. In 2020, around 4.88 GW of new solar was deployed and, for this year, another 6 GW is expected.
EUPD Research forecast that the strongest growth will come from the utility scale segment, as many projects selected in public tenders are expected to reach completion by the end of 2021.
As for large scale, unsubsidized PV plants linked to power purchase agreements, the analyst expects that around 400 MW could be deployed. In February, Enervis published a market report on the European PPA market according to which, there is currently a project pipeline in Germany for subsidy-free photovoltaic projects with a volume of 786 MW.

The researchers explained they were able to scale up from the cell to the module level without any efficiency loss, which they described as the main challenge for the development of large-area perovskite PV modules.
The perovskite cells were connected in series to form large-area solar modules using the so-called monolithic series connection, with structuring lines being introduced during the deposition of a cell's individual layers, which were all deposited through a vacuum process.
“The major advantages of vacuum deposition with regard to the production of efficient solar modules, are the ease with which the processes can be controlled, the low number of process parameters and, in particular, the independence of the deposition mechanism from the coating surface,” said KIT researcher Tobias Abzieher, noting that the process was used in combination with a laser technique for the monolithic series connection.
With the combination of vacuum processing and laser ablation, the scientists achieved an efficiency of up to 16.6% on a module surface of more than 50cm2 and 18% on a module with an area of 4cm2. “Despite the enlargement of the device's area by a factor of over 500, almost no loss of efficiency can be observed,” said researcher David Ritzer.
With its approach, KIT claims to have succeeded in reducing the scaling losses in perovskite solar modules to values that are close to those of cadmium telluride (CdTe) or copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) modules.
In the future, the researchers will work on optimizing the solar cell layer stack and on further reducing the dead areas. “If we fully exploit the potential of the technology, the production of perovskite solar modules with efficiencies of well over 20%, even on even larger areas, is an achievable goal in a timely manner,” said researcher Ulrich Paetzold.

Switzerland-based solar module manufacturer Meyer Burger Technology AG has unveiled a high-performance heterojunction half-cell solar module, which it claims will provide an additional yield of up to 20% compared to conventional PERC modules.
The module features efficiency up to 21.8% and weighs just under 20kg. “We achieve these industry-leading energy yields and up to 400 W nominal power per module without having to make the modules bigger and bigger like our competitors”, said the company's managing director, Moritz Borgmann, adding that the new product is significantly lighter than standard panels.
The Meyer Burger White panel measures 1767 x 1041 x 35 mm and weighs 19.7 kg. It is available with wattages ranging from 380 to 400 W and efficiencies between 20.7% and 21.7%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.23% per degree Celsius and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V. It is made with 120 monocrystalline heterojunction half-cells and 3.2mm antireflective glass.
The Meyer Burger Black product has the same weight and dimensions as the white module, as well as its components and electric performance data. It is available in five versions with power ratings between 375 and 395 W and efficiency ranging from 20.4% to 21.5%.
As for the glass-glass version; the module weighs 24.4 kg and measures 1722 x 1041 x 35 mm, its power rating ranges between 370 and 390 W, efficiency up to 21.8%, and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The manufacturer also explained that, due to its bifaciality, it can achieve a combined power of more than 430 W under standard measurement conditions. Bifaciality is commonly defined as the ratio of the output measured from the rear-side of a panel over the output measured from its front side. According to Meyer Burger, the bifaciality of its glass-glass module is around 90%.
The manufacturer also said that, despite the half-cell architecture, the front side of the new products has a homogeneous “full-cell” look. They are being manufactured with the company's Smartwire technology, which Meyer Burger said prevents microcracks.
The white and black products come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. Their average annual degradation is 0.25% for 30 years and 2% in the first year of its lifetime. The output warranty for the glass-glass panels is 30 years and at least 93% of initial performance is guaranteed.
For the module distribution, Meyer Burger has signed contracts with well-known partners such as Baywa re, IBC Solar, KdiSolar, Krannich Solar, Memodo, Solarmarkt, Solen Energy Europe, and Sonepar Germany. This means that the panel manufacturer is able to cover markets such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Benelux region, Italy, France, Poland, Great Britain, the Nordic countries, and the USA. Further sales partnerships will follow in the coming weeks.
Meyer Burger operates a heterojunction cell production facility in Bitterfeld-Wolfen and a highly automated module factory in Freiberg, Germany. Production at both sites is expected to begin by the end of May. The first modules could then be delivered to customers from July. The initial annual capacity of both factories is 400 MW each, which the manufacturer wants to increase to 5 GW by 2026.

Mild summer temperatures, coupled with record installations of rooftop solar capacity in the first three months of the year, has led to a 3% decline in average operational demand from the National Electricity Market (NEM), the Australian Energy Market Operator said in its new Quarterly Energy Dynamics report. The decline amounted to the lowest level of operational demand since 2002.
In fact, the first quarter saw record low average operational demand in most of the regions in the NEM, in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia.

Spot prices plunge
Regional electricity spot prices fell massively, between 21% and 68% compared to the first quarter of 2020, to reach their lowest average level since 2015. The largest spot price reductions occurred in Victoria, falling from AUD 79 (USD 61.17)/MWh to AUD 25/MWh, its lowest quarterly average since the first quarter of 2012. New South Wales fell from AUD 86/MWh to an average of AUD 38/MWh, while Queensland averaged AUD 43/MWh.
Continuing the trend in the final quarter of 2020, negative spot prices remained confined to the southern regions, with Victoria reaching record quarterly occurrences at 10.3%. South Australia remained at what the AEMO described as “very high,” at 16.8%.
“South Australia’s average daytime prices fell below zero consistently between 10 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. (AEST) during the quarter, the first time in the NEM’s history. At the same time, persistently low electricity prices below their cost of generation required AEMO to direct South Australian gas-powered generations on for system security for a record 700% of the quarter,” said AEMO Chief Markets Officer Violette Mouchaileh.
In South Australia, the average spot price during peak solar production was negative AUD 12/MWh.

Increased renewable energy output coupled with reduced daytime electricity demand saw average balancing prices reduced in Western Australia from AUD 56/MWh in the first quarter of 2020 to AUD 47/MWh this quarter. The reduction occurred despite a jump in evening peak demand and a hot summer.
The state set a record for minimum operation demand in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) on March 14. Operational demand at this time dropped to 952 MW, 33 MW below the previous record, with estimated distributed PV output of 1,026 MW at the time.

New Delhi-based Gold Plus Glass Industry, India’s second-largest float glass manufacturer, has announced plans to set up a new solar glass factory. 
Gold Plus Director Vivek Dubey told pv magazine that the company plans to build the new solar glass factory at a location in southern India. The plant will have a capacity of 300 tons per day and will be operational by September 2023.
The company is already in discussions with government authorities in at least two southern states to secure land and funding, as well as subsidies. It will likely choose a state and a plot of land within the next three to four weeks.
The plant will produce extra clear, textured glass with anti-reflective coatings. The thicknesses will range from 2 mm to 6 mm (including 3.2 mm).
“The plant will be able to provide the complete range of glass required for solar PV modules, including 2 mm tempered solar glass,” Dubey told pv magazine. At present, the idea is to meet domestic demand, but the company is also ready to explore export opportunities, he added.
Currently, Borosil Renewables is the only solar glass manufacturer in India. It has a factory in Bharuch, Gujarat, that accounts for about 40% of India’s solar glass demand.
Given the ambitious solar energy target laid out by the Indian government, the move by Gold Plus into solar glass manufacturing will be welcomed by PV panel manufacturers. Many domestic module suppliers are also now in the process of expanding their own capacity. 
Gold Plus is looking to finance its expansion through a mix of internal accruals, equity fundraising, and debt. KPMG has been appointed to assist the company in raising funds. The company is already backed by Azim Premji’s investment unit,  Premji Invest.

Tesla reported that its energy storage deployments grew 71% year over year in the first quarter of 2021, driven largely by what it said was the popularity of its Powerwall product.
The company said that rooftop solar deployments reached 92 MW in the first quarter, its strongest quarter in 2.5 years. Solar roof deployments grew 9x compared to the same period last year. The growth curve slowed, however, from the fourth quarter of 2020 when the company installed 86 MW.
CEO Elon Musk told an earnings call that the company had made some “significant mistakes” with its solar roof project. Recent price volatility reflects a realization that the complexity of roofs varies dramatically, he said. The company’s recent shift to sell rooftop solar and energy storage as a package is intended to streamline installation by ensuring that power goes to the battery system before reaching the electric circuit breaker.
Musk said that a software update for the Powerwall could enable as much as a 50% power increase over the 5 kW of real power currently specified. The company said that demand for Powerwall “continues to far exceed” its production rate. As a result, the company said it shifted Powerwall deliveries to solar customers only. As production rates increase, Tesla said it may make the energy storage system again available as a stand-alone product.
(Read “Making the numbers work for a residential energy storage system.”)
The company said that the February snowstorm in Texas and other blackout events continue to drive customers toward home energy storage. Even so, it said that energy storage deployments can “vary meaningfully quarter to quarter” depending on the timing of specific project milestones, which is the driver behind the company’s reported sequential decline in megawatt-hours.
The company deployed 260 MWh of storage in the first quarter of 2020 and 1,584 MWh in the fourth quarter. The pace sagged to 445 MWh in the first quarter of 2021.
Musk said that Powerwalls could be used to stabilize the grid and operate as a virtual power plant. He said the concept is likely to gain traction as electric vehicle adoption increases.

CS Energy said it has developed and started work on a 216 MW, eight-project solar portfolio in upstate New York, in partnership with Goldman Sachs Renewable Power Group (GSRP) and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).
The company has started building the 27 MW Darby Solar project, the 27 MW Branscomb Solar array, the 27 MW Stillwater Solar installation, the 27 MW Grissom Solar site, the 27 MW Regan Solar project, the 27 MW Pattersonville Solar installation, the 27 MW Janis Solar array, and the 27 MW Puckett Solar project.
Stillwater Solar was originally developed by East Light Partners, acquired by GSRP, and is being constructed by CS Energy. All of the projects are expected to reach commercial operation by the end of this year. The eight arrays will become some of the first operational utility-scale solar projects in upstate New York, according to CS Energy.
The projects will also bring New York to the cusp of having 3 GW of installed solar capacity, enabling the state to join California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Massachusetts in hosting that much capacity.
Construction is expected to generate 500 jobs, and the $160 million in project investment is expected to generate more than $80 million in benefits for local communities.
As with all other large-scale solar developments in New York, the eight projects were initially procured and developed through the state’s Clean Energy Standard, which has evolved into a commitment to ensure that 70% of the electricity consumed in the state by 2030 is generated by renewable energy.
Contracts for the projects were awarded by NYSERDA as part of its Renewable Energy Standard Request for Proposals in 2017 and 2018.
