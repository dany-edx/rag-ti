That was just one of the headline-grabbing insights in a 1H 2021 LCOE Update which posited the carbon price in China will rise to around $50 per ton in mid century; stated solar became cheaper than coal in Vietnam and Thailand in the first half of the year; that receding solar panel glass costs are mitigating a rising polysilicon price; and cited rapid solar wafer manufacturing build-out as the main cause of the rampant poly price, rather than more high-profile events such as factory explosions.
The advent of bigger solar projects – up to an average 50 MW this year – and bigger, more powerful and more costly modules is helping prevent rising solar manufacturer material costs from having a big effect on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from solar during 2021, according to the analyst.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, Cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
BNEF has calculated a 5.2% rise in the average solar module cost this year, to $0.23/W – thanks to more hefty price tags for bigger panels and a rise in the cost of aluminum frames – will translate into a global, average solar LCOE of $48/MWh for fixed-axis panels and $38/MWh for sites featuring single-axis trackers. Those two figures would represent rises of 1% and 4% on last year's numbers, respectively, according to the analyst, which also stated the fixed-axis cost can be as low as $26/MWh in India this year and $35 in China, and as high as $125 in Japan. In the U.S. market, the analyst reported, single-axis tracker PV now undercuts combined-cycle gas turbines, with an LCOE of $39.80/MWh.
The report noted, however, panel price rises of around 7% in China since the second half of last year, and of 10% in India.
With BNEF expecting the monocrystalline solar panels which accounted for 85% of last year's global market to offer an average 20.5% conversion efficiency this year – against 17.6% for cheaper, multicrystalline products – the analyst has forecast the average PV project this year will feature 400-550 W-rated panels offering an average conversion efficiency of 20.1%.
The lowest LCOE figures recorded this year are in the $22-29/MWh range in Chile, India, the UAE, China, Brazil and Spain, said BloombergNEF in a report subtitled: Rising commodity prices start biting to perhaps also reflect inflationary effects on other clean energy technologies, such as the knock-on effect of steel costs on wind turbine makers.
Despite such input pressures on solar manufacturers, BNEF noted the capital cost of PV projects in Chile and Brazil has fallen 5% this year, to $680,000 and $760,000/MW, with the former figure now on a par with the set-up costs in mature European solar markets.
As far as solar auctions are concerned, BNEF recorded 42 GW of capacity had solar electricity tariffs set by such procurement rounds last year with solar and wind projects set to come online next year and in 2023 commissioned on the back of bids ranging from $17-70/MWh.
The expected LCOE for solar compares favorably with the analyst's estimates for new, carbon capture and storage (CCS)-equipped coal power plants ($133-449/MWh) and gas projects ($156-336/MWh), although the study notes unabated coal-fired power still rules on price in Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines this year.
Green hydrogen-fueled gas plants would carry a hefty LCOE of $293-535/MWh, according to the report, although that figure could come in to $82-134 in Europe, India and Japan by mid century if renewables-powered hydrogen can be produced for less than $1/kg.
The document, published on Wednesday, reported a polysilicon price up 198% since May last year, to $21.70/kg but added, each $4/kg rise in the cost of the solar panel feedstock typically only raises module prices one cent per Watt.
Examining the role carbon prices will have on the levelized cost of energy, BNEF has estimated an unambitious charge of $3 per ton of carbon emitted in China, in 2030, will rise to $40/ton in 2040 and $50 in mid century, if a carbon market concerned with 14% of global CO2 emissions is to help achieve carbon neutrality in the nation by 2060.
The analyst expects the carbon price in Europe to rise from around $50 this year to $111 by the end of the decade.

Interested developers will have time until October 22 to submit their bids and final results will be announced by the end of the year.
The agency allocated DKK 1.2 billion ($192.6 million) for the procurement exercise, after spending DKK258 million in the previous auction of the same kind. These funds should be enough to allocate around 429 MW of renewable energy capacity.
Selected projects will be eligible for a feed-in premium – related to the wholesale electricity price – for 20 years.
In the first auction of the kind, held in 2018, 20-year power purchase agreements were awarded to three solar plants with a combined generation capacity of 104 MW and three wind facilities with 165 MW of capacity. The Danish Energy Agency received 17 bids in that procurement round – for 280 MW worth of solar capacity and 260 MW of wind. The weighted average price premium of the winning bids was DKK0.0227/kWh.
In the second exercise, held in 2019, the agency allocated 252 MW of clean energy generation capacity, of which 83 MW was solar and 93 MW solar-wind hybrid facilities which included 34.1 MW of PV capacity. The weighted average price premium, which is paid for the power generated by the projects on top of spot market prices, was DKK0.0154/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/28/using-the-oceans-depths-to-store-renewables-compress-hydrogen/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 28, 2021","Using the oceans’ depths to store renewables, compress hydrogen","An international research team has developed a novel concept of gravitational energy storage based on buoyancy, that can be used in locations with deep sea floors and applied to both the storage of offshore wind power and compressed hydrogen.
Called Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST), the proposed technology is defined as an alternative to pumped-hydro storage for coasts and islands without mountains that are close to deep waters. It consists of using stored renewable electricity to power a motor that lowers a compressed gas recipient and then generating electricity by releasing the compressed gas recipient to rise back to the surface through the water.
“The system is a low-cost, long-term solution for storing compressed green hydrogen produced with solar power or renewable electricity generated by large scale offshore wind facilities,” research co-author, Julian David Hunt, told pv magazine, noting that the use of BEST is interesting for offshore wind power plants, as these should operate in weekly energy circles and be able to store energy for four days and then generate electricity for another four days.
“Regarding the use of buoyancy energy storage for floating solar panels, even though there might be potential for this technology, as it is located close to the deep sea, it would be cheaper to store energy with batteries, as it only requires daily energy storage,” he further explained. “In other words, BEST systems are expensive for storing energy for 12 hours but are cheap to store energy for four days.”
The proposed system uses air or hydrogen as compression gases to fill the recipient, which can be shaped as a series of balloons or tanks. The buoyancy force is exerted by the gas as it has a smaller density than the water. The recipient is connected to the motor and the anchor, located on the ocean’s depths, through a cable and pulleys. “The cable is stored in a cylinder attached to the motor/generator when the buoyancy recipient is lowered,” the scientists explained. “The pulleys also contribute to increasing the speed of the cables and lowering the forces applied to the motor/generator.”
The cost of the cable is pointed out as a possible limiting factor for the technology at this, initial stage, due to its long length and the robustness it has to show. The anchor, on the other hand, must also be built with extreme robustness, as it must sustain the high buoyancy forces created by the gas recipient. “The anchor would be made of steel and screwed to the bottom of the ocean with a system similar to an oil rig,” the group explained. “The weight of the ground where the forces are applied should be larger than the buoyancy force of the recipient.”
The system is able to increase or decrease the speed of the buoyancy recipient depending on the storage needs, and a velocity of 0.01m/s is considered ideal to minimize losses due to friction. The recipient must be built with holes to allow water to penetrate it when it is lowered and the pressure increases. When the recipient is raised, the pressure difference increases and water is pushed out. “Given the rapid reduction in volume of the compressed gas in the first ten to 100m from the surface, the installation of the system requires the support of a ship on the surface to lower the system to the minimum operation depth and then introduce the pressurized compressed gas to the system,” the research team further explained.
The system can operate at a maximum depth of around 10,000m and pressure of 1,000 bars and a minimum depth of around 3,000m and pressure of 300 bars. “If the designed minimum pressure of the system is smaller, the volume of the gas will reduce substantially, reducing the energy storage potential of the system,” the academics emphasized. “If the designed minimum pressure increases, the altitude variation in which the system can operate reduces, reducing the energy storage potential.”
When combined with offshore wind, the proposed system can store electricity at an investment cost of between €50 and €100/kWh while, when utilized for compressing hydrogen, it is said to improve compression efficiency to up to 90%, according to the research group. To achieve a lower cost, the system can also be combined with battery storage, especially if the capital costs of the latter will further drop in the future. “Thus, the combination of both systems will offer an energy storage solution with low cost of stored energy ($/MWh) and low cost of power capacity ($/MW),” it further explained. “[The] BEST system operates slowly but [can] constantly charge and discharge in a weekly cycle while the battery will rapidly charge and discharge in a six to 24-hour cycle.”
The scientists recognized that this kind of storage has so far been studied on a theoretical level and that only small, lab-scale experiments were conducted. Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, the USA, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Cuba, Jamaica, Guatemala, Honduras, Brazil, Portugal, Oman, South Africa, Madagascar and Somalia, Ivory Coast and Ghana were pointed out as the most suitable locations for this storage technology.
It was presented in the paper Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology: An energy storage solution for islands, coastal regions, offshore wind power and hydrogen compression, published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research team included scientists from Brazil’s Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in Austria; and the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, in Germany.

The two companies said in a joint statement that the move is aimed at combining the best of their technologies, to achieve multi-junction solar cells with efficiencies of around 30%. “In a tandem structure, the bottom layer produces one-third of the device's energy but still carries 100% of the production cost,” they stated. “It is here where the direct wafer cost advantage is essential.”
1366 Technologies has developed a kerfless wafer production technique that does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers and forms wafers directly, using molten silicon. HPT has so far been granted 18 patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and 30 additional patents by various foreign patent offices. These patents relate to a manufacturing process to produce printed metal halide perovskite photovoltaic (PV) devices.
The new entity will receive $25 million in funding from Texas-based investor Hunt Energy Enterprises LLC (HEE), U.S. thin-film manufacturer First Solar Inc. and Bill Gates-owned Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), among others. “Our singular direct wafer process is the crucial advantage in making tandem modules a reality and with the HPT merger we have the blueprint for achieving economically-viable tandem solutions for terawatt-scale,” said 1366 Technologies CEO, Frank van Mierlo.
More details on how the two technologies will be integrated were not provided.

Patrick Nussbaumer, industrial development officer at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), told the second edition of the Sustainable Energy Forum for East Africa (SEFEA) event, there are plenty of developers and willing investors but a lack of visibility between the two.
The UN official was addressing an event organized by the Kampala-based East African Centre of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Efficiency and Brussels-headquartered business association the Alliance for Rural Electrification (ARE).
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Nussbaumer, stressing the need to de-risk clean energy project investment as well as reduce start-up costs, said international bodies could help fill the shortfall when renewables developers lack the skills to also be able to secure financial support for their plans.
Event moderator and ARE board member Prosper Magali pointed out the $16 billion spent annually on off-grid renewables worldwide falls far short of the more-than-$41 billion it has been estimated will be required to bring universal electricity access this decade.
Daniel Schroth, acting director for renewable energy and efficiency at the African Development Bank, offered hope when he cited a 2021 status report which noted Rwanda and Kenya are among the world's top seven nations for access to off-grid clean power, with 9% and 6.8% of their populations, respectively, able to use such facilities.
The bank director added, however, the International Energy Agency has estimated half of the world's new electricity connections this decade will have to be associated with distributed-generation plants if universal access to electricity by 2030 is to be achieved.
He also noted a lack of grants and affordable loans in the region for mini-grids – and of any form of basic finance – is being compounded by “limited engagement from local financing institutions which are reluctant to invest, despite the fact there has been an increasing track record, particularly in … solar home system[s].”
Michael Ahimbisibwe, acting principal energy officer at Uganda's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, told the event his government had set up the Uganda Energy Credit Capitalisation Company to offer long-term loans to private businesses. The organization will help the nation exploit geographically scattered renewable energy resources which, in combination with an East African electricity access rate of “perhaps about 30%,” offers commercial clean energy opportunities in areas including irrigation, phone charging, and the medical industry.
Ahimbisibwe's Kenyan counterpart Paul Mbuthi – senior deputy director of renewable energy at his nation's Ministry of Energy and Petroleum – also stressed the vital role off-grid renewables can play in the region.
“Many of the areas required to be electrified are far from the national grid, or the grid is too expensive to extend to such areas, and it's not possible to reach to every citizen wherever they are,” said Mbuthi. “That is why decentralized renewables have a big role to play, even in developed countries. There is an abundance of renewable resources in Kenya. However, most of these places are located in regions where it is challenging to develop infrastructure. Therefore, it only makes sense to have on-site development, like mini-grids or standalone system[s], which can be easily deployed.”
That grid capacity shortage, as well as a lack of public institutions dedicated to clean power, was among the obstacles to renewables roll-out highlighted by Erwin Küenzi, head of unit for themes and quality at the Austrian Development Cooperation program run by the European country's international development agency.
Current system costs mean mini-grids are not financially sustainable in East Africa, added Küenzi.
The problems facing private-sector renewables developers across East and West Africa were outlined by Winnie Shwashwa, VP for finance at Nairobi-headquartered PowerGen Renewable Energy.
She pointed to familiar complaints about licensing paperwork as well as a multiplicity of electricity tariff-setting regimes, which vary from country to country; the effect on mini-grid economics once central grids extend into the same communities; sluggish payments from government bodies; and the small scale of many mini-grids in the two regions.
The SEFEA event, which was held from Tuesday to Thursday, was backed by the EU's Get.invest program, which is funded by the bloc and the governments of Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Austria.
This article was amended on 30/06/21 to reflect UNIDO is not among the sponsors of the EU's Get.invest program, as previously stated.

The tenders were held on June 8 and June 11, respectively.
In the first of the two auctions, solar accounted for around 1.2 GW of the assigned capacity. Around 24.7 TWh of power was contracted in total, which is only 68% of the 38.7 TWh that the ERO had expected to assign. Around 300 MW of capacity was set aside for wind power projects.
In the second procurement exercise, all of the contracted capacity – around 1 GW – went to PV projects. The ERO revealed that all 1,264 submitted offers were for solar installations, and that 11.9 TWh was contracted across 1,016 projects, although it had planned to assign 14.7 TWh.
“Photovoltaics are replacing onshore wind farm projects,” the regulator said. “This situation is obviously caused by legal barriers to the development of wind energy.”
It referred to provisions introduced in 2016 that stipulated that wind turbines must be located at distances from communities equal to at least 10 times their height.
The authorities did not provide details about final auction prices.
“The high amount of projects submitted in the auction for smaller projects resulted in a competitive price of energy, which is essentially lower than current market price on the Polish wholesale market,” Piotr Pająk, a renewables reporter for the Gramwzielone website, told pv magazine.
Pająk said it was predictable that wind would lose its share of projects over 1 MW in size.
“We knew there would be less wind projects on the wind market due to prohibitive distance rule, but the disproportion is quite impressive,” he said.
He said that auctions might become less interesting for PV and wind investors due to rising energy prices in the Polish wholesale market.
“It means more investors in the future may resign from the support scheme and try to secure higher returns through PPA or on the spot market, especially for large-scale PV projects,” Pająk explained. “We also notice first business models that include a mix of both auction schemes, which may be important for banks, and sales of energy on the market.”
In the last auction for projects over 1 MW, held in December 2020, solar accounted for roughly 800 MW of the allocated power. Overall, the ERO allocated approximately 1.7 GW of renewable energy power generation capacity in the auction, including about 900 MW of wind power. The lowest auction price bid was PLN 190 ($50.30)/MWh and the highest bid came in at PLN 249.90.
The last procurement exercise for projects not up to 1 MW in size also resulted in PV securing all the allocated capacity of 700 MW.

The two transactions also removed a further RMB1.89 billion (US$292 million) of liabilities from GCL's books.
The company managed to offload two expensive solar project companies on Friday by rolling them into a sale package of seven entities with a total generation capacity of 229 MW which was sold to State Power Investment Corp (SPIC) business Guizhou West Power Construction Co Ltd.
The Heqing Xinhua and Menghai GCL units sold as part of the deal had installed only 47 MW of an intended 130 MW, after incurring infrastructure expenses related to the original scale of the developments. Both solar project operating companies were also hit by bigger-than-usual expenses as they were taxed at a higher rate after being planned on cultivated land, GCL told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Friday.
That sale is expected to book heavily-indebted GCL a RMB781 million (US$121 million) windfall, at a book loss of RMB117 million, and to remove RMB1.2 billion (US$186 million) of liabilities.
The transaction was announced a day after GCL reported the sale of another seven PV parks, with a total generation capacity of around 149 MW. The earlier disposal, to SPIC subsidiary Chongqing Lvxin Energy Development Co Ltd, will net GCL a RMB3.11 million (US$481,000) profit on its investment by securing a RMB355 million windfall, and will also reduce the seller’s liabilities by RMB688 million.

Of the total sum, $75 million will come from the International Development Association (IDA) and $93 million from the Clean Technology Fund. “This new project is in line with our strategy for the Sahel, which aims to double the rate of access to electricity by 2025, especially in rural areas, and to create the conditions for more private financing in the energy sector,” explained Maimouna Mbow Fam, World Bank operations manager for Burkina Faso.
The funds will be used for the development of the Large Scale Solar and Rural Electrification Project which supports the electrification of around 300 locations in selected rural areas and the connection of 120,000 households, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and community infrastructure, to a reliable power supply. In addition, the allocated funds will finance key investments to strengthen the grid and enable the integration of solar generation and its distribution during peak demand.
The project will also facilitate the launch of a tender for 325 MWp of solar with 335 MWh of storage capacity, which will be developed in several phases with a first phase of 120 MWp with 120 MWh of battery storage, which will be launched mid-2021. “This new scheme will enable Burkina Faso to mobilize more than $400 million in private investment in solar production and innovative battery storage systems,” added Alexis Madelain, project team leader at the World Bank. “This will make it possible to develop the country's solar potential on a scale, reduce the cost of electricity supply, and thus extend access to electricity services in rural areas, without increasing the sector's need for subsidies.”
Burkina Faso had only 62 MW of solar generation capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. However, large PV projects are taking shape in the West African state, such as the 30 MW plant that Axpo Group business Urbasolar began constructing near Pâ in February and two solar plants, totaling 30 MW, which are under construction by Engie.

When completed, the unsubsidized plant will be the country's largest solar facility. “The company is keeping its options open on off-take for the project, which can sell its output into the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market during the sunniest hours, when demand is highest,” the company said in a statement. “This will supplement the Luzon grid’s thin reserves and help prevent the rotating outages that have affected millions of Filipinos over the past weeks.”
The company's unit, Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corporation, will initially build a 225 MW portion of the plant and will then complete the second phase at a later stage, with no time frame being provided.
The project is part of a 1 GW PV project pipeline that the company announced in December. “These projects are under PPAs and are apart from our projects for the announced auctions, which will still come at a later date,” the company's CEO, Leandro Leviste, told pv magazine at the time. “The capacities among these projects will be disclosed at a later date but we confirm the total for 2021 exceeds 1 GW.”
Several giant solar projects were unveiled in the country in recent months. Three PV projects with capacities of 1.2 GW each were included in a list of solar projects with web-based monitoring systems for energy applications under a program known as The Energy Virtual One Stop Shop (EVOSS) System.

PV system fires have a tendency to strike a nerve within the industry. While rare compared to other system disaster events, such occurrences always garner considerable attention.
The issue with solar system fires is how little is known about them. Questions have lingered for years as to what the common causes are, where system failures are occurring, and how often these failures could happen. These questions are the same ones being pursued by Dr. John R. Balfour, president of High Performance PV, and Lawrence Shaw, chief solar systems engineer at Higher Powered, LLC.
To Balfour and Shaw, the most clear and pressing issue with preventing PV system fires is how little information is kept on them. All reported fires in the country are tracked by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) using data given by local fire departments. However, when a solar system is determined to be the cause of a fire, that’s as deep as the reporting goes, with no exploration into specific failures or causation. Furthermore, if a responding fire department doesn’t have solar photovoltaics listed as an option in their reporting systems, it gets filed to the USFA miscellaneously.
As it stands, solar system fires are underreported, and sometimes not at all. Available information is dated and specific causations remain a mystery.
Faulty hardware, aging components, and improper installation can be seen as a poor reflection on the industry at large. But Balfour says that this is an inconvenience that must be overcome to address a larger industry issue.
“Almost all of these issues are quite controllable,” said Balfour. “And that control goes back to having accurate shared information, i.e. component and system data.”
Balfour and Shaw came across case studies in Japan and Britain of solar system fires. Most of these fires were caused by aging and failing system components, and a significant number of failures were attributed to components greater than or equal to seven years of age.
Typically, blame is often attributed to improper installation. However, small case studies are not enough to rule out installation issues as a contributing factor.
Many companies and owners of projects don’t want to share such information. However, this creates a circular issue in which we remain unaware of what causes solar system fires and how to prevent them.
Balfour and Shaw believe that the catalyst for more in-depth and informative data tracking will come from financiers and insurers of solar projects. If solar system fires become more frequent and/or destructive, they’ll become a legitimate industry-wide concern for project economics and reliability.
Financiers won’t want to approach projects without some level of certainty that the proper precautions are being taken, and insurers may not provide coverage to projects that aren’t implementing preventative O&M and other precautions. This is similar to what’s happening with solar projects in hail-prone regions, where research into hail damage mitigation and monitoring was sparked by the insurance industry.
To try to put a number on what these losses could look like, Shaw has developed a methodology to estimate the future costs and impacts from reported PV system sourced fires in California. By estimating the number of PV systems in the state that are older than seven years and using available data to track the number of fires in California annually, Shaw’s model is able to generally predict the amount of PV fires that will occur in California and what their cost will be.
