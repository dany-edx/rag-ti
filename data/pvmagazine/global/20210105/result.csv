The IFC announced the credit line in December and has estimated South Africa offers a $588 billion, ten-year opportunity in “climate smart” renewable energy and urban infrastructure investments.
Arvana Singh, head of sustainable financial solutions for Nedbank, said: “This transaction continues to demonstrate Nedbank's commitment to engage in alternative climate finance mechanisms. These will further develop markets and support projects which create positive impacts aligned to the United Nations sustainable development goals, in pursuit of Nedbank's commitment to building a greener and cleaner economy.”
Adamou Labara, IFC country manager for South Africa, added: “While the immediate future calls for solutions to the economic damage caused by Covid-19, it is critical that we take this opportunity to rethink the structure of our economies, to build a fairer, more resilient, low-carbon future. Working with our partners to develop a strong climate finance market is an important part of this process.”
The South African government has committed to reducing carbon emissions 42% within five years and is aiming to more than double the nation's power generation capacity by 2030, with renewables supplying “as much as 20% of the mix,” according to a press release issued by the IFC on December 21 to announce the green finance loan.

The facility is expected to be built in two 5 GW phases with a total investment of RMB4.3 billion ($652 million). The first phase is expected to be completed by the end of 2021 while the second phase is scheduled for completion in June 2022. On Monday, the company also announced a capital increase of RMB790 million. These funds will be used to accelerate the construction of a 60 GW module factory that GCL is planning to build in Hefei city, Anhui province. Construction of the first, 15 GW phase was launched in December, with completion scheduled by June.
Shanghai-listed PV module maker and EPC contractor Eging PV announced last week a plan to increase its cell and module capacity. The company's existing factory in Jintan, Jiangsu province, will be upgraded and its module capacity will reach 3 GW while the cell capacity will be raised to 2 GW. The manufacturer will invest RMB1.5 billion in this new plan.
Panel provider Trina Solar had decided to build a new 8.5 GW monocrystalline solar cell factory in Yancheng City, Jiangsu province. The planned investment in the factory, which is expected to begin manufacturing activity within 24 months, amounts to around RMB3 billion. The new manufacturing facility will increase the company's planned annual production capacity in Yancheng City to 18.5 GW by 2023.
Module manufacturer JinkoSolar has agreed to buy up to 338 million square meters of solar glass from Chinese manufacturer Flat Glass. This amount would be enough to produce around 59 GW of modules up to 2023. The purchase price will be negotiated on a monthly basis.
Panel producer JA Solar has agreed to buy 32,400-43,200 metric tons of polysilicon from Xinjiang-based manufacturer Daqo. Shipments will be made up to December 2023. Also, in this case, the purchase price will be negotiated on a monthly basis.
Project developer and module provider Canadian Solar announced last week the sale of its 30% stake in Big Fish SPV S.r.l. and Iron SPV S.r.l. to Italian renewable energy company Falck Renewables. The two companies own solar plants with a combined capacity of 290 MW located in Italy. The financial terms of the transaction were not revealed.
Galloping sales of gas-guzzling SUVs in China ensured conventional vehicle sales by manufacturer BYD continued to outpace “new energy vehicles”, according to the company’s full-year sales figures. A near 44% year-on-year rise in SUV sales, to 174,298 units, added up to a 2% annual rise in oil-fueled vehicle sales as other conventional models suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic. Battery electric vehicle sales for BYD fell 11% year-on-year, to 130,970 units, and the plug-in hybrid figures fell 33% but the company saw a 44% uptick in e-bus sales, to 9,125 units.
The government of Huazhou City, in Guangdong province, announced, last week, a plan to invest RMB650 million in a 150 MW solar project across several locations. The plant will combine power generation with farming, fishery and agriculture. It is estimated the whole project will provide 160 GWh per year.
Hong Kong-listed BEWG Clean Energy Group announced an agreement with the government of Wannian county, Jiangxi province, to develop a 500 MW agrivoltaic project in the region.

Switzerland-based solar module manufacturer Meyer Burger has secured up to €22.5 million in public funds for the construction of its heterojunction solar cell factory in Thalheim, Germany.
The company was granted a €15 million grant from the regional government of Saxony-Anhalt, where the manufacturing will take place, and the German central government. Another grant of €7.5 million comes from another fund aimed to improve the regional economic structure. Both grants were received by Meyer Burger at the end of 2020.
A report by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE was prepared for the approval of environmental aid. This confirms that the planned production based on Meyer Burger's heterojunction technology has considerable environmental advantages compared to conventional cell production, the company said. Meyer Burger's investments were classified as “exceptionally innovative and environmentally friendly,” the Swiss company continued.
Meyer Burger is currently setting up its cell production in Thalheim and a module production in Freiberg. Production is scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2021 and both factories will initially have an annual capacity of 400 MW each. Cell production is to be expanded to 1.4 GW of annual capacity as soon as possible. However, this is subject to successful debt financing, Meyer Burger said.
The headline of this article was changed on 05/01/21 to reflect it is Meyer Burger's HJT cell factory which will receive the grants, not its module factory, as previously stated.

Simarpreet Singh: The year 2020 has fallen short of expectations as far as capacity additions in the rooftop solar segment are concerned. The country added 883 MW of rooftop solar capacity in the first nine months of the year. 
Though on the lower side than 2019, this performance could have been much better had it not been for the coronavirus-induced lockdown, which disrupted the supply chains and caused a shortage of labor, leading to delays in construction and restricted movement of equipment. 
As things limped back to normal, with the lockdown opening in phases, the commercial and industrial categories did particularly well in the third quarter, making up some lost ground.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/05/the-geopolitical-impact-of-hydrogen/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GEOPOLITICS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 5, 2021",The geopolitical impact of hydrogen,"pv magazine: Prof. Overland, this year we have seen a large number of governments, industrial conglomerates and big corporations announce new plans or strategies to make hydrogen into a feasible option for the energy landscape in the decades to come. We have seen the setting up of potential hydrogen clusters, hydrogen alliances, and many partnerships among heavyweights within industries of different kinds. However, it is still not clear whether the price of hydrogen will drop easily, regardless of whether green or blue. Do you believe these massive plans will be enough to make hydrogen succeed?
Indra Overland: Although it is not the first time there has been enthusiasm about hydrogen, the enthusiasm is more intense, widespread and concrete this time around. The context is also much more conducive this time, with the Paris Agreement in place, policymakers around the world taking climate change increasingly seriously, and an experience of cleantech companies doing very well on stock exchanges. However, ultimately intentions, plans and roadmaps will not be enough to turn a hydrogen economy into reality. It will depend on hydrogen becoming cost-competitive vis-à-vis other solutions in several areas, such as seasonal/grid-level energy storage, high-heat industrial processes, heavy road transport, shipping and aviation. If hydrogen does turn out to be the cheapest option in several of these areas, its future will be bright. If it only wins in one area, it is probably not going to be such a big deal although it could still have a market.
Image: Norsk Utenrikspolitisk Institutt (NUPI)
Are there countries that may be better positioned than others for the hydrogen economy?
As I showed in recent research, some countries with abundant renewable energy resources have comparative advantages in the production of green hydrogen, that is to say, hydrogen produced by hydrolysis. Space is also an important factor, because solar and wind facilities require a lot of space. Thus, a country such as Algeria might have a significant advantage and become a net exporter of green hydrogen to the European Union, especially if its existing natural gas pipelines can be repurposed for hydrogen. However, current levels of efficiency for green/hydrolytic hydrogen are not very high, so this picture is not clear as of today.
Assuming that electrolysis prices will fall enough to bring green hydrogen into the picture, what consequences should we expect in geopolitical terms? In your previous interviews with pv magazine, you stressed more than once that wind and solar, and increasing rates in the electrification of transport and mobility, would make countries less dependent on each other and on energy imports. Could hydrogen maintain certain levels of energy-dependency?
This is not an unlikely scenario. However, as I showed in one of my research [papers], such green hydrogen exporters will always be competing against their own customers! What I mean is that the exporters have an advantage in terms of renewable energy resource abundance and available space, but this advantage is not absolute, as the customers also have the opportunity to produce their own hydrogen if imports become too expensive. All countries have some renewable energy resources, even if they are not very evenly distributed. Thus if there is a growing international trade in hydrogen resulting in increased energy dependency between some countries, it is still not going to be like the oil dependencies of old between an exporting country that has a lot of oil and an importing country that has no oil.
There is currently a lot of interest in hydrogen from big utilities and fossil fuel companies, as many of them may keep using their gas infrastructure to transport and sell hydrogen, or even use gas to produce it. Do you believe that their support for one technology or another will be crucial in deciding the world’s future energy landscape?
My impression is that the climate policy momentum is too strong to be manipulated by fossil fuel companies in the long run. They might be able to temporarily greenwash something or cultivate enthusiasm about something that is not quite clear yet, such as the economics of various hydrogen options. But in the longer term it will boil down to a competition between concrete zero emission technologies and their cost-efficiencies. However, in this competition one should not write off blue and turquoise hydrogen yet. Blue and turquoise hydrogen are made by capturing carbon from natural gas and pumping the carbon back into the ground or using it for other purposes. This type of carbon capture will probably continue to be cheaper than carbon capture from exhaust fumes and may turn out to be more cost efficient than green hydrogen. If existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure can also be repurposed for hydrogen without costs becoming too high, it could become a very interesting option for quick decarbonization.
Hydrogen poses a chicken and egg problem: should we first create demand from heavy industry and transport and then build up a hydrogen generation fleet or rather first set up the latter and then stimulate demand?
So many things in the world are chicken and egg problems, but I don’t think hydrogen really is one of them. It was an intractable chicken and egg problem when it was thought that passenger cars would be the main initial market for hydrogen, but that was a big mistake as lithium ion batteries are much more suited for passenger cars and hydrogen is much more suited for other things, like temporal grid-level energy storage and high-heat industrial processes. And for those areas there is not a significant chicken and egg problem, one just has to make a bet on hydrogen and see whether one is able to compete against the alternatives.
The race for hydrogen may challenge the perspective of a fully electrified world. If producing green hydrogen will prevail, do you believe we may see less need for battery-based energy storage?
Yes, if green hydrogen costs fall significantly and enable it to compete against other storage solutions, there will necessarily be less demand for the other storage solutions. However, with the extreme growth in electromobility that I expect—which I think will outpace the expectations of most actors—there may be so much demand for lithium ion batteries for vehicles that this frees up the seasonal/grid storage for hydrogen, maybe also some other areas like aviation.
Eventually, what kind of countries may decide to have the highest rates of other types of storage, electromobility and electrification and which ones may have a stronger preference for hydrogen?
Good question. I don’t know. Maybe whatever it makes sense in one place will make sense everywhere else too, so that there is not much geographical variation.
Compared to batteries, green hydrogen is currently cleaner. Would this represent an advantage?
Yes. However, battery technology is undergoing rapid change. For example, cobalt is already on its way out. Thus, the lifecycle emissions and other social and environmental issues connected with batteries are going to change. So hydrogen has an advantage, but it is shrinking and we don’t know how much it will shrink in the future.
Is a clash of technologies and big economic interests in sight? Should we avoid it or is it inevitable?
Technologies are going to be key, and competition over hydrogen-related technologies should become pretty fierce. However, this is not exactly war, more like the competition between Apple, Huawei and Samsung in mobile telephony.
Solar and wind would benefit from both scenarios, as well as the coexistence between the two trends. Do you believe that, under these circumstances, we may see an accelerated decline of fossil fuels? Which would be the geopolitical consequences of this accelerated scenario?
If there is one thing that I am confident about it is that solar and wind will grow. At the moment, floating offshore wind is particularly dynamic, but there is an awful lot of research going on into different photovoltaic technologies that could potentially give solar a massive boost. Hydrogen is another likely piece in this puzzle of the whole energy transition that could help it accelerate.
In our most recent interviews, you highlighted repeatedly that geopolitical changes do not occur too quickly. Don’t you believe that this year, with the Covid-19 crisis and the arrival on the scene of hydrogen, an acceleration could have been triggered?
I am not sure that hydrogen will cause any dramatic acceleration in the energy transition, though more clarity on blue and turquoise hydrogen or a cost-cutting technological breakthrough on green hydrogen could do that. What I think is more likely to cause abrupt change is stranded fossil fuel assets. Financial markets are like flocks of sheep. When they swing from one thing to another it can get very crowded at the gate. I am glad I don’t have any shares in ExxonMobil to put it that way. Countries whose economies are largely based on fossil fuels could experience serious shocks in the coming two to three years. This also means that the question of blue and turquoise hydrogen is decisive. If blue and turquoise hydrogen are not viable options, it will reinforce the fossil fuel collapse. If, by contrast, blue and turquoise hydrogen turn out to be cost-efficient, the countries with the largest natural gas reserves could have very bright prospects indeed.
In previous interviews with pv magazine, Overland discussed geopolitical issues related to the GeGaLo Index itself, the myths around the geopolitics of renewable energy, and the combination of solar and hydropower. He has also talked about countries such as China, the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as technologies like storage, super-grids and the energy transition in general.

Polarons are described by the U.S.-based researchers as fleeting distortions in a material's atomic lattice that form around a moving electron in a few trillionths of a second and then disappear. “As ephemeral as they are, they affect a material's behavior and may even be the reason that solar cells made with lead hybrid perovskites achieve extraordinarily high efficiencies in the lab,” they explained.
Through an x-ray free-electron laser – the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) – the U.S.-based researchers have observed for the first time the formation of these local distortions, including their size, shape and how they evolve. The femtosecond-resolution diffuse x-ray scattering measurements showed that when free electrons start to move around the perovskite material they are surrounded and engulfed by a sort of bubble of polaron distortion that moves along with them. “Some people have argued that this ‘bubble' protects electrons from scattering off defects in the material and helps explain why they travel so efficiently to the solar cell's contact to flow out as electricity,” research co-author Burak Guzelturk stated.
Polarons are able to form and grow in perovskite cells due to the flexible and soft lattice structure of lead hybrid perovskites. When they form, they have a very small size of a few angstroms (an angstrom is one 10-billionth of a meter) but then rapidly expand outward in all directions and reach a diameter of about five billionths of a meter. “This nudges about 10 layers of atoms slightly outward within a roughly spherical area over the course of tens of picoseconds, or trillionths of a second,” Stanford scientist Aaron Lindenberg added.
The scientists explained that these results were confirmed by optical pump-probe reflection spectroscopy and that the big novelty in their work is represented by the discovery that polarons have a larger size than expected. “While this experiment shows, as directly as possible, that these objects really do exist, it doesn't show how they contribute to the efficiency of a solar cell,” the research team concluded. “There's still further work to be done to understand how these processes affect the properties of these materials.”
The findings of the research were presented in the paper Visualization of dynamic polaronic strain fields in hybrid lead halide perovskites, published in Nature Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/05/gcl-concern-over-senior-notes-due-january-30/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",MAX HALL,"JANUARY 5, 2021",GCL concern over senior notes due January 30,"The heavily-indebted solar project subsidiary of polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly has warned the holders of US$500 million of senior notes due to mature this month it may not be able to honor the investment.
An update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange just before Christmas warned: “The company [GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd] estimates that its existing internal resources may be insufficient to repay the existing notes.”
Holders of the 7.1%-interest-bearing notes – issued on the Hong Kong stock market three years ago – have been asked to swap them for 9.75% notes on the Singapore Exchange, which would mature in three years' time. Under the terms of the proposed deal, note holders would exchange each US$1,000 worth of the investment for US$950, a US$50 cash consideration, a US$10 “instruction fee” and any interest accrued on the existing notes, plus a cash settlement for any fractional note holdings.
Crucially, investors will also have to agree to back any debt restructuring plan which takes place in the event of the senior note swap falling through, with GCL stating the transaction will only take place if the holders of 90% of the notes – $450 million worth – agree to the arrangement. The financial update issued by the company on December 23 added the proposal would see GCL replace the existing notes with “up to [US]$475 million” of new notes, without explaining the US$25 million shortfall implied in any new issue. The poly maker stated it would reserve the right to cancel the proposed notes swap in the event of any “adverse development in the market” or if the deal be deemed not to be “in the company's best interest.”
With the notes due on January 30, holders have until January 13 to sign up to the deal – and to sign away their right to oppose any subsequent company restructure, the terms of which may only be waived or amended by the company and the holders of more than half the senior notes in question.
GCL said it had been forced to request the postponement of its debt because it was owed RMB9.17 billion (US$1.42 billion) in solar subsidies at the end of June and had net current liabilities of RMB6.51 billion at that point. The company warned a failure to postpone settlement of the notes would trigger a cross-default of debts.
The polysilicon manufacturer has ramped up efforts to sell off its solar park estate in China and there was a further flurry of sales over the festive period as state-owned entities continued to cherry pick projects.
The day the senior notes news broke, GCL announced another proposed project sale, of three projects with a generation capacity of 90 MW to Hunan Xinhua Water Conservancy and Electric Power Co Ltd. The sale price of RMB140 million (US$21.7 million), dividend windfall of RMB61 million and payment of liabilities owed by the projects to GCL of RMB61 million are expected to generate RMB203 million for the seller and will remove RMB480 million in liabilities from GCL's books even as the transaction marks a RMB20.8 million loss for the seller, based on the value of the solar farms.
On Wednesday, GCL announced another, 30 MW project sale to Hunan Xinhua, which is 99.6% owned by the China National Nuclear Corp and the Ministry of Water Resources. That second deal would actually mark a RMB2.78 million profit for GCL, which would bank a net RMB70 million from the sale of its 51% holding in the project.
December 28 was another busy day for GCL shareholders, who voted through a previous sale of six solar projects while learning of a proposed deal to sell another 217 MW of generation capacity in Anhui, to Xuzhou State Investment and Environmental Protection Energy Co Ltd. That sale would net the seller RMB985 million (US$152 million) and remove another RMB951 million from the company liabilities column whilst constituting a net loss of RMB27.4 million on project value. It will be voted on by shareholders on January 15.
In a further effort to pay down debt, the Elite Time Global entity which holds GCL-Poly's controlling stake in the GCL New Energy project business proposed, on December 29, watering down its 62.28% holding to 58.94% by selling 638 million shares for HK$0.235 (US$0.03) each, to generate net profits of up to HK$145 million (US$18.7 million).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/05/sustainable-pumped-hydro-across-616818-sites/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 5, 2021","Sustainable pumped-hydro across 616,818 sites","Scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) have identified 616,818 locations throughout the world that could be suitable sites for 23.1 million GWh of pumped-hydro storage capacity.
The sites relate exclusively to closed-loop pumped-hydro energy storage projects with little environmental impact due to their location away from rivers and can be found through an open-source online platform managed by the Australian government.
The identified sites are all located at altitudes of less than 100 m above sea level and have sufficient height differences to enable potential energy storage between two water reservoirs. “The upper reservoir can be located near a hilltop rather than in a river valley, which substantially increases the height difference (‘head') between the reservoirs and hence the available potential energy,” the research team said, adding that a large head varying from 100 m to 800 m is usually preferable.
“Off-river” pumped-hydro projects are also said to overcome the typical topographical issues of conventional pumped-hydro, as the size of reservoirs is relatively small, ranging from tens to hundreds of hectares. This limited size also reduces the need to manage large flood events and ensures considerably lower construction costs.
The enormous storage potential identified in the research should be mostly used for medium-term storage of intermittent PV and wind power generation. “The pumped hydro resource is well distributed at a regional and sub-regional level to support variable renewable energy deployment,” the academics explained. “The total global storage capacity of 23 million GWh is 300 times larger than the world’s average electricity production of 0.07 million GWh per day.”
Using just 1% of the identified sites in the atlas for pumped-hydro storage would be enough to support a global electricity system powered by 100% of renewables, according to the researchers. Currently, there are over 180 GW of pumped-hydro storage systems in operation around the world.
The Australian group also emphasized that the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for closed-loop, off-river pumped hydro is currently the lowest for storage of hours to days. ” The lowest energy storage cost is achieved in reservoir pairs with large head and large water-to-rock (V/R) ratios for the target storage capacity,” it stressed.
The findings of the research were presented in the study Global Atlas of Closed-Loop Pumped Hydro Energy Storage, published in Joule.
In a previous work published in April 2019, the same research group had identified 530,000 locations for 22 million GWh of pumped-hydro storage capacity. In this research, as well as in the latest paper, the scientists identified the sites through a global audit that relied on geographic information system (GIS) algorithms.
The algorithms helped to identify dry-gully or turkey’s nest sites, which include upper and lower reservoirs with hypothetical tunnels between them. The researchers were able to look at data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, water volume, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost. “There is an increase in the number of sites relative to the earlier release due to modification of the filtering,” research co-author Matt Stocks told pv magazine.

The results of France's third tender for solar projects featuring innovative technology were published yesterday by the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE).
The regulator allocated 146.2 MW of PV capacity across 47 projects in the procurement exercise. The final average price was €0.0815/kWh.
In Q1 2021, pv magazine’s UP initiative will shine a spotlight on agrivoltaics – the combination of agriculture and solar energy – in recognition of this emerging market. The goal is to understand the potential benefits, and economic, political and technical challenges of such an innovative partnership. Make sure you stay informed!
Of the assigned projects, 31, totaling around 80 MW, were for agrivoltaic installations. Most of these plants will be located in southern France and, in particular, in the region of Occitanie. French agrivoltaic specialist Sun’Agri was the largest winner in the tender, with 22 projects with a combined capacity of 58 MW.
“The results of this call for tenders confirm the interest of the public authorities in agrivoltaics as a flagship solution for the adaptation of agriculture to climate change, and contribute to the development of a sector of excellence in France,” said Antoine Nogier, president and founder of Sun’Agri. “But this result is also a translation of the urgency to implement now solutions that improve agriculture and make it more resilient.”
In the second tender for innovative PV held in April, the CRE allocated 104 MW of generation capacity across 39 projects, around 40 MW of it from agrivoltaic projects. Those schemes will sell power for an average €0.0828/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/05/manufacturers-call-for-module-size-standardization/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 5, 2021",Manufacturers call for module size standardization,"Trina Solar, along with seven other prominent solar module manufacturers, is pushing to standardize 210mm silicon wafers and modules.
The proposal looks to set 210+/-0.25mm as the standard size of silicon wafers in the 210-220mm size range under the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International Photovoltaic Standards (SEMI), while revising the existing module size standards.
For most of the past decade, the traditional wafer size has been 156.75mm, with that size representing more than 90% of the monocrystalline market. Since 2019 however, manufacturers have begun to see benefits in increasing wafer sizes, leading ultimately to modules rated at 500 W+ appearing on the market.
Because these modules are made by multiple manufacturers, the size change has not been uniform, and that can lead to confusion and increased cost, proponents of the standard said.
Besides setting a standard size, the Trina-led proposal also calls for promoting the standard sizes of silicon wafers and modules as follows:
The companies, which include Risen Energy, Zhonghuan Semiconductor, Tongwei, Huansheng Photovoltaic, Runyang New Energy Technology, Canadian Solar and Wuxi Shangji Automation, alongside Trina, argue that standardizing the silicon wafers will allow the solar industry to achieve scale, and enable all businesses to improve production efficiency, optimize supply chains and drive technological innovation.
The companies also argue that standardization will allow for more competitive manufacturing by decreasing initial investment for new companies and providing some certainty that investments won’t be wasted if a new size becomes more popular.
Trina has been the group’s vocal leader, providing releases supporting the effort, as well as conducting studies to help demonstrate the value and safety of 210mm wafers.
For developers, the companies argue that a 210mm standard will decrease balance of system costs and the levelized cost of electricity for new solar projects.
These balance of system costs refer to large-scale, ground-mount solar projects, the market segment where 210mm wafers are currently practical. With standardization, these larger wafers could be manufactured for smaller-sized modules with a lower power rating. To date, however, they have been utilized in 500W+ modules, which are too large for typical rooftop installations.
In a company release, Trina outlines why 210mm is the group’s preferred size choice by highlighting flux value, the dumpling effect and cost savings delivered by using fewer modules in an installation. (Fewer modules means lower junction box, potting, combiner box, DC cable, installation and construction costs).
Flux value refers to the increase in production capacity brought about by large-size products, reducing the cost of labor, depreciation, and operating, management and financial expenses per unit of output.
The dumpling effect refers to the increase in the amount of auxiliary materials in transportation, such as frame, glass, backsheet, EVA, ribbon bus bars, pallets and packaging materials being less than the increase in module area when using large-size wafers in module production, bringing savings in encapsulation and transportation costs.
The company also offered a cost calculation of 210mm wafers, compared to 166mm and 182mm wafers, across the entire value chain:
In a separate study, Trina addresses one of the most prevalent concerns facing the standardization of 210mm wafer size: the high working temperature of such modules due to their high-current output.
As a module’s operating temperature rises, the open-circuit voltage will decrease, while the short-circuit current increases slightly, leading to decreases in photovoltaic conversion efficiency and cell power. According to the company study, an energy loss of 0.20% occurs for every 1℃ of increase in operating temperature.
The same study, however, found that, under the same installation and cooling conditions, the working temperature of 210mm and 182mm modules are nearly the same. It said that the cells only change the area with the same Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) structure and efficiency.
According to Trina, 210mm and 182mm cells have the same PERC structure and their efficiency is almost the same. With similar packing materials and under the same optical environment, there is almost no difference in the current density of such modules. The increase in current in the 210mm ultra-high-power module is driven by a larger cell, as current is the product of current density multiplied by cell area.
And even though the current is larger, efficiency remains the same with a steady current density and larger cell area. In addition, for the same module efficiency, the amount of unutilized heat – the solar energy which cannot be converted into electric energy – is the same in terms of unit area.
With the same installation and heat dissipation conditions, operating temperatures for 210mm ultra-high power modules and 182mm modules are roughly the same, it said.
