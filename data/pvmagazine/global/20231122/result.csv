Italy added about 3.5 GW of new PV capacity across around 280,000 systems in the first nine months of this year, according to new statistics from Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE), the Italian energy agency.
The country reached 28.57 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of September 2023. About 8.44 GW of the total came from rooftop installations, while the remaining 16.61 GW is represented by ground-mounted arrays.
About 46% of the power added in the first nine months of this year originates from residential installations, with recent growth driven by the commercial and industrial sector (C&I) and utility-scale projects above 1 MW in size.
The regions with the highest share of total new capacity additions include Lombardia with 649 MW, Veneto with 486 MW, and Emilia Romagna with 361 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/22/the-solar-module-surplus-eupd-research-considers-europes-warehouse-woes/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,EUROPE",,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",The solar module surplus: EUPD Research considers Europe’s warehouse woes,"Rystad Energy analysts recently expressed apprehension about a substantial surplus of unsold solar modules stockpiled in European warehouses. Rystad noted that in the first eight months of 2023, Europe imported approximately 78 GW of solar modules, a figure which surpassed anticipated installations for the entire year.
Import data to the end of September 2023, supplied by energy thinktank Ember, reached 85.9 GW [1] and the data beyond September 2023 is unavailable. Nevertheless, unless there is a substantial deceleration in deliveries to Europe, it is envisaged the module surplus may exceed 100 GW by year-end in 2023. Marius Mordal Bakke, a senior supply chain analyst at Rystad Energy, emphasized his concerns about the declining prices of solar modules in the market and the challenges associated with de-stocking older panels procured at higher cost. He underscored the necessity for the industry to adapt to shifting market dynamics.
Nonetheless, this development has provoked varying responses from other analysts, including Karl-Heinz Remmers, the founder of pv magazine. He has criticized Rystad Energy analysts, drawing particular attention to their inconsistency in estimating the stock of PV modules in European warehouses, with figures fluctuating between 40 GW and 80 GW. Remmers' primary contention appears to be that Rystad's statements may be generating undue alarm. He maintains that a surplus of PV modules in the European Union is a common occurrence. He emphasizes that EU analysts should embrace the notion that a warehouse stock ranging from 10 GW to 19 GW represents a “normal” inventory and should not be associated with the notion of “dumping.”
Remmers has presented three scenarios with the one EUPD Research finds most plausible as follows: With a 60 GW market in the European Union in 2023, “normal” inventory would run to 10 GW. Remmers estimates the European Union deployed 50 GW of module generation capacity to the end of October 2023 and posits a 59 GW module excess to the end of 2023, including stock carried over from 2022.
EUPD Research insists robust analysis must be contingent upon precise PV installation data. Our comprehensive assessments, rooted in years of meticulous data collection and monitoring of PV installations in our databases, necessitate certain adjustments to the figures put forth by various other analysts.
First and foremost, the 78 GW of Chinese PV exports to the European Union's 27 member states (the EU27) to the end of August must be considered with caution. The calculations were made by Ember, a London based independent energy thinktank. The General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China does not release the generation capacity of its solar exports. Ember’s estimation was arrived at by dividing the export value of panels, in US dollars, by average monthly PV module prices [2]. When EUPD calculated the export capacity of Chinese products by using a methodology based on several data points, including module export weight, the figure fell to around 66.6 GW, reducing oversupply concern.
Additionally, there appears to be a miscalculation in the assertion that the European Union installed 46 GW of solar capacity in 2022. EUPD data [3] indicates the actual installation figure was approximately 40.4 GW, for the EU27, and 44 GW for the wider European market. Consequently, when considering that China exported 7 GW to the European Union in 2021, the surplus of Chinese exports from 2022 stands at approximately 47 GW:
Effective inventory management entails demand forecasting and EUPD expects the European Union to have deployed around 60 GW of solar generation capacity during 2023, almost 20 GW more than in 2022.
That would render the other two scenarios outlined by Remmers inconsequential – unless European energy authorities undertake significant retroactive revisions of their PV installation data during the first half of 2024. While the ultimate outcome remains to be seen, the 60 GW figure is based on EU27 third-quarter 2023 updates and the methodology of EUPD Research’s Global Energy Transition Matrix (GET Matrix) database [4].
EUPD Research's forecast for 2024 installed PV capacity ranges from 65 GW to 75 GW, depending on scenario. If Chinese solar exports to the European Union in 2023 reach 100 GW [5], that would bring an excess of 40 GW worth of panels shipped during 2023 to add to the 2022 surplus of 47.2 GW for total oversupply of 87.2 GW [6]. If a quarter of that figure (around 22 GW) is considered normal warehouse flow, the true oversupply runs to around 65 GW, similar to Remmers' 59 GW suggestion.
­­­Yes, there is. Zhang Sen, secretary-general of the photovoltaic branch of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export wrote, in an article published on China’s Ministry of Commerce website, that, “Due to the optimistic atmosphere in the European market last year [2022] and the recent decline in European electricity prices, distributors have excess inventory.” Sen said, as the European Union is poised to install approximately 70 GW of solar capacity in 2024, it becomes evident that a chunk of 2024's PV installations will already exist within European warehouses at the onset of January 2024.
Furthermore, in conjunction with the data derived from the EUPD Research price and stock monitoring databases in Germany and Europe, as well as disconcerting feedback from various stakeholders, it could be concluded concern is real.
EUPD Research meticulously monitors the net purchase price of solar modules crafted from monocrystalline passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cells, from the perspective of PV installers. It is noteworthy that these prices have reached historic lows. In the fourth quarter of 2023, prices for monocrystalline PERC modules from Chinese manufacturers are falling 30% compared to the first quarter of 2022.
While the lower prices generally reflect market developments over the previous two years, the reductions for Chinese manufacturers are particularly striking. For modules of the same technology produced by German manufacturers, the price decline over the same period was around 15%, only half the fall experienced by Chinese manufacturers. The persistent price fluctuations pose a particularly formidable challenge for installers who had made substantial prepayments to accumulate significant module stockpiles, anticipating extended delivery times.
Testimony from one such installer underscored the predicament. They told EUPD research, “The market has completely collapsed. Even the suppliers have cut their selling prices, by almost 50% from 2022 to 2023. We are the ones left behind because we ordered in 2021 for delivery at the end of 2022 so that we can work in 2023, and we will make huge losses this year. We are expecting a 75% drop in volume and a 50% drop in purchasing because prices have dropped so much. We are curious to see if we can survive that. And that's after 20 years of stability in the market and having weathered every solar crisis so far.”
This statement poignantly illustrates the issue of price erosion. In previous years, the primary challenge for installers was extended delivery times, prompting many to diversify their product portfolios and accumulate larger quantities of stock. However, those forward-thinking installers are now confronting the brunt of the challenge. Availability is no longer a major concern and market oversupply has driven prices down significantly compared to the previous year, when some installers made significant stock purchases.
The causes of the current oversupply are varied and include the solar learning curve, a need for the industry to be reordered, the fact Chinese manufacturers scaled much more rapidly than expected, and that those Chinese players could lose market share as attempts are made to onshore solar manufacturing.
Like any other technology, PV has to go through a learning curve. The solar learning curve refers to the process of continually reducing cost as more experience and expertise are gained in PV development and deployment. Swanson’s and Wright’s laws clearly describe how the cost or time required to perform an industrial task decreases as the task is repeated and experience is gained. Costs decrease and performance improves as industry gains knowledge and experience in manufacturing, installing, and maintaining solar systems. The price drops being experienced in the solar market today are primarily a phase in PV evolution that needs to be understood and managed.
China Chamber's Sen has said the industry is poised for a transformation due to the recurrent issue of oversupply. In 2023, prominent photovoltaic companies including Longi Solar, JA Solar, Jinko Solar, Trina Solar, and Tongwei, have unveiled plans to expand production capacity. The expanded capacity predominantly focuses on negatively-doped, “n-type” production, known for its enhanced photovoltaic conversion efficiency. Notably, the n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology route is the primary choice, although n-type heterojunction (HJT) technology is also in use. The expansion of those companies serves a dual purpose argues Sen – facilitating the rapid advancement of new technology and reducing production costs. However, it also accelerates the depreciation of photovoltaic equipment due to the excess production capacity, compelling enterprises to increase investment in back-end research and development and continually expand high-efficiency production capability to meet demand. Sen’s conclusion is that this, in turn, forces relatively lethargic small and medium-sized photovoltaic companies to exit the market.
Moreover, newer, more efficient modules mean faster installation with a smaller workforce required and, subsequently, higher margins. Put that in the context of an acute shortage of skilled workers in Europe and it would not be difficult to understand why such tectonic reshuffling of the industry, with a focus on new technology, is transpiring.
Chinese solar manufacturing capacity increased at a much faster pace than the PV market. As Chinese companies competed to have a bigger share of the market, Europe had to deal with basic issues such as supply (including critical material delays), and installation bottlenecks (including grid issues, and labor shortages). As an example, EUPD’s PV InstallerMonitor 2022/2023 found 63% of surveyed installers in Germany stated customers had to wait at least four months for installation after their initial contact. Although not as acute as in Germany, the situation was more or less the same for other major European markets.
Covid-led supply chain disruption, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and increasingly ambitious climate change goals have mobilized the main importers of Chinese solar modules to kick off initiatives favoring local manufacturing. The most important destinations for Chinese module exports have traditionally been the United States and the European Union. Both these markets have planned, or are planning to further support their domestic industries via local manufacturing support policies. Legislation includes the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), in the United States [7]; and the Solar Energy Strategy aspect of the European Union's REPowerEU plan; Europe's Green Deal Industrial Plan, published in February 2023; the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA); and the Critical Raw Materials Act, both of which were published in March 2023 [8]. The European Union policies aim for 40% of the bloc's solar generation capacity in 2030 (around 30 GW) to comprise European-made components.
Furthermore, it should be emphasized that, as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union is adopting a more cautious approach to avoid placing exclusive reliance on Beijing for its solar energy initiatives. If China takes on the primary role in advancing green energy within the European Union, that would grant Beijing greater influence in key political decisions, displacing Brussels. European policymakers are thus striving to reduce their critical infrastructure dependence on China.
From 2013 to 2018, the European Commission introduced minimum import tariffs on Chinese solar products to protect its domestic solar industry. That did not deliver a renaissance of European solar manufacturing, which experienced persistent insolvencies. The period also brought a bust in solar demand – it took several years for Europe’s solar installation rates to return to 2011 levels. Thus, one would think that the European Union would not again sleepwalk into such a blunder, especially as Brussels does not have the support of most of the solar sector which is responsible for almost all European solar jobs and revenues today.
Against such a background, and as Europe’s solar sector industry association, SolarPower Europe is recommending the European Commission amend EU state aid rules – the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework – to allow EU member states to support European solar manufacturers with their operating expenditure costs. SolarPower Europe also wants “resilience auction” procurement exercises, under the NZIA, which would be earmarked for solely European made solar components. And the trade body has called for an EU-level financing instrument dedicated to European-produced PV – a “solar manufacturing bank.” [9]
Moreover, as each EU member state has a different solar ecosystem, it is highly likely each state will create special mechanisms to further support local PV production. The reaction of member states level is a matter to be determined in the coming months.
In the realm of the PV industry, effective inventory management in the face of fluctuating demand and prolonged lead times presents a formidable challenge. This challenge necessitates a meticulous and collaborative approach, recognizing that no singular entity operates in isolation within this dynamic industry. Instead, it is prudent for all stakeholders to adopt a holistic perspective, encompassing the broader business ecosystem. This comprehensive approach mandates decisions that not only bolster individual profit margins but also foster the collective wellbeing of interconnected companies.
Inherent uncertainty persists in demand, due to the perpetual evolution of technology. Consequently, it is imperative for manufacturers to engage in proactive collaboration with their clientele, gaining profound insights into the actual, attainable demand for their manufactured products. Additionally, an opportunity exists for suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to participate in innovative and cooperative endeavors focused on the efficient recycling of unused components, ensuring their sustainable integration into the hands of end-users.
EUPD Research maintains a steadfast belief that the market will naturally self-regulate as the industry undergoes a transformative “reshuffling.” This self-regulation will occur in tandem with the stabilization of regulatory mechanisms, rendering them less susceptible to fluctuation. Simultaneously, different stakeholders will acquire a refined understanding of the rules governing their activity. It is evident that component manufacturers boasting exemplary back-end R&D will strategically prioritize shipments to regions where reasonable profit margins can be maintained, meticulously factoring in logistics and distribution costs. Conversely, markets characterized by a high risk of revenue loss will be approached with caution.
Within this intricate landscape, pivotal factors for achieving success encompass access to comprehensive market intelligence, the harnessing of invaluable insights from industry installers, the adoption of a strategically astute regional positioning, and judicious entry into the market with a meticulously calibrated level of investment. It is imperative to recognize that Europe constitutes a mosaic of distinct states, each delineated by unique political, economic, and environmentally sustainable strategies and prerequisites. The linchpin for survival and subsequent prosperity in the European PV market lies in the nuanced understanding of “what,” “how much,” and “when.” This is achievable exclusively through rigorous market research and data analysis.
Against this backdrop, EUPD Research extends the following resolute recommendation to the principal stakeholders in the realm of politics and industry, for the months ahead.
Punitive tariffs would severely impact the European Union's climate goals and job market, would slow down the PV industry as European end-customer and consumer costs would increase. With the European Union goal of achieving 42.5% renewable energy in its power mix by 2030 – which entails an acceleration of the PV deployment to 600 GWac by 2030 – solar is expected to create more than 1 million jobs in the European Union by 2025. Therefore, the reshoring of European manufacturing must happen with great caution and the right tools, so that the painful, fruitless experience of the 2010s is not repeated.
In the ever-evolving landscape of the European Union's renewable energy industry, navigating complexity and embracing innovation are paramount. The art of communication tailored specifically to target audiences will be key. Messages need to be created that resonate deeply, addressing the concerns and aspirations of diverse stakeholders within the renewable energy sector. Expertise in understanding the nuanced needs of installers, distributors, and other market intermediaries is required. By identifying and engaging with these key players, synergistic partnerships should be created that can drive meaningful progress.
Macro market intelligence will be vital in understanding global and regional trends, installed capacity figures, module prices, and the amount of PV components manufactured and exported. That would lead to a clear understanding of the top and emerging markets in each region, in the short and medium term and would help align supply and demand on a macro level.
In other words, and strategically speaking, optimized supply chains can ensure products reach the right place at the right time. That, coupled with a nuanced understanding of local markets, as micro market intelligence, will enable stakeholders to establish localized company presences that resonate with regional sensibilities.
At the heart of any successful approach in Europe lies a finely tuned brand management strategy. Compelling narratives that capture the essence of each renewable energy initiative must be created, along with adaptive strategies acknowledging the unique challenges posed by each European state. By employing country-specific language, cultural gaps can be bridged and a sense of connection that transcends borders can be fostered.
Finally, in a world where sustainability is not just a goal but a necessity, implementation of the right communication strategies, combined with comprehensive market knowledge, emerge as the catalysts for transformative change. The mission is to accompany business partners to thrive in the European Union's renewable energy industry. By aligning the right strategies with the pulse of local communities, impactful change is created which can usher in a future where renewable energy isn't just a choice but the cornerstone of progress.

French PV module manufacturer Voltec Solar has secured €9.3 million ($10.1 million) from Ademe, France’s environmental agency. The company plans to use the funds to speed up the production of perovskite-silicon tandem solar panels.
“I have no doubt that it is the technology that allows access to the market,” Voltec Solar Director Lucas Weiss told pv magazine.
The French manufacturer currently operates two 250 MW production lines at its factory in Dinsheim-sur-Bruche, France.
“Each of the lines is compatible with p-type PERC or n-type TOPCon and heterojunction (HJT) technology, but we have mainly sold PERC technology until now,” Weiss said. “We are launching a new product range in spring 2024 using TOPCon cells.”
Voltec Solar is also developing four-junction (4T) perovskite-silicon technology with the Institut Photovoltaïque d’Île-de-France (IPVF), with the aim of producing 5 GW by 2030.
The facility will make modules based on IPVF's 4T tandem solar cell technology. The two entities plan to set up the first pilot production line by the end of 2023 and the first 200 MW industrial demonstrator in 2025. They will then increase the factory's capacity to 1 GW in 2027 and 5 GW by 2030.
IPVF and Voltec created a joint venture, France PV Industrie, to implement the project. The pilot line will require an investment of €15 million and the industrial demonstrator will require €50 million. The partners estimate the total investment at around €1 billion by 2030.
“To stand out and win markets, you have to bet on factors such as performance, price and durability,” Weiss said. “On the first point, perovskites, and in particular in tandem, present interesting yields.”

Germany installed 1,231 MW of new PV capacity in October, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). This compares to 1,050 MW in September and 706.5 MW in October 2022.
In the first 10 months of this year, developers connected 11.7 GW of solar to the grid, compared to 6.12 GW in the same period a year earlier. The country's cumulative solar capacity surpassed 79.2 GW at the end of October
Rooftop PV systems, incentivized by Germany's incentive program, accounted for more than 606 MW of new capacity in October, while 535 MW of ground-mounted PV systems, selected under Germany's tender schemes, were installed in the same month.
The German government has already surpassed its target of installing 9 GW this year, but achieving the cumulative goal of 215 GW by 2030 requires a monthly linear increase of 1,578 MW, a threshold that has not been reached in any month this year, according to the Bundesnetzagentur.

Fraunhofer ISE and Heckert Solar have collaborated on the development of a high-efficiency PV module with M12 half cells and a 20.5% efficiency rating. Fraunhofer ISE handled conception, pre-development, and initial prototype production, while Heckert Solar established a new production line at its main facility in Chemnitz, Germany, for the 400 W module, targeting residential use.
“The jointly developed photovoltaic module is characterized by the use of M12 half cells with twelve busbars and a special arrangement of the solar cells through a so-called cross-string design,” said Christian Reichel, project manager at Fraunhofer ISE. “The resulting reduced mechanical stress on the solar cells and cell connectors reduces the risk of breakage of the solar cells.”
The PV module's design integrates findings from Fraunhofer ISE's life cycle analysis across different module types. To minimize the CO2 footprint, the research team developed optimized supply chains for the module.
“We have already been able to implement part of the production concept for the smallest possible CO2 footprint that was developed in the project,” said Ronny Köhler, head of quality assurance at Heckert Solar. “We only use green electricity to produce the modules, most of which is generated by our own photovoltaic systems on the factory premises. The waste heat from our offices and packaging materials are largely reused.”
Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (BMWK) funded the development of the new product under the “Komoger” research project, which designs competitive modules to be specifically made in Germany.
The module has been in series production since the beginning of this year. Although the larger M12 cells significantly enhance solar module efficiency, standard European production lines cannot process them, according to Fraunhofer ISE.
German PV production equipment supplier Teamtechnik developed its stringer systems for this format as part of the project. The new flexible stringer for various cell formats and with the option for flat wire and round wire connection is now part of the Chemnitz production and is also used in the Module-TEC laboratory at Fraunhofer ISE.
“The further development of stringers for interconnecting solar cells with more than six busbars as well as the wire interconnection of solar cells in M12 format were a milestone for us,” said Thomas Fischer, project manager at Eckert Solar. “This helps ensure that European photovoltaic production systems remain viable.”
Heckert Solar expanded its annual module production to 400 MW this year by constructing an additional factory in Langenwetzendorf, Germany. In August 2022, the company announced a €2 billion ($2.2 billion) investment in PV production in Germany with Interfloat and Wattkraft.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/22/only-3-portuguese-energy-communities-operating-despite-massive-demand/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,PORTUGAL",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",Only 3 Portuguese energy communities operating despite massive demand,"The European Commission published its legal framework for renewable energy communities in 2018 and 2019, with the Portuguese government following suit with its own legislation the following year.
But despite the European Union and Portuguese government’s best efforts to kickstart the movement, four years on from the first legislative push there are only three energy communities legally operating in Portugal.
Humberto Queiroz revealed to pv magazine that there are another 200 awaiting legal authorization in Portugal’s “time-demanding” regulatory backlog.
“You can have a collective for self-consumption, but to have a formal energy community, this process is very time demanding,” said Queiroz, a researcher at Portugal's Nova School of Science and Technology.
Quiroz, also an engineer employed at Lisbon-based Utility EDP, said it is “general knowledge” that an energy-sharing community must receive a license from the government’s Directorate-General of Energy and Geology (DGEG) before it can legally operate in Portugal. Permits usually take over a year to be granted, he said.
This means that hundreds of projects are stalled in these government systems awaiting approval, Quiroz said.
pv magazine asked the DGEG how many energy-sharing projects are in the pipeline and what is the average wait time before they get approved but did not get a response.
One operational energy-sharing community is the 184 MW project located in the western Portuguese coastal community of Cascais. According to the local Cascais government website, formal operations for the €250 million ($273 million) project started on Feb. 24, 2021, with the array generating a quarter of the municipality’s total yearly electricity consumption.
Energy-sharing communities lead to greater public acceptance of renewable energy projects, private investment, lower electricity bills and local job creation, the European Commission states online. A 2023 study reiterated the manifold economic benefits of these systems, saying their results show it is economically feasible for a third party to invest with the right energy prices and payback time.
Despite these benefits, Queiroz said the biggest challenge affecting the success of these solar projects is the lengthy permit wait followed by cost and community appetite. “It is up to the people, and how willing they are to invest in solar PVs and batteries, and if they are really interested in that,” he said.
But the draw is that energy savings will be reinvested back into the community, Quieroz said. Those who made money from the scheme can sell surplus electricity back to the community, or use it to power or construct public infrastructure.
Queiroz co-authored a recently published research paper that assessed the energy-sharing coefficients of Portuguese renewable energy communities. The review, based on a set of simulations across public infrastructure, found that time-variable energy-sharing coefficients are the best option for the renewable energy community. Larger consumers integrated into renewable energy communities also garnered bigger benefits, the researchers found.
“These benefits decrease when buildings are allowed to self-consume local generated energy prior to the sharing process as demand inequalities become less important for the computation of the considered sharing coefficients,” the authors said in the paper. “The entire community also presents better performance in this case.”
Queiroz also firmly believes in these communities fighting energy poverty. Not only are consumers' energy bills slashed, but they can use this relieved money to pay for other important goods, such as healthcare and food, he said.
Queiroz's findings are included in the paper “Assessment of energy sharing coefficients under the new Portuguese renewable energy communities regulation“, published last month in Heliyon.
Portugal’s energy makeup for 2022 consisted of mostly oil (42%) followed by natural gas (22%), biomass 15%, electricity (14) and “other” (5.3%), according to the DGEG’s website. The country recorded an estimated 2.5 GW installed capacity at the end of last year, according to the most up-to-date statistics provided by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

“The main contribution of the research study presented in this paper concerns the comparison of a real CSC application of the three possible energy-sharing types regulated in France,” said the researchers.
The study was demonstrated on three buildings at the Izarbel Technology Park in southwestern France. Buildings ESTIA1 and ESTIA2 mainly host student activity related to the engineering school of the ESTIA Institute of Technology. Building ESTIA4, is a business facility with a data center.
The EKATE research project will install 286 kW across three buildings. The study focuses on the first step of installing 149 kW on ESTIA1, which will supply energy to all three buildings.
“As the above-mentioned PV was not yet installed during the EKATE project, the existing 5.6 kW PV installation at ESTIA1 (installed in 2005) was used to emulate the 149 kW PV panels to be installed shortly,” the academics said. “The fact that the new PV panels will have the same location and orientation as those already installed is a solid guarantee of the quality of the emulation.”
The Internet of Things (IoT) architecture will control and manage energy allocation in the park, using sensors, meter readings, and weather data. The three buildings prioritize using PV-generated power based on energy allocation methods, selling surplus energy to the grid. Energy data is recorded in the blockchain and shared with the local French utility for billing.
The static energy allocation method maintained constant keys of repartition (KoR) at an unspecified rate. In the default dynamic case, KoRs are variable and automatically calculated by the French grid operator, Enedis, in proportion to the consumption of each building. The customized dynamic energy allocation method is based on maximizing economic benefits.
“In France, the building that is equipped with PV panels does not pay the CSPE (taxes that are not related to the grid) nor the TURPE (grid tariff). As the PV panels were installed in ESTIA 1, this building did not pay these taxes,” the researchers said.
ESTIA 2 incurred TURPE charges for grid usage but not CSPE, due to shared ownership with ESTIA1. In contrast, ESTIA4 faced a tariff of €0.11 ($0.12)/kWh. ESTIA1 achieved a 66% boost in savings, attributed to tax benefits, while ESTIA2 saw a 38% increase. Consequently, dynamic energy allocation prioritized ESTIA1's consumption, using surplus for ESTIA2, and then ESTIA4. Any remaining surplus was fed back into the grid for sale to the French electricity generation company. Researchers compared the outcomes of these methods in four scenarios – with and without a data center, and for low and high solar radiation.
The researchers said that it is not clear whether the data center will be included in the final CSC, so both scenarios were checked.
The data center at ESTIA4 maintains consistent electricity consumption among its servers, guaranteeing a permanent usage of over 100 kW.
“Compared with the static type of sharing based on consumption, the self-consumption rate (SCR) of dynamic allocations was 3.86% higher in the first scenario (low solar radiation and no data center), 0.78% higher in the second scenario (high solar radiation and no data center), and 0% higher in the third and fourth scenarios (low solar radiation and data center and high solar radiation and data center),” the academics said. “The static sharing based on investment was the worst-performing allocation strategy in terms of SCR.”
As for the financial savings, the differences were more substantial. In the first scenario, the customized dynamic sharing increased savings by 4.84% over the consumption-based static allocation and 4.25% over the dynamic default. In the second scenario, an increase of 0.67% was obtained.
“In the third scenario, an increase of 41.50% was achieved compared with the static sharing and 36.65% compared with the dynamic sharing by default,” the researchers said. “Finally, in the fourth scenario, the dynamic sharing achieved 16.29% more savings compared with the static sharing and 13.26% compared with the default dynamic sharing.”
The researchers presented their findings in “Photovoltaic energy sharing: Implementation and tests on a real collective self-consumption system,” which was recently published in Heliyon. The academics come from Spain's University of the Basque Country, France's University of Bordeaux, and New Zealand's Auckland University of Technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/22/eu-parliaments-vote-on-net-zero-industry-act-prompts-mixed-reactions/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",EU Parliament’s vote on Net-Zero Industry Act prompts mixed reactions,"The European Parliament yesterday adopted new legislation aimed at bolstering the European Union's (EU) renewable energy technology manufacturing sector.
Although Europe’s major solar lobby groups, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) and SolarPower Europe, mostly welcome the Net-Zero Industry Act, they are divided over a clause related to non-EU-made technology used for tendered projects.
According to the Act, unspecified limitations should be set on procuring and tendering projects using net-zero technologies sourced from outside the EU. The aim of this is to not “exacerbate” dependencies on other countries for clean technologies, the legislation states.
But the policy director of Brussels-based solar association SolarPower Europe, Dries Acke, warns this requirement is a “red flag” for the solar sector and “for those committed to the EU’s energy security and climate goals.”
“It introduces pre-qualification criteria on local content, meaning that technologies that are partially produced outside Europe are not even allowed to bid into public auctions,” he said. “Two things can be true; We must work harder to support European solar manufacturing and Europe needs to be part of a globalised solar supply chain to meet climate and energy targets.”
Acke said including non-price criteria in auctions “positively rewards” sustainable and locally-produced technologies but it should be “phased in”.
Policy director of Braunschweig-based ESMC, Žygimantas Vaičiūnas, said the Act aligns “perfectly” with a previously published industry letter signed by over 40 European PV module manufacturers and associations.
The letter, published Nov. 16, encourages policymakers to include in the Act a clause stating that no more than half of a tendered project’s net-zero technology should originate from countries not part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA).
Roughly 15 countries are on the WTO GPA list, but China, the world's leading module manufacturer, is not. According to Vaičiūnas, the clause aims to reduce China-made modules from being imported into the EU.
Meanwhile, Members of the European Parliament also supported creating the Net-Zero Industry Valleys initiative as part of the Act, which is aimed at expediting permit approvals by delegating environmental assessments to Member States.
Other parts of the Act state certain administrative restrictions should be simplified to speed up net-zero manufacturing opportunities and project roll-out. According to the Act, plants producing less than 1 GW per annum should be granted permits within six months and projects producing more than 1 GW per annum should be granted permits within nine months.
Manufacturing projects producing a yearly output of more than 1 GW should be awarded permits within 12 months, and production facilities producing less than 1 GW per annum should be awarded a permit within nine months.

It said that its new “PVP-foil” product makes building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) more aesthetically appealing. It can also create additional revenue streams for PV owner, by using its PV panels for advertisements.
The manufacturer said that PVP-foil reduces the production of the panel by 10% to 30%.
“The product has recently launched in Europe,” Ronen Wetser, head of global partnerships at PV-Print, told pv magazine. “We will also launch it in the US in February 2024.”
Wetser described the product as a premium cast vinyl film featuring precise perforations, offering over 65% open area. To accommodate advertising companies with budget constraints for shorter campaigns, a more cost-effective and thinner product version will be available. Wetser said he anticipates a reduction in prices for the standard model within the next two years.
Two laminate options are available for printing. “Ultra Cast” lamination is designed to enhance energy efficiency, while “PVP no-reflect” features a non-reflective surface to minimize sun glare.
“A special high tack adhesive ensures ultimate contact with the panel surface. Notably, it can be easily replaced when needed, offering flexibility in design updates,” Wetser added. “This innovation is not limited to new installations; it can seamlessly enhance the aesthetics and functionality of existing solar panels.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/22/pv-driven-carnot-batteries-may-help-convert-coal-power-plants-into-renewable-energy-facilities/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,DENMARK",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",PV-driven Carnot batteries may help convert coal power plants into renewable energy facilities,"Researchers from the Technical University of Denmark have proposed to use Carnot batteries to convert coal power plants to renewable energy production.
Carnot batteries are systems that store electricity in the form of heat through storage media, such as water or molten salt, and transform the heat back to electricity when needed. This category includes liquid air energy storage (LAES) systems and Brayton or Rankine based pumped thermal energy storages (PTES) systems, as well as Lamm-Honigmann storage, which is a sorption-based technique that can be charged and discharged with both heat and electrical power, and systems based on integrated resistive heating with power cycles.
The scientists explained that decommissioned coal power plants are ideal sites to combine electric heaters and thermal storage as they enable the reuse of existing equipment, such as steam turbines, heat recovery boilers and heat exchangers. “Furthermore, conventional generators, rather than inverter-based resources, are able to retain a significant amount of inertia for grid frequency stabilization,” they said.
The group investigated, in particular, coal power plant retrofits using packed bed thermal energy storage and applied their approach to a Chilean 300 MW coal power facility with a production of live steam at 565 C and 160 bar.
For their modeling, the scientists considered a packed bed facility with a storage capacity of 1.37 GWh and a storage temperature of 730 C. The system utilizes atmospheric air as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and solid material as the storage medium. The heaters, valves, and inlet and outlet pipes are placed on top of the system to avoid additional excavation and allow the rock bed to be installed partially below ground level, making maintenance easier.

“The estimated thermal losses for this configuration are 1.94% per day, while the maximum pressure loss over the packed bed, in this work observable during discharge, is calculated to be 49 mbar,” the team said. “The charging time was selected to use the maximum hours of sunlight to represent the use of renewable power from photovoltaic (PV) plants, and in this way, the discharge will take place during the night or when the sunlight is not available.”
In the proposed system configuration, the PV plants power the storage system's electric heater connected to the storage tank, which in turn provides heat to the steam generator connected to the coal power plant's steam turbine and condenser.

Through their analysis, the scientists found that the retrofitted plant may achieve an annual net power production of around 443 GWh for 4 h storage capacity, 797 GWh for 8 h storage capacity, and 1,150 GWh for 12 h storage. “These values are around 3.4% lower when the air temperature at the steam generator inlet is set to 590 C,” they explained.
They also found that the system's highest annual round-trip efficiency was achieved for a storage capacity of 8 h, and that the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is reached for the largest storage capacity at €88.09 ($95.97)/MWh. “This value appears competitive with both state-of-the-art conventional power plants and alternatives such as the ones powered with thermal storages based on molten salt,” they added.
Their findings were introduced in the paper “Retrofit of a coal-fired power plant with a rock bed thermal energy storage,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage.
The team noted that a follow-up study implementing the tools developed in the work in a techno-economic optimization could pave the way towards implementation, identifying the ideal operation and sizing for lowest cost and maximum revenue.
Another research team at the Technical University of Denmark this year investigated what levelized cost of storage (LCOS) Carnot batteries require in order to become competitive in a 100% renewables scenario for their home country. They found that an LCOS of less than €66.2/MWh would be competitive, provided that gas prices stay at low levels.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/22/inverted-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-25-1-efficiency-via-new-passivation-technique/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",Inverted perovskite solar cell achieves 25.1% efficiency via new passivation technique,"A group of researchers led by Northwestern University in the United States announced it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.1% for a perovskite solar cell with an inverted configuration.
The US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has certified the result.
Inverted perovskite cells have a device structure known as “p-i-n”, in which hole-selective contact p is at the bottom of intrinsic perovskite layer i with electron transport layer n at the top. Conventional halide perovskite cells have the same structure but reversed – a “n-i-p” layout. In n-i-p architecture, the solar cell is illuminated through the electron-transport layer (ETL) side; in the p-i-n structure, it is illuminated through the hole‐transport layer (HTL) surface.
“Inverted perovskite solar cells are known for their impressive stability but have been held back by lower efficiency in turning sunlight into electricity,” the research's lead author, Cheng Liu, told pv magazine. “This issue mainly arises at the point where the perovskite layer meets the electron transport layer, causing energy loss instead of being converted into useful power. The energy loss is primarily caused by carrier recombination, especially at the interface between perovskite and the electron transport layer.”
The research group utilized a pair of special molecules to interface to address the complex carrier recombination issue. “Firstly, we used sulfur-modified methylthio molecules to passivate surface defects and suppress recombination through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding,” Liu explained. “Secondly, we used diammonium molecules to repel minority carriers and reduce contact-induced interface recombination achieved through field-effect passivation.”
The scientists built the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and phosphonic acid called methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz), a perovskite absorber, the passivation layer, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
According to the researchers, their passivation approach led to a five-fold increase in carrier lifetime and a three-fold reduction in photoluminescence quantum yield losses. As a result, the inverted perovskite solar cells maintained stable operation at 65 C for over 2,000 h.
“This marks the first time inverted perovskite solar cells have crossed the 25% efficiency barrier following rigorous asymptotic maximum power scan protocol,” Liu said, noting that the previous record was 24.1%.
With the cell, the research team also fabricated all-perovskite tandem solar cells with an efficiency of up to 28.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.14 V, a short-circuit current density of 15.6 mA cm2 and a fill factor of 84.0%.
“We consider the multimolecule passivation approach, along with diverse functionalities, as a promising direction for exploring next-generation passivation strategies to achieve improved performance and stability in perovskite optoelectronics,” Liu explained.
The research team presented the new solar cell technology in the paper “Bimolecularly passivated interface enables efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science.

A steady decline in solar module prices since October 2022 will boost the internal rate of return (IRR) for 45 GW of utility-scale solar projects that have been awarded since fiscal 2021. This, in turn, will drive solar capacity implementation to its fastest annual pace of 16 GW this fiscal year, according to CRISIL Ratings.
Solar installation faced delays in fiscals 2022 and 2023 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and efforts to protect the Great Indian Bustard bird, resulting in project extensions. However, with falling module prices, the end of pandemic disruptions, and clarity on bird protection measures, Crisil analysts anticipate accelerated solar project execution by fiscal 2026. The reversal of falling module prices in the last quarter of fiscal 2021 impacted project returns, affecting 20 GW of projects auctioned in fiscals 2021 and 2022 within the 45 GW solar project pipeline.
“If implemented as per schedule, the average IRR of 20 GW projects auctioned during fiscals 2021 and 2022 could have fallen to as low as 5%, with some even becoming unviable on a standalone basis,” said Ankit Hakhu, director of CRISIL Ratings. “However, the pandemic-linked extension in the scheduled commissioning dates provided relief to these projects, giving developers a chance to defer module purchases.”
With a 30% reduction in module prices as of September 2023 compared to the previous fiscal's average, analysts anticipate a potential 300-500 basis points improvement in project IRR to an average of 9%. The assumption includes project financing at a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio, P50 plant load factors of 26% to 27% AC, an interest rate of 9.5% on under-construction and 8.5% on operational phase debt, along with interest income of 4% on reserves and cash balances.
“Softer module prices will also benefit 25 GW of capacities bid during and since fiscal 2023,” said Varun Marwaha, associate director of CRISIL Ratings. “These 25 GW of projects had higher bid tariffs … as they factored in higher module costs, and should see their IRR improve.”

It claims to deliver improved analytics and asset insights to enable productivity and profitability improvements based on the developers’ idea that merely relying on performance data from equipment inside the plant, such as inverters, is not enough to uncover technical issues, environmental influences, or underperforming PV plant equipment.
The solution has both a forecasting and diagnostic functionality. “If the model predicts a higher amount of energy than the system produced, then the team can dig deeper into the data indexed and stored in the platform to find out why shortfalls occur,” Robertas Janickas, Chief Technology Officer at Inion Software told pv magazine, adding that shortfalls can be caused by faults in the solar power plant, soiling, or environmental factors, for example.
The software relies on statistical models, deep learning, and machine learning technology to process data generated by PV plant hardware, such as inverters, power plant controllers (PPC), and data loggers. Additionally, weather data parameters, such as temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and sun position from multiple meteorological data can be used to determine the most accurate forecasts.
Furthermore, the productivity of nearby solar power plants can be accessed to make comparisons with similar sites. “We have a client that discovered exactly how much revenue they were missing out on when two out of three of their identical power plants were underperforming in the early morning hours compared to the third one, even though they were located near each other,” explained Janickas.
The platform is available on a subscription basis from Inion Software or via its distribution partners.
Customers include Romania-based solar plant developer Volter, Spanish photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panel maker Abora Solar, Lithuanian module manufacturer Solitek, and Ecooo Revolución Solar, a Spanish community solar plant developer.
The company was founded in 2019 to focus on products for solar power plant operators, such as data loggers, the Inion analytics platform, and a battery management system, which extends the capabilities of standard battery storage solutions. “The key feature of all our products is they are made to outperform the existing tools. For example, most data loggers take reading every 5 minutes. Ours track the status every 60 seconds,” said Janickas.

The winners of Australia’s biggest storage tender to date have been announced by the state and commonwealth governments, who opted to join the Long-Term Energy Service Agreements (LTESA) and Capacity Investment Scheme auctions into one super tender.
It resulted in six projects being selected to deliver a total of 1,075 MW of firmed capacity and 2,790 MWh of storage. The six winning projects include:
The projects are targeting commercial operations by December 2025 – the year the state’s biggest coal plant, the 2.88 GW Eraring facility, is scheduled to close. Its closure is set to open up a major energy supply and reliability gap in the state. New South Wales Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said specifically that the six projects will help to ensure “we do not need [Eraring] to be open one day longer than they need.”
The successful projects are required to deliver at least half their capacity in the event of a supply shortfall declared by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). The projects from this tender alone are equal to 8% of the total 2022-23 New South Wales summer peak demand. They are underpinned by a 10-year agreement with government.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Minister Sharpe said part of the reason why the governments expect these projects to be able to be commercially operating within two years is because “they don’t rely on those very big transmission projects that we’re working with.”
In recent years, shuttered power plants like Liddell have become extremely popular sites for battery proposals due to their infrastructure and grid connections.
The November edition of pv magazine is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
The tender was run by AEMO Services, acting as the New South Wales Consumer Trustee. The auction originally sought 380 MW of firming infrastructure and demand response from the market but was expanded to 930 MW after the federal government came onboard to support an additional 550 MW through its own storage tender scheme, known as the Capacity Investment Scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/22/northvolt-unveils-160-wh-kg-sodium-ion-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,SWEDEN",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",Northvolt unveils 160 Wh/kg sodium-ion battery,"Northvolt, Europe’s battery manufacturing torchbearer, has announced the development of its first-generation sodium-ion battery cells. They are designed to provide the foundation for the company’s next-generation energy storage solutions, with subsequent generations to deliver higher energy density, opening opportunities to enable cost-efficient electric mobility solutions.
Its sodium-ion technology has been validated at more than 160 Wh/kg at its R&D and industrialization campus, Northvolt Labs, in Västerås, Sweden. This level of performance makes the technology competitive with today’s dominant energy storage chemistry – lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries.
“Thanks to the global abundance of ingoing materials as well as the robustness and sustainability of the sodium-ion technology, Northvolt sees sodium-ion technology as a key part of the company’s product portfolio in the long term,” Wilhelm Löwenhielm, Northvolt senior director of business development ESS, told pv magazine. “With its first-generation sodium-ion product, Northvolt will bring to market a solution at scale that is competitive with LFP solutions. Over time, the technology is expected to surpass LFP significantly in terms of cost-competitiveness.”
According to Löwenhielm, Northvolt aims to address the energy storage market with a complete plug & play battery solution to allow for fast market entry and scale-up.
“Key activities for bringing this particular technology to market is scaling the supply chain for battery grade materials, which Northvolt is currently doing together with key partners,” he said.
So far, the company has revealed few details about the technology's performance.
“We’ve also demonstrated the cell’s robustness and cycle life – something that’s key for energy storage systems,” the company said on its website, without providing any hard figures.
However, Northvolt has said that its sodium-ion cell is based on a hard carbon anode and a Prussian White-based cathode, which makes it similar to the first generation of sodium-ion cells unveiled by Chinese battery industry heavyweight CATL in 2021.
At the time of the launch, CATL said it had been dedicated to the research and development of sodium-ion battery electrode materials for many years. It also revealed plans to establish a basic industrial chain by 2023.
It said its first generation of sodium-ion battery cells could achieve energy densities of up to 160Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. Earlier this year, it confirmed that China's Chery will become the the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
“At the surface level, it should be the same technology as announced by CATL in 2021, but the Chinese manufacturer is also pursuing layered oxide cathodes as well – both with similar performances (160 Wh/kg),” Max Reid, principal electric vehicle and battery analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told pv magazine. “In the early days of sodium-ion, it makes sense for a company like CATL to keep developing several technologies and attempt to overcome the challenges of each to hedge its bets.”
Northvolt, on the other hand, has adhered to nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery chemistry, which is favored by electric-vehicle customers. The company's ESS platform is based on the same chemistry, which is seen as less sustainable than LFP due to cobalt and nickel content.
The Swedish startup, which has secured the backing of big investors such as Volkswagen, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs since its establishment in 2016, has however always claimed that it is building the world’s greenest lithium-ion batteries with a minimal CO2 footprint.
The company has managed to reduce its lithium-ion cell carbon footprint to 33 kg CO2/kWh — a two-thirds reduction compared to an industry reference. Its goal, however, is to establish 150 GWh of annual cell production by 2030 at 10 kg CO2/kWh with 50% of material for its lithium-ion cells coming from recycling.
In December 2021, Northvolt bacame the first manufacturer to produce battery cells fully designed, developed and assembled by a homegrown European battery company. Those first cells rolled off its manufacturing lines at Northvolt Ett – its first gigafactory, in northern Sweden, which has an installed capacity of 16 GWh. In the meantime, the company has revealed plans for three more plants in Germany, Canada and Sweden.
Northvolt has also been engaged in development of energy-dense lithium-metal battery technology for aviation and high-performance vehicles at its subsidiary Cuberg based in San Leandro, California. The Stanford University spinoff has developed a 20 Ah commercial-format lithium metal pouch cell with an energy density of 405 Wh/kg and integrated those cells into an aviation-specific battery module offering gravimetric and volumetric energy density of 280 Wh/kg and 320 Wh/L respectively.
Around a year ago, Northvolt announced an investment in Altris, a Swedish tech company that has developed a proprietary technology to produce Fennac (Prussian White), a key component in sodium-ion batteries that consists of sodium, iron carbon and nitrogen.
In October, Altris announced a milestone in its technology development, presenting a 160 Wh/kg sodium-ion battery cell.
“Now, we have our eyes set on achieving 200 Wh/kg and beyond, while keeping our chemistry pure and sustainable”, said Björn Mårlid, CEO of Altris.
Northvolt, which developed its sodium-ion cells in partnership with Altris, said that its focus is on the industrialization of this technology and developing solutions for its integration into energy storage solutions for global deployment.
“The low cost and safety at high temperatures make the technology especially attractive for energy storage solutions in upcoming markets including India, the Middle East and Africa,” the company said in a press release.
The industry placed high hopes on sodium-ion battery technology amid last year's price increases and predicted lithium-ion battery material shortfalls. Although the initial hype has waned, with lithium-ion battery prices returning to a downward trajectory, sodium-ion technology is still considered a viable alternative.
The two battery technologies have much in common in terms of structure and working principles and can often even use the same manufacturing lines and equipment. However, sodium-ion offers superior environmental credentials, enhanced safety, and better raw material costs than lithium-ion. Generally, Na-ion cells are quoted to be even up to 40% cheaper, but the challenge is bringing the technology to scale.
