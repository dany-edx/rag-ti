If India maintains its current momentum and implements announced projects, it will achieve an annual green hydrogen demand of 2.85 MMT by 2030, according to SAREP. The transition will require a total investment of $57.6 billion.
The report states that the fertilizer and export sectors will account for nearly 37% (1.02 MMT) and 29% (0.81 MMT) of the total 2.85 MMT green hydrogen demand.
In the base case scenario, the report authors assumed that 10% of India's refineries would switch to green hydrogen, 10% of existing city gas distribution pipelines would be blended with green hydrogen, 50% of ammonia-based fertilizer imports would be replaced with domestic green ammonia, and the country would meet 6% of its demand from target importing countries by 2030.

To meet these green hydrogen demand estimates, the report says India will need 62 GW of additional renewable energy capacity, 29 GW of electrolyzer capacity, and 11 MMT per annum of ammonia infrastructure. This represents an estimated investment need of $36 billion, $15 billion, and $6 billion, respectively, by 2030.
Multiple oil public sector undertakings (PSUs) have announced internal targets for the adoption of green hydrogen. The report authors considered internal targets from leading oil PSUs in arriving at the estimates from oil refining and natural gas blending industries.

French renewables developer Akuo said earlier this year that it had started looking for a strategic partner, when it hired three banks – Nomura, Rothschild & Co, and Natixis Partners – to assess potential takeover offers. Several investment funds, including the investment arm of French energy giant TotalEnergies, have reportedly expressed interest, according to a recent report in L'Informé.
Earlier this year, the founders of Akuo announced their search for financing to develop a 20 GW renewable energy project portfolio. To assist in this process, the company has engaged three banks – Nomura, Rothschild & Co., and Natixis Partners – to evaluate potential takeover offers and their strategic value.
Total Energies, with its €280 billion ($307.0 billion) in turnover in 2022 and record profits of nearly €19.5 billion over the same year, is therefore well-positioned to easily complete this acquisition, estimated at around €2 billion by Akuo. A deal would significantly expand Total Energies' renewable portfolio, which stood at 1.6 GW of operational capacity in January 2023, primarily through external growth.

The four projects will have a combined capacity of 100 MW and will be constructed by independent power producers, the tender document says, without providing further technical or financial details. Interested consultants have until May 19 to submit their offers.
In April, Landscope Mauritius, a government-owned property developer, issued a tender for 10 MW of solar capacity in La Valette, Bambous, a town on the northwestern coast of Mauritius.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Mauritius had 110 MW of installed capacity by the end of 2022. The nation did not install any new capacity last year, according to IRENA.
In March 2022, the Central Electricity Board (CEB) of Mauritius issued two different tenders for the deployment of 140 MW of solar-plus-storage capacity. The government of Mauritius has also been supporting distributed solar through net metering and rebate schemes.

In 2021, the Indonesian government announced a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2060 at the latest. The pivotal role to be played by solar has been confirmed by the country’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), the IESR, the International Energy Agency (IEA), and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). As the IESR reported in its “Indonesia Solar Energy Outlook 2023” report, PV deployment has fallen far short of decarbonization requirements.
The world’s fourth-most populous nation – with 275 million people – is Southeast Asia’s biggest economy and expected to be the world’s seventh largest by 2030. Being the world’s 15th largest nation by surface area contributes to a technical solar generation capacity potential of 3 terawatts-peak (TWp) to 20 terawatts-peak, depending on land use. Around 1.5 TWp of that potential, occupying 2.5% of Indonesia’s land, could support a zero-emission energy system by 2050, according to IESR’s study, titled “Deep decarbonization of Indonesia’s energy system.”

Cost-competitiveness, modularity, and availability ensures solar would be the leading electricity source in most Indonesian net-zero economy models. Solar and, to a lesser extent, wind will supply 55% of Indonesia’s electricity in mid-century, according to an IEA model consistent with keeping the global temperature rise this century capped at 1.5 C. IRENA estimates 800 GW to 840 GW of solar could supply 54% to 62% of Indonesia’s electricity by 2050. Both scenarios would require greater power system flexibility, expansion of electricity transmission infrastructure, inter-island interconnections, and energy storage.
Energy ministry data, however, shows Indonesia had deployed only 270 MWp of solar by the end of December, around 0.01% of the lowest technical potential estimate. Policy and regulatory uncertainty combine with a lack of planning and implementation in an electricity market dominated by state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), which generates, transmits, and distributes power.
For example, although PLN’s 10-year power development plan – to 2030 – envisages 4.7 GW of solar, including 3.9 GW operational by 2025, there were only eight projects, with a total generation capacity of 600 MW, in the pipeline last year, all of them tendered before the power plan was drafted.
PLN has also tendered the first phase of a plan announced last year to replace 500 MW of small diesel plants in remote locations but unfavorable results mean the procurement round will be held again, delaying the project. The utility has been criticized for a lack of transparent auction scheduling, leading to market uncertainty.
There have been successes, though. Solar power purchase agreement (PPA) prices fell 76% from 2015 to 2020, from $0.25/kWh to $0.058/kWh. The decline is 84% (to less than $0.04/kWh) when including two record-low bids attracted by PLN subsidiary Indonesia Power’s equity partner selection exercise for floating solar projects in Singkarak and Saguling which have a total generation capacity of 110 MW. PLN companies this year issued invites to tender for a 100 MW floating solar project at Karangkates dam plus the second phase of its equity partner selection for utility scale solar and wind facilities.
Rooftop solar has enjoyed modest growth since net metering regulations were established in 2018 but PLN-imposed restrictions have slowed installations. Energy minister Arifin Tasrif in 2021 drafted a regulation that specified each kilowatt-hour exported to the grid by net-metered solar owners would earn a full kilowatt-hour off electricity bills, up from a 65% credit being paid by PLN.
The energy minister also streamlined the net metering application process but PLN, citing grid capacity concerns, chose not to implement the new system and subsequently limited net-metered solar system capacity to 10% to 15% of the prosumer’s electricity connection.
With fewer net-metered customers arriving in 2022 than in previous years, Jakarta is attempting to find a middle ground to assuage PLN’s capacity fears and suggestions include abolishing net metering and applying a quota to applications. While industrial solar could benefit from any removal of capacity limits, home solar and small business use is expected to suffer from an extended payback period for net-metered systems.
The current issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
The Indonesian government and PLN still have a lot of work to do to make solar-powered decarbonization successful. Momentum was generated by last year’s presidency of the G20 group of economies as well as Indonesia’s signing of a Just Energy Transition Partnership with a slew of multilateral lenders, to fund a shift from coal to clean energy.
The early retirement of coal and widespread adoption of solar are critical to the nation’s aim of limiting peak power sector emissions to 290 megatons of CO2 by 2030 and having renewables supply 34% of electricity this decade.
Through its energy chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year, Indonesia can strengthen the role of solar power in the context of regional energy security through collaboration in the power system and beyond, including promoting the PV supply chain in the region. While the path is winding, the route to clean, affordable, and equitable energy – with solar as its backbone – is clear.

The authorities now say that these cavities and canals are not archeologically significant, as they cannot even be considered to be sedimentological deposits.
Work on the facility came to a halt in mid-January after the discovery was announced by the archeological firm Tibicena Arqueología y Patrimonio SL.
Spain's General Directorate for Energy of the Department of Ecological Transition, the Fight against Climate Change, and the government of the Canary Islands issued the initial administrative authorization for the project. The project developer is Spanish grid operator Red Eléctrica de España, which is investing around €400 million ($439.3 million) in the facility.
The station will use water from the upper reservoir of Chira and the lower reservoir of Soria. It will have a storage capacity of 3.5 GWh. The regional government of Gran Canaria began developing the project in 2015.
In 2021, the Spanish Institute for Diversification and Saving of Energy allocated 255 MW of PV capacity for the Canary Islands through the Solcan rebate scheme, which refunds a percentage of installation costs using public funds. At the time, the archipelago had an installed PV capacity of approximately 170 MW.

“We have identified four failure modes in the silicon heterojunction glass-backsheet module which has the potential to result in a power loss of up to 50% following damp heat testing,” researcher Chandany Sen told pv magazine. “We sought to understand the possible underlying causes of each failure mode and how to quickly detect them at the cell level.”
The scientists conducted their experiment on bifacial half-cut n-type silicon HJT solar cells sourced from industrial production lines of unidentified manufacturers. The products were divided into three groups: modules with encapsulated cells; modules with encapsulated cell precursors; and non-encapsulated cells. For the first two groups, the researchers used ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant.
“All samples featured an n-type wafer, intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) passivation layers on both sides, and phosphorus-doped (n-a-Si:H) and boron-doped (p-a-Si:H) hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers on the front and rear sides, respectively, followed by indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) layer deposited on both sides,” they said.
All devices underwent a damp heat test at 85°C and 85% relative humidity (RH) for durations between 500 hours and 4000 hours.
Through this testing, the academics identified four failure modes for the encapsulated cells, resulting in power losses ranging from 5% to 50%. The first failure type consisted of cell darkening in localized points, and the second was represented by darkening around the interconnection of busbars and ribbon wires. The third failure mode involved intense darkening between the interconnected regions of busbars and ribbon wires, while the fourth showed darkening on the interconnected region of busbars and ribbon wires.
According to the group's analysis, the first failure type was attributable to surface contamination, which may have occurred during handling or characterization before module encapsulation. As for the second and third groups, the scientists attributed the failures to the involvement of soldering flux.
“The direct impact of flux and lead (Pb) solder in causing contact degradation after DH testing was also observed in other work,” they said. “It is essential to highlight that, in some cases, the usage of a different Ag paste also resulted in a Type-3 failure.”
For the fourth group, the researchers indicated that the failures likely originated from the byproduct of EVA used for encapsulation.
“Although the experimental design in this work cannot determine exactly how each failure mode occurred after DH testing, it demonstrates plausible situations that could happen in the industry environment and lead to the actual failure modes observed,” they concluded.
Sen said that comprehending and mitigating these failure modes, preferably at the solar cell level, will be crucial to realizing the low-levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) potential of HJT. She said that while glass-glass modules are frequently employed for HJT solar cells due to their reduced susceptibility to moisture ingress, similar failure modes are likely to occur in these modules over more extended periods.
The research team presented its findings in the study “Four failure modes in silicon heterojunction glass-backsheet modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

Epitaxially grown p-type wafers, also called “EpiWafers,” offer low-cost and low-carbon material for solar cells, providing higher voltages and fill factors compared to cells with a front-side collecting emitter.
Epitaxially grown p-type wafers, also called “EpiWafers,” offer low-cost and low-carbon material for solar cells, providing higher voltages and fill factors compared to cells with a front-side collecting emitter.
The scientists grew p-type Cz-Si wafers with a resistivity of 2.5 Ω cm and a diameter of 150 mm through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) batch reactor at atmospheric pressure. They then chemically cleaned and passivated the wafers with a surface passivation layer made of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) deposited via plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 180 C for 78 cycles, which resulted in 10 nm thick layers on both sides.
“The resulting sample set consists of EpiRef wafers with a final thickness of 110 μm and three different base resistivities of 3, 14, and 100 Ω cm,” they said.
Applying a front finger grid design to all EpiRef wafers, the team observed that each of the three devices could potentially achieve a power conversion efficiency exceeding 25%. They also noted that the presence of iron (Fe), chromium monoboride (CrB), and Boron (BO) defects in the EpiWafers did not adversely affect cell performance, demonstrating the high quality and purity of the epitaxially grown wafers.
“In our case, these structural defects, originating from epitaxial growth, can be avoided by using another susceptor design,” the academics said. “Structural defect-free areas preserve their excellent material quality during high-temperature processing.”
They presented the novel manufacturing technique in “Epitaxially Grown p-type Silicon Wafers Ready for Cell Efficiencies Exceeding 25%,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.
In April 2021, Fraunhofer ISE said it had achieved an efficiency of 26.1% for a TOPCore solar cell.
“Based on a systematic simulation-based analysis, we were able to derive some fundamental design rules for future high-efficiency silicon solar cells above 26% efficiency,” Stefan Glunz, division director of photovoltaics research at Fraunhofer ISE, said at the time. “Both-sides-contacted solar cells have the potential to reach efficiencies up to 27 percent and thus surpass the previous world record for silicon solar cells.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/09/texas-senate-approves-tight-permit-restrictions-on-solar-wind/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 9, 2023","Texas Senate approves tight permit restrictions on solar, wind","From pv magazine USA
The senate of the state of Texas has voted in favor of SB 624, which could impose significant permitting restrictions and fines on solar and wind energy projects. A companion bill is now heading to the state house for approval.
Texas is the nation’s leader in wind energy development and is soon to take over as the No. 1 US state for solar, leapfrogging California. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) expects the state to add 36 GW of solar over the next five years, building on the 16 GW that is active to date, and making it the nation’s sterling example of harnessing the sun’s energy.
This boom in growth occurs just as the $369 billion spending package within the US Inflation Reduction Act is implemented and rolled out, a law that is further catalyzing the energy transition toward carbon-free power generation.
The Advanced Power Alliance projects that in 2024, renewable generation under the Electric Reliability Council of Texas will deliver $6 billion in net system operating cost savings and more than 18,000 MW of reliable capacity contributions. However, state legislators have taken aim at the industry, despite the economic boom that has come with it. Texas lawmakers showed their support for SB 624 in late April.
The law singles out solar and wind facilities, requiring them to obtain a permit from the Public Utility Commission (PUC) of Texas, while leaving out fossil fuels from the requirement. Governor Greg Abbott, who has long shown an affinity for fossil fuels, has appointed all the PUC members, who now would act as gatekeepers for any renewable energy project.
In addition, SB 624 assigns a new yearly fee to be paid by renewable energy developers. It would also require developers to pull a permit any time significant changes need to be made to existing projects. Under the law, each new project would be required to undergo a new environmental impact study.
The law places existing renewable energy projects at risk by retroactively applying permit requirements to these sites. It vests the commission with the power to enter project sites and remove installed clean energy capacity if it does not meet the newly-established tightened permits.
“The onerous proposal would violate private property rights of Texans and reduce the value of properties who are denied their ability to develop the energy resources on their land,” said the Advanced Power Alliance in a statement. “The bill will drive up the cost of energy for every Texan and would place every power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with corporate customers at risk.”
