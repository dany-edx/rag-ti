The 38-page document, produced in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, was more notable for the fact giving “a new lease of life” to Britain's North Sea oil and gas fields was given higher prominence than the section devoted to renewables, which characteristically had more emphasis on wind power than solar.
“We are going to make better use of the oil and gas in our own back yard by giving the energy fields of the North Sea a new lease of life,” Johnson wrote in his introduction to the report, adding: “Net zero is a smooth transition, not an immediate execution, for oil and gas.” The UK, wrote Johnson, would also be “investing massively in nuclear power” to secure its energy security.
The methods by which the nation intends to generate up to 10 GW of hydrogen this decade, “subject to affordability and value for money,” perhaps reflected the government's priorities, with the document stating: “Investing in the North Sea, expanding our renewable[s] capacity, and leading in nuclear power will also enable the UK to produce more hydrogen.”
On solar, the strategy envisages up to 70 GW of generation capacity by 2035, up from 14 GW today, without specifying how that fivefold expansion will be achieved.
North Sea proposals include speeding new permits and reconsidering the ban on shale gas fracking, referred to in the document as a “pause” with a new report into the controversial process.
Elsewhere in the publication, the government highlighted its decision to reduce fuel duty for the first time in more than a decade and said it could support business by increasing the renewables obligation exemption to 100%. The renewables obligation exemption currently spares energy-intensive industries up to 85% of the cost passed on by generators in power prices to fund the clean energy generation they are legally required to source.
The government wants 50 GW of offshore wind generation capacity this decade, including 5 GW of floating turbines, and said it would work chiefly with the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales to expand onshore projects.
Of that 10 GW hydrogen ambition, at least half should be green, the document stated, with a decision promised next year on whether to blend up to 20% of the sustainable form of the energy carrier into the natural gas network, and helped along by annual production capacity allocations aiming to reach price competitiveness by 2025, subject to market conditions. By that point, Westminster hopes to have a gigawatt of electrolyzed hydrogen capacity at least under construction.
The modernization of electricity grids also rated a mention, with undated pledges to introduce time-of-use tariffs and grid-scale electric vehicle battery storage, and to have new homes built to be smart-meter ready.

Singaporean clean energy company Sunseap on Tuesday announced it had signed a deal with Riau governor Ansar Ahmad to develop an unspecified volume of “large-scale solar and storage” across the Riau Islands and is already considering 1.38 GWp of solar and 3 GWh of storage on the island of Combol, and 1.62 GWh of solar plus 3.5 GWh of storage on Citlim.
Sunseap's largest shareholder is European utility Energías de Portugal, whose own largest investor is state-owned power company China Three Gorges.
The recent project announced by Singaporean developer Quantum and its German peer aims to export all the projected 4 TWh of solar electricity to be generated to the city state, to help meet 8% of its electricity demand.
By contrast, Sunseap says its facilities will provide clean power to Indonesia as well as Singapore, without specifying volumes.
Sunseap has already signed a deal with government entity Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority to invest $2 billion in a floating solar and storage project on the Duriangkang reservoir on the Riau island of Batam.
In January last year, state-owned Emirati developer Masdar signed an agreement with Singaporean peer Tuas Power, French energy company EDF, and Indonesian state-owned utility PT Indonesia Power to explore the development of 1.2 GW of solar generation capacity, with the potential for energy storage, on Indonesian territory, also for export to Singapore.

A group of scientists from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) in Spain has shown for the first time how changes in atmospheric circulation patterns on a planetary scale, which are known as teleconnections, affect renewable energy generation in different European countries.
In the paper “Seasonal prediction of renewable energy generation in Europe based on four teleconnection indices,” published in Renewable Energy, the Spanish team proposed a novel method to forecast long-term variations in the generation of renewable energy sources months in advance through climate predictions. These forecasts can be very useful for electricity network operators in order to program alternative energy sources, for power providers to estimate electricity prices, and for governments to prevent crises in energy prices.
Teleconnections are numerical indices that summarize air movements around the Earth's surface and connect weather conditions in regions far apart from each other. In Europe, electricity supply and demand are affected by changes in four teleconnections in the Euro-Atlantic region, which can cause variations in the earth's surface temperature, precipitation, solar radiation and wind speed: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic Oscillation (EA), East Atlantic/Western Russia Oscillation (EAWR), and the Scandinavian Pattern (SCA).
The study developed by the BSC scientists proposes a methodology that transforms the seasonal predictions of these four Euro-Atlantic teleconnections into wind and solar energy forecasts. The results show the dependence of wind and solar generation on the state of those teleconnections and how seasonal forecasts can help anticipate electricity demand and expected renewable energy generation across Europe.
‘Teleconnections like the NAO have already proven useful to the European electricity sector in explaining recent episodes of low wind power generation or high energy demand. With this study we show how the seasonal predictions of teleconnections can inform months in advance of a possible risk of low renewable energy production, while at the same time serving to better inform those responsible for making decisions in this regard,” explained BSC researcher Llorenç Lledó.
“Beyond the mitigation of climate change, the energy crisis that Europe is experiencing sends a clear message: our electricity system needs to move towards higher quotas of renewables to achieve energy independence. And this can only be achieved with a better understanding and predictive capacity of the meteorological and climatic oscillations that affect renewable energy sources,” stated research co-author Francisco Doblas.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/25/india-added-a-record-13-5-gw-of-solar-and-wind-capacity-in-2021-22/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 25, 2022",India added a record 13.5 GW of solar and wind capacity in 2021-22,"From pv magazine India
India added a cumulative 13,549 MW of renewable energy generation capacity in FY 2021-22, up 128% over the previous fiscal. This included 12,438 MW of solar (10,217 MW of utility-scale and 2,221 of MW rooftop) and 1,111 MW of wind, according to a new report by Bridge To India.
Rajasthan (5,806 MW) and Gujarat (2,469 MW) together accounted for 61% of the total RE capacity addition.
The nation now has 96.2 GW of cumulative installed renewable capacity, excluding small hydro and biomass.
The record installation in 2021-22 was mainly due to the completion of projects delayed from the previous year, even as the sector faced challenges like rising input costs, delay in imported module shipments, and an environmental directive from the supreme court on transmission lines in most of Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Vinay Rustagi, managing director of Bridge To India, said, “The renewable sector has shown remarkable resilience in the face of multiple challenges. But it is important to acknowledge that the record high numbers in FY 2022 came mainly because of the Covid spillover effect from the previous year. Investor sentiment is in balance affected, on the one hand, by strong macro-fundamentals of the energy transition, and on the other hand, by acute policy and execution barriers. The government’s revised target of 500 GW renewable capacity by 2030, equivalent to over 40 GW of capacity addition per annum, warrants a holistic reassessment of the sector.”
Rooftop solar capacity addition was at an all-time high at 2.2 GW (up 68% over last year). The increase was predominantly driven by the residential solar segment, which saw 746 MW of new installations.
The total project capacity (allocated by the government and public agencies) in the pipeline stood at 67 GW (54 GW of solar and 13 GW wind), with SECI having the highest offtake share of 60% (40 GW), followed by Discoms (22%, 15 GW).
Module prices surged by 34% in the first half (the April-September period) due to supply-side constraints in China but eased slightly in the second half. Year-end imported and domestic module prices at $0.26/watt and $0.32/watt, respectively, were still about 25% up over the previous year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/25/european-ppa-market-sees-contraction-in-march/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"APRIL 25, 2022",European PPA market sees contraction in March,"Zurich-based renewable energy consultancy Pexapark has reported a sharp decline in European PPA activity for March.
The war in Ukraine is having repercussions on PPA prices and Europe could see very complicated electricity price curves in the remainder of the year, the analyst explained.
During the month of March, the average price of signed PPAs was €77.37/MWh, 3% higher than the February average of €74.9/MWh. “Our view is that downside risks generally outweigh potential gains in PPA pricing due to price spikes in the first and second years,” the company added.
Pexapark also revealed that nine power purchase agreements with an aggregate capacity of 400 MW were signed in Europe in March — a sharp decrease compared to February, when contracted capacity for unsubsidized renewables reached 1.3 GW across 18 deals.
March's new contracts were secured mostly by energy-intensive industries such as chemical and metal producers and mining companies. Norway's power company Statkraft, for example, signed a PPA with German chemical group Wacker in its home country and another one with Spanish steelmaker Tubos Reunidos in Spain
Germany's corporate segment was the most active in the first quarter of the turbulent year thanks to deals secured by food giants such as Nestlé and Das Futterhaus. According to Pexapark, Germany has the foundations to become a great PPA market, and it seems that the global turmoil has set this trajectory in motion. Spain ranks second in the number of deals, withe four corporate PPAs totaling 936.8 MW being signed in the country in the first quarter of the year.
Pexapark furthermore revealed that Europe had also seen the first two storage-related PPAs signed in Europe during the first three months of the year. The consultant cites a 10-year deal secured by French energy company EDF for a 5.1 MW/1.7 MWh solar-plus-storage project selected by German authorities in a tender for innovative projects, which subsidizes part of the plant.

The devices were built with a novel lift-off-based patterning approach based on swelling-induced crack propagation.
“The swelling-induced lift-off method allows the fabrication of a flat, uniform, crystalline, and patterned perovskite film without defects such as fracture or partial delamination,” the scientists explained. “In addition, the simultaneous lift-off patterning of the perovskite layer and electron transport layer (ETL) minimizes interfacial defects.”
In the process, the perovskite film was deposited by spin-coating on layers made of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyimide (PI) that were prepatterned via oxygen plasma etching. A top silicon oxide (SiO2) layer is utilized as an etch stop layer for the dry etching of PMMA/PI layers and is finally wet-etched using a buffered oxide etchant (BOE).
After cracks propagate along the edge, the PI/perovskite layers are detached from the substrate without any fractures or partial delamination of the patterned films on the substrate.
“During the prepatterning of the PMMA/PI layers, the substrate becomes hydrophilic owing to oxygen plasma. Thus, the perovskite precursor can be spread over the entire substrate,” the scientists said, noting that this step allows the deposition of a perovskite film with a uniform thickness, a flat surface, and conformal coverage.

The micro cell was built with an insulation layer deposited on the ETL to prevent a direct contact between the ETL and the hole transport layer (HTL (violet). The insulation layer was then patterned and etched to expose the ETL inside the microcell area. The perovskite layer was deposited and patterned after the deposition of the HTL and top electrode.
The scientists tested 458 perovskite microcells with a diameter of 100 μm and an electrode area of 9 mm2 and found that the champion device, under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved an efficiency of 20.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V, a short-circuit current density of 22.5 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 77%. The microcells also showed a light utilization efficiency of 4.67 and a color rendering index of 97.5 %.
With this PV device, the researchers also built a first prototype of a solar window which they claim has vivid colors and high color purity. The window was fabricated with metal–insulator–metal structures and moth-eye-inspired nanostructures.
The microcell design is introduced in the paper Perovskite microcells fabricated using swelling-induced crack propagation for colored solar windows, which was recently published in nature communications. The research team includes academics from the Seoul National University, the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), and the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/25/myanmars-steeplechase-towards-renewable-energy/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,MYANMAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 25, 2022",Myanmar’s steeplechase towards renewable energy,"The Ministry of Information (MOI) and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Economic Relations (MIFER) of Myanmar last week issued a joint press release stating that the government is planning to boost renewable energy development and increase foreign investments despite the threat of new economic sanctions.
The two ministries said the announcement comes in response to recent unspecified media reports about energy shortages in the country and exits of some foreign energy companies.
“The recent temporary shortage of power was caused by a surge of global liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a weaker kyat currency, as well as terrorist actions linked to the People's Defensive Force (PDF),” the government said referring to the armed wing of the democratically elected National Unity Government (NUG) which was ousted by a military coup on February 1, 2021.
“Apart from advocating a boycott of utility payments since 2021, PDF terrorists blew up power lines from the Lawpita hydroelectric plant in Kayah State. These actions contributed to outages which caused hardship to ordinary citizens and small businesses in particular.”
The government also said it will accelerate power generation in the country from oil and gas sources through new investments.
As for solar development, the two ministries said the 40 MW Letpanhla and 30 MW Nyaungbin Gyi solar projects have been completed and 13 solar power projects totaling 370 MW have been launched.
“Three more solar power projects which will generate 390 megawatt are also planned. Special efforts are being made to promote floating solar projects, rooftop solar projects, and small and medium-sized projects wherever possible. Tenders are also being called for 18 solar power projects that can generate 635 MW. These are in addition to ongoing negotiations for 11 solar projects which will generate 300 MW that have been invited,” their statement reads.
Despite the optimism of Myanmar's authorities, the development of large scale solar appears to be  encountering difficulties. Chinese PV inverter manufacturer Sungrow announced last week in its financial results that the project it secured in Myanmar's first solar tender held in September 2020 has been canceled.
Last month, Irrawaddy news website owned by the Irrawaddy Publishing Group (IPG), founded in 1990 by Burmese exiles living in Thailand, reported that the utility solar projects selected in the above-mentioned tender were still far behind their construction schedules.
“Myanmar’s military regime is not pushing enough or not pushing at all the Chinese firms who are contracted to start solar power production, despite the fact that they are several months behind schedule,” the media outlet reported, hinting at the fact the military coup took place four months after the tender was finalized.
“The companies were set to start operations within six months under the agreements. However, the Myanmar military seized power from the NLD government in a February coup last year while the bidders were in the final phase to sign power purchase agreements with the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE).”
German project developer ib vogt, which secured one of the awarded projects, has declined to provide a comment upon pv magazine request. “ib vogt generally does not comment on projects that are under development,” the company stated.
Only an undisclosed project developer has so far secured a power purchase agreement from the MOEE, said Irrawaddy citing unidentified sources from the ministry. Furthermore, the article reveals that several of the regions where the projects will be located are currently affected by clashes between the army and resistance groups.
The MOEE allocated 1 GW of PV capacity in the procurement exercise and final prices ranged from US$0.0348/kWh to $0.051/kWh. The biggest winners were Chinese inverter maker Sungrow and China Machinery Engineering Corp. (CMEC), with nine and eight projects awarded, respectively.
A consortium formed by China's State Power Investment Corporation Limited (SPIC) and local company Khaing Long Gems secured four projects. Two more consortia – including a group involving Chinese solar manufacturers Longi and GGL Systems – also won projects, as did the remaining two bidders, including groups led ib vogt and Myanmar's Gold Energy.
In June 2021, the MOEE launched a second 1 GW PV tender and a few months later it postponed the deadline to submit the bids for unspecified reasons.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country reached an installed PV capacity of 80 MW at the end of 2021.

Ontario’s regulatory changes expand access to net metering, allowing solar customers to receive credit on their electric bill for any excess energy sent back to the grid.  The changes clarify and enable third-party ownership arrangements for net metering, such as leasing, financing, and power purchase agreements. Prior to the amendments, the net metering regulation required the customer to own or operate the renewable generation system to qualify as an eligible generator.
“Our government has put families back in control of their energy bills and we will continue to give them more tools to keep costs down, including new ways to lower electricity costs,” said Todd Smith, Minister of Energy. “By allowing families and business to lease rooftop solar systems and benefit from net metering we are eliminating barriers, including up-front costs for customers, while at the same time supporting new jobs in our growing clean energy sector.”
Encouraging net metering creates new opportunities for renewable energy businesses, including installers, developers, and service providers, to offer distributed energy solutions, like rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources. In making the announcement, the ministry of energy office released a statement saying that the government hopes the amendments will encourage businesses interested in investing in Ontario to be able to set up their facilities in the province and have more options to meet renewable energy or sustainability targets.
“This regulatory clarity will enable our industry to move forward in providing Ontario consumers with more options to lower their energy costs and to reduce GHG emissions, while helping to drive job creation and growth in the province’s renewable energy sector,” said Robert Hornung, president and CEO, Canadian Renewable Energy Association. 
The government also introduced consumer protection measures that apply specifically to third-party ownership net metering arrangements. Some of these measures include disclosure requirements for businesses when dealing with homeowners and businesses, ensuring transparency for consumers.
