The agreement requires the two nations to collaborate on safety, regulatory measures, and market analysis to facilitate government and industry planning and investments.
GIZ, the German development agency, has launched the International Green Hydrogen Promotion Program (H2Uppp) on behalf of the German Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection (BMWK). The program aims to bolster green hydrogen projects and their value chains in Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay, Mexico, and Brazil. The funding for the projects ranges from €50,000 ($52.874) to €2 million, with a requirement that the private sector contributes at least 50% of the contract. Eligibility criteria include the lead applicant company being based in the European Union and having a minimum of three years in existence. The call for proposals remains open until the end of the year.
DHL, HH2E, and Sasol have signed an agreement to set up a collaborative project focused on building potential production capacities for sustainable aviation fuels derived from green hydrogen (eSAF). The project will be built in an undisclosed location in eastern Germany to serve various airports, including Leipzig/Halle. The initial plan foresees a production volume of at least 200,000 tons of eSAF per year, with the potential to scale up to 500,000 tons annually. This scaled production is expected to lead to a reduction of 632,000 tons of CO2 emissions yearly. Airbus is also expected to join the consortium at a later stage.
Tata Motors has supplied two 12-meter-long hydrogen fuel cell-powered (FCEV) buses to Indian Oil Corp., the largest petroleum company in India. These deliveries are part of Indian Oil's ongoing trials of 15 buses powered by green hydrogen across Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.
 
Mauritania could be in an advantageous position to export hydrogen to international markets, potentially surpassing countries such as Morocco and Egypt in this regard, according to Michaël Tanchum, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute. Mauritania's smaller population, vast coverage by the Sahara Desert with abundant direct normal irradiation (DNI) levels, and rich wind energy resources contribute to its favorable position. Additionally, being the only Sahel nation with a coastline allows Mauritania to facilitate off-take for export markets.
Galp has made a final investment decision on two large-scale projects to reduce the carbon footprint of the Sines refinery, including a 100 MW of electrolyzers for up to 15 ktpa of green hydrogen production. The unit, for a total investment of €250 million, is expected to have its first start up in 2025. The electrolyzers will be supplied by renewable power, originating from long-term supply agreements. Plug Power was awarded the order for the 100 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, while Technip Energies will be the main EPCM provider.

This week, however, the project's two managing companies – Masdar and Indonesian-headquartered electricity generator PLN Nusantara Power – announced in a press release they had agreed to expand the floating PV plant more than threefold to 500 MW.
The companies did not say when the project expansion would be complete.
In January 2020, Masdar said it had signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, the government-owned electric utility, to build what it then claimed was Southeast Asia’s largest floating PV project.
The project can now expand operations because Indonesia's Ministry of Public Works and Housing now permits up to 20% of water coverage can be used for renewable energy, according to the press release.
A recent study showed that Indonesia had the potential for floating PV on 2,719 suitable bodies of water, with 271,897 MW of potential capacity and 369,059 GWh/year of potential generation. Indonesia recorded 291 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recent data collated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/26/australias-rooftop-pv-installations-hit-1-4-gw-in-h1/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HEAT PUMPS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2023",Australia’s rooftop PV installations hit 1.4 GW in H1,"Australia's Clean Energy Regulator said in a recently published report that utility-scale PV deployment is sluggish due to a rangte of challenges, including rising costs, global competition, and regulatory issues.
Rooftop solar installations have been a bright spot, with almost 160,000 systems installed in the first half of the year. This trend suggests that 2023 could surpass Australia's previous record of 3.2 GW in total capacity for rooftop solar installations.
In the first half of 2023, 1.4 GW of rooftop solar PV capacity was added, up 21% year on year. If this growth continues throughout 2023, it is possible that the 2021 record of 3.2 GW could be exceeded. The average size of rooftop systems has also increased, reaching a new high of 9.3 kW.
“The increased capacity saw the share of renewable electricity rise to over 36% of demand in the National Electricity Market. This is expected to grow to 40% by December,” said the regulator.
Last weekend, South Australian rooftops provided 101% of the state's electricity demand, an unprecedented feat, according to energy advisory firm Global Power Energy. This achievement in South Australia is exceptional, both within the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and on a global scale.
Clean Energy Regulator CEO David Parker, described the first half of the year for new large-scale renewable energy investment commitments as “quiet … We’ve downgraded our expectations and now expect 2023 investment may not reach 3 GW.”
Although the regulator had anticipated that 3.5 GW of new renewable projects would reach a final investment decision (FID) in 2023, only 0.5 GW hit this milestone before July. However, the second half of the year is expected to see more significant activity, with industry engagement indicating approximately 2.5 GW of projects moving towards FID.
“Wind and solar remain the cheapest options for new energy supply. Unfortunately, rising costs for components, engineering and construction combined with strong international demand for these products and services are slowing progress,” the regulator said. “Finding ways to streamline grid connection and fast-tracking new transmission will also be critical for success.”
Increasing prices and decreasing durations of power purchase agreements (PPAs), which are crucial for large-scale projects as they secure offtake and guarantee income, are impacting the number of projects reaching FID, according to the regulator.
“Increased cost and risks [for large-scale renewable projects] are flowing through to the PPAs prices,” the report says. “A higher price is needed on a per megawatt hour basis to get projects to FID. These higher prices may be leading to less demand for PPAs from electricity retailers and corporates.”
The regulator noted a growing trend towards shorter-term PPAs. but achieving Australia's 82% renewable energy generation target by 2030 will require a significant increase, it added.

The system will also serve as a backup energy source in the event of sudden blackouts.
NHOA Energy said the project falls within the Guangdong provincial government's energy storage development policy, making it eligible for expected subsidies.

The main topic was the development of home solar in Ukraine.
Image: IB Centre
The regulator was not receptive. Our decentralization arguments were met with skepticism, to put it mildly, by representatives of the old Soviet centralized power generation system. One of the commission members said the idea home solar could be a useful market segment was delusional, therefore there was no point developing it.
Exactly 10 years later, home solar arrays became almost the only source of energy for Ukrainians left without electricity due to the centralized energy infrastructure destroyed by Russian missiles and bombs.
As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology and digital systems, the need for secure and reliable energy becomes ever more pressing. While traditional, fossil fuel-based systems have long been the mainstay of global energy, growing awareness of their negative environmental impact, the finite nature of such resources, and the rising potential for geopolitical conflict has prompted a renewed focus on decentralized, renewable energy systems.
Ukraine has become a vivid example of how the centralization and monopolization of an energy system can lead to tragic political, environmental, and economic consequences. The nation's chronic dependence on Russian energy sources, in particular, oil, gas, and nuclear fuel, created the prerequisites for almost 100% Russian control over the Ukrainian economy. A similar situation has developed in many European countries.
After more than a decade of advocating for the decentralization of Ukraine's energy system, I was pleased to see president Volodymyr Zelensky declare the such an aim will be a state priority. It is essential that governments and private sector actors prioritize the development and deployment of decentralized renewable energy systems in order to ensure a secure and sustainable energy future. Action must not be blocked by fossil fuel energy lobbyists or short-sighted thinking. In Ukraine, for example, the development of decentralized renewable energy systems has been held up for over a decade by various energy lobbies, including the Russian nuclear industry. As a result, only 70,000 households have been able to benefit from the security and resilience of decentralized systems, rather than the millions that could have done so.
Energy dependence has created very dangerous conditions for military aggression. In 2014, my consultancy and cleantech thinktank the Innovative Business Centre (IB Centre), together with former German Green Party MP Hans-Josef Fell, organized the EuroSEF 2014 event in Brussels. The energy security forum saw industry experts and members of the European Parliament discuss the new energy configuration of Europe in the context of dependence on Russia. Unfortunately, not everyone understood the scale of the threat then.
The leadership of Russia, the largest supplier of energy carriers to the countries of the European Union, expected that during its invasion of Ukraine, Europe would pretend the war did not concern them and would instead choose economic stability based on Russian gas, oil, and nuclear fuel. We cannot say all European countries passed this test.
What is the solution in such a situation? Diversification of energy supply and decentralization. Furthermore, decentralization also holds paramount strategic significance.
A centralized system is an easy target for cruise missiles. In the case of Ukraine last year, the Russian military purposely destroyed the country's energy system by bombing transformers, leading to widespread blackouts. Ukrainian households and companies that had installed autonomous renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and biofuel heating and electricity systems, were able to continue to have access to electricity and heating, demonstrating the inherent resilience and security of decentralized systems.
In 2011, the IB Centre started a pilot project within the framework of the Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy. We decided to lobby for the opening up of the solar energy market to households.
The renewable energy association was the first such body in the Ukrainian cleantech industry, which at that time united more than 75% of players in the clean energy market. We communicated the aims of our project through the resources of the IB Centre, which at that time managed the leading new energy industry information platform, had its own news agency, and produced industry publications from the cleantech sector.
We immediately found ourselves at the epicenter of lively discussion, which mainly centered on the fact that representatives of legacy energy systems were inventing reasons why individuals could not become solar energy generators. Those disputes continued until 2015, when the Ukrainian parliament finally adopted amendments to a law enabling a green tariff for individuals – homeowners.
The war in Ukraine became the trigger for radical change in the European energy paradigm. Today, most of the countries of Central Europe and Eastern Europe quickly adopt legislative changes aimed at the development of decentralization of energy, in particular solar energy, without too much delay and prevarication.
A great example of a rapid pivot to green, decentralized energy is Romania. In July, the country’s Ministry of Energy announced a finance program for solar arrays on social infrastructure facilities that is worth more than €500 million ($535 million). At the beginning of this month, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy of Romania announced the launch of a finance package for solar panels for farmers worth almost €1 billion. A little earlier, Romania had already announced an intent to install 160,000 solar roofs in the next two years.
That is why we have chosen Bucharest as the venue for CISOLAR 2023, the 11th Solar Energy Conference and Trade Show of Central and Eastern Europe, which will take place in the Romanian capital on Oct. 30-31. We want to write a new page of energy transformation in the region and demonstrate that even the most centralized systems in Europe can be transformed into green, decentralized ones with the help of solar energy. After all, there are simply no other options for the evolution of our energy systems.

The scientists focused their analysis on Chile's Maule region, which has a strong agricultural profile and is affected by chronic periods of drought.
“I think vertical PV would be feasible and interesting in many other regions of Chile considering the troubles they have with scarcity of water and the type of crop they have,” the research's corresponding author, Roxane Bruhweyler, told pv magazine. “We decided to focus on the central region because of the additional problem of the water conflict between farmers and hydropower centrals and the importance of irrigated agricultural lands in that region. This particularly makes sense when you are evaluating the geometry of an agrivoltaic system that you suspect to be able to reduce the evapotranspiration of the crop.”
They quantified the anticipated reduction in water usage when converting irrigated agricultural land to vertical agrivoltaics and assessed the expected power generation of a 100 kW north-tilted PV array in Chanco, located in the Maule region's Cauquenes province. The PV system reduces the cultivated area of the agricultural surface by 15%, and a 14 m gap between the rows of bifacial solar modules enables the use of agricultural machinery.
“Shading of the crop on the solar panels is negligible for most cereals and forage crops and there is no effect at all for a crop height below 105 cm,” the scientists explained.
They conducted a series of simulations on the system considering the global horizontal irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed as input data. They also used hourly weather data for 2021 and the PVLIB-Python modeling tool produced by Sandia National Laboratory, which calculates solar irradiance on the plane of a PV panel (POAI), measured as kWh/m2/day, to analyze the array's power production.
Through these measurements, the academics were able to verify that the vertical PV system could reduce water demand for the irrigated main crops. They also found that the PV installation produces 10% less energy than conventional PV systems.
“However, the agrivoltaic facility offers a two-peak generation profile that allows the spreading of the production of photovoltaic energy over the day, reducing the risk of curtailments,” they stated. The microclimate heterogeneity analysis of this vertical agrivoltaics suggests that plants will need slightly different amounts of water depending on their position between the rows of panels.”
The researchers presented their modeling in “Vertical agrivoltaics and its potential for electricity production and agricultural water demand: A case study in the area of Chanco, Chile,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments.
“Future work will aim to further validate the computational models tested in this study through field monitoring of vertical AV sites in collaboration with other partners, with a specific focus on the effects of these installations on microclimate and water balance, energy yield prediction uncertainties, and crop growth,” they said, in reference to their future plans.
The research group includes scientists from Hochschule Anhalt University of Applied Sciences in Germany, French technology company Naldeo Technologies Industries, and Universidad de Santo Tomás in Chile.

TÜV SUD has confirmed the results.
For the same module technology, the manufacturer had achieved in March an output of 723.97 W and an efficiency of 23.30%.
“The Himalaya G12-132 module is made up of double-sided microcrystalline G12-20BB HJT cells produced independently at the Huasun Xuancheng Phase IV HJT Cell Project,” Huasun said in a statement. “The average mass-production efficiency of the cells has been increased up to 26.2% after two months of capacity ramp-up.”
The company also explained that the new record was made possible by applying low-temperature silver paste with high-density fine busbar printing technology to the module production, without providing further details. “We will continue to break records for module efficiency and power output after gradually introducing new technologies like metallized film and 0BB into mass production,” it stated.
In March, Huasun started making solar panels at its HJT cell factory in Xuancheng, in China's Anhui province. The factory has an annual capacity of 10 GW and produce bifacial 182 mm HJT cells, based on a cell tech with a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.69%.

The material consists of phosphorus alloyed with arsenic.
“The study shows that alloying is a powerful tool for controlling the properties and thus applications and potential of this growing nanomaterial family,” said researcher Adam Clancy.
The creation of arsenic-phosphorus alloy nanoribbons (AsPNRs) dates back to the group's past work. In 2019, the researchers discovered phosphorus nanoribbons.
“However, phosphorus-only materials do not conduct electricity very well, hindering their usage for certain applications,” they stated.
To tackle this problem, the research team alloyed phosphorus with its neighboring element, arsenic. They initiated the process by using a commercially available black arsenic phosphorus (bAsP) alloy. Submerging this alloy into a lithium electride ammonia solution led to the formation of compounds containing phosphorus with arsenic precursors, commonly referred to as bAsP, along with lithium.
Following this process, the academics dispersed the compounds in amidic solvents and created the AsPNRs. Then they analyzed the properties of the AsPNRs and found they have high hole mobilities. As holes are the opposite partners to electrons in electrical transport, their improvement helps electrical current move more efficiently.
The researchers have further specified that the AsPNRs are reaching the highly electrically conductive state at above 130 kelvin. In addition to the high hole mobilities, their conductivity is also due to a small energy bandgap of only 0.035 eV and their paramagnetic nature.
“AsPNRs can be used in applications where the low electrical conductivity of quasi-1D phosphorene nanoribbons hinders their application, such as energy storage electrodes,” the scientists concluded. “Beyond, their small band gap, magnetism, and high hole mobilities make them ideal candidates for next generation near-infrared detectors, quantum computing, and charge carrier layers in solar cells, respectively.”
They described their findings in “Production of Magnetic Arsenic–Phosphorus Alloy Nanoribbons with Small Band Gaps and High Hole Conductivities,” which was recently published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The research group includes scientists from University College London, University of Cambridge, Queen Mary University of London, and University of Bristol.

The German photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module manufacturer said that the factory has an annual capacity of 50 MW, or 120,000 modules per year. It claimed that it is currently the world's largest PVT production facility.
Sunmaxx plans to switch on the first production line this year. It said that it aims to reach a capacity of 3 GW at an unspecified later stage.
“The remodeling of the production site and the preparation of the hall for the production machinery is currently taking place,” said CTO Jiri Springer. “But the demand for our modules – including for the construction of ground-mounted systems – is growing rapidly and we want to scale up our production as quickly as possible. We plan to open the first line this year, but the location allows us to implement further expansion opportunities up to several hundred megawatts per year in the near future.”
In March, Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) certified that Sunmaxx's PVT PX-1 solar modules have an overall efficiency of 80%. They measure 1,750 mm x 1,140 mm x 38 mm and feature 108 PERC half-cells in the M10 format. The electrical output is 400 W, which corresponds to an electrical efficiency of about 20%.

Panasonic drew some attention at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, as it brought in Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps to promote its new products, including a new series of residential solar modules, a home battery, and a home energy management system.
“Panasonic’s long-standing commitment to sustainability, including developing the technologies to create a cleaner future such as high-performance solar panels and home energy storage, is why I have chosen to work with them this year to outfit my own home with a Panasonic solar energy system,” said Phelps.
The major panel supplier revealed the 430HK2/420HK2 Black series modules, made with heterojunction (HJT) technology, half-cut cells, and gapless connections. The 430 W and 420 W modules are the company’s most powerful available and sport efficiencies of 22.2% and 21.7%, respectively.
The Evervolt HK2 series are backed by a 25-year warranty for performance, product, parts and labor. Panasonic said the panels have a low degradation rate of 0.25% annually, leading to at least 92% of the original output by year 25. The company said its modules benefit from minimal low induced degradation and potential induced degradation.

Along with the HK Black series, Panasonic displayed its modules with passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) technology and half-cut cells, which are slightly less powerful but offer a lower price point. The 405PK2 and 400PK2 series offer 20.8% and 20.5% efficiencies respectively and power ratings of 405 W and 400 W.
The modules offer a power output of at least 84.8% at the end of 25 years of operation. These modules are offered the same 25-year warranty on performance, product, parts, and labor.
“Our variety of premium modules offer various capabilities and price points, allowing more flexibility and options for both consumers and installers,” said Mukesh Sethi, director of solar and energy storage at Panasonic Eco Systems North America.
Home battery
Along with the new modules on display was a home battery announced in June. The new generation Evervolt home battery is a a modular energy storage device that supports both DC and AC coupling.
The storage system includes a hybrid inverter and lithium-ferro-phosphate battery. It also includes the SmartBox, a home energy management device.
Each battery is modular in increments of 4.6 kWh of usable energy, offering up to 18.4 kWh per battery. Up to four EverVolt batteries can be connected to one SmartBox, achieving up to 30 kW of power and 72 kWh of usable energy. Up to 15.2 kW of solar modules can be connected to three maximum power point trackers. The battery offers up to 7.6 kW of continuous backup power in a single battery.
The battery’s 160 A AC current helps keep more appliances running continuously, and it can use both 120 V and 240 V with no transformer needed. It is rated for a 6,000 cycle lifespan and has a 98% peak efficiency rating and 97.5% CEC weighted efficiency. It also enables 200% PV oversizing, meaning solar capacity can exceed inverter capacity by up to 200%.
The battery operates on multiple operating modes, including back-up, self-use, time-of-use and custom modes which can be set through a mobile app. The device is connected with a Wi-Fi monitoring system connected to Panasonic’s app.
Homeowners can track battery levels, view energy consumption data, and view alerts and instructions on how to troubleshoot errors. The system can receive firmware updates in real time via over-the-air software.
The EverVolt battery has black-start functionality to restart a system with solar power after a grid power outage. It is compatible with generators of up to 125 A to support the home during long power outages. The SmartBox allows for the backup of up to six electrical panel loads.
The battery system can be installed indoors or outdoors and is UL9540A certified for unit level thermal runaway. Panasonic includes a 12-year product warranty that covers product, performance and labor across all major systems and components of the solar installation.
“With the increased focus on clean energy, the EverVolt Home Battery System provides homeowners with a new, enhanced solution for energy management that is easy to install and can be used with new and existing solar systems,” said Sethi.
