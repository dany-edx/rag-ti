The two studies will determine the percentage of hydrogen that can be safely transported through existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure, including Enbridge's transmission system and FortisBC's distribution system, in British Columbia, Canada. According to DNV, the studies are the “largest” blending studies undertaken in North America. They “will be used to develop the codes and standards required to safely transport hydrogen as the first step in forming a sustainable commercial hydrogen market,” said the Norwegian classification society.
The US Department of Energy has announced $750 million of funding for 52 projects across 24 states to “dramatically reduce the cost of clean hydrogen and reinforce America's global leadership in the growing clean hydrogen industry.” The government said it aims to build 14 GW of fuel cell manufacturing capacity per year and 10 GW of annual electrolyzer manufacturing capacity. Several of the selected projects are run by well-known companies, such as Ballard Power Systems, Cummins, General Motors, Nel Hydrogen, Plug Power, Robert Bosch, and thyssenkrupp nucera.
Vattenfall said it will conclude its hydrogen production project for offshore wind farms. It started the project almost two years ago. “Having tested the development phase for decentralized offshore hydrogen production, and in light of other industry advances, Vattenfall has now taken the decision to conclude the project,” it said. It claimed that the project, designed around its European offshore wind hub off the coast of Scotland, “aided the creation of a new regulatory and consenting regime by the UK government for offshore hydrogen transportation and storage.”
Heidelberg Materials UK, Stopford and Cranfield University said they are working to establish the feasibility of using ammonia as a source of hydrogen for use as a fuel in cement kilns. “We have already proved the success of using hydrogen as part of a lower carbon fuel mix, but its storage and transportation are technically challenging and, at present, costs are prohibitive,” said Heidelberg Materials UK Sustainability Director Marian Garfield. The company said the new research, which builds on a demonstration using hydrogen as part of a net zero fuel mix to power a cement kiln, “will explore the potential use of ammonia as a low-cost, low carbon hydrogen carrier, evaluating the most efficient method of ‘cracking' the ammonia on-site to release the hydrogen for use as a fuel in the kiln.” 
Sasol and Topsoe have launched a 50:50 joint venture, Zaffra, to develop and supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Topsoe said the venture aims to build a “global presence.”
Eletrobras and Paul Wurth do Brasil have agreed to collaborate on the production of renewable hydrogen and synthetic fuels. “The partnership includes the construction and operation of a 10 MW plant for the production of renewable hydrogen (H2R) and oxygen,” said Eletrobras. “Feasibility studies are expected to be completed in around a year.”

When testing under ambient conditions, the team recorded an efficiency of 11% for 50 cm² large-scale solar panels consisting of optimized roll-to-roll fabricated hybrid perovskite solar cells and up to 15.5% efficiency on individual small-area cells.
CSIRO said scaling up production while maintaining efficiency has long been a hurdle for printed solar cell technology, with many researchers achieving efficiency levels of 1% to 2% for fully printed flexible solar panels.
The researchers’ hybrid perovskite solar cell modules consist of serially-interconnected cells, produced entirely using industrial roll-to-roll printing tools akin to how a newspaper is printed, and replacing metal electrodes with perovskite-friendly carbon electrodes.
The team used automated fabricated and screening systems capable of producing and testing more than 10,000 solar cells per day. They said this allowed them to quickly pinpoint the ideal settings for various parameters, leading to a substantial increase in efficiency outcomes.
The CSIRO said the results are the culmination of more than a decade of research and development. It it is now actively seeking industry partners to further develop and commercialize the technology.
The researchers said the flexible printed solar cells could be used in industries such as defense, emergency management, construction, agriculture, mining, space exploration and urban infrastructure.
It said their solar cells’ shorter energy payback time and projected low costs make them an economical and environmentally attractive renewable energy solution. The researchers estimate a cost of around $0.70 for a production rate of 1,000,000 m² per year in Australia, with potential for further significant cost reductions.
CSIRO’s project has been completed in collaboration with researchers from the University of Cambridge, Monash University, the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales.
The research, “The first demonstration of entirely roll-to-roll fabricated perovskite solar cell modules under ambient room conditions”, has been published in the 15th edition of the Nature Communications journal.

Iberdrola said in a statement that the companies will monitor and potentially apply new treatment technologies to enhance the industrial recovery capacity of PV modules. They also plans to explore the reuse of secondary raw materials obtained during treatment processes to ensure the 100% recyclability of solar panels.
Iberdrola said their efforts will ensure ideal positioning for panel recycling at end of life. Álvaro Portellano, the head of Iberdrola’s Perseo Venture Builder unit, noted the company's commitment to recycling all facility components.
“This strategic agreement is a continuation of our efforts in the search for the best technologies for the recovery of the resources contained in waste in order to incorporate them back into production processes,” added María Jesús Kaifer, FCC Ámbito’s technical director and head of circular economy. “The recycling of photovoltaic panels is another project that we are tackling together with a leading company in its sector, Iberdrola.”
In 2022, FCC Ámbito and Iberdrola jointly launched EnergyLoop, a company focused on the recycling of wind turbine blades. 
FCC Ámbito recently inaugurated an industrial PV panel treatment plant in Cadrete, Spain, and is currently leading PV4INK R&D&I, a project aimed at recovering the silver contained in solar panels. Iberdrola, meanwhile, is participating in the European RETRIEVE project, which is working on flexible recovery technologies for each main component of PV panels, particularly silicon.
In 2023, Iberdrola completed Spain’s first hybrid wind-solar plant and announced plans to open a PV module factory and install the country’s first hybrid hydroelectric-solar plant.

The projects were awarded to a mix of local companies and foreign companies. The signing ceremony took place this week in the presence of Minister of Energy Mohamed Arkab and  Minister of Environment Fazia Dahlab.
The capacity was allocated as part of a 1 GW scheme launched in late 2021 and a 2 GW tender initiated in February last year. The 2 GW procurement exercise will deliver 15 PV projects, with capacities ranging from 80 MW to 220 MW, in 12 provinces across the country. The tender attracted 20 bidders and a total of 77 offers.
The 1 GW tender involves the construction of five solar projects in five provinces, with capacities ranging from 50 MW to 300 MW. The two initiatives are part of the country's goal to deploy 15 GW of solar and stop using natural gas. According to local media reports, Sonelgaz appears set to launch another 3 GW procurement exercise later this year.
Algeria had installed about 423 MW of solar capacity by the end of 2021, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

The DHN-72X16/DG/FS panels come in four versions, ranging from 570 W to 585 W nominal power, with a power conversion efficiency of 22.07% to 22.65%. They have an open-circuit voltage ranging from 51.0 V to 51.6 V and a short-circuit current of 14.02 A to 14.20 A.
The double-glass panels measure 2,278 mm x 1,134 x 32 mm and weigh 32 kg. They feature 2.0 mm heat-strengthened glass, with anti-reflective coating. The modules have IP68 junction boxes and anodized aluminum alloy frames. They can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and in temperatures ranging between -40 C and 85 C.
The temperature coefficient is -0.30% per degree Celsius. The PV panels come with a 15-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1% and the 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“With the unique frameless design on the front of PV modules, the new module is installable both vertically & horizontally,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “It is also capable of preventing snow or sand accumulation, which may ensure an annual power generation increase of 6% to 15%.”
DAH Solar is based in Hefei, China's Anhui province. It currently operates a 5 GW solar panel factory.

6,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/15/underrepresentation-of-women-in-solar-requires-holistic-approach/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,2024-03-15,Underrepresentation of women in solar requires ‘holistic approach’,"Solar energy leads not only to renewable energy generation but also the way for gender inclusion. Our sector employs almost the same percentage (40%) as the oil and gas sector (22%) and wind sector (21%) together, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency's report “Solar PV: A Gender Perspective.” In that sense, we can be very optimistic regarding the attractiveness of our sector for women for its contribution to sustainability and positive impact on social welfare in developing countries.
Women often face more challenges than their male colleagues in most industries worldwide due to the lack of social and gender equality policies and cultural legacies. At Women in Solar Europe Network, we are gathering specific data to help us understand the obstacles that prevent women from reaching leadership positions in our regions. Although it's still early days, our initial data shows that 91% of women have encountered career barriers. This figure is much higher than the 60% reported in ‘Solar PV: A Gender Perspective,' although their percentage varies depending on the data set. Observing how our percentage changes as we collect more data will be interesting.
The solar and energy storage industry is full of opportunities for women, but we need to set the correct path proactively. Many companies in the sector prioritize diversity and inclusion and strive to create an equitable work environment by supporting mentorship, networking, and professional development initiatives such as the WiSEu Network. Unfortunately, this is not the case for all organizations. Many male C-Levels don't have inclusion in their business agenda, and they might pay a high price for it.
According to many reports, such as Diversity Wins (2019) from the Mackinsey series, companies with higher representation of women in leadership roles and ethnic diversity ‘are most likely to outperform competitors in profitability'. Equity and Inclusion are usually recognized to contribute to innovation as they avoid blind spots caused by the group mentality.
It is worth mentioning that the representation of women across the value chain in different segments, roles, and leadership positions varies significantly. Returning to IRENA's “Solar PV: A Gender Perspective” report, manufacturing employs the most significant proportion of women, 47%, while installers employ only 12%. In Europe & North America, women in administrative roles account for 50% with no progression to leadership roles, where women hold globally 30% of managerial positions and 17% of senior management out of their share.
The underrepresentation of women in the PV industry needs to be addressed with a holistic approach from a cultural and educational perspective, motivating girls to pursue STEM careers, attracting young women to the industry from the university level, career development support from organizations starting at entry positions, and gender equality policies from governments. It is not easy, as many actors are involved, but it certainly can be done.
According to SolarPower Europe, by the end of this decade, solar energy is projected to generate the most job opportunities within Europe’s renewable energy sector, estimated at approximately one million positions. Consequently, our industry is experiencing rapid growth, continually attracting the younger demographic to its workforce. That is precisely the biggest opportunity and challenge. In my view, our options are limited; leaders must either evolve into pioneers or become relics of the past, and it all comes down to recognizing the value that gender equality and diversity—be it ethnic, cultural, religious, sexual, age-related, or pertaining to disability—add to an industry that must perpetually innovate.

7,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/15/systovi-searching-for-buyer-due-to-chinese-dumping/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,FRANCE",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,2024-03-15,Systovi searching for buyer due to ‘Chinese dumping’,"From pv magazine France
French module maker Systovi, a Cetih group subsidiary since 2018, said in a press release that it is no longer able to compete against Chinese suppliers and is now on the lookout for a buyer. The company said it faces challenges, despite significant investments in a new production line and the doubling of its capacity to 80 MW.
“Despite a solid first half of 2023, Systovi has faced the sudden acceleration of Chinese dumping since last summer, a consequence of the increase in local manufacturing capacity and the closure of the US market, linked to the protectionist measures under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),” said the company. “In the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework, this has resulted in a flood of subsidized Chinese panels on the French and other European markets, and led to a sharp drop in Systovi's order books.”
Its announcement follows the recent decision of Switzerland-based Meyer Burger to stem losses in Europe by halting solar module production in Freiberg, Germany.
Systovi said progress has been slow on regulatory measures to restore fair competition in France and the broader European market.
“The current discussions, in which the company is participating, at the French level as well as at the European level, will not have an effect within a time frame compatible with Systovi's challenges,” said the company.
Systovi Managing Director Paul Toulouse said the decision to seek a buyer aligns with the company's dedication to its aim to support a sustainable energy future. The selection of a buyer will be based on their capacity to preserve employment and sustainably manage the business.

The production shortfalls were due to thick clouds in moist westerly winds from the Atlantic, penetrating more strongly and further east than usual for this time of year.
The large shortfalls in solar production compared to February normals spanned a vast area, across the UK (-13%), France (-19%), Belgium (-31%), Netherlands (-35%), and Germany (-17%). Shortfalls of similar magnitude were seen across Switzerland, Northern Italy, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, southern Sweden, the Baltic states and Ukraine. Some locations in France and Poland reached as low as 40% below normal irradiance.

The thicker-than-usual clouds were the result of a series of low pressure systems in the vicinity of Iceland, Norway and the UK. These low pressure systems drove moist westerly winds and clouds from the Atlantic deep across Europe north of the Alps.

With high winter-time precipitation, the solar production shortfalls could have been even worse due to snow soiling. Above-normal temperatures led to more rain than snow during February 2024.
Further south, conditions were closer to normal in more stable weather conditions across Portugal, Spain, Southern Italy, Greece, Turkey and the Balkans. Mean daily irradiation in these areas during February reached up to 4 kWh per day, with some areas receiving 120% normal irradiance. Ireland and Scotland, also received more irradiance than normal in February, but mostly due to the shorter days, this was still less than 1.5kWh per day.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Mexico's Energy Regulatory Commission has published statistics for distributed-generation facilities with capacities of less than 0.5 MW for 2023. The figures show that total installed capacity reached 3,361 MW at the end of December 2023.
This capacity comes from 411,085 registered interconnection contracts. Solar account for 410,810 of these contracts. This equates to 3,339.31 MW, 99.33% of the total.
The commission's statistics show that 76,101 new contracts were signed last year, for a total of 728.93 MW. These are both the highest figures since 2007, when the regulator started tracking distributed generation. Interconnection contracts increased by 22.7%, and installed capacity rose by 27.7% compared to 334,984 contracts in 2022.
Jalisco has the most interconnection contracts (74,261) and installed capacity (515.26 MW) in distributed generation, followed by Nuevo León with 46,418 contracts and 355.69 MW, Chihuahua with 32,979 contracts and 227.55 MW, and Guanajuato with 21,432 contracts and 213.69 MW.

Monocrystalline PERC G12 wafer prices decreased by 2.24% week-over-week to $0.349 per piece (pc), while N-type M10 and G12 wafer prices dropped by 2.82% and 2.08% week to week-over-week to $0.241/pc and $0.377/pc, respectively.
The only exception was monocrystalline PERC M10 wafers, which trended flat week to week at $0.254/pc thanks to its manageable production output.

As outlined by a market expert, the fundamentals of the wafer market are currently defined by elevated inventory levels, high production costs, and heightened operating rates.
The high inventory level of wafers has placed a lot of strain on the wafer suppliers. A source from a major wafer producer expressed the challenge of sales being very tough, stating that without offering discounts on quotations, securing an order is practically impossible.
According to a source from a small-scale manufacturer, there's a notable price variance among the quotes for N-type M10 wafers in the market. Despite the mainstream price standing at CNY1.93 ($0.27)/pc, some manufacturers have resorted to quoting as low as CNY1.8/pc to bolster sales.
According to the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, the wafer market's average operating rate has currently exceeded 85%. The resurgence of downstream demand is one of the factors driving wafer manufacturers to maintain high operating rates, said a market participant.
Furthermore, the polysilicon prices stand relatively robust at present, which necessitates that wafer manufacturers maintain high operating rates to mitigate non-silicon production expenses, the source added.
Additionally, OPIS has gathered from market insights that certain downstream manufacturers are requesting wafer producers to slightly modify the size of current M10 wafers to enhance the power generation area of modules. Currently, wafers sized at 183.5 and 183.75mm are being explored based on the M10 182mm standard. Wafer factories can achieve these sizes without the need for equipment updates.
Moving forward, it's inevitable that wafer inventory will continue to accumulate rapidly. A source observed that some wafer factories are contemplating production cuts to reduce inventory. It remains to be seen if the wafer production output in March can meet the 70 GW or more that the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association has projected.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The tests took place in Muscat, the capital of Oman, which experiences hot summer temperatures of up to 43 C, considerable humidity, and little rain. “Though there have been efforts made to improve PV performance through cleaning and cooling, not much research has been done to fully understand the role that cleaning and water injection play in improving PV performance,” the scientists said. “The study aimed to provide insights into the influence of cooling PV panels and interval cleaning in improving the performance of photovoltaic cells.”
The academics placed a few monocrystalline modules in the same area, each with three thermal sensors at different points. In addition, they installed devices to measure solar irradiance, open circuit voltage, and short circuit current, and their readings were logged into a computer every minute.
All panels, with unmentioned capacity, were set at a height of 1.2 m facing south, and their performance was measured for two weeks. One panel was kept as a reference, with no cleaning or water injection for cooling. Another one was cleaned every three days with towels.
A third panel had water injected through nine nozzles arranged in parallel. In the first week, water was only injected once, on the first day, for half a minute. In the second week, water cooling took place daily, for two minutes each time.
“The results show that the highest power generated was 85.6 W with an efficiency of 23.6%, and the lowest values were 73.4 W, 18% efficiency, for the PV panel cleaned after three days,” the results showed. “In contrast, the uncleaned panel had the maximum power and efficiency of 75.7 W and 17.1%, respectively. The lowest power and efficiency were 67.5 W and 15.4%, respectively. The amount of dust measured after exposure to weather conditions at 20 C was 0.9 g.”
The panel that was only cleaned once for 30 seconds had maximum power and efficiency of 67.13 W and 15.8%. Its lowest power value was 20.6 W with 7.1% efficiency.
“Through the results, it was noticed that the uncleaned panel, in some instances, performed marginally higher than the water injection panel, and this is mainly due to a minimal duration of water injection with a potential of forming mud-like dust accumulation on the surface of the solar panel,” the researchers emphasized. “Another reason is that the water injection nozzles may cast a shadow on the panel, reducing the output power.”
Improved power and efficiency were observed in panels with 120 seconds of daily water injection. In that case, the highest power and efficiency reached 76.68 W and 18.68%, respectively. The lowest measurements were 11.8 W power and 14.4% efficiency.
“The introduction of water for cooling led to a 23.9% increase in energy output,” the scientists concluded. “These findings highlight the importance of regular cleaning and cooling techniques in maximizing the efficiency and output power of photovoltaic modules.”
Their findings were presented in the paper “Effects of cooling and interval cleaning on the performance of soiled photovoltaic panels in Muscat, Oman,” published in Results in Engineering.
