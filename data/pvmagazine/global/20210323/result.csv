It is hoped that supplying the panels to every home in what SolarAid described as the “super-rural village” of Ntchisi will generate enough funds to pay for the costs of the pilot project.
Homeowners, who will be given access to a period of free electric lighting from the systems, will be offered the option of either buying the panels, or of leasing them and paying only for the electricity used.
The solar systems will be supplied by the SunnyMoney social enterprise owned by SolarCentury, which itself has been the object of a takeover by Norwegian state-owned renewables company Statkraft since November.
Helped by a donation of £75,000 (€87,000) from science, technology, engineering and maths charitable foundation the Turner Kirk Trust, it is hoped the roll-out of solar in the 500 households in Ntchisi will lay a template for clean energy to reach remote settlements across Africa.
Elsewhere, European-based private sector solar body RES4Africa has welcomed Portuguese-owned Spanish solar developer EDP Renewables and French company Schneider Electric to its membership body.

The factory is being set up in an 80,000m2 building and is expected to have a 5 GW annual production capacity for cells and modules. When it begins manufacturing in July, Talesun's module capacity will reach 15 GW.
Shanghai-listed solar project developer Jinko Power has reported a 32.88% year-on-year revenue drop for 2020. The company's turnover reached RMB3.58 billion (US$560 million) and net profit dropped 27.6%, year-on-year, to RMB523 million. Jinko said the Covid-19 crisis had a significant impact on its operations, due to fewer-than-expected engineering, procurement and construction contracts and several delayed projects.
China's second-largest grid operator, China Southern Power Grid, has announced around 200 GW of renewable energy capacity will be deployed on its service area–which includes the southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and Hainan–this decade. The company said the first 100 GW will be installed before 2026 and the balance before 2031. The proportion of non-fossil-fuel power plants in Southern's portfolio will rise to 65% in 2030–from 56% last year–and power generation from solar and wind will rise to 61% of the total, from 52% today.

Equating to 65 GWp of new capacity, the volume added–in terms of officially reported projects–takes the world to 270 GWac of solar capacity, according to the latest annual return.
With Wiki-Solar ranking the top 26 nations by the amount of large scale projects added in 2020 and by cumulative generation capacity, China continued to lead the world, and the lack of public reporting of some projects in the world solar capital ensures the analyst can be prone to underestimate Chinese additions.
The U.S. almost overtook its solar superpower rival–at least in Wiki-Solar terms–with 242 announced large scale projects amounting to 12 GWac of capacity, compared to the 97 projects for 12.8 GWac added, officially, in China.
Spain soared back up the ranking with 52 projects adding 3.9 GWac of capacity, including unsubsidized facilities such as ACS Group's Escatrón-Chiprana-Samper, which has a 730 MWac footprint and electric utility Iberdrola's 500 MWac Núñez de Balboa.
Wiki-Solar noted the 29 large projects installed in Australia, for 3.6 GWac of new capacity, indicate grid connection bottlenecks are “gradually” easing and pointed out the arrival of projects subsidized under the SDE+ program helped the Netherlands double its solar capacity, to 1.8 GWac.
It was a different story in the U.K., where just 11 new large scale projects were connected, for 162 MWac of generation capacity last year. Italy and Canada also tumbled down the rankings.
Wiki-Solar is predicting another record this year, provided world number three India can complete all its planned solar tenders and the U.S. can deliver on what promises to be another bumper 12 months. With more than 9.8 GWac of cumulative solar capacity, following the golden years of 2009-12, Spain is likely to join the 10 GWac club in 2021, added the analyst.

The Uttar Pradesh New & Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA) has invited solar power developers to set up an aggregate 75 MW of grid-connected solar power projects in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
The two projects, known as Makrechha and Banghauli (45 MW) and Tikar (30 MW), are to be installed on a build-own-operate basis as part of the Uttar Pradesh Solar Park in Jalaun District.
The projects will be awarded through international competitive bidding followed by reverse auction. Bidders will be able to quote a single tariff if applying for both projects.
The Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders. The maximum tariff payable to the project developers is fixed at INR 3.00/kWh ($0.041/kWh) for 25 years.
The projects must be commissioned within 15 months from the date of signing the PPA.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/23/how-to-protect-rooftop-pv-systems-from-fire-risk/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 23, 2021",How to protect rooftop PV systems from fire risk,"The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and the Dutch Institute for Safety have published a guide to help homeowners or businesses operating a rooftop PV system, or willing to install one, become aware of the fire risks associated with solar power generation.
The guide also provides firefighters with tools to act quickly and safely in the event of an incident and defines the most common fire causes, such as bad system design, inadequate installation, animals chewing on wires, storm damages, manufacturing faults in PV products, including connectors and junction boxes, and heat accumulation, among others.
The basic principle proposed by the TNO experts is that a PV system, including the inverter, must have its own fire compartments, as far as this is possible. These compartments should comply with the Dutch WBDBO requirement, which establish that the fire in a building should be stopped in 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes, depending on the type of building and its function. WBDBO stands for Weerstand tegen BrandDoorslag en BrandOverslag, which translates to Resistance Fire Bursts and Fire Spread.
“For the layout of a commercial roof with solar panels, we recommend working with surfaces of a maximum of 40 by 40 meters, or 1,600 square meters, as in this way the firefighters can still reach all solar panels during their operation,” the Dutch experts said, adding that a safe space must be maintained between the PV system compartments, also in residential installations. “What is also very important if a fire breaks out is that the firefighters can find all information about the existing PV system in the meter cupboard or at the entrance of the building,” they explained. This should help the firefighters identify the location of the inverter, the possible presence of a storage system, and a fireman's switch.
The guide is said to be a working paper that will be updated constantly according to adjustments in regulations and technology.
In September 2018, the Netherlands enterprise agency Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) tasked the TNO to conduct an investigation into fire accidents involving rooftop PV systems reported by Dutch media at the time. In April 2019, the research institute ended its investigation and stated that around 70% of the fires were caused by faulty connectors, and especially by cross-mating, which happens when connectors of different kinds are mated.
In December, Underwriters Laboratories, a U.S. nonprofit standards development organization, published the new UL 3741 safety standard, which is related to the evaluation of PV hazard control functions.

The technology-neutral scheme will be implemented over the period 2021-2026 and the fee exemption will be given on a first-come, first-served basis.
The applicants are also entitled to request additional funds for the installation of a heat pump or leasing of a heating system if they cannot afford the upfront costs for buying one. Furthermore, funds will be awarded if individual oil and gas boilers are converted to district heating.
The use of heat pumps and more flexible heating systems coupled to wind and power generation may be particularly beneficial for countries with serious grid congestion issues, according to a recent report from Dutch electricity transmission system operator (TSO) Tennet. The company's experts analyzed how the use of heat pumps and smarter heat networks may contribute to the creation of more flexible electricity demand, which would, in turn, have the twofold advantage of reducing fossil fuel consumption and not wasting surplus renewable energy generation during peak hours.
Power-to-heat technologies, on the other hand, could also help increase renewables deployment in countries with limited grid capacities and in isolated, coal-based energy systems, according to researchers from Kosovo’s University of Pristina, the Naval Architecture University of Zagreb and Denmark’s Aalborg University.

This type of solar cell, which is also known as a Grätzel solar cell, named after its inventor, EPFL Professor Michael Grätzel, is used for powering electronic devices such as wireless sensors or internet of things, with indoor light.
This dye, a new tailored organic photo-sensitizer coded MS5, was used to fabricate devices with a copper (II/I) electrolyte. Designed by main research author Marko Stojanovic, the dye was then used as a co-sensitizer with another well-known organic sensitizer known as XY1b. “The photo-sensitizer is at the heart of the operational mechanism of the device,” Stojanovic told pv magazine. Hence, reducing the costs and fabrication process of the dye facilitates the access and implementation of the DSSC technology, he added.

The co-sensitization method, according to the research team, offers the advantages of the high photo-voltage of MS5 and those of the wider spectral-response dye of the XY1b. “Apart from absorbing photons from the blue and yellow domain of the solar emission spectrum, the role of the new dye in this tandem is to boost the voltage output of the device by retarding the recombination of charge carriers generated by light,” the academics stated. “MS5 is a fully organic dye that I synthesized in a one pot-method, from its building blocks,” Stojanovic explained. “It presents several attractive features compared to the traditional Ru-based sensitizers, notably, the absence of rare-earth metal and its straightforward synthetic procedure.”
The co-sensitized MS5/XY1b solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 13.5% under standard AM1.5G sunlight conditions and remained stable for 1000 h under light soaking conditions and devices solely sensitized with MS5 showed an open-circuit voltage of 1.24 V, which the researchers said was a record value among copper-based DSCs.
“Our work constitutes an important breakthrough in the work of DSSCs and especially dye design,” said Grätzel, the director of EPFL's Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces. “It shows that high performances are achievable with a relatively simple dye, through judicious molecular engineering of the sensitizer's molecular structure.”
Compared to conventional p–n junction photovoltaic devices and other thin-film PV technologies, the Grätzel solar cells have much lower production costs. These PV devices, however, must still gain in efficiency, scalability and stability to get closer to mass industrial production. What makes them still attractive, after more than 30 years of research, is their good performance under low-light conditions, as well as their flexibility in terms of colors and appearance.

A China Power spokesperson told pv magazine solar made up around 15% of the company's power generation mix at the end of the year with the 4 GW of operational photovoltaics assets including the 500 MW Liaoning Chaoyang grid-parity project and a further 440 MW across three projects in Ningxia which will receive subsidies determined by competitive bidding.
The China Power representative said coal still dominated the generation portfolio of the utility, a subsidiary of the state-owned State Power Investment Corporation. Some 15 GW of coal-fired power plants amounted to around 56% of generation assets with hydro supplying around 20% (5.48 GW) helped by the acquisition of Wu Ling Power in 2009.
With 2.17 GW of wind farms making up around 8% of the portfolio, at least the 154 MW of natural gas facilities contributed less than 1% of the total.
The volume of “clean power” generation capacity added last year was less than 2% higher than that posted in 2019 but China Power sold 5% more “clean electricity”, year-on-year, with the 33.5 TWh concerned driving a 4% rise in revenue in the segment. The RMB10.7 billion (US$1.64 billion) banked as a result added up to 38% of the cash generated by total electricity sales.
Though there were few concrete commitments to new, non-gas clean power facilities this year, chairman and executive director Tian Jun said: “We will be committed to establishing a clean energy company.”

The single-phase, 230 V device is available in six power classes, ranging from 3 kW to 6 kW and has a DC input voltage range of 65 V to 600 V.
The inverter measures 474x530x165mm and weighs between 15.4 and 19 kg. It offers a reported efficiency of 97.6% and a European efficiency of 96.8%, for the smallest device, and 97.1% for the biggest.
The product comes with two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs while its MPPT range is 65-530 V. Its maximum input current (DC) spans from 22 A to 12 A and the maximum short circuit current from 33 A to 18 A. It is equipped with IP66 protection, regulated air cooling, and can be used in projects at altitudes of up to 4,000m and with temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius.
“The Primo has countless open interfaces for linking together the energy, storage, mobility, heating and cooling sectors,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “We’ve packed it full of future-proof technology to make it possible to get the most out of the photovoltaic system over the decades.”
The inverter has another feature, called PV Point, which Fronius describes as a backup power socket providing backup power supply without the need for a battery. “This can be used to operate vital loads such as laptops, smartphones or small freezers,” the company explained.
The device is compatible with the residential battery Battery-Box Premium HVS/HVM, from Chinese manufacturer BYD. The BYD Battery-Box Premium Line is available in small, HVS, and large, HVM versions. Their capacities range from 5.1 kWh to 10.2 kWh (HVS) and 8.3-22.1 kWh (HVM). The lithium iron phosphate system is modular and can be expanded in 2.6 kWh stages for the HVS version, and in 2.8 kWh phases for the HVM product.
“Parallel operation of the modular BYD Battery-Box Premium HVS/HVM in combination with the Primo GEN24 Plus enables a storage capacity of up to 57.96 kWh,” Fronius stated. “This makes it possible to create storage solutions for commercial applications, intelligent charging solutions for electric vehicle fleets or a profitable and sustainable alternative to diesel-powered emergency generators.”

According to a group of researchers from the University of California Santa Cruz, in the United States, these projects may be easily developed in the U.S. and, in particular, in California, which has the world’s largest water conveyance system, and is constantly threatened by droughts. They warned, however, that achieving a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) closer to that of ground-mounted solar will be crucial for their feasibility.
In the paper Energy and water co-benefits from covering canals with solar panels, published in Nature sustainability, the scientists conducted regional hydrologic and techno-economic simulations to assess if California’s 6,350km canal network may be suitable for the installation of similar solar arrays. “In our main results we considered cadmium telluride (CdTe) semiconductor technology but in the sensitivity analysis, we also considered multicrystalline silicon,” they specified.
The research group applied three different methods to assess potential water evaporation: A modified version of the Penman-Monteith equation, which requires data on temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation; pan evaporation, which is a measurement tool considering temperature, humidity, rainfall, drought dispersion, solar radiation, and wind; and the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS), which helps agricultural producers and growers efficiently manage water resources.
Three different PV plant configurations were analyzed for eight different sites across the California network of canals: A common, ground-mounted solar plant located on land adjacent to canals; a steel-truss canal-spanning design already used in several projects in India; and a suspension-cable canal-spanning design that was also utilized in India.
The academics calculated the net present value (NPV) of the three plant typologies, considering revenues, upfront costs, installation, permitting and land, and found that plants built with tensioned cables may have a higher NPV than a ground-mounted facility, as their additional costs can be easily offset if water conservation, enhanced electricity production, avoided land costs, and reduced aquatic weed maintenance are achieved.
Plants built with a steel truss had a lower NPV than ground-mounted arrays, due to the high cost of the truss. “Although the truss, over-canal system generally has the lowest NPV, at the site with the highest water costs the steel-truss system has a higher NPV than the overground system,” the scientists explained. “The net present value of over-canal solar exceeds conventional overground solar by 20-50%, challenging the convention of leaving canals uncovered and calling into question our understanding of the most economic locations for solar power.”
The analysis also showed that there is not a big difference between the three project types, in terms of LCOE. “This is because in the case of the over-canal designs, the increases in the annual costs were proportional to the increases in annual energy output, due to evaporative cooling,” the paper reads.
Looking forward, the U.S. group said off-grid, or ‘distributed generation,' projects should be considered for initial field experiments or pilot projects. Furthermore, criteria such as proximity to the grid or land availability in a given area should also be included in future analysis.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/23/a-banner-year-for-us-solar/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 23, 2021",A banner year for US solar,"From pv magazine 03/2021
IHS Markit forecasts that the United States will install more than 20 GW of utility-scale PV installations in 2021, making it another banner year for solar. Notably, the utility-scale segment already has over 11 GW (DC) of projects under construction. Other contributing factors to the growth of solar this year are the transition of coal states to renewables generation in the near-term; states like Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky allhave large PV pipelines in 2021 through 2025. Moreover, continued corporate procurement for PV generation and aggressive net zero goals by large utilities across the country will ensure the maintenance of growth for solar over the next five years.
ITC extension
On Dec. 21, 2020, both houses of Congress passed a large Covid-19 and funding bill that included a two-year extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a one-year extension on wind production tax credits (PTC), and funding for energy research and development programs, among other provisions. The extension of the ITC will likely reshuffle the demand for PV projects from 2022 through 2025 as investors seek to capture the ITC 26 and safe harbor provisions at a price point that is beneficial to their returns. Allowing two additional years for the 26% credit will improve the economics of solar overall, as the credit will now be coupled with a smaller tariff for solar cells and modules (assuming the tariff is not extended).
For the residential market, homeowners across the country had been rushing to secure the ITC 26 by installing solar in their homes in 2020, despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the residential segment is more sensitive to tax credits than the non-residential segments. The extension will drive an immediate spike in demand, followed by declines that are correlated to the ITC step-down.
The two-year solar tax credit extension is expected to spur more demand for residential and commercial solar systems in several emerging markets. This means that 2021 will be an important year for residential installers, but consumer demand from 2022 onwards will taper off, as mature markets reach saturation and net metering and distributed solar programs continue to be challenged and modified across the United States.
New markets
In 2021, the Midwestern and Southern United States will be responsible for 60% of PV installations in the country. States like Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, Florida, and Texas will contribute to a large portion of installation volumes in these regions. Demand for PV in the Midwest is forecast to be primarily driven by the utility-scale solar market, as utilities seek to comply with varying levels of renewable energy and emissions reduction goals.
Similarly, in the Southeast, large utilities such as Duke Energy, Georgia Power, Dominion Energy, and Florida Power & Light are driving demand for utility-scale solar through cost competitive, voluntary procurement mechanisms. These utilities, among others, have set aggressive net-zero renewable energy generation targets that will require solar PV procurement in the near future. Moreover, utility partnerships with large corporations are driving further demand for utility-scale solar projects.
In the Southwest, IHS Markit forecasts that the utility-scale PV segment will drive demand, with most of the installations attributed to massive PV growth that is expected to continue in Texas through 2025. Although utility-scale installations will dominate the market in Texas, the residential segment also gained momentum in 2020 and will sustain similar levels in the short-term, as consumers take advantage of the extended ITC and utility incentives like rebate programs.
Green goals
Historically, the residential and commercial PV segments have driven most of the demand in the Northeast and will continue to do so. However, due to New York’s aggressive utility-scale goals, the large-scale segment will account for more than half of PV demand in the region. Recently, the state announced 23 utility-scale projects that have a combined capacity of 2.2 GW. Additionally, the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) has approved construction of a 55-mile transmission line that aims to enhance reliability and speed the flow of energy from upstate NY to the lower parts of the state.
New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Maryland will also help drive most of the PV growth in the Northeastern United States in 2021. Lawmakers across the region have put forth policies that could help PV growth, though some have been more successful than others. Earlier this year, Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts vetoed legislation that required the state to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. More recently, Governor Baker has suggested amendments to the bill and is awaiting a response from the state legislature.
PV policy
IHS Markit forecasts that installations of energy storage projects in the United States will account for more than 5 GW of capacity in 2021. The extension of the ITC will likely improve the economics of solar+storage systems and enable energy storage projects to be co-located with PV to benefit from a reduced tax burden through 2025.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)’s Order 2222, which was passed in 2020, opens wholesale markets to behind-the-meter energy storage. But it may take longer than expected for this ruling to become a strong market driver. Order 2222 aims to allow distributed energy resources (DERs) to participate in wholesale power markets by bundling together as a single bidding entity. Recently, regional transmission organizations, and other stakeholders, have requested an extension to the order, citing too short of a timeline to implement the ruling.
While the United States will continue to extend its dominance in the storage market, incentives for storage are still lacking in the country, with a standalone storage tax credit not easily guaranteed, as Democrats only control the Senate by a small margin. In the near term, the most consequential federal policies benefiting the energy storage industry will likely be in the form of executive actions.

Only a few years ago, showing up prepared for a potential client involved Google Earth, a ruler, and an inkjet printer. This took time, and the numbers were always rough.
In a sales environment where only one in 10 viable projects moves forward, getting from a good idea to a hard yes or no from a customer needs to happen fast.
So, let’s imagine ourselves as solar developers under pressure and tasked with creating a design for a client proposal in only one minute. The 60-second race is on!
My firm started using Helioscope around 2014 to do quick commercial solar system layouts. Once a rooftop has been targeted, we can design a project – if we were in a race – in less than a minute. At the end of that minute, we’ll know the potential electricity generation, and how many solar panels fit on the site.
(And for the residential market, Aurora Solar has amazing features for the smaller, tighter, tree-surrounded rooftops on our homes.)
Once logged into Helioscope, the only button that matters is the big orange one labeled New Project. Clicking it launches a window that asks for a project name, address, and hardware profile.
Click the New Project button in Helioscope. Time needed to complete action: 3 seconds
Our hardware profile — which we’ve already configured to specify the main components and techniques our company deploys in construction — is chosen by default. Some of the key components include solar panels, racking, and inverters, and site-specific information such as angle of panels, and required setbacks.

After entering our information, we click Create New Project. Time needed to complete action: 10 seconds.
Now we’ve arrived at the project’s custom site page within Helioscope. New designs, unique site conditions, shading, and the final design deliverables can be navigated to using this page. Our quick layout challenge takes us first to the New button, then the Create New Design field.
That’s when we get to the array design page, which is where the tool’s real beauty lies. With this page, the team at Helioscope has given the solar system sales person the ability to customize and fine-tune design on the fly, without using engineering resources.
Time needed to complete action: 20 seconds
This account has a carport profile in place (which we selected while setting up this new solar layout), so Helioscope “designs” the solar system for us. The design includes a fairly accurate conversion of Google Earth imagery dimensions into solar panel sizes, angles, and shadows.
This happens as easily as you can connect dots with a mouse. (Seriously, folks, this is magic.)
The software also chooses an inverter to connect to the panels. If you’re lucky, your solar system’s size will be a perfect fit for the default profile’s solar inverter. If not, you’ll need to find a unit that matches the output.

Time needed to complete action: 0-10 seconds
At this point, we have a nascent design of a solar power system that includes total number of solar panels, angle and azimuth of the solar system, and inverters and rough wiring.
From here, press the large “Save & Exit” button near the top of the page. Then move to the “Reports” button and click “Simulate.”

Time needed to complete action: 10 to 30 seconds
You’ve now set in motion the final action to have a technical solar power deliverable, more than enough for a first conversation with a customer.
Helioscope produces a clean, shareable diagram of the solar array, overlaying the site’s Google Earth image. The deliverable calculates the number of solar panels and inverters and provides their model numbers.
Also calculated are multiple levels of electricity generation data: monthly and first-year totals, as well the various points in the generation process where energy losses occur. These electricity loss data fields represent our final quality check before we hand the document to the customer.

First-year electricity generation along with the system’s total solar panel wattage is required to create a financial model. That model, along with the Helioscope proposal, are typically the only documents a developer needs to provide a client in the early stages of a project.
What’s more, having the opportunity to share your screen and refine the design based on the prospective customer’s input is a real added value that enhances your business reputation and just may seal the deal.
Total elapsed time for our simulated race? As little as 43 seconds.

Renewable energy developer UPC\AC Renewables Australia confirmed work has commenced on the first stage of its massive $768 million hybrid solar and battery project in New South Wales' New England region.
UPC\AC Renewables CEO Anton Rohner said work has already started on stage one of the 720 MW solar farm which will be coupled with a 400 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS).
“It is exciting to reach this milestone,” he said. “UPC\AC Renewables Australia first walked these lands with the farmers three-and-a-half years ago and today we’re starting construction on one of the southern hemisphere’s largest solar farms.”
The New England Solar Farm will comprise more than 2.4 million solar panels, 150 power conversion units, and a lithium-ion battery storage facility. It will connect to TransGrid’s existing 330 kV transmission line that crosses the 3,362-hectare development site.
The solar farm will be installed in two stages. Stage one includes a 400 MW solar farm comprising about 980,000 PV modules mounted onto a horizontal single-axis tracking system.
The first stage will also include 50 MWh of integrated battery storage and a 33/330kV substation.
The first stage is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2023 with the company hopeful it will be able to commence construction on the second stage prior to then.
Once fully operational, the facility is expected to produce 1,800 GWh of electricity annually, enough to power more than 250,000 homes.
“Once fully complete, the solar farm and battery project will be Australia’s largest hybrid solar and battery energy storage facility. It will play an important role in the energy transition already underway across the country,” Rohner said.
“The local community, our project landowners and civic leaders have been very supportive of the project over the past three years. We’re extremely excited to see construction start and the opportunities that are being returned and created for local business and workers.”
The project will help build out the New England REZ, one of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW Government’s electricity “road map“, which is designed to support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
Elecnor Australia has been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the first stage of the project. The Spanish-owned renewable energy group will perform the job through its Green Light Contractors subsidiary.
Elecnor will also be responsible for operation and maintenance in the two years following start-up.
Initial works will include upgrades for the local road network connecting to the New England Solar Farm site.
UPC\AC Australia, a joint venture between UPC Renewables and AC Energy, a subsidiary of Ayala Corporation in the Philippines, said up to 700 jobs are expected to be created from the solar farm and battery project during peak construction.
