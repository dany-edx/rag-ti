Building on its previous investments in both grid scale batteries and system security, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) will now allocate AU$100 million ($73 million) to further investigate grid-forming inverters that can enable utility-scale batteries to provide system stability services traditionally provided by synchronous generation, such as coal or gas.
Named the Large-Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, the new ARENA program will provide funding to grid-scale batteries of 70MW or larger operating operating in the National Electricity Market or Western Australia’s Wholesale Electricity Market. In addition to supporting new build projects, funding will also be available to existing grid scale batteries seeking to retrofit advanced inverter capability or expand an existing or committed battery by constructing a new adjacent project, and incorporating advanced inverter functionality across both the existing and new assets.
It is expected that the funding round will support at least three projects, with a maximum grant available of AUD35 million per project. Applications will be open to all battery energy storage technologies, provided that they are equipped with advanced inverters, ARENA stated.
Demonstration at scale
The funding round aims to incentivize and derisk private sector investment and overcome barriers to the deployment of advanced inverter technology. By funding advanced inverter technology at scale, ARENA hopes to provide valuable insights into the operations and emerging capabilities of advanced inverters.
“Grid scale batteries and other types of energy storage technology will be vital to support our future electricity system powered by renewables,” ARENA CEO Darren Miller said. “This funding round will demonstrate the role of advanced inverters in grid scale batteries to provide system stability, facilitating a more efficient transition and accelerate the uptake of renewable generation.”
Unlike traditional, grid-following inverters which sync their output to the grid’s voltage waveforms, advanced or grid-forming inverters can set their own frequencies without the inertia generated by large spinning pieces of hardware. This makes them capable of providing the grid with virtual inertia replacing the mechanical inertia traditionally provided by synchronous generators while reducing the current curtailment of solar PV and wind generation.
ARENA's funding initiative follows the release of the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Application of Advanced Grid-scale Inverters in the NEM report, which highlights the great potential of this technology. The report identifies four key areas of application for advanced inverters – including connecting inverter-based resources in weak grids, supporting system security, island operation, and system restart.
In line with the findings, the paper set out clear recommendations for immediate action to capture the opportunities of advanced inverters, including enabling capabilities on new grid-scale batteries.
“Further funding and support is needed to assist as many new grid-scale battery deployments as possible to incorporate grid-forming capabilities, to build a fleet that can support the transition to high IBR penetration by 2025,” AEMO said.
Another recent study by Powerlink Queensland found that batteries with advanced inverters can play a valuable role in maintaining system strength, supplementing the use of synchronous condensers. The study has showed that grid forming batteries can play a constructive role enabling renewables and supporting the operation of the power system. It found that a 100MW battery can support the connection of 300MW of inverter based generation, specific to the particular case examined.
Growing fleet
Presently, Australia’s largest grid-connected battery using advanced inverter technology is another ARENA funded project – the 30MW/8MWh the Dalrymple ESCRI battery situated on South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula. But, this will be soon overshadowed by the 150MW/193.5MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve, aka the Tesla Big Battery, also in South Australia, once it completes its upgrades to advanced inverters.
Earlier this year, Australian utility AGL broke ground on the 250MW/250MWh Torrens Island battery, touted as the largest planned grid-forming battery in the world. The system will initially start out with a one-hour duration (250MWh) but will be capable of expanding to up to four-hour duration in the future (1000MWh). The Torrens Island battery will be delivered by Finnish technology company Wartsila, use over 100 inverters with grid-forming capabilities supplied from German-headquartered company SMA.
In ARENA's latest funding round, expressions of interest will open in February, with a due date of March 31. Selected projects will be invited to submit a full application later in the year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/30/cpia-pushes-back-against-us-ban-on-solar-imports-from-xinjiang/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 30, 2021",CPIA pushes back against US ban on solar imports from Xinjiang,"China’s solar industry has condemned the adoption of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, calling it slander designed to help American companies compete in the booming sector. The China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) argued there is no evidence of any forced labor in the region, which is home to about 50% of the world’s polysilicon production.
In early 2021, leading European and U.S. PV trade associations and analysts began speaking out against accusations of human rights in China’s Xinjiang province. In particularly, accusations that some solar products and materials were being produced using slave labor.  The region has been under scrutiny for its alleged human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities.
Just days before Christmas, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. If enacted, the law would ban all imports from China's Xinjiang region, unless it can be proven that products were not connected to forced labor.
The CPIA said in a statement that it strongly opposes the new legislation, which, it believes disregards the truth, violates international law, and damages the overall interest of China. It argued solar businesses in the Xinjiang region strictly follow international standards, while employment in the region is voluntary and fairly compensated.
Due to difficulties in either gathering evidence of fair labor practices and verified certificates of origin for some PV modules and materials, some  European and U.S. solar companies may opt to source materials, and polysilicon in particular, from non-Xinjiang regions in anticipation of import bans.
As discussed in pv magazine’s UP Initiative on solar workers rights earlier this year, solar manufacturers will need to respond to looming sanctions and rigorous supply-chain tracing requirements by increasing transparency, where feasible.
The potential impact of the sanctions on polysilicon from Xinjiang has been discussed at length this year. According to BloombergNEF, such measures might increase the profitability of companies like thin film producer First Solar, which does not use polysilicon, and of polysilicon producers with capacity outside Xinjiang – but the measures would be unlikely to have a much wider impact on solar industry growth.
“Solar manufacturers have over and over again proven themselves flexible and willing to adapt supply chains to trade legislation, for a small price,” Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF, wrote in pv magazine earlier this year.

In announcing the commencement of 1GW of solar and wind projects in Inner Mongolia today, the Beijing Jingneng Clean Energy Co. noted that by co-locating assets, it plans to “reduce the waste of wind and solar power resources.”
The 1GW of projects include a 500MW combined solar and wind facility at Abag Banner Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia. The project, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023 will be coupled with hydrogen electrolysis.
The second renewable project Beijing Jingneng announced today is a 500MW wind project at Sonid Left Banner Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia. It will be coupled with 75MW/150MWh of battery energy storage.
The company reports that all investment decisions have been taken and that the projects have received the required approvals and permits.
Beijing Jingneng claimed to have installed over 8GW of renewables and gas generation capacity Beijing, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningxia and Sichuan Provinces as of mid-2018. It claims to be the largest wind power operator in China.

Indeed, it has been calculated that buildings account for 32% of energy use and 19% of energy-related greenhouse gases in the form of heating, cooling, lighting, appliances, and machinery.
In addition to the predicted billions of square meters of space that will be built across the world over the next decade, most developments standing today will still be around in 2050. Thus, retrofitting existing structures is seen as a key sustainability target.
Urban solar: Solar and energy storage have a fundamental role to play, particularly when it comes to cooling and heating and, due to their increasingly small costs, for low-income households struggling with high energy bills.
Under one roof: pv magazine looks at the progress being made to green the world’s cities. This article focuses on Europe’s solar plans and current achievements, specifically in heating and cooling, rooftop solar, and building-integrated PV.
Independent action: The city of Ithaca, New York – located 180 miles from Manhattan – has adopted a Green New Deal, in line with its aims to offset all carbon emissions by 2030. It is implementing private equity programs and net-zero building mandates to get there. Ryan Kennedy reports.
Powerful equation to expand C&I: Big rooftop PV systems on factories, warehouses, and public buildings need not be limited by ownership issues nor local grid capacity claims Australian innovator EleXsys Energy. The company is maxing out an Ikea in Adelaide, Australia, with solar and storage. And it claims its smart technology can allow the same to be done elsewhere.
Prioritizing electrification: The urgency to decarbonize the building sector has caught global attention in the lead-up to the COP26 summit, commencing on Oct. 31. Wood Mackenzie’s Ben Hertz-Shargel says that success will require a two-pronged strategy of massively electrifying building heat over the coming decade, while also investing in technologies that can pick up future heating demand if the grid cannot handle it.
Up to code for decarbonization: The International Energy Agency predicts that India will record the world’s fastest growth in energy consumption from buildings through 2040. The energy demand could create a big market for solar installers and equipment providers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector. While building codes now include provisions for renewable energy integration, effective implementation will be key to ensuring compliance, reports Uma Gupta.
Building a new policy environment: Since the beginning of 2021, all new buildings constructed in the European Union must be “nearly” zero energy. This is a complex task requiring synergies among various stakeholders and technologies. Ilias Tsagas provides insight into the drivers and challenges toward this set goal and shines a light on solar’s most significant role.
Electrons to replace molecules in US homes: Policy developments are likely to define decarbonization efforts and rooftop solar deployment in U.S. homes. Proposed legislation at the federal level is looking to accelerate electrification, while net metering developments continue at the state level. pv magazine USA’s Ryan Kennedy provides an update.
BIPV no refuge: Deployment in the building-integrated PV segment is accelerating, and so too are the number of solar products available to architects and developers. And while BIPV had long been the segment in which an array of thin-film technologies could shine, they are now in increasingly stiff competition with crystalline silicon rivals.
Headroom on heat pumps: Heat pumps can now achieve sufficiently high flow temperatures to operate most heating systems, even in older buildings. They are not yet highly efficient, but new refrigerants are expected to provide a remedy. This presents a number of challenges, but German researchers and industry participants are working on solutions to harness the power of heat pumps to keep people warm throughout the year.
Check out the coverage from our UP Initiative Q1 theme: Agri-PV from Dec. 27, Q2 theme: Workers’ rights on Dec. 28, and Q3 theme: Sustainable electricity and corporates’ critical solar role on Dec. 20.
In Q1 2022, we will turn our attention to the rise of e-mobility and how it can complement the renewable energy transition. Specifically, we will examine the role electric vehicles, trains, and two- and three-wheelers can play in greening the electricity grid.
About the UP Initiative
In 2019, pv magazine pledged to place the issue of sustainability in the solar and energy storage industries at the heart of our reporting and events via the UP initiative. In addition to running quarterly themes, which examine key issues, we are also holding webinars on topics like supply chain transparency; publishing whitepapers on issues like green finance, and have ramped up our general reporting on a host of other sustainability issues. Our global series of roundtable events have also helped the initiative step UP even further.

Frank Haugwitz, founder, AECEA: Conditions have changed. Module prices are at a high. Right now, you pay CNY 2.10 ($0.33) to CNY 2.20 per watt, so that has prompted developers or investors to either postpone, shift demand into next year, or just kick off the project with a small phase this year and the larger bulk of the project to be executed next year. At the same time, given this high-price environment we are in right now, some of these manufacturers have started to reconsider their expansion plans. Because at some point, they ask the question, “does it really make sense to keep on building up more production capacities if we cannot pass all these high-price modules to the end users?”
Because the demand has shifted to next year, I don’t see this overcapacity situation as severe as three, four months ago. It has softened. Of course, oversupply conditions will remain in place. I mean, it has always been an oversupply situation, anyway.
Right now, the price of polysilicon is about CNY 276/kg. It could be that by the end of next year, provided all projects will execute as planned, China could be home to around about 1 million plus tons of nominal annual polysilicon production capacities. The actual output, given the ramp-up of new production capacity, will not reach this level until 2023. By the end of next year maybe the actual output could be between 700,000 and 750,000 tons, which is indeed an increase. But nevertheless, this will pretty much become available in the latter half of next year.
We may witness a steady, soft price decline. So possibly by the second half of next year or early second half next year, falling to around about CNY 170 per kilogram. That would already be quite a drop by about CNY 100, but compared to CNY 56 in 2020, it’s more than double.
Whether that will translate into a significant reduction of module prices remains to be seen, because of China’s dual carbon policy, power restrictions, and how the pricing of PV components and other materials develops.
These kinds of power restrictions are expected to be in place for the foreseeable future. As of now, let’s say the broad consensus is until the end of this year or after the winter period. So, it is basically from April onwards. From the second quarter next year onwards, we are back to normal.
If I put myself into the shoes of the Chinese government and I ask, what do I want? I would like to have a lasting change of my energy mix, so I’m not turning off the switch and then turning it on again. Otherwise, we would have an annual exercise like this. In the long run, Beijing does not want to have these kinds of situations recurring every year. This can’t be. So that’s why the significant and lasting change ahead will be the introduction of so-called time-of-use electricity tariffs.
This year the distributed generation segment, consisting of residential PV and C&I, is outperforming. Time-of-use tariffs means that at a given time throughout the day you pay a certain tariff, including C&I incentives, which used to be subject to a fixed tariff – now no more. In almost all provinces, C&I tariffs are no longer set in stone. They too are subject to this time-of-use scheme and are subject to market demand and supply and other drivers. It is one more driver, why C&I solar will become much more popular: It helps me as a manufacturer to reduce my own factory carbon footprint.
At some point you drill down to the company level in each separate province. Thus far we’ve talked about provincial-wide decarbonization targets. But now we drill deeper and deeper. At some point we will be on a factory level. At that level, the factory owner will be asked how to conserve energy, how to save energy, how to reduce carbon footprint, etcetera.
So, you have this kind of policy switch with this introduction of time-of-use electricity tariffs, that will bring a lasting change in both the consumption and generation of electricity.
As a commercial or industrial user, if you have your own rooftop system, maybe combined with storage, you can schedule your production according to a schedule you determine and not be resigned to the following: “All right. Now I have power from midnight until eight o’clock in the morning.” Often you will be informed at very short notice. I learned that sometimes you have only an hour or two lead time.
It is cheaper with this kind of time-of-use electric tariff and the so-called “floating tariff.” Basically, now you have a fixed tariff and a certain percentage of the tariff can float according to demand and supply. It can go up to 20% and sometimes these time-of-use differences between early morning and peak hours are up to CNY 1 and more. That is a lot.
Solar PV is very competitive – that will drive some of the demand for distributed generation. But as well, it brings in the longer term a change of the overall, let’s say, consumption habits.
In the first nine months of this year residential PV installations grew by about 120% year on year. In the first three quarters of this year, already about 11.6 GW of residential PV systems were installed. So, 120% plus, and the C&I segment is still lagging behind. It’s around about 5 GW so far this year, so almost equal to the entire C&I installation in 2020.
Distributed overall, we’ll see that there was massive demand because in August as the NEA basically approved a new nationwide distributed generation PV pilot program. Accordingly, counties shall make sure 50% of government buildings accommodate rooftop PV systems, 40% of public buildings, 30% of commercial buildings, and 20% of residential buildings in semi-rural areas. As of today, out of a total of 2,851 counties, over 670 of them have been approved by the NEA. And if you assume about 200 MW to 250 MW per county, that makes around 130 GW to 170 GW of additional demand between now and the end of 2023.
If you talk about large-scale utility ground-mounted systems in, let’s say eastern and central provinces, there is a significant land constraint. The province of Shandong recently released a notice saying no new ground mounted systems shall be registered and approved until further notice. They will look into each and every ground-mounted project installed since June 2018 to investigate the status quo and verify if everything is in compliance and the positive and negative impacts.
But what is on top of all this is that they want to make sure no more agricultural land would be covered by solar PV plants. So you have a conflict with land needed for securing food supply. Is it more important than generating green electricity? Shandong is the No. 1 province in terms of installations. They have installed about 26 GW of PV, around 10% of China’s cumulative total, which is not a small number.
Yunnan also just released a notice regarding the protection of grasslands and forests. Inner Mongolia early this year released a plan to save 52% of the Inner Mongolian territory. It’s a no-go area for future PV system development in order to protect the grasslands in this case. So you have two issues: environmental protection and making sure in the long run you can guarantee food supply. That’s why distributed generation can only increase in terms of importance in the future.
For this year, I expect residential installations to grow to about 16 GW, from 10 GW last year. For the C&I segment I expect around 6-7 GW, from 5.4 GW last year.
Definitely for the remaining years of the 14th Five-Year Plan the share of the distributed segment in the overall PV build will increase.
