The Cambridge-based company called it “a world first,” adding National Grid was recently announced as its first major customer. “Loop hydrogen has a typical levelized cost of hydrogen of around £2.27/kg (€2.71), based on a large-scale Loop installation and using the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy’s assumptions for calculation,” Levidian CEO John Hartley told pv magazine. “This does not, however, take into account the value of the graphene produced during the production of the hydrogen. The value of the graphene will, in many cases, completely offset the cost of the hydrogen.” The company is working with National Grid’s UK Hydrogen team on the categorization of hydrogen by color and is discussing the issue with the UK government. “Blue hydrogen is typically produced using steam methane reformation with carbon capture, meaning the carbon has to be buried or injected into underground storage,” the company told pv magazine. “Loop, on the other hand, uses a proprietary methane plasma technique that requires no added heat, catalysts, or other additives.” Levidian said that an increase in natural gas prices does affect its production costs, as methane reportedly accounts for approximately 20% of them. “The value in the two products produced by Loop – clean hydrogen and green graphene – are significant,” added the company. “In many cases, our customers are industrial energy consumers who have no viable option except for natural gas. Loop allows them to not only decarbonize that fuel but also to produce graphene that can be resold.”
UK-based Source Energie and green hydrogen company ERM Dolphyn plan to use Celtic Sea floating wind power sites to produce green hydrogen rather than generate electricity. “The first site under development is called Dylan,” wrote ERM Dolphyn last week. “It has a target deployment date of 2027-28 and is located approximately 60km off the Pembrokeshire coast, west of Milford Haven … Both parties agree that the location is ideal as it offers good energy generating conditions (more than 10m/s average wind speeds) [and] strong expansion potential, and has a number of viable low impact pipeline routes to areas of existing and growing hydrogen demand.” The company added, future expansion of the sites could generate more than 2GW of energy.
The British government has announced £200 million (€239 million) for 1,000 green buses, including electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. The government on Saturday stated a dozen areas in England, “from Greater Manchester to Portsmouth, will receive grants from the multi-million pound package to deliver electric or hydrogen powered buses as well as charging or fueling infrastructure, to their region.”
Germany is also working on its hydrogen plans with officials meeting their US counterparts in Berlin this week. The meetings will include industry executives discussing LNG and hydrogen supply options. During the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue, German foreign minister Annalena  Baerbock said the country has to phase out Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible. 
The country is also working on domestic production. The City of Hamburg, for instance, has announced completion of a feasibility study on the conversion of the Moorburg hard-coal fired power plant to electrolysis for green hydrogen production. “The study concludes that electrolysis for the production of green hydrogen at the Moorburg site, with a capacity of up to 500MW, is economically and technically feasible. Parts of the existing power plant infrastructure offer excellent conditions for the realization of an electrolyzer. This can be built in parallel with a partial [thermal] power plant dismantling and [could be] subsequently expanded. The time line possible under the important projects of common European interest (IPCEI) funding procedure, with commissioning of the plant by 2026, is considered realistic,” the city wrote last week. It also noted, a biomass co-generation plant, a gas and steam power plant, or a high-temperature storage facility were not considered reasonable. 
H2 Mobility Deutschland has secured €110 million after Hy24 announced a €70 million investment today. Industrial shareholders Air Liquide, Daimler Truck, Hyundai, Linde, OMV, Shell, and TotalEnergies will collectively contribute a further €40 million. The cash will enable H2 Mobility Deutschland to upgrade its refueling station network and build new hydrogen stations to meet demand from commercial vehicles and vehicles which are in intensive use. H2 Mobility Deutschland, which runs more than 90 hydrogen refueling stations, wants 300 by 2030. The €70 million investment “is being made by Hy24 through the Clean H2 Infra Fund, the world's largest hydrogen fund to date,” the project stated.
Carburos Metálicos, part of the Air Products Group, has successfully concluded its participation in the test circulation and refueling of the first hydrogen bus in Galicia. The test took place this month. “The Xunta de Galicia has expressed its future intention to integrate this zero-emission technology in its intercity public transport network in order to move towards its extensive implementation,” the company wrote last week. The vehicle, made by CaetanoBus, has traveled around 200km per day between the airport of A Coruña and the city center. “Another aspect that has been highlighted during this test is that refueling with H2 [hydrogen] is as simple and fast as with any other fuel, which facilitates its intensive use,” the company added.
The EU’s joint Research and Innovation Initiative on Green Hydrogen has presented its research and innovation strategic agenda. The project, coordinated by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, provides the basis for “concrete steps towards implementation at a hybrid conference on 16 and 17 May,” the ministry wrote this month.
Toyota will enter Japanese motorsport the Super Taikyu Series 2022 with three vehicles equipped with powertrains that use different fuels, including a hydrogen engine-equipped Corolla. “In the … six months between the first round, in May of last year, and the final round in November, engine performance was improved to levels comparable to gasoline engines, with a 24% increase in power output and 33% increase in torque, along with successful control over abnormal combustion,” Toyota wrote this month, of its hydrogen-powered vehicle. “However, improved cruising range and reduced hydrogen filling time for practical use are major issues that will be addressed throughout the year.”

The performance, which would be around six times better than the numbers posted for the same stage of last year, offer further evidence of the Chinese, early-year solar rush which the National Energy Administration last week said amounted to 10.86GW of new generation capacity having been added in January and February alone.
Production output matched those impressive statistics with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology yesterday reporting the 110,000 tons of polysilicon manufactured in China in the last two months was still not sufficient to meet demand.
The nation's solar manufacturers produced at least 40GW of wafers – of which only 5.1GW were shipped for export; 39.5GW of cells, and at least 21.9GW of solar panels, according to the ministry.
Chinese inverter makers produced around 27GW of products in January and February, the government department reported.
Solar manufacturer Jinko has announced its first wind power project win, after securing 100MW of turbine generation capacity in Urumqi City, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Jinko in September signed a strategic co-operation agreement with state-owned wind company China Longyuan Power Group to develop at least 3GW of solar and wind power generation capacity over three years.
Solar developer Xinyi Energy will boost its coffers by issuing 188 million shares to two Chinese investors, the company said yesterday. Beijing-based financier Hillhouse, and the China International Capital Corp Ltd investment bank which is also based in the capital, will sign up for the shares for HK$4.14 (US$0.53) each to raise a net HK$780 million (US$99.6 million) for the developer.
This copy was amended on 30/03/22 to reflect the figure announced by Tongwei is its estimated first-quarter profit, not revenue, as was previously stated.

The Abu Dhabi-based international body launched the latest edition of its World Energy Transitions Outlook report at the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue event and director-general Francesco La Camera, writing the foreword, spelled out: “Progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate.”
The world will have to install 450GW of new solar capacity each year – most of it utility scale – for the rest of this decade, with China and India to lead Asia to a roughly half share of the world's installed PV capacity in 2030, the report's authors estimated.
Elsewhere, North America will need to install 90GW per year of solar to claim a 14% share of the world's operating panels at the end of the decade, and Europe's 19% slice of the pie will require 55GW of annual solar capacity additions.
European funding will also help North Africa make its contribution to the 70GW of annual solar capacity additions which will be required across the Middle East and Africa with European energy demand ensuring grid connections with North Africa flourish.
To have a hope of avoiding the worst effects of climate change, Latin America will need 20GW of new solar annually this decade and a further “more than 2GW” will be needed each year across the Oceania and Pacific region, the Irena report estimated.
Of course, it is not just solar that the world needs and, with the 348-page report calling for massive electrification and energy efficiency efforts, enabled by the full suite of clean energy sources, hydrogen, and biomass, we will have to start devoting $5.7 trillion per year to the energy transition for the rest of the decade, according to Irena.
That can be feasible if the $700 billion per year channeled into fossil fuels is immediately diverted to the transition, the publication stated. Public investment in the transition will have to immediately double, too, said Irena, to attract the remaining money needed from the private sector, which would bear most of the financial burden.
In return for the investment sought – including to ensure there are 147 million electric vehicles (EVs) per year hitting the roads in 2050, that $131 billion is invested annually in EV charging by that point, and that 350GW of green hydrogen electrolyzers are operating as early as 2030 – the world can anticipate a jobs dividend.
Irena has estimated the 12 million job losses it anticipates in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries will be comfortably outweighed by “close to” 85 million new energy-transition roles this decade, including 26.5 million in clean energy.
It is all a matter of political will, Irena pointed out, with policymakers also needing to usher in sufficient international grid connections and flexibility; training; utility scale batteries; electricity demand-side management; digital tools; peer-to-peer power trading; community ownership of renewables; time-of-use energy tariffs; and net billing systems.

“The facility makes efficient use of renewable power from the local grid,” a Siemens Energy spokesperson told pv magazine. “Solar PV is not the predominant source in Berlin and direct coupling of heat pumps with solar without storage is a challenge, as heat pumps are more economical the more operating hours they accumulate. However, solar in general is an opportunity the more it penetrates the grid as it provides ever more economic and green power to feed power to heat facilities. “
The Qwark3 project – named according to the German acronym for “coupling of district heating, power, and cooling” – should begin commercial operations by the end of this year. Vattenfall and Siemens signed the agreement to build the facility in March 2021.
The heat pump is expected to provide 8MW of thermal capacity to the district heating network and delivers forwarding temperatures of between 85 C and 120 C. The high-temperature heat pump from Siemens Energy can deliver heat to the district heating network as required, even under cold winter conditions.
“In the long run, district heating temperature levels will reduce for better efficiency,” the spokesperson said. “But until all the networks are converted, it will take decades for which high-temperature heat pumps are an important bridge technology to decarbonize heat. In parallel, more and more industry applications will demand decarbonized heat from high-temperature heat pumps.”
The cooling plant operated by Vattenfall at Potsdamer Platz is able to provide cooling and heating to about 12,000 offices, 1,000 housing units, and numerous cultural facilities.
“Putting a new high-temperature heat pump into operation, however, will provide a more environmentally friendly way of linking heating, cooling, and electricity in the future,” the two companies said in a joint statement in March 2021. “The new technology turns waste heat into a usable product, improving the energy-efficiency of the cooling power generation process while providing the urban district in Berlin with green heat from renewable electricity.”
The Siemens Energy spokesperson said that the cost of the heat pump is highly project-specific and depends a lot on economies of scale. “The power price is a major factor around the economics and the lower the power price, the better. If solar power helps reduce average power prices this has a positive effect on the application of heat pumps,” said the spokesperson.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/29/schuco-publishes-warning-due-to-potentially-defective-solar-module-backsheets/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 29, 2022",Schüco publishes warning due to potentially defective solar module backsheets,"From pv magazine Germany
In mid-2012, Schüco said it would discontinue the production of its thin film solar modules in Osterweddingen, Germany. Just under two years later, it sold its PV business to Viessmann.
Now in the spring of 2022, Schüco has had to publish a precautionary “product safety warning.” During the “active and passive product monitoring obligation” it has been determined that solar modules delivered between 2010 and 2012 may be affected by a technical fault, Schüco says. The fault is due to a polyamide backsheet, which could lead to defective solar modules.
“Since ensuring product safety is our top priority, we always take all necessary measures to ensure that neither a buyer nor an uninvolved third party comes to harm when using the products we manufacture,” reads the warning letter.
It continues, “Schüco has determined, as a result of field incidents, that a certain type of polyamide backsheet from a specific manufacturer can develop failure patterns that can result in cracks in the backsheet. As a result, the potential hazard resulting from the failure pattern depends on the material, location and type of installation, as well as other factors.”
Under certain external influences, a danger to life and limb because of electric shock cannot be ruled out, the manufacturer warns. Thus, parts of PV systems potentially affected by the fault should not be touched under any circumstances without protective measures.
So far, there have been no reports of damage, a spokesman told pv magazine. And Schüco naturally wants it to stay that way. The first thing it must do now is to find out how many of the solar modules with possibly defective backsheets are still installed in PV systems worldwide. These should be secured against unauthorized access and replaced in the event of a sustained reduction in performance, the spokesman continued.
PV system operators may locate affected solar modules by means of their serial numbers. Faulty modules will have a “0” in their 11th digit, Schüco said. In the warning, the company also provided further concrete instructions for action if faulty modules are detected.
Under no circumstances should the solar modules, plugs, wiring, or parts of the substructure be touched without protective measures against electric shock. Specialized personnel should be informed about the potential dangers. They should then uninstall the solar modules and dispose of them in accordance with legal requirements.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/29/skyfri-acquires-avi-solar-to-automate-solar-asset-management/,"SPONSORED,INDIA,NORWAY",,"MARCH 29, 2022",Skyfri acquires Avi Solar to automate solar asset management,"Skyfri, backed by leading climate investors SpeedInvest, Singularity, and Link Venture Capital, is one of the fastest-growing clean technology firms globally, accelerating growth through targeted acquisitions and deployment of technology to fully automate solar asset management.
“The acquisition of Avi Solar is part of a strategy to consolidate the O&M industry globally and automate most of the tasks that are manual today. Our ambition is to become the largest and most trusted technology platform for solar asset management worldwide. The plan is to streamline, automate and put a layer of quality on solar asset operations for asset owners. We do this through our proprietary technology, operational staff, domain expertise, and best practices from Europe,” says CEO of Skyfri, Pratik Ghoshal.
The Skyfri technology takes care of a solar asset (or portfolio of solar assets), from its very inception to the end of its asset lifecycle. This is done through the combination of firmware, software, and technology solutions that are OEM-agnostic and can be deployed on any solar asset regardless of size, installation, or location.
It identifies root causes of production downtime and energy losses in real-time, provides alarms to operational personnel instantly, consolidates former siloes such as billing, invoicing, contracting, maintenance management, and other asset management tasks into one cloud platform. This increases efficiency for clients.
“Taking care of solar assets is today mostly done in separate tasks, by separate companies. For example, billing and invoices are done by one software, while another does monitor, and reporting and a third company does the actual O&M onsite. Skyfri integrates all these verticals into one single source of truth, and one complete digital platform. The scalability of our technology makes it available for several clients, at a reasonable rate, so that everyone, regardless of size can optimize their production,” says CTO of Skyfri, Aslan Shamsutdin.
The acquisition will bring over 500MW of additional solar power plants for some of the largest and most reputed renewable asset investors and owners, such as KKR, Cleantech, Bosch, and Honda, onto the Skyfri platform, called Skyfri Intelligence.

Traditional landowners have granted compressed hydrogen shipmaker turn exporter Global Energy Ventures (GEV) permission to conduct onsite environmental and engineering studies, including solar monitoring on increased acreage, following a meeting held on Melville Island.
The studies will support the company’s referral submission to the territory’s Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), which will allow the project to formally move forward with its pre-feasibility work.
The Tiwi Islands project is targeting an annual green hydrogen production of 100,000 tonnes, which will be exported to the Asia-Pacific, with a particular focus on Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China. The project will use the company’s own fleet of hydrogen-powered and compressed hydrogen-carrying ships currently being developed.
The company is targeting an investment decision on the Tiwi project by the end of next year, 2023, with the first production in 2026.
GEV’s proposed project is located on the traditional lands of the Munupi people
Among the permissions granted is an increase in the land available to include in its referral submission. GEV now has scope to include solar generation based on ~2,580 hectares, or 25.8 square kilometers (km2), up from 1,800 hectares – adding almost a third of additional space.
It will also assess an additional 40 hectares adjacent to the existing Port Melville facilities for hydrogen production and compression, with a total of 72 hectares now under consideration near the port.
Connecting the solar farm to the hydrogen production facilities will be a new transmission line that is expected to follow an existing road to minimize environmental impacts. The company is now assessing ~120 hectares (1.2km2) of land for this transmission line.
The approvals from the Munupi Landowners and Tiwi Plantation Corporation Board will also allow GEV’s consultants to be onsite for environmental surveys, with further engineering surveys and studies to follow later in the year as part of the project’s pre-feasibility.
It has also been granted permission to begin solar monitoring in the September quarter for a period of 12 months, based on agreed sites for clearing and installation. Further meetings and permissions will be required at various stages for the project as and when future activities on Munupi land are required, the company said.
To advance the design of the solar farm and transmission line, GEV has hired CE Partners, about whom there is little information online. GEV said the Melbourne firm will be covering construction, operation, and generation modeling of both the solar farm and transmission line.
Alongside the onsite environmental and engineering surveys and solar monitoring, GEV and its consultants will begin detailed engineering and support the target of financial close by the second half of 2023.
On the nearer-term horizon, the company will lodge its submission referral to the territory’s EPA in the June quarter and expects its decision to follow in the September quarter.
The company will also pursue potential offtake agreements in the meantime, and will be participating in the Austrade’s Team Australia Stand at the World Hydrogen Summit, Rotterdam, in May.

The project subsidiary of polysilicon maker GCL-Poly sold off 2.9GW of solar generation capacity last year, to reduce its debt pile RMB11.2 billion ($1.76 billion). That left it with a project portfolio of 1,1051MW, the developer said yesterday, with a further 298MW marked for sale.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
The business, which sold off those swathes of solar projects to Chinese state-owned enterprizes, still made a loss, however, of RMB790 million ($124 million) for its shareholders. That was presented as a win compared to the RMB1.37 billion ($215 million) shed in 2020 and will come as no surprise after revenue fell from RMB5.02 billion ($788 million) to RMB2.85 billion ($447 million), year on year, including sales of electricity numbers which declined from RMB4.94 billion ($775 million), in 2020, to RMB2.69 billion ($422 million) last year.
In line with the asset-light definition, the value of GCL New Energy's non-current assets fell from RMB30.8 billion ($4.83 billion), in 2020, to RMB7.71 billion ($1.21 billion) and its current assets from RMB10.7 billion ($1.68 billion) to RMB7.42 billion ($1.16 billion), with RMB783 million ($123 million) worth marked for sale. While the company cash pile halved, from RMB1.14 billion ($179 million) to RMB586 million ($91.9 million), current liabilities did too, coming in from RMB23.5 billion ($3.69 billion), in 2020, to RMB3.64 billion ($571 million), and including a steepling fall in bank borrowings from RMB12.4 billion ($1.95 billion) to RMB1.08 billion ($169 million).
All that meant the net current liability value of RMB9.23 billion ($1.45 billion) posted in 2020 became a RMB4.56 billion ($715 million) asset last year. The company borrowings due this year also reduced, from RMB1.59 billion ($249 million) to RMB352 million ($55.2 million), year on year.
As to the future, aside from solar project operations and maintenance income – which rose to RMB79.6 million ($12.5 million) revenue last year, from RMB64.8 million ($10.2 million) a year earlier – and engineering, procurement and construction activity worth RMB70.3 million ($11 million), up from RMB23.7 million ($3.72 million), GCL New Energy remains keen to become a hydrogen project business.
Despite the collapse of a plan to take Ethiopian natural gas from connected business Poly-GCL Petroleum Investments Ltd, GCL New Energy said it is still exploring a procurement deal for the fuel as it stressed the importance of gas-fired “blue” hydrogen as a transitional source of the energy carrier, due the high costs of renewables-powered, green hydrogen. GCL has yet to explain the carbon capture and storage measures it will take to ensure any gas-fired hydrogen is blue, rather than the fossil-fuel rated “gray” version of the gas.
The company did at least mention an intent, further down the line, to provide “wind and solar-power-to-hydrogen, storage-integrated energy services.”

Solar PV reached new heights through 2021, with top line estimates pegging total global deployment at the inspiring milestone of 1TW of installed active capacity on the planet. In January 2022, the United States made its latest contribution by bringing 22 projects to commercial operation, adding 952MW of capacity.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its January Electric Power Monthly update. For the month, solar photovoltaics generated 8GWh, which represented 2% of total (utility scale) electricity generated for the month in the United States. Impressively, January’s generation increased nearly 40% year-over-year. When including estimates for small-scale solar, EIA reported the United States generated 11.17GWh of solar photovoltaic energy, up from 8.47GWh in the previous year, or a 33.5% increase.
The three largest projects added in January were Fort Powhatan Solar in Virginia, with a nameplate capacity of 150MW, followed by Searcy Solar in Arkansas with 100MW, and Assembly Solar III in Michigan, clocking in at 79MW nameplate capacity.
Renewable vs. sustainable
Renewable energy, including solar PV, solar thermal, wind, biomass, geothermal, and conventional hydroelectric power combined for a total generation of 79.29GWh.
A distinction should be made between “renewable” and “sustainable” energy. Johns Hopkins University describes renewable energy as something that comes from sources that naturally renew themselves to meet our energy needs. This can include such technologies as biomass, hydropower, etc. “Sustainable” energy is defined as energy that can support both the current generation as well as future generations. John Hopkins considers solar and wind as primary sources of sustainable energy.
While hydropower is the chief source of “renewable” energy on the planet and mitigates carbon emissions onset by fossil fuel generation, its sustainability has come under question. Hydropower does not directly pollute, but its facilities have large environmental impacts by changing the environment and affecting land use, homes, and natural habitats in the dam area.
The climate is posing risks to the generative capability of hydropower, too. Take Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona, for example. The dam, which has a capacity of 1.32GW and serves over 5 million customers, has reached alarming low levels of water caused by human activity and the most extreme drought in 1,200 years. Water levels are so low, that they threaten to fall below the intake for the turbines that generate energy for millions of Arizonans and five tribal communities.
Excluding hydropower, solar PV and wind led the way for sustainable energy, contributing a combined 46.2GWh. Currently, the hot topic in Texas is whether solar and wind can now replace coal. In the rapidly drying Western states that rely on a good deal of hydroelectric power, the conversation may turn to finding how much solar and wind energy is needed to replace the dams.
A year of challenges
Solar PV has reached new heights in the face of a year of challenges. In the residential and commercial sectors, major markets like California and Florida waged battles in an attempt to preserve net metering, a policy in which utilities pay solar customers for sending their excess solar generation to the grid. In Florida, a bill has been passed that will phase out net metering, and in California, the heavily-criticized net metering 3.0 bill has been delayed indefinitely.
At the utility-scale costs rose significantly in 2021, with SolRiver Capital managing partner Brandon Conard telling pv magazine that bifacial modules shipped-to-site costs rose from $0.28/W to $0.42/W from 2020 to late 2021. Conard said he expects price pressures to alleviate by the end of this year.
Conard said that legislation like the Biden administration’s Build Back Better Act would have gone a long way to spurring even higher record deployment numbers, but that has been shelved. In December, Senator Joe Manchin pulled out his must-have vote, and Republican Senators voted unanimously against the bill that was designed to prepare the United States for the climate and energy profile of the future.
Multiple anti-dumping and anti-circumvention cases are another hampering force on the industry. Though solar reached new heights in January, major solar developer SOLV Energy CEO George Hershman told pv magazine that “deployment is frozen.” Hershman said the uncertainty caused by these tariffs is simply too much to digest in a utility-scale solar project, where module prices can account for 50% of the cost or more. SOLV‘s projects can exceed $300 million, so a 50-250% tariff would impose between $75 -$375 million in additional costs. This level of risk is untenable and is why Hershman describes the case as “an affront to the solar industry.”
Despite all of these hurdles, the solar PV train keeps rolling. The White House calls for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030, at least half of which would be locally supplied clean energy meeting 24/7 demand. The nation has eight years to get there, and solar PV is positioned to be center-stage for the next decade of deployment.

“The system design has modeled on a residential building but it can also be used for other buildings if the load curves for electricity and heating are known,” researcher Stefan Krauter told pv magazine.”It can provide autonomy for electricity over the whole year.”
The decentralized energy system is designed to cover a household's main power demand via photovoltaics, even during winter, by including sufficient storage capacity.
“The aim is to minimize the grid load by achieving low or even zero grid interaction, which is realized by the use of decentralized long-term energy storage,” the scientists explained.
The system utilizes a 6.8kW PV array and a 5kW electrolyzer powered by surplus solar power to produce hydrogen, which is then stored in a hydrogen tank via a compressor. In periods of high energy demand, when PV generation is not sufficient, the green fuel is used to produce electricity via a 1.24kW fuel cell system. Lithium-ion batteries are part of the proposed system configuration in order to react to too rapid load changes, which the hydrogen system would not be able to handle.
The heat waste generated by the fuel cell and the electrolyzer is transferred via heat exchangers to a hot water tank, which supplies hot water to the household. The remaining demand is covered by a heat pump.
The academics tried to identify the kind and size of components required under different scenarios. They also aimed to assess the conditions under which a system could compete with conventional power systems in terms of price and costs. The model was simulated in Simulink (MATLAB) to analyze when and how the PV system is fully able to cover the energy needs of a household.
The scientists also used HOMER software, which was developed by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in order to verify the results. Measurements were taken with a  time resolution of 15 minutes and a total time frame of one year.
The German group estimated that the electrolyzer used 4283.55kWh of surplus solar power to produce 80.50 kg of hydrogen in one year, while the fuel cell was able to return 1009.86kWh energy by burning 73.52 kg of hydrogen.
“The compression of hydrogen required a yearly energy demand of 268.14kWh, while the heating demand was 1208.66kWh,” the scientists explained. “The heating demand was reduced by 643.69kWh by using the waste heat produced within the electrolyzer and the fuel cell.”
They said their simulation via Simulink showed that household heating demand expands the required amount of decentralized stored hydrogen when aiming for energy-independent operations.
“Future research has to focus on optimizing the control system and on analyzing which component dimensioning under which scenarios is preferable in terms of energy and resource efficiency and in terms of lifetime increase,” they said.
The scientists described the system design in “Hybrid Energy System Model in Matlab/Simulink Based on Solar Energy, Lithium-Ion Battery and Hydrogen,” which was recently published in Energies.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/29/us-government-to-move-forward-with-pv-anti-circumvention-investigation/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 29, 2022",US government to move forward with PV anti-circumvention investigation,"From pv magazine USA
The US Department of Commerce (DOC) has decided to act on a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar, requesting that it review solar panel imports from Chinese companies in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
The DOC has said that it is launching an anti-dumping investigation into the companies. Auxin Solar’s petition claims that solar cell and module manufacturers in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam are using parts produced by Chinese companies, in order to minimize production costs, while also skirting existing anti-dumping and countervailing (AD/CVD) tariffs on Chinese goods, which have been in place since 2012.
The announcement of an investigation has begun to cast a dark shadow on the solar industry, as its findings could massively disrupt supplies and production of solar modules, as about 80% of US crystalline-silicon modules are shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand.
In response to the decision, Auxin Solar released the following statement:
“For years, Chinese solar producers have refused to fairly price their products in the US and have gone to significant lengths to continue undercutting American manufacturers and workers by establishing circumventing operations in countries not covered by those duties. We are grateful Commerce officials recognized the need to investigate this pervasive backdoor dumping and how it continues to injure American solar producers. Fair trade and enforcement of our trade laws are essential to rebuilding the American solar supply chain and making Solar in America again.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, the president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has also released a statement.
“Contrary to the Biden administration’s goal of growing clean energy in the US, the Department of Commerce has decided to consider up to 50% to 250% tariffs on the solar industry in the United States,” said Ross Hopper. “This misstep will have a devastating impact on the US solar market at a time when solar prices are climbing, and project delays and cancellations are adding up. The solar industry is still reeling from a similar tariff petition that surfaced last year. The mere threat of tariffs altered the industry’s growth trajectory and is one of the reasons why we’re now expecting a 19% decline in near-term solar forecasts. Taking up this case will have a chilling effect on the solar industry.”
Since it was published, the Auxin Solar petition has been disparaged and disregarded by leading organizations across the solar industry. John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy with the SEIA, called it “a blatant attempt by Auxin to unfairly gain a competitive advantage, to the great detriment of other domestic module manufacturers and the American solar industry at large.”
Auxin’s petition is very similar to one that was thrown out by DOC in November 2021, but not identical. American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC) filed a series of petitions in mid August seeking a Department of Commerce investigation into its allegations that module imports from the three countries represented an attempt by the companies to skirt existing US rules against dumping.
In a November 10 decision, Abdelali Elouaradia, director of DOC’s AD-CVD office, said that A-SMACC’s insistence to keep the names of its member companies from the public would “prevent Commerce from obtaining and considering” information related to an inquiry.
The difference in the Auxin petition is that, instead of focusing on specific yet unnamed companies, Auxin is asking for a review of entire countries.
AD/CVD tariffs can be as high as 50% to 250%, a level of uncertainty that has shuddered through the US solar industry. “Deployment is frozen,” said George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy in an interview with pv magazine. SOLV is among the largest utility-scale solar contractors in the United States, with a strong project pipeline of over 4GW across the nation.
Potential impact
Hershman said the uncertainty caused by these tariffs is simply too much to digest in a utility-scale solar project, where module prices can account for 50% of the cost or more. SOLV‘s projects can exceed $300 million, so a 50% to 250% tariff would impose between $75 million to $375 million in additional costs. This level of risk is untenable and is why Hershman describes the case as “an affront to the solar industry.”
The effects of US market uncertainty may already be showing, as LG announced it will close its solar module business and close its 550MW module assembly plant in Huntsville Alabama.
Outside of trade industry organizations, other American module manufacturers have also decried Auxin’s petition. Silfab Solar, a Canadian-owned manufacturer with 800MW of module manufacturing capacity located in Washington state, attested that a anticircumvention review would cause immediate and direct harm to American crystalline-silicon module producers, as these companies are dependent on imports of solar cells, because there is no commercial production capacity at all in the United States.
According to SEIA, the implementation of AD/CVD tariffs would result in the loss of 14GW of new solar installations, a figure which represents more than half of what was installed in the US last year.
The move by Auxin has been seen as an attempt for the company to better position itself against foreign manufacturing competition and boost the power of American manufacturers, but Hershman shares that the implementation of AD/CVD tariffs would have the exact opposite effect. 
In Hershman’s view, tariffs like the ones imposed by the Auxin case are temporary, short-term measures that won’t boost US manufacturing in a meaningful way. Long-term certainty is needed for a company to move a fabrication process to a new country. He called for industrial policy like the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, includes numerous tax credits for US-based manufacturing.

US-based IntriEnergy has secured intellectual property protection in India for its technology platform. It claims that its systems can increase the overall energy output of a solar cell by up to 60%. The technology can be applied to any solar cell during the manufacturing process, creating a high-efficiency, low-cost solar cell.
The IntriEnergy tech platform includes three innovations. D·ARK anti-reflective coating increases the energy output of any solar cell by 10%. Its IntrinSiC silicon-carbide innovation captures 40% more of the sun’s spectrum. And it has introduced quantum energy dots to optimize energy flow. By combining these three innovations, the company can achieve a 60% increase in energy output in solar panels.
“Companies that license our technology will realize an increase in the energy output of their current solar panels from 400 watts to 640W+, without increasing panel size,” said IntriEnergy.
India patent number 390862 was officially granted on Feb. 28. The patent protection covers the period from IntriEnergy’s original filing date of July 28, 2015, expanding its patent protection globally. The company has already secured patents for its innovations in the United States and Canada and is awaiting final approval in the European Union and Hong Kong.
“Securing intellectual property protection is core to IntriEnergy’s forward-looking IP strategy. This enables the company to secure licensing, partnerships, and joint venture opportunities with existing solar manufacturing companies seeking a competitive advantage in the $180 billion annual solar industry,“ said IntriEnergy Chief Executive Officer Jackie Coffey.
