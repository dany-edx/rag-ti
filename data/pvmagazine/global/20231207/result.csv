The agreement includes the development of a 7 MW solar plant, which is expected to cover a large part of the island’s electricity requirements. The project will include electric vehicle chargers for cars and boats, encouraging locals and visitors to embrace electric transportation. The island's close proximity to the mainland makes this infrastructure crucial, especially for small boats.
The government said that the project is part of the country’s “GR-Eco Islands” initiative to “green” the Greek isles. Poros will be the third island after Astypalaia and Halki to join the initiative.
Greece's GR-Eco Islands initiative, launched in 2021 with a €100 million ($107.9 million) of funding, raises questions about which islands will join and the process for participation.
Astypalaia, for example, was chosen by Germany’s Volkswagen in 2020 as the site to test the company’s electric mobility business model. The Greek government supported Volkswagen’s concept. Given that Astypalaia is powered by dirty diesel generators, it ran a public tender for a solar-plus-storage power plant.
Greece’s Public Power Corp. (PPC) won the tender earlier in 2023 and is now building a 3.5 MW solar project and a 5 MW/10 MWh battery system on the island. Upon completion, the PPC-owned project will cover half of Astypalaia’s electricity needs.  
It is not clear whether the Poros island project was put forward by Masdar or Greece’s government. However, Masdar has committed to sponsoring it and the project costs remain undisclosed until the two parties determine the “technical specificities of the planned activities,” according to the press release.

Honeywell Process Solutions said it will provide Massachusetts-based renewable energy developer VIElectron with its first installment of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to accommodate six solar facilities across the US Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John).
The lithium-ion based BESS will add 124 MWh of energy storage co-located with the solar facilities. Grid-scale storage solutions can absorb fluctuations in demand, further stabilizing the grid by absorbing excess power during low usage and then releasing it during peak hours. The adjoining solar facilities will provide a total of 140 MW solar capacity.
The solar-plus-storage system is expected to cover 30% of the energy consumption needs of the islands.
According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), the US Virgin Islands have heavily relied on fossil fuels to generate electricity in the past. This means residents accrued expensive electricity costs that fluctuated with global oil prices.
“In 2009, the US Virgin Islands were almost 100% dependent on imported oil for electricity, water desalination and transportation, resulting in electricity costs nearly four times the US national average,” the DOE said.
Since then, the US Virgin Islands have set a goal to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels for energy production by 60% by 2025. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) adds that the U.S. Virgin Islands also want to generate 30% of peak capacity from renewables by 2025. According to the DOE, the territory is well on its way to reaching these goals due to its growing portfolio of renewable energy projects that include:

While it does not boast the same solar irradiance as sunnier climates, the sun shines for long hours during summer, compensating for dark winters. A combination of advanced technology, a stable grid, availability of land, predictable permitting processes, and growing demand for clean energy has created a unique opportunity for solar development in the country.
Image: Solnet Group
Finland has made impressive strides in solar technology. For example, Solnet Group has invested heavily in research and development, leading to energy storage possibilities and grid optimization. These advancements are critical for optimizing grid operation and stabilizing energy consumption. The number of utility scale projects is rising due to volatile fossil fuel energy prices. Finland increased its energy independence in the wake of the Ukraine war. With Russia as a neighbor, policymakers noted energy stood out as a sector ripe to be disrupted.
The commitment of both the Finnish government and its citizens to reach carbon neutrality by 2035 is a driving force behind solar's success. The government moved quickly to introduce policies and incentives to promote renewable energy, including tax benefits and subsidies for solar installations. Even with solar on the rise, however, there is still potential for more and Finland is not among the countries deploying solar the most, at least not yet.
When Solnet Group started implementing PV projects, in 2014, solar was not deployed much in Finland and was not as well-known as it is today. There was also not the demand present.
Finland's energy consumption is on the rise, driven by a growing economy and the electrification of sectors such as transportation and manufacturing. Solar power can enhance grid stability in Finland by providing a decentralized energy source and this can be especially beneficial during extreme weather conditions or unforeseen disruptions.
Developers vs. landowners
One of the intriguing aspects of Finland's solar boom is the scramble for land. Developers are racing to secure suitable sites for solar installations, often negotiating with landowners to reserve space. This competitive landscape reflects growing interest in solar projects across the country. Finland has ample unoccupied land but a significant portion of it is forested, prompting concern clearing sites could reduce the nation’s carbon storage capacity. Nevertheless, numerous solar projects could be deployed near property plots, on rooftops, or even on former peat land previously harvested for energy.
Amid increasing demand for clean energy solutions, new players have entered the Finnish solar market, especially in the consumer business. Many new entrants are eyeing quick returns on investment, hoping to capitalize on the solar rush. As Solnet has observed, however, that might not be the most feasible strategy. We consider that establishing long-term partnerships holds greater significance for sustaining business longevity.
While the enthusiasm for solar in Finland is undeniable, question marks hang over the viability of rapid, profit-focused development. The solar energy sector requires substantial investment and expecting quick returns may not align with the realities of the industry. Solnet has witnessed instances of early failures among those who entered the market solely with profit in mind.
Market conditions
The market has experienced significant growth in the past year, primarily centered around on-site PV installations – rooftops and ground mounted. The outlook for solar is not entirely free of clouds, though. While demand is rising, electricity prices have fluctuated, affecting the economic feasibility of solar projects. The cost of financing PV sites has risen, due to elevated interest rates, and that can erode returns on investment, especially when projects are financed by borrowing. The electricity market in Finland remains volatile, making long-term forecasting and planning challenging.
While Finland has made commendable progress in solar development, the government has recently decided to halt subsidies for solar projects. Backing will instead be allocated to hydrogen projects. Rather than removing subsidies, the government should consider expanding the financial incentives for solar installation, making them more accessible to a broader range of businesses and homeowners. Supporting the industry remains imperative for the adoption of solar energy as PV will be the workhorse of the green transition. Incentives could include tax credits, grants, and feed-in tariffs.
Further simplifying and expediting the permitting process for solar projects would reduce administrative burdens and accelerate timelines. Implementing fair and attractive net metering policies would encourage greater adoption of solar by enabling users to sell excess electricity back to the grid at competitive rates. The government has also considered setting a price limit for electricity but if it is too low, it will remove the incentive to sell electricity to the grid, something which has stabilized the market.
Finland should collaborate with European Union policymakers to harmonize renewable energy targets, ensuring a unified approach to clean energy across the bloc’s member states. That could facilitate cross-border energy trading and bolster European solar. In addition to long-term planning, the Finnish government should consider more short-term objectives to support solar deployment.
Prospects
Amid the challenges, however, there are encouraging outcomes for Finnish solar. As a leader in the domestic market for commercial installations, Solnet has experienced a lot of opportunity. Solar projects yield an attractive return-on-investment and bring long-awaited stability to energy costs for customers.  Solnet has started planning southern Finland’s largest solar park, together with Finnish investment company H.G. Paloheimo. Large-scale solar parks will be established in the region with solar panels planned to amount to 140 MWp of generation capacity.
The site’s investment value could reach €100 million ($109 million) and the project will be executed through a partnership model. The initiative involves preparing the solar parks for a ready-to-build phase, followed by construction led by Solnet Group. This approach ensures finance for the solar parks and secures future electricity buyers for the energy to be produced. The parties have also agreed on an option to incorporate new technology for electric grid balancing. More energy buyers and investors are being considered for future projects.

Minimax GmbH, a German fire protection specialist, has developed a new water extinguishing system for flat rooftops with PV systems.
The PVProtect solution can be used on rooftops with inclinations of up to 10 degrees. It consists of a network of heat differential detectors and extinguishing nozzles distributed around the solar modules, which can quickly fight small fires.
When an unusual temperature increase is detected by a sensor, it triggers a message to the fire protection center and subsequently to the fire department. The closely spaced sensors precisely locate even small fires, and the system's extinguishing nozzles can promptly address the fire with minimal water, ensuring risk-appropriate water distribution at low operating pressures.
The system can be connected to the existing water supply of a sprinkler system, which enables cost-effective integration into existing fire protection systems, said Minimax.
The manufacturer said its PVProtect solution is recognized by German insurance companies and VdS Schadensverhütung GmbH, an institute for corporate security and a subsidiary of the General Association of the German Insurance Industry.
Minimax is a globally active company with around 10,000 employees and €2.2 billion (2.37 billion) in sales.

The team investigated, in particular, how grassland responded to different simulated grazing management strategies within the agrivoltaic array.
“This is the first study to test how forage quantity and quality respond to simulated grazing in the semi-arid climate of Colorado,” the research's corresponding author, Matthew Sturchio, told pv magazine. “The ability of plants to regrow at different stages of the growing season, when environmental conditions become hotter and drier, is important for determining best practices for grazing management in grassland agrivoltaic systems.”
The scientists took their measurements at the Jack’s Solar Garden (JSG), an elevated, south-oriented agrivoltaic learning and research facility using single-axis-tracking systems near Longmont, Colorado. They quantified how the timing of grazing alters overall productivity and if forage quality changes throughout the growing season.
Their analysis considered air temperature and relative humidity throughout the growing season from May to September 2022. These data were then used to calculate vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which is the difference between the amount of moisture that is actually in the air and the amount of moisture that air could hold at saturation.
The primary goal was to assess how PV panels altered patterns of forage production, which is technically known as aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and forage quality. “ANPP in grasslands is a valuable ecosystem service that is important for the economics of grazing as an agricultural land use,” the academics explained, noting that they compared the results of the simulated ungrazed grassland under the panels with an ungrazed reference area without PV modules. 
The measurements showed that the agrivoltaic system did not have a significant impact on end of season ANPP totals in the absence of simulated grazing activity.
“More importantly, re-growth following simulated grazing led to equal or greater ANPP than in un-grazed sites at all microenvironment locations throughout the array,” the team said. “This finding indicates that a previously managed low diversity semi-arid grassland can maintain productivity within an agrivoltaic array and that the timing of grazing is unlikely to strongly affect total annual productivity.”
Overall, the results indicated that the forage quality in semi-arid regions may even be increased later into the growing season with grazing under solar panels.
The group introduced its findings in the study “Agrivoltaic arrays can maintain semi-arid grassland productivity and extend the seasonality of forage quality,” published in Applied Energy.
Another research group at the Colorado State University investigated last year how agrivoltaic systems mounted on single-axis trackers affect rainfall and light redistribution at a 1.2 MW installation on grassland in Boulder. This team believes that their understanding of the effects of single-axis agrivoltaic systems on rainfall and light redistribution and consequent impacts on crop productivity can help to restore land degraded by overgrazing, agriculture practice, and water scarcity.

Profils Systèmes has developed a PV veranda that can be integrated into existing and new buildings.
“We developed this product more than fifteen years ago,” Denis Bounio, a sales manager for Profils Systèmes, told pv magazine France, noting that the rise in energy costs has brought this product back into fashion.
The Wallis&Energy photovoltaic veranda is a grid-connected PV system that can host solar modules with power outputs of up to 500 W and panels from a wide range of manufacturers.
The size of the photovoltaic panels may vary from 700 mm x 1,000 mm to 1,210 mm x 1,800 mm. Their thickness is between 26 mm and 50 mm, with the filling of the insulating panel ranging from 32 mm to 55 mm. The generators can be opaque, assembled on insulating panels, or semi-transparent, assembled in insulating glazing.
Integrated above the insulating panels, the solar modules provide ridges with troughs, allowing easy passage of electrical cables. The equipment benefits, as an option, from a box of remote roller shutters, a support for spotlights or LED strips and a support for blinds.
“It’s an interesting solution when you want to enlarge your house, especially since administrative procedures have been simplified and photovoltaic panels now offer much better yields,” Bounio explained.
Waterproofing is ensured from a 5% slope by sealed insulating panels sealed with ethylene propylene rubber (EPDM) seals. Furthermore, installing panels on the roof of a veranda optimizes its insulation, by adding a layer of material that limits heat loss through the ceiling.
Profils Systèmes, based in Baillargues, France, is a unit of Groupe Corialis.

Electricity “gen-tailer” EnergyAustralia has unveiled design details for its proposed Lake Lyell Pumped Hydro Project, providing an overview of key project elements including the upper reservoir design, site access roads, underground powerhouse, the switchyard and water intake location.
It is expected the pumped hydro facility, located approximately 110 kilometers west of central Sydney, will be capable of producing 335 MW of renewable energy for up eight hours during periods of peak demand.
EnergyAustralia, which is also seeking to develop a battery energy storage system at the Mt Piper site which will be able to dispatch up to 500 MW of power for up to four hours, said the pumped hydro facility will provide firming and other ancillary grid services in the Central West region, and across the state.
The project proposes to use the 32-gigaliter Lake Lyell, which was specifically built to supply water to the 1.4 GW Mount Piper coal-fired power station that is scheduled to close in 2040, as a lower reservoir with a new upper reservoir to be built in a gully on the southwest flank of the adjacent Mt. Walker.
The concept design also outlines plans for a new underground powerhouse which will contain two pump-turbines and electrical transformers. This will be accessed via two tunnels from portals built on the north side of Farmers Creek.
The project will also incorporate existing transmission assets, with the facility connecting to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via a new switchyard that will link to the existing 330 kV transmission lines that pass through the project area to the south of Mt Walker.
EnergyAustralia Project Director Michael de Vink said the concept design emphasises the company’s commitment to mitigating environmental, cultural heritage and other important impacts through “site-sensitive” design.
“This includes changes made following consultation with the community and initial environmental studies,” he said. “The siting of key elements of the project takes advantage of the natural geography of the site to avoid visual impacts, mitigate environmental impacts and maintain lake recreational access for the community.”
De Vink said the concept design will allow EnergyAustralia to plan further studies to assess the project’s environmental impact and “progress with more detailed engineering design work.”
“The next step for the project is more detailed assessments and continuing community engagement,” he said, adding that environmental studies are currently underway with findings to be included in the project’s Environmental Impact Assessment which is expected to be on public exhibition towards the end of next year.
EnergyAustralia, which is owned by Hong Kong-based CLP Group, said the Lake Lyell project is currently in the feasibility stage with a decision on proceeding likely to be made in the second half of 2025. It is anticipated construction would take at least four years, meaning the earliest the facility could be operating is 2029.

The Smart Solar Roof system features 430 W TOPCon double-glass, frameless solar panels with an efficiency of 22.5%.
“The modules are Climacy-branded and are produced by OEM manufacturers in China,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The mounting systems are produced in Switzerland.”
The solar module features 108 half-cut cells (182 mm x 83 mm) with dimensions of 1,716 mm x 1,128 mm, weighing 23.5 kg. It has an open-circuit voltage of 38.49 V, a short-circuit current of 14.23 A, and a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V, backed by a five-year product warranty.
The mounting system, directly fixed to the roof slat, streamlines insulation and installation speed. It includes a retention system for module attachment to a carrying structure, designed to counteract lamination bow caused by asymmetric heating during the lamination process.
“When producing laminated glass structures, such structures are typically heated only from one side,” the spokesperson said. “This leads to differences in thermal extension of the layers and thus to the lamination bow.”

GCube Insurance, an underwriter for renewable energy projects, said that about 54% of incurred costs of total solar losses can be attributed to hail, despite being only 1.4% of the total number of claims filed. This is based on data collected by Gcube over the past five years. Average costs totaled $58 million per claim.
It said this risk is being underestimated by solar asset owners, causing a gap between insurance requirements for solar projects and what is available in the market and leading to project delays and cancellations.
GCube insures more than 100 GW of renewables projects in 40 countries.
Other leading insurance risks include fires (16% of claims and 20% of total costs) and electrical failures (19% of total claims and 3.5% of total costs), based on five years of GCube data.
The insurance underwriter said in pursuit of a reduced levlized cost of electricity (LCOE), solar manufacturers have adopted larger, thinner modules with more fragile surface glass, leading to increased hail risk.
“Hail damage risk is undermining the security of solar power as a prominent clean energy solution,” said Fraser McLachlan, chief executive officer of GCube Insurance. “We therefore have an overriding imperative to develop solutions to this challenge and restore our ability as insurers to provide the sector with long term risk underwriting.”

It combines a custom-made printed circuit board (PCB) attached to the PV module and a single-board Raspberry Pi computer that communicates wirelessly over WiFi.
“In our work, a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT)-based wireless monitoring system for PV module performance analysis is introduced,” corresponding author, Mohamed Abu Radia, told pv magazine. “While we haven't conducted a comprehensive economic analysis, a rough estimation of the system's cost based on component prices suggests it may range from $100 to $150.” 
According to the research group, the PCB of the system includes three NodeMCU WiFi modules that allow it to communicate with Raspberry Pi. One of those modules is in charge of collecting measurements, the second for servo motor control, and the third for On/Off control. The latter control can be used for various applications, such as battery storage, cleaning systems, and cooling pumps.
In addition, the PCB contains voltage and current sensors, luminosity sensors, ambient temperature and humidity sensors, and temperature sensors. It also includes relay switches for the On/Off functions and the servo motor. It is powered using a commercial 5 V/2A power adapter.
The WiFi modules of the board are all programmed to allow them to send information and receive commands via a password-protected MQTT protocol. To control the system beyond the range of a WiFi network, the scientists have also established a secure VPN tunnel.

On the receiving side, the research group used a Raspberry Pi computer capable of working with the MQTT protocol. “The adoption of the MQTT protocol over Wi-Fi for data transfer to the central processing unit (Raspberry Pi) offered significant advantages in terms of data interference, transmission rate, and power consumption,” the academics emphasized.
To analyze the data and control the functions of the PV, the group installed a few open-source software on the Raspberry Pi. Node-RED – a visual programming tool that allows users to create and deploy workflows – was used to process the data. This data was then sorted and analyzed via the InfluxDB program. Finally, data visualization, user interface, alerts, and controls were created via Grafana with the help of some plugins. The group also integrated additional weather data from provider OpenWeatherMap into the user interface.
The scientists tested their system in a laboratory setting with a 50 W polycrystalline PV module with a cooling system. To assess the system's reliability, its reading was compared to the readings of multimeters. “The results of this comparison indicated a good degree of agreement between the measurements obtained from the proposed system and those provided by the multimeters,” they stated.
They have also looked into the latency time of the system. The average latency time – the delay between data recording and data reception – was found to be 0.323 seconds. “Our system demonstrates a relatively rapid data transmission capability, enabling real-time insights into photovoltaic module performance,” the researchers added.
“The implementation of alerts and thresholds in Grafana facilitates proactive monitoring, enabling researchers to respond promptly to deviations from predefined limits and ensuring the system operates optimally,” the academics concluded.
They presented the system in the study “IoT-based wireless data acquisition and control system for photovoltaic module performance analysis,” which was recently published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics, and Energy.

Islands from 10 Member States vary in geography, population size and industry, and will receive three years of European Commission assistance.
The program's selected islands are at different stages of their energy transition. For example, Ireland's Arranmore and Tory islands are only “just developing their energy transition plans,” according to the European Commission, while Greece's Tilos island is described as advanced and will use the support for the “last mile.” Other islands belong to Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Portugal, Croatia and Spain.
The islands will develop plans and receive “comprehensive assistance” from the European Commission to achieve carbon neutrality. The press release does not specify whether this is financial assistance.
The European Commission claims that although its 2,400 islands may be small, they have a combined population of 20 million – making it the bloc’s sixth largest Member State. Many depend on expensive fossil fuel imports for their energy supply, the European Commission states.

The scientists said they have added six new results to the new tables since June.
One of the six results added to the tables is the 25.2% efficiency that researchers at Northwestern University in the United States achieved for a 1-cm2 lead halide perovskite cell.
Furthermore, the tables now include the 22.4% efficiency that US-based First Solar achieved for a 0.45 cm2 cadmium-telluride (CdTe) cell, the 26.1% efficiency that China's University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) obtained for 0.05 cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell, and the 26.1% efficiency the Northwestern University and the University of Toronto in Canada achieved for a 0.05-cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell.
The fifth result added to the tables is the 36.1% efficiency that Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) and Dutch research institute AMOLF achieved in September for a multijunction solar cell based on silicon and III-V semiconductors such as gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs).
The sixth result is the 33.9% efficiency the Chinese module maker Longi announced for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell in early November.
In Version 62 of the tables, released in June the researchers added 21 new results, a record number for the Tables. The group has seen major improvements in all cell categories since 1993, when the tables were first published.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems and the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Namely, those challenges are achieving heat electrification, utilizing decommissioned thermal power plants, meeting the demand for large-scale heat storage, and increasing the share of carbon capture.
“The importance and prevalence of heat pumps lie in that heat pumps can not only participate in the regulation of thermal energy between the supply and demand sides, aimed at the heating/cooling supply that accounts for 50% of the energy consumption for users but also address the bottleneck problem of energy consumption in carbon capture to tackle the last ‘10%' carbon emissions,” they said.
Heat electrification
As for the first of the listed challenges, the scientists said heat pumps are endowed with substantial potential for electricity utilization. According to their estimates, the requirements of building heating of up to 80 C and industrial heating below 150 C can be satisfied with a heat pump.
“It means that 100% of building heating and 50% industrial heating will be addressed,” they emphasized. “If the penetration rate reaches 90%, a total 20% CO2 reduction could be achieved by heat pumps.”
Their higher initial costs, the researchers say, are affecting decision-makers for now – but this will change with breakthroughs in technologies and a more comprehensive usage scenario in the energy transition.
Decommissioned plants
Regarding the challenge of utilizing decommissioned thermal power plants, the researchers propose transforming them into transit stations, storing energy in different forms. They suggest that 20% of the renewable energy will be held in electric batteries or high-temperature heat storage based on the Carnot battery concept, then transferred to the consumer via the grid. Another 30% chunk of the energy will be used to produce hydrogen and methane, which will then be stored and moved to the clients via pipeline.
The final 50% share will be utilized with heat pumps, working with a reverse cycle to store and then supply people with cooling and heating.
“The appropriate positioning of decommissioned thermal power plants in the future energy system will minimize equipment investment and, more importantly, mitigate the perceived threat of unemployment that undermines the political support for the energy transition,” the research group said.
Heat storage
As for large-scale heat storage, the scientists believe that a large part of the future capacity may be provided by heat pumps. That entails positioning one heat pump between the supply side and the storage facility and another one between the storage facility and the demand side.
“From the supply side to the heat storage side, thermal energy stored can be multiplied by heat pumps,” they further explained. “Taking the air source heat pump as an example, 1 kWh of electric energy can be utilized to generate threefold to sixfold thermal energy when deriving 2-5 kWh of free thermal energy from the environment. From the heat storage side to the demand side, if it is connected to the users with heat pumps as an intermediate system, the grade of thermal energy can be regulated according to the user's needs.”
Carbon capture
The final issue tackled by the scientific group is the hard-to-abate emissions that occur in industrial production and transportation. They say that in China, it will account for 20%, and while it is estimated that half could be captured by natural forests, the rest should be handled by carbon capture. Also for that, the research paper proposes a heat pump for help.
“Heat consumption for regeneration is estimated to account for 80% of the total direct air capture energy consumption,” they noted. “Therefore, carbon capture driven by natural or waste heat source heat pumps is prone to apply for urban carbon reduction. For example, the evaporator of the heat pump not only absorbs industrial waste heat but also couples with the adsorption tower and condenser in the DAC system, and the condenser of the heat pump can release heat to the desorption tower.”
The four approaches were presented in the study “Heat pump assists in energy transition: Challenges and approaches,” published in DeCarbon. “Challenges and opportunities coexist with each other, and it's time to go further,” the scientists concluded.
