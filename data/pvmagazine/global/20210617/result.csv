Polish perovskite solar cell manufacturer Saule Technologies has inaugurated its new cell factory in Wrocław, in western Poland.
The manufacturing facility occupies an area of approximately 5,000m2 and currently hosts a pilot production line which enables all laboratory processes to be reproduced in a fully automated manner. At the same time, parallel work, to establish a highly efficient industrial line, has already been launched, targeting a capacity of 100 MW.
“Almost six years have passed since, with the financial help of the Japanese entrepreneur Hideo Sawada, we launched a project to realize the production line of photovoltaic cells in perovskite,” said Olga Malinkiewicz, CTO and co-founder of Saule Technologies. “I am happy and proud that, after a long phase of research, testing and hard work, we are now entering the implementation phase.”
She pioneered a room-temperature inkjet printing process eight years ago when she was a doctoral student at the Institute of Molecular Sciences (ICMol) at the University of Valencia, Spain. The process, which is claimed to greatly reduce manufacturing costs, was awarded a prestigious prize in the Photonics 2 competition organized by the European Commission.
According to the manufacturer, the cells produced at the new facility will be lightweight and flexible. They could be easily placed on a laptop, car, drone, spacecraft or building, or even in the shade and indoors. The first application will be to power internet-of-things devices.
The obvious areas of application are in BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaics). This is the main reason why Columbus Energy – a modern energy service provider and the largest distributor of photovoltaic installations in Poland – invested €10 million in the development of Saule Technologies, becoming, thus, the main shareholder of the company and acquiring the priority purchase right.
On the day of the inauguration of the perovskite photovoltaic cell plant, Saule Technologies, along with Columbus Energy, signed tripartite cooperation agreements with the MVGM group, a leader in commercial real estate management acting in ten European markets. The value of the investment portfolio under the signed contracts is €250 million.
Saule Technologies has also started its IPO process. The initial public offering will take place on NewConnect – a marketplace managed by the Warsaw Stock Exchange – later this year.

Spanish renewable energy company Acciona has installed, in Chile, its first mobile photovoltaic generation unit, with the aim of replacing diesel as an energy source in the construction of the new detention center La Laguna Education and Work Center, in the commune of Talca, in the Maule region.
During its entire construction period, which began at the end of 2017, the La Laguna project has not had a connection to the electricity grid, and a very high number of diesel generators had to be used to meet its energy needs, explained Acciona in a press release.
The mobile PV system is made up of 70 photovoltaic panels with a power output of 370 W each, which together make up a foldable solar structure with an installed capacity for the generation of clean energy of 25.9 kWp.
With this pilot project, Acciona wants to assess the technical, economic and environmental viability of this portable photovoltaic generator and to evaluate its use in the company's construction projects around the world, explained Miguel Ángel París Torres, head of the area of the office of projects, sustainable and industrial building of the R&D center of the Acciona construction business. “The main indicator of the success of this pilot project, from the point of view of sustainability, will be the fuel savings achieved,” he stated.
The mobile PV unit that has been installed in the La Laguna project is one of the solutions that Acciona intends to implement on a large scale in the field of portable plug-and-play generator sets based on renewable energy sources, mainly photovoltaic, as well as in H2 fuel cells.
“At Acciona, we plan to continue with the validation tests of some of these emerging technologies throughout this year, in various works of different types and specific energy needs, which will be one of the first experiences of this type in the sector of construction worldwide,” Torres further explained.

The project is set to be built in Aetolia-Acarnania, in northwestern Greece, and will include two upper water reservoirs, Agios Georgios and Pyrgos, with volumes of approximately five and two million cubic metres, respectively. Lake Kastraki, which is controlled by state-owned utility the Public Power Corporation, will serve as a lower reservoir.
“The investment exceeds €500 million and yields 816.00 GWh annually,” said a Terna Energy press release.  
The developer said the pumped-hydro scheme was declared a project of common interest by the EU in 2013 and thus received support from the bloc's Connecting Europe Facility for its feasibility studies. As such, said Terna in its press release, the project has obtained “definite approval of environmental terms.”
The pumped-hydro plant was also granted strategically significant investment status by the Greek government in 2014, ensuring priority status in processes carried out by public bodies and concerning other red tape.
“In other words, the project is technically, and licensing-wise, ready and ripe enough for its construction to be shortly initiated,” said the company.
With no finance details included in the press release, Terna also refused to comment on such matters when contacted by pv magazine.
With bankability a prime concern for potential investors, a video produced by Terna Energy states the Amphilochia project will be able to generate revenue by providing grid ancillary services.
The Greek government is expected to publish an energy storage regulatory framework this summer, however, and Alexandra Sdoukou, secretary general for energy and mineral resources at the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, told pv magazine last week, the aim will be to get the regulation into law before October. 
Investors may be unlikely to step forward before knowing the details of the pending regulatory regime but Terna has a good track record in securing finance from multilateral institutions including London-based development lender European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  and the EU’s European Investment Bank.
The energy ministry also told pv magazine it is preparing to tender 700 MW of battery storage this year.
Speaking at an energy storage webinar organized last year by Greece’s energy regulator, Stavros Papathanasiou, a professor of electrical engineering at the National Technical University of Athens, argued that for Greece to stay on track for its 2030 energy strategy, the country will need a combination of large pumped-hydro storage systems and smaller battery facilities. While batteries could provide four-hour storage, Papathanasiou said, pumped-hydro could be used for periods of six hours-plus.
Papathanasiou, who is drafting Greece’s energy storage policy framework, suggested the nation will need 1.5-1.75 GW of new capacity to meet 60% of its 2030 electricity needs from renewables.
pv magazine has determined Athens will devote €450 million of the €30.5 billion it expects to secure from the EU's post-Covid recovery and resilience facility, to energy storage. Of that €450 million, around €200 million will be channeled into battery facilities, via the planned 700 MW tender.
It remains to be seen whether the Greek government intends to subsidize pumped-hydro facilities.
With Amphilochia its flagship project, Terna claims plans for smaller facilities at Amari, on Crete; at Veria; and in the Peloponnese, ensure it holds 1.5 GW of licensed pumped storage capacity in Greece.

Spain-based solar tracker maker Soltec announced, today, the launch of SFOne, a new solar tracker with a 1P double-row configuration.
The SFOne is designed for modules with 72 and 78-cell designs and is self-powered by a dedicated module that, according to Soltec, translates into a lower operating cost.
Soltec already launched the SA Series 1P multi-row technology tracker, in 2009, and is now taking it up again, with new advances. Among them, Soltec highlights its ‘Dy-Wind' technology, which offers a methodology for the design of wind-resistant tracking structures and the optimization of the diffuse booster system for low-light conditions.
The tracking system also features the StringRunner, which is Soltec's proprietary standard component that combines fused PV source circuits and cabling within the tracker torque-tube, to a DC power switch. This tech allows for in-tube cable management and low-voltage trenching minimization
According to the manufacturer, installation of the device is similar to that for its SF7 tracker but it is easier and faster. Furthermore, the company claims the new product offers a 75% reduction in labor time. “Additionally, [with the] SFOne, Soltec offers the possibility of minimizing imported components for manufacture in each country where the projects are developed, through Soltec's factories, thus reducing the carbon footprint,” the manufacturer stated.
The SFOne will be available in all markets where the company has a presence.

Berlin-based monitoring provider Solytic came up with the figures, which identified Germany's Belectric as the continent's top O&M provider, with 2.79 GWp of capacity in its portfolio.
Compatriot businesses Enerparc (with 2,378 MW on its books), Juwi (2.53 GW) and Baywa re (1.9 GW) rounded out the top four with Norwegian company Scatec the top non-German provider on the list, with 1,898 MW under management. Baywa, however, has since disputed the figure attributed to it by Solytic, and told pv magazine it provided O&M services to 3.3 GWp of solar project capacity in Europe as of July 19.
French companies made the next biggest contribution to a Solytic list which did not identify any non-European O&M providers with more solar capacity than the 50 MW reportedly maintained by German player Suncycle. French companies, led by Neoen, which has 1.8 GW under management, supplied five of the top 36, followed by Italian and Spanish businesses, of which there were four each; three U.K. firms; two Dutch and Norwegian entities; and one representative each from Austria and Belgium.
In terms of solar portfolio scale, there were notable gaps between the capacities managed by Juwi and Baywa; between 12th-ranked Luxembourg-based firm Enovos‘ 1.2 GW and the 850 MW maintained by Italy's EF Solare Italia; and between the 100 MW operated by U.K. firm Natural Generation, in 35th place, and Suncycle.

“The 182mm-wafer-size module is the most cost–effective solution based on the in–depth analysis of various boundary conditions of the whole industrial value chain,” the document reads. “Without efficiency improvement, further increase on module power with larger size modules will not achieve lower system cost.”
The three manufacturers emphasized the increasing reliability risks associated with larger and more powerful products and reiterated the well-known saying “bigger is not always better,” heard in recent months from all those companies that decided not to bet on 210mm wafers, and modules with a power output exceeding 600 W. JA Solar, however, launched an 800 W product in August.
According to the analysis by the three companies, which considered factors such as manufacturing, transportation, installation, power generation performance and system matching, the ideal module weight for easy deployment is 33.3kg and the maximum weight should not exceed 35kg. Furthermore, glass thickness for bifacial products should not be over 2mm. “On the premise of [a] two [times] 2mm, double-glass, structure and reasonable control of the frame cost, the size of the module should be within a limit, otherwise its ability to resist static and dynamic load will be weakened seriously,” the experts from the three companies stated, adding that glass burst and micro–cracks become more frequent if these size and width parameters are exceeded.
In terms of yield and efficiency, 182mm wafers do not differ substantially from 166mm products, however, they can provide a significant balance-of-system (BoS) cost reduction, due to their increased size and current. These lower costs are achieved thanks to three main factors: A larger racking design which reduces support and pile foundation costs per watt; a reduced length of the cables connecting PV strings and combiner boxes, or string inverters; and a lower labor cost associated with the limited increase in the product's size. “The 182mm-wafer-size module is compatible with the design of two rows of vertical (2P) and four rows of horizontal (4L) racks, and can adapt to different terrain conditions by adjusting the number of strings on a single rack,” the paper notes.
The manufacturers compared the BoS costs of 182mm-wafer-size modules and 210mm products installed on the 4L rack, and found that the former have a slight advantage in racking, foundation, and land costs. “Excessive working current of a module will lead to a significant increase of the heat losses on the metal contact surface of the cell, the ribbon and the bus bar, which will increase the working temperature of the module to a certain extent,” the experts stated.
*The article was amended to reflect that the ideal module weight for easy deployment is 33.3kg and not 3.3kg as we previously wrote.

The commission yesterday announced it had approved the plans for post-Covid recovery submitted by Spain, meaning the heads of state which make up the European Council of Ministers can rubber-stamp that finance package within a month or so.
With plans for residential energy efficiency, sustainable transport and decarbonization of industry included, the commission said 40% of the budget drawn up by Madrid would be devoted to the green transition, more than the 37% required for EU member states to gain access to a slice of the €673 billion recovery and resilience facility (RRF) cash.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have, thus far, covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The RRF package, which will disburse funds until 2026, comprises €313 billion in grants and €360 billion in loans. The Spanish allocation is made up entirely of grants, the commission said on Wednesday.
Provided the council approves the Spanish plan, the member state will gain access to 13% of the total package – €9 billion – immediately, as ‘pre-financing.'
Portugal‘s €16.6 billion RRP was approved by the commission on the same day. Council approval would free up an immediate €2.2 billion of the total, which will be supplied as €13.9 billion of grants plus €2.7 billion loans.
And the commission today approved Greece‘s €30.5 billion plan – €17.8 billion loans, €12.7 billion grants – opening up the prospect of Athens gaining access to an initial €4 billion in four weeks or so.
Although member states were advised by the EU to submit recovery plans by the end of April, they will still be able to do so until the middle of next year.
The EU will fund its post-Covid, NextGenerationEU recovery plan by borrowing up to €800 billion through 2026, at a rate of around €150 billion per year, and on Tuesday announced it had raised the first €20 billion through a ten-year bond described as the biggest amount the bloc has raised in a single transaction.
The bloc expects to raise €80 billion this year through further bonds and short-term bills with €407 billion of the finance anticipated to be allocated to grants for member states and €386 billion for on-lending.
The commission said fund managers made up 37% of the purchasers of Tuesday's bond, with bank treasuries buying 25%, central banks and equivalent bodies 23%, insurance and pension funds 12%, non-state banks 2%, and hedge funds 1%. U.K. investors snapped up the biggest proportion of the bonds, with 24%, ahead of purchasers in the Benelux nations, who accounted for 15%. The commission added, 10% of the bonds were sold to investors in Asia and 3% to purchasers in the Americas.

China’s Jinchen Machinery has received almost 10 GW of solar module production line orders from India this year and has said it has a further 8 GW under discussion. The list of manufacturers placing orders includes almost all the big names in the Indian industry.
Vikas Singh, deputy director for sales and marketing at Jinchen Machinery, told pv magazine the company had received orders aggregating to 10 GW from all India's tier 1 companies recently, including Waaree Energies, Vikram Solar, Tata Power Solar, Adani, Goldi Solar, Premier Energies, Solex and RenewSys. 
Jinchen has already installed 2 GW of production lines and said the balance will arrive in the next 2-3 months and be installed by the company.
“Due to Covid, Chinese engineers cannot come to India,” Singh told pv magazine. “So it’s a big challenge for us to handle this big number for installation but we have started preparations for it and [have] installed 2 GW already, with our local team.”
Solex has stated it has placed an order for a 1.2 GW production line and Adani said it has signed a 2 GW deal. Singh declined to specify the capacities ordered by each Indian manufacturer.
The Jinchen representative added: “All the upcoming Jinchen lines [in India] provide the highest level of automation and bigger panels, as per the latest trend. Our one single line, of 500 MW [production capacity], can be operated with 13-15 [staff] only.”
Jinchen will open an India office by August, to support the line installations with a warehouse and engineering team. The office will be in Gujarat, where most Indian solar manufacturers have factories.
“We are opening [the] Jinchen India office by August 2021 in Surat City, and we will have our own spare warehouse to support customers,” said Singh. “We are also expanding our service team and adding more engineers. We expect to have a team of 50-plus engineers by this year-end.”

“All the projects are under the same 15-year power purchase agreement with a single off-taker, which is Irish grid operator Eirgrid,” a spokesperson from the utility told pv magazine.
The facilities will have a combined capacity of 118 MW and will be located in the counties of Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Longford, Galway, Offaly, Meath and Tipperary. The projects will be built by ‘Shannon Energy powered by Obton,' which is a joint venture between Obton and Irish company Shannon Energy. Their completion is expected by 2022.
In Ireland’s first renewable energy auction, solar secured 796.3 MW of generation capacity, versus 479.2 MW for wind, and undershot the average electricity price across the whole exercise with a mean PV figure that was €1.16/MWh lower.
Project developers secured feed-in premiums to top up the wholesale power price for 14-16.5 years, depending on project delivery dates.
The auction was part of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which started taking shape in September 2017 and was approved by the government in December 2019. A second round of the RESS, to procure a further 3 TWh of clean power, is planned this year.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Ireland had an installed solar power of approximately 40 MW at the end of 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/17/costs-loom-as-hurdle-for-green-hydrogen-says-rystad-energy/,"HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 17, 2021","Costs loom as hurdle for green hydrogen, says Rystad Energy","From pv magazine Australia
Australia has embraced the potential of green hydrogen, with 38 GW (AC) of assets already announced. But new analysis from independent consultancy Rystad Energy shows that capital expenditure costs need to be slashed by 75% for green hydrogen to be cost-competitive with fossil-fuel alternatives.
The Australian government has committed to green hydrogen – generated by renewables-powered electrolysis – as a fuel for the future. It formally recognizes it as a “priority technology” in the Technology Investment Roadmap announced late last year.
The government reaffirmed its commitment to hydrogen at the recent G7 Plus Summit in England by signing new partnerships with both Germany and Japan to support hydrogen initiatives. It has set an economic “stretch goal” to produce green hydrogen for $2 per kilogram. At that price, green hydrogen is expected to be cost-competitive in a range of applications.
However, Rystad Energy Senior Analyst David Dixon has declared the $2p/kg target as a real challenge. A detailed examination of cost factors in Australia shows that green hydrogen will struggle in the foreseeable future to be cost-competitive with gas produced using fossil fuels, he said.
Last week, Dixon released details of a year-long investigation into the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) in Australia. The analysis, based on a 100 MWh electrolyzer facility powered by current solar PV and wind technology, included more than 2,400 simulations for every state investigated. It took into account the AC capacity of the solar and wind assets, and the capex and opex of all elements in the equation. The investigation identified electricity costs, electrolyzer capex and opex as the key components of the LCOH.
“Our numbers suggest you need to reduce the capex of the total system, that is the electrolyser, the PV and the wind by 75% as well as improve the capacity factor in order to get to the government target of $2p/kg of hydrogen,” Dixon said.
 
 
 
 
Dixon said the required cost decline for hydrogen electrolyzers is foreseeable as they start to get built at scale. But he warned that achieving similar reductions for PV and wind will be a real challenge with electricity, which makes up the bulk of the LCOH.
“The wind and PV costs have to come down by over 50% and this is a very, very big challenge in a mature industry,” he said. “And in the short term, we’re actually predicting costs of key equipment to go up as commodity prices rise, not go down, so $3 is foreseeable and $2 is very, very challenging.”
The report shows gains in electrolyzer efficiency, including firming during periods of low demand on the grid, would also be critical in reducing costs. But Dixon said that even with the foreseeable reductions, the LCOH would still be above the $2p/kg target.
“If the capex of electrolyzers reduces 60%, we can knock off a $1, if we build utility PV and wind at a scale and thus benefit from the economies of scale, you knock off about 50 cents and if you firm between off-peak hours you can reduce that further but it still only takes you to $3p/kg,” he said. “There has to be a shift or subsidy even at scale in order to displace the existing production of hydrogen from steam methane reforming.”
While costs remain a hurdle for the industry, the Australian government remains committed to hydrogen, signing a new accord with Germany. Included in the initiatives is the establishment of the German-Australia Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (HyGATE), with both countries to commit funding to support pilots and research projects along the hydrogen supply chain. The new accord will also see the two countries exploring options to facilitate the trade of hydrogen and its derivatives produced from renewables from Australia to Germany.
In addition, Australia has announced a new agreement with Japan to jointly support initiatives that will help drive transitions to net zero emissions, with a focus on clean technology such as hydrogen. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said international collaboration focused on technological innovation will be key to getting new energy technologies like hydrogen to commercial parity.
“Our ambition is to produce the cheapest clean hydrogen in the world, which will transform transport, mining, resources and manufacturing at home and overseas,” he said. “We have a mix of all the key ingredients needed to be a major global player in a thriving global clean hydrogen industry – abundant land and energy resources coupled with an excellent track record and reputation as reliable energy partner.”

Overall, more than 1,500 attendees from all corners of the world tuned in to hear our expert speakers discuss a number of key solar issues, from quality, asset management, sustainability and innovation.
In addition to our live coverage and photo gallery, the team also recorded all the presentations and panel discussions so you can follow the conversations that took place. First up is the Cornerstone on Maintaining PV Quality, moderated by pv magazine editor in chief Jonathan Gifford, and head of events Frederike Egerer.
One of the key developments in the PV marketplace in 2021 is the emergence and deployment of large-format and high-powered modules. Power outputs of 400, 500 and even 600 Wp and beyond are reshaping notions of power plant design. However, given the rapid shift, concerns have been raised about the longevity of high-powered modules, and their susceptibility to a range of failure modes.
The quality concerns include crystalline defects in larger wafers, cell cutting processes and spacing that can result in cracking, an increase in defects as a result of cell currents, lamination defects due to process changes, and the alignment of multi-busbars. Materials such as glass, EVA and other encapsulants were also considered.
Methods for effective risk management were further addressed, including questions about the number of players involved in the distribution of risk. And the ways to effectively designate the roles of banks, insurance providers, EPCs, manufacturers, and investors, were discussed.
In addition to our attendees and experts, we would also like to thank our sponsors who helped make this event a (virtual) reality! Watch out for the remaining three Roundtables Europe videos in the coming days.

With government advisory body the Climate Change Committee having estimated the U.K. will need 40 GW of solar by 2030 to hit net zero, Solar Energy UK this morning published its Lighting The Way report spelling out how that figure can be reached.
The trade group has repeated its regular calls for reform of the business rates levied on commercial entities with solar rooftops, and the removal of VAT on solar systems, and considered the potential uplift for PV from improved building standards and incentives for the retrofitting of solar on buildings.
Alongside the familiar refrain demanding reform of the planning process, today's report also emphasizes the importance of keeping solar eligible for the biennial contracts-for-difference national renewable energy tenders, hinting at a fear the government might again be preparing to remove photovoltaics from the regime.
Solar Energy UK said the industry is already on track to more than double to almost 29 GW of generation capacity this decade, even without the policy and regulatory support it has demanded and which, it says, has been offered by the government to peers in the offshore wind sector.
The report claims the installation of a cumulative 40 GW of solar by 2030 would also bring “thousands of skilled jobs” to the U.K. as well as £17 billion (€19.8 billion) of extra economic activity.

In an update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday, PV panel glassmaker Xinyi Solar told shareholders first-half net profits are expected to at least double, compared to the HK$1.41 billion (US$182 million) previously anticipated.
While the news will be welcomed by investors, Xinyi Solar pointed out the rise in average selling prices for solar glass witnessed – compared to the first six months of last year – would lift profits despite the fact prices have fallen “substantially” in the current three-month window.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
With the solar glass price currently on the downward slope, Xinyi Solar warned: “The performance of the group’s solar glass segment for the remaining months of 2021 could be affected.”
Sister company Xinyi Energy also announced an uplift in solar electricity revenues thanks to solar projects it has acquired since July, with its net profits for the first six months of this year expected to come in 25-40% higher than the HK$438 million predicted.
But it was the performance of the solar glass business controlled by Xinyi Glass shareholders which was cited as one of two contributors to an anticipated 260-290% uplift in first-half net profits at the float glass maker, which is effectively Xinyi Solar's parent.
Whilst rising income from float glass sales was also mentioned, photovoltaic products will contribute significantly to a thumping rise in profit to HK$4.98-5.39 billion (US$642-694 million).
The Xinyi updates came hours after fellow Chinese manufacturer Flat Glass announced plans to issue up to RMB4 billion (US$625 million) worth of convertible bonds, with RMB2.8 billion (US$437 million) of the proceeds earmarked for solar glass production and distributed solar project capacity.
Flat Glass said the proposed fundraising exercise, which will be voted on by shareholders at its AGM, would generate RMB1.95 billion towards the RMB2.39 billion cost of a solar glass factory to make 750,000 tons per year of ultra thin, ultra high transparent products. Some RMB197 million (US$30.8 million) would pay most of the RMB207 million cost of a fab to produce 15 million square meters of solar PV ultra white glass, and RMB658 million (US$103 million) would be put towards RMB665 million worth of solar generation capacity.
With the figures rounded off by pv magazine, Flat Glass said RMB1.2 billion from the bond issue would be added to its working capital.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/17/is-large-scale-solar-ready-for-the-north-pole/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORWAY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 17, 2021",Is large scale solar ready for the North Pole?,"A group of scientists from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, the University Centre in Svalbard, and Norway-based consultancy Multiconsult, has sought the assess the technical feasibility of large scale PV projects in polar regions and has investigated, in particular, the performance of a small-scale, ground-mounted, solar array in the Adventdalen valley in Svalbard, which is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean located halfway between Norway and the North Pole.
The small facility was south oriented and built with the panels having a tilt angle of 30 degrees. The module rows have a distance of 5.5m and the panels are placed at a height of 1.3m. Timber poles with a length of 12m are used as ballast to protect the arrays from high wind speeds.
The fixed-tilt installation relies on an off-grid inverter provided by California-based specialist CyboEnergy and several 265 W monofacial modules of type JKM265P, provided by Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar. The panels were installed on a wooden rack in opposite directions, with some facing the sky and some facing the ground. “A bifacial module was installed as well but was covered by the snowdrifts during the beginning of the production season and suffered significant power production losses,” the researchers specified.
Solar power generation was registered only between March 5 and October 19, when the region was hit by enough sunlight to make the facility go into operation. From mid-November to mid-January, there isn't any sunlight at all in the area.
When tests were performed, the scientists observed snowdrifts forming on the leeward side of the plant, and saw that these melted entirely between the winters. “The results show an increase of drift length, height and volume with the time of exposure in the field,” the Norwegian group explained, noting that accumulation mainly occurs at the leeward side of the PV array, which is the side that faces away from the wind.
The snowdrifts on the plant, they further explained, are similar to those produced by porous snow fences. A snow fence is an artificial barrier that forces wind or drifting snow to accumulate in a desired place. “The similarity indicates that snow-fence theory can be applied to PV arrays and used to control snowdrift accumulation in solar power plants,” they also stated. “The design can be adapted so that snow is deposited in designated areas (as with snow fences) or so that the deposition is minimized.”
Furthermore, the academics found that snow accumulation can also be lowered by shifting the azimuth, array tilt, and bottom gap of the PV array. “However, the influence of the rack itself should be taken into account in such cases,” they emphasized. “The finding also indicates that if the attack angle in the field measurement set-up was 90 degrees instead of 30-45 degrees, the length and cross section area of the snowdrifts could increase by up to 50%.”
Their findings can be found in the paper Polar solar power plants – Investigating the potential and the design challenges, which was recently published in Solar Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/17/n-type-solar-development/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JUNE 17, 2021",N-type solar development,"From pv magazine 06/2021
It is estimated that by the end of 2021 there will be around 400 GW of mono PERC capacity, doubling the 2020 volume. There will be at least 280 GW of cell capacity, calculating 182 mm and 210 mm cells only. Amid the serious capacity surplus, Tier-1 cell manufacturers could only keep slim profits in the first quarter, with only 1-3% of profit left for mono PERC cells.
Demand growth
PV manufacturers have not changed their target markets. Chinese n-type TOPCon manufacturers mainly target utility-scale projects, but the power output of modules assembled with large p-PERC cells has reached beyond 500 W, outshining n-type, despite its efficiency advantage.Silver prices remain high, hindering the development of HJT cells with higher silver paste consumption. This means slower demand for n-type products.
Non-China n-type module manufacturers, on the other hand, focus on residential and C&I rooftop projects. Outside China, Panasonic withdrew from solar and Maxeon announced PERC cell capacity expansion plans. In a competitive cell market, foreign manufacturers also began to develop strategies for the future. Mature markets including Europe, the U.S., and Japan, where demand is rather stable, will remain the major overseas markets.
The large-scale capacity expansion and economies of scale of p-PERC makes it difficult for n-type to compete. With the rising cost of raw materials and sluggish demand, n-type cell production declines to around 6 GW, and market share slips from 5% in 2020 to 4% this year.

PERC Module

TOPCon Module

HJT Module
N-type capacity
Orders for n-type products remain low. Manufacturers mainly gear up for n-type technology this year, with capacity significantly higher than production. Having expanded, mono PERC now sees signs of decrease in profitability. Several manufacturers revealed that they will stop adding PERC capacity, as it’s already in surplus. Projects for the second half of the year are mostly n-type technology roadmaps or high-end technology research. It will take a while for n-type technology to reach large-scale commercial production.
Progress by larger manufacturers in 2021 will determine whether n-type can achieve mass production. The industry is watching whether Longi’s TOPCon and Tongwei’s 1 GW HJT capacity expansion projects materialize by early 2022, bringing costs down. Eyes are also on the yield rate of TOPCon and the selection of equipment for these processes.
Equipment capex for TOPCon dropped in 2020 to a level slightly higher than PERC. Taking into account equipment compatibility and the ability to increase cell efficiencies after switching from PERC to TOPCon, many new PERC production lines have been earmarked for upgrade to TOPCon. If TOPCon process can help increase efficiencies of existing cells and stabilize yield rate, real TOPCon capacity and production will exceed HJT. Technically, manufacturers are still choosing between LPCVD and PECVD, and the issue of wraparound polysilicon layer remains to be solved.
HJT processing is simpler and has advantages on yield rate and efficiencies. After introducing light-soaking last year, overall cell efficiencies increased to more than 24%. However, cost reduction remains a bottleneck. With the emergence of Chinese HJT equipment suppliers and their continued optimization, the capex for a 1 GW HJT cell production line has declined to CNY 450 million ($61 million)/GW. In addition to cost reduction through decreased equipment capex, adopting multi-busbars or smart wire interconnection can drive efficiencies up and silver paste consumption down. Meanwhile, R&D in silver pastes continues, hoping for a technical breakthrough with different materials.
High costs put most manufacturers in wait-and-see mode. Except for Tongwei and HuaSun, most capacity expansion projects this year are at pilot scale. Future development depends on whether HJT expansion in the second half can bring down the cost per watt. The depreciation of equipment brings limited cost reduction, after equipment costs declined from an annual CNY 800 million/1 GW last year to this year’s CNY 450 million/ 1 GW. Further cost reduction can only depend on the advancement of silver paste technology, as well as economies of scale. For HJT capacity and production to grow in the long term, HJT must narrow the gap of costs with p-type.
Continuous progress
TOPCon and HJT both see continuous progress in cost control and efficiencies. The two are projected to see expansion in capacity and production in the next one to three years. However, TOPCon has advantages over HJT in order volume and capacity expansion, as it is easier to be upgraded from PERC. As a result, TOPCon will outpace HJT in terms of capacity and production in the short term. If costs for equipment and silver paste can decrease continuously while production volume increases, HJT will have more room for cost reduction for each high-cost material. Moreover, as HJT cell efficiencies continue to improve, its capacity and production will grow long term.
TOPCon and HJT face challenges in the large wafer transition. While 182 mm and 210 mm will become the mainstream format for p-type in the second half of the year, it remains a barrier for n-type to overcome stability issues using large wafers. If n-type cells made with large wafers can go into mass production in the next two years, costs will fall immediately.
Mono PERC is showing signs of decline after large-scale expansion, so it becomes increasingly important to prepare for next-generation technologies. But as it will take time for n-type to reach commercial production, large manufacturers’ materialization of capacity expansion projects, the degree of cost reduction, mass production efficiency, as well as yield rate control, 2021 and 2022 will be a key period for the evaluation of manufacturers.

Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) has confirmed that work has started on its AUD 60 million (USD 45.7 million) Dalby hybrid power plant, which will feature 2.4 MW of solar PV capacity and a 2.5 MW/5 MWh battery. It will be the first battery energy storage system (BESS) the company has developed in Australia.
FRV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Abdul Latif Jameel, said the plant will be connected to Ergon’s distribution network. This will allow it to supply and take electricity from the grid and trade in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
FRV Australia Managing Director Carlo Frigerio said the hybrid facility is designed to be operated as a predictable and dispatchable generation plant. The system will have the ability to access the maximum number of markets and revenue streams, including arbitrage and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS).
“Battery energy storage systems are needed to support further investment in Queensland renewables and help maintain system security and reliability,” Frigerio said. “This project will be critical to Queensland’s future energy supply and security as renewable energy capacity increases, with storage supporting solar and wind power coming into the market when it is most needed. The inclusion of PV as part of the project shows the importance of integrating solar and batteries in order to deliver dispatchable power.”
Construction of the project is scheduled to be completed in December. The facility is expected to be fully operational by early 2022.
FRV Global Managing Director Felipe Hernandez said the Dalby project is part of the company’s  long-term investment plan to develop energy storage projects throughout the world.
“FRV is already collaborating with governments, regulators, and partners around the world to lay the foundations for a new energy model,” Hernandez said. “Energy storage will play a central and critical role to fully realize the power of renewable energy, and FRV acknowledges the value of this technology as a key element to achieve a decarbonized society.”
The Dalby Hybrid Power Plant is FRV’s ninth project in operation or under construction across the NEM, including the 125 MW Lilyvale Solar Farm in Queensland, the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria, and the  69.75 MW Goonumbla Solar Farm in New South Wales.
FRV has also achieved financial close on the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm, commenced construction on the 90 MW Sebastopol Solar Farm, and continues to develop the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm, all in New South Wales.
The Dalby hybrid power plant is one of several battery energy storage systems planned for Queensland as the state government looks to continue its transition to renewable energy. Singapore-based Vena Energy, for example, is almost finished developing the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South BESS project. And state-owned energy company Stanwell is moving ahead with plans to develop a 150 MW/300 MWh battery next to the 1.4 GW Tarong power station site near Nanango.
In addition, the Queensland state government has announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries. They will have a combined capacity of 40 MWh and will be installed across the state as part of a community battery trial.

General Motors said this week that it will increase its EV investments to $35 billion through 2025.
The automaker made an initial commitment in March 2020 to invest $20 billion over the same time period, including capital, engineering expenses and other development costs. Last November, it increased that total to $27 billion.
In January, GM said that it plans to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040. The company worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop what the automaker called “a vision of an all-electric future.”
To reach its goals, GM outlined plans to transition to electric vehicles or other zero-emissions vehicle technologies. It said that it also planned to source renewable energy and leverage “minimal offsets or credits.” The automaker said at the time that it believed that the energy sector was “well on its way to a decarbonized grid” and that an all-electric future would be supported by renewable infrastructure and technology.

Demand driver
In a supply chain review of strategic parts of the U.S. economy, the White House shone a spotlight earlier this month on U.S. battery manufacturing capacity for electric vehicles and for stationary applications. The report showed that the automotive industry will likely drive demand for batteries, with worldwide sales projections of 56 million passenger EVs in 2040, of which 17% (about 9.6 million EVs) would be in the U.S. market. The report said that if all batteries for EVs in the U.S. market were manufactured abroad, it would result in roughly $100 billion in imports.
GM’s newly announced investments include:
GM also confirmed plans to launch its third-generation HYDROTEC fuel cells with greater power density and lower costs by mid-decade. GM manufactures its fuel cells in Michigan in a joint venture with Honda.
The company said last November that it would deliver 30 new EV models by 2025 globally, with two-thirds available in North America. In its latest update, GM said it will add electric commercial trucks and other products to its North America plan that will use its Ultium Platform. In addition, GM will add U.S. assembly capacity for EV SUVs. Details will be announced later.
