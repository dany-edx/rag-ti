Among them is a pressurized alkali electrolyser of the new generation S+, which Sunfire will deliver for the first time in the order of 10 MW,” the companies said in a note released Wednesday. In addition, the first hydrogen filling station in the Uckermark region of northeastern Germany is being built at the Prenzlau site, which will be supplied with the green hydrogen produced on site. Enertrag will connect the hydrogen center directly to the Uckermark combined power plant, which has a renewable generation capacity of more than 600 MW. “The green hydrogen is to be used for the mobility sector and in particular for local public transport in the region,” the companies added. “Enertrag will be responsible for marketing the produced hydrogen, which can also be supplied to customers by means of trailers.” Due to an increased power density, the new system is expected to record an improved efficiency compared to the previous generation. “It is important for us to produce our green hydrogen from regionally generated, renewable electricity, thus relieving the burden on the electricity grids and making good use of surplus electricity,” said Manuela Blaicher, head of Enertrag's Power-to-X division. Blaicher recently joined the company from Deutsche Bahn. She previously worked at Engie Deutschland and Boston Consulting Group. Enertrag and Sunfire are already collaborating on other projects, including in the cement sector. Sunfire in 2014 opened what is reportedly the world’s first power-to-liquid demonstration plant in Dresden, where it produces renewable e-fuels such as diesel, naphtha, and waxes.
U.S.-based hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck company Hyzon Motors has signed an MoU with Shanghai Hydrogen HongYun Automotive for the purchase of 500 hydrogen-powered electric trucks. “Under the non-binding MoU, the initial order of 100 vehicles is expected before the end of 2021 while the other 400 vehicles will be ordered in 2022,” reads the note released on Thursday. Apart from its assets and facilities in the US, Hyzon Motors also has international operations in the Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and China. “Hydrogen fuel cell technology has been adopted more quickly in China than in the rest of the world,” said Hyzon CEO Craig Knight.
US-based multinational energy corporation Chevron and Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer, signed an agreement to develop hydrogen demonstration projects in transportation and stationary power applications. “The goal of the collaboration is to confirm the feasibility and performance of hydrogen for use as a commercially viable alternative to traditional fuels for line-haul rail and marine vessels. The collaboration also seeks to demonstrate hydrogen’s use in prime power,” the companies said on Wednesday. Chevron is eying opportunities in the heavy-duty transportation and industrial sectors. This week, it also signed an MoU with Delta and Google to track sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) test batch emissions data using cloud-based technology, while also penning a letter of intent with Colorado-based renewable chemicals and biofuels company Gevo to jointly build new facilities that would process inedible corn to produce sustainable aviation fuel.
Malaysian state-run oil and gas company Petronas and Japanese petroleum company Eneos have signed an agreement to jointly develop a competitive, clean hydrogen supply chain between Malaysia and Japan. “The MoU will see both parties embark on a technical-commercial joint-study of a hydrogen supply chain which includes hydrogen production and its transportation in methylcyclohexane (MCH) form, where hydrogen is converted from its original gaseous state into a liquid form to enable large volume deliveries,” reads a statement released by Petronas on Friday. Petronas and Eneos will also explore low carbon hydrogen production from Petronas’ petrochemical facilities “and in the future, green hydrogen produced by renewable energy.”
Australian petroleum exploration and production company Woodside has joined five South Korean parties in the HyStation project, which aims to construct and operate hydrogen refueling stations to service public transport bus fleets in the Asian country. “Woodside is the only foreign direct investor in HyStation from the energy sector, joining South Korean state-owned gas company KOGAS, Hydrogenic Energy Fund (of which Hyundai Motor Company holds a majority share), Samsung C&T, Industrial Bank of Korea and Hyundai Rotem,” reads the announcement published on Friday. The Korea Development Bank has agreed to provide financing support for the new company.
HyStation wants to accelerate the conversion of bus fleets from diesel to hydrogen, with hydrogen produced on site through natural gas reforming. The first hydrogen bus refueling station is expected to begin operation by the end of 2022. The investment in HyStation follows Woodside’s investment in HyNet, which operates 16 hydrogen refueling stations, with more nearing completion.
The German energy sector is calling on the future government to foster a strong domestic market for hydrogen to contribute to a globally competitive hydrogen industry. “We appeal to the future German government to create the conditions for an ambitious hydrogen production through offshore wind energy,” wrote eight industry groups (BWO, DWV, EEHH, EE.SH, IG Metall Coast, Foundation Offshore-Winden-Ergie, WAB, and the AquaVentus Forderverein), saying that hydrogen imports will not be enough. The German government, alongside several German companies, are eying import opportunities, speaking with governments and companies in South America, North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. “The National Hydrogen Strategy must be further concretised. For the production of green hydrogen, this means setting binding expansion targets and creating a road map for offshore wind to hydrogen. In view of the Federal Constitutional Court ruling of 24 March 2021, planning beyond 2030 is necessary in view of the expected implementation times and the increasing demand for green hydrogen production, including the necessary infrastructure.” The expansion targets for offshore hydrogen must be set in addition to the expansion target of 40 GW at sea for the electricity sector, wrote the industry groups. The eyes are now on the northwestern end of the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea. The associations also call for the construction of hydrogen pipelines. “The possibility of a hydrogen transport pipeline must be explicitly provided for in the spatial development plan for the North Sea,” they wrote. The groups also demanded that a ban in the land development plan for the SEN-1 offshore development area be deleted. The associations are additionally calling for a collective pipeline that would allow cooperation between North Sea states, a change in criteria used to evaluate transport systems, and the development of an awarding system. German federal elections will be held on September 26.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/10/eupvsec-2021-key-takeaways/,"EVENTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",EUPVSEC 2021 – Key takeaways,"The 38th edition of the European PV Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition (EU PVSEC) opened with a statement from European commissioner for energy Kadri Simson, who referred to solar as “a golden thread running through each of the [EU climate] policies,” and told the audience that the industry has “the green light from the commission.”
This level of optimism has carried throughout the conference. Presentations and discussions throughout the week have begun with the assumption that solar has a key role to play in the energy system, and focused on the most effective ways to achieve this without also creating additional problems in sustainability, materials consumption, grid stability and other areas. pv magazine’s takeaways from the event reveal an industry heading down the right path from the crossroads it stood at after last year’s event.
The concept of a 100% renewables-based energy system has been around for a while. In earlier days it was laughed, and more recently has been treated as a faraway ideal that might happen some time in the future. With many regions targeting full decarbonization only by 2050, such an energy system is still quite far off. However, the conference featured much discussion of how a 100% renewable energy system could be built and operated.
A panel discussion on Wednesday afternoon brought PV’s role in this into focus, and the importance of moving investments away from fossil fuel infrastructure, and building a system based on microgrids and energy communities and powered primarily by solar. Other topics, including manufacturing and recycling were also addressed with the assumption that we’ll see a massive increase in solar installations in coming years.
Grid integration also emerged as a key topic in this year’s conference, with much discussion around getting solar-generated electricity onto grids. This included plenty of new innovations in weather & power output forecasting for large-scale plants, as well as sector coupling, hydrogen, and other ways to ensure stable energy supply from a system led by solar.
In some ways, it has been a fairly quiet year for cell and module technologies, with larger dimensions taking the place of progress in cell efficiencies or module energy yield. But there is plenty more on the horizon, as was in evidence at EU PVSEC
Tandem cell technologies were much discussed throughout the week. Though we’ll still have to wait a few years before we see them produced at anything like the current scale of silicon PV, these are surely the most exciting thing in the PV technology pipeline. A panel discussion held on Thursday afternoon with several leading perovskite researchers provided one of the highlights of the event. This brought the broad conclusion that perovskites are almost certainly the best material for the top cell in a tandem device, and that we will first see a wave of perovskite-silicon tandem cells, with dual-perovskite devices and possibly combinations with CIGS and other thin-film materials likely to follow.

The past couple of years have shown that even simply changing the size of a PV module can have big implications to its reliability, and to confirming reliability and performance through accelerated testing.
With several completely new PV technologies set to appear on the market in the next few years, and a whole new landscape of testing standards, handling/installation guidelines, and much more will have to be developed alongside this. At EU PVSEC this was particularly evident for perovskites, with sessions dedicated to developing standards both for laboratory testing and measuring outdoor performance.
But reliability in the current generation of PV technology is no less important, and this was demonstrated with the awarding of the Becquerel Prize to Ulrike Jahn, for her many years of work on improving reliability across the PV supply chain, and her leadership of Task 13 of the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS), which is focused on research into the performance, operation and reliability of PV systems.
Solar has long had the potential to be integrated into other industries and environments, and the large amounts of land required by large-scale solar plants is a growing concern in many regions. Aside from floating PV, however, applications like building-integrated or vehicle integrated solar have remained only a small niche.
Based on presentations at several sessions held on Thursday, change is on the way here, with many new innovations on show, particularly for modules designed as building materials that can be manufactured in a variety of different colors and surface textures. Further presentations made the case for vehicle integrated PV to extend the range of an electric car, and made the case for agrivoltaics with various approaches to dual land use for solar and farming.

SSFG and First PV are also planning to set up an R&D center devoted to BIPV technologies.
State-owned China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) has sold 1.97 TWh of green power on China’s green power trading platform in its first day of operation. The list of buyers include BASF, Shell, Linde, Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group, and inverter manufacturer Sungrow, among others. The trading mechanism, launched this week, will initially include solar and wind power and could be extended to hydro and other renewable energy sources.
Inverter manufacturer Ginlong Solis announced a strategic cooperation agreement with the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), China's largest energy company. Ginlong said the two companies would work more closely in developing joint renewable energy projects but did not provide further details.
Wafer producer Zhonghuan Semiconductor announced that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had approved its plan to raise RMB 9 billion ($1.39 billion) via private bond issuance. The company said it would use the funds for its new 50 GW wafer manufacturing facility in the city of Yinchuan, the provincial capital of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region. The factory will produce wafers measuring 210 mm. The internal rate of return (IRR) of the bonds is 38.44%, and the payback period (PBP) is estimated to be 4.21 years.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/10/cylindrical-solar-panel-for-street-lighting/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",Cylindrical solar panel for street lighting,"Italian start-up Fly Solartech Solutions Srl has developed a lightweight cylindrical solar panel that can be integrated onto PV-powered street lighting lamp posts of different sizes. 
The Fly Solartech module is encapsulated in thermoformable plastic technical polymers and relies on a white backsheet. It is available in three versions with a power output of 100, 120, and 240 W.
The most powerful device measures 180 x345 x3.10mm and weighs in at 5 kg. It is built with 84 half-cut monocrystalline cells with an efficiency of 23.4% and has an open-circuit voltage of 12.78 V for each string. The overall efficiency of the 240 W panel is 17.3% and its temperature coefficient is -0.32%.
“The product is divided into two halves which are assembled together to embrace the post,” the company's CEO, Davide Zanatta, told pv magazine. “Each half is composed of two strings of cells that are not interconnected with each other but each with its own junction box.” This configuration allows deploying more cylindrical modules around the same post and connecting them in series and maximizing their output through multi-channel maximum power point tracking (MPPT).

“The thermoformable technical polymers allow shaping the product in its cylindrical shape without incurring internal micro-cracking and maintaining the range of curvature that the cells themselves are is able to absorb,” Zanatta further explained.
The product has a diameter of almost 35 cm including the fixing structures and can be applied on any commercial post with a diameter ranging from 10 to 25 cm. This, according to the manufacturer, also allows for excellent ventilation between the interspace created between the panel and the pole, triggering a natural chimney effect that induces a continuous airflow between the backsheet and the post vertically.
Each cylinder is incorporated in two aluminum fixing collars placed on the external ends of the panel and two lateral guides that allow the perfect closure of the two halves. “Its cylindrical nature allows it to withstand strong winds as well as its vertical application allows limiting to a minimum the deposits of dirt and sand as well as snow accumulation,” Zannatta emphasized.
The product can also be made with an anti-glare protective coating to allow its application on roads and highways where the use of an anti-reflection product is necessary. “The is also easily applicable as a retrofit solution, as it is possible to install the junction box between panel and pole by means of special brackets,” Zanatta concluded.
The product comes with a 10-year product warranty and 20-year performance guarantee.
When asked about the general skepticism around cylindrical PV panels after the bankruptcy of US manufacturer Solyndra in 2011, Zanatta said since then almost everything had changed in the solar market. “One of the weak points of Solyndra was that the panel efficiency was rated at 10-12% and this product was competing on a roof solar market that had better economic and technical options,” he stated. “Our product, instead, is using the latest technologies in terms of efficiency and manufacturing process and it is targeted to fill a very specific demand of the solar market for public lighting, which means the need for panels that do not visually disfigure the environment, that minimizes the need for cleaning them and most important of all that they can be used as a retrofit on poles already installed.”
The panels that are now used for public lighting applications are basically standard panels installed on the pole head, he added. This does not allow them to be installed on existing poles because they need lamps and poles that allow them to be housed at the top of the pole. Moreover, they have higher cleaning costs, and being in a horizontal position tens of meters high, they become easy support for birds and their excretions as they are covered by snow during winter.
Fly Solartech Solutions Srl is based in San Daniele del Friuli, in the northern Italian region of Friuli Venezia-Giulia. It currently owns and operates a 40 MW factory in Tolmezzo, in the same region. “Our plan is to expand the capacity to 100 MW over the next three years,” Zanatta added. The company also develops flexible and lightweight photovoltaic panels, which can be integrated into building envelopes but also in automotive, marine, public lighting, and military applications.

Engie Green, a unit of French energy giant Engie, has begun construction on a 29 MW solar carport at the factory of Netherlands-based car manufacturer Stellantis in Sochaux, in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in eastern France.
The carport, which is being developed with 64,000 solar modules on a surface of 22 hectares, is intended to cover 30% of the factory's electricity demand and is expected to come online in October 2022.
Described by its developer as the largest project of its kind in France to date, the solar carport will host some 10,000 vehicles.
The project is part of a plan to make the manufacturing facility completely carbon-free over the next years.
The second-largest solar carport under construction in France is a 17 MW facility located at Disneyland Paris. France's Urbasolar, a subsidiary of Switzerland-based Axpo, is developing the project, which will include 67,500 solar panels across a surface spanning 17 hectares.
The facility will produce enough renewable energy to supply around 17% of the park's current electricity consumption.

The new funds add to the €20 million the regional government had devoted to the program in October 2020.
“The initial allocation of €20 million allowed the funding of 466 applications out of 921 admitted,” the regional government said in a statement. “Thanks to the new funds, all the remaining 455 applications remaining in the ranking will be financed.”
The scheme is open to two different kind of projects – installations of PV systems linked to storage systems, and the deployment of standalone storage systems linked to existing solar arrays. For the first project category, the rebates will cover 50% of purchase and installation costs. This percentage could go up to 90% for projects developed by small municipalities.
The second category of rebates will cover 100% of project costs, with “50% of the approved rebate to be paid in 2021,” the regional authorities said. The second tranche, equal to 30% of the total, will be paid in 2022. “The remaining sum will be paid in 2022, once the project is completed.”
This scheme and other smaller schemes implemented by the region in previous years have become the main growth driver for the residential storage segment in Italy. According to recent figures from local renewables association ANIE Rinnovabili, the country had 43,784 storage systems linked to renewable energy power generators at the end of March. These storage systems have a combined capacity of 212.1 MW and a maximum storage capacity of 333.0 MWh.
According to these figures, just four of the batteries are not connected to a solar power generator and most of the devices – 42,274 for a total capacity of 206.5 MW/319.1 MWh – are based on lithium-ion technologies, with the remaining share being represented by lead batteries and other unspecified technologies.

Indian developer ReNew Power has announced the commissioning of 250 MW of solar capacity in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The capacity is part of a 300 MW Interstate Transmission System (ISTS) PV project won by ReNew Power in the third tranche of a competitive auction held by Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI). 
ReNew Power expects the remaining 50 MW of capacity to be commissioned by the end of this month.
The solar project is located in the Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan and has a 25-year power purchase agreement with SECI. It will supply clean electricity to the state of Bihar at a tariff of INR 2.55/kWh ($ 0.035). The project is also expected to provide direct employment to around 600 people.
Renew Power has installed fixed-tilt monocrystalline modules and string inverters. It will also use robotic module cleaning at the site to help conserve water in the desert conditions of the project site.
Sumant Sinha, the chairman and CEO of ReNew Power, said the company was able to commission the project according to budget and within the stipulated time frame, despite pandemic-related challenges.
“With this commissioning, ReNew Power continues to contribute significantly to India’s growing renewable energy capacity, in line with the country’s ambitious targets of achieving a capacity of 450 GW by 2030. This is the first project to be commissioned after ReNew started trading on Nasdaq and is another step toward ReNew achieving close to 18 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2025,” he said.
ReNew claims to be India’s leading renewable energy independent power producer. It develops, builds, owns, and operates utility-scale wind and solar energy projects, as well as distributed-generation PV projects. Its holding company, ReNew Energy Global, listed shares on the Nasdaq in August 2021, and trades under the ticker “RNW.”
As of Aug. 31, ReNew Power had a 10.2 GW project portfolio, including 5.8 GW of operational wind, solar and hydropower projects in India. The rest is under construction or in the pipeline.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/10/co-evaporated-perovskite-solar-cell-with-20-6-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",Co-evaporated perovskite solar cell with 20.6% efficiency,"Scientists from Singapore's Energy Research Institute at Nanyang Technological University have developed a co-evaporated perovskite solar cell with strong power conversion efficiency and good thermal stability.
“These cells could be used for a variety of applications,” researcher Annalisa Bruno told pv magazine. “In our, work we proved for the very first time the versatility of the thermal evaporation process in customizing the perovskite absorber for different architectures.”
The cell has a “p-i-n” layout and relies on co-evaporated MAPbI 3 films. The co-evaporation process used by the researchers allows the production of graded, customizable perovskite layers without adding extra layers or an additional passivation step. Background pressure is slowly decreased during the evaporation process to achieve the desired Fermi levels. These define the efficient conversion of energy of radiation into electrochemical energy.
Controlling and monitoring the growth and composition of lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) during co-evaporation in forming the cell perovskite absorber is the main challenge of this manufacturing step. Different electron and hole-transporting materials (HTMs) were tested on the cell and the best performing device had an HTM made of [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid, which is also known as MeO-2PACz.
The champion cell, based on self-assembled monolayer (SAM) MeO-2PACz, achieved what the academics have described as a record efficiency of 20.6% and two different cells, based on 2,2“,7,7”-tetra(N,N-di-p-tolyl)amino-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-TTB) and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as HTMs, reaching 20.3% each.
“The narrow power conversion efficiency distribution for perovskite solar cells using the three different HTLs highlights the good reproducibility of these co-evaporated devices,” the research group said, noting that when the spiro-TTB device was scaled up to sizes of 1 cm2 and 1.96 cm2, its efficiency reached 19.1% and 17.2%, respectively.
“These unencapsulated co-evaporated p-i-n perovskite solar cells exhibit remarkable long-term stability, retaining 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency for over 1000 h on storage at room temperature,” the researchers said.
According to Bruno, these large-area devices are the most efficient co-evaporated perovskite solar cells of this size to date. The cells are also said to have remarkable thermal stability, as they retain more than 80% of the initial efficiency on thermal aging at 85 C for 500 hours.
“Given the developments of thermal co-evaporated perovskite over the last few years, we may be able to see these cells reaching commercialization within the next few years,” she said.
The scientists described the cell and related manufacturing technique in “Co-Evaporated MAPbI3 with Graded Fermi Levels Enables Highly Performing, Scalable, and Flexible p-i-n Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/10/cooling-pv-panels-with-water-and-cotton-mesh/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",Cooling PV panels with water and cotton mesh,"A group of Russian researchers has developed a new active technique to reduce the operating temperatures of solar modules that acts simultaneously on both sides of a panel.
The system, dubbed “dual surface cooling” by the scientists, is built with a 16 mm single polyvinyl chloride (PVC) perforated pipe applied on the upper part of the module that spreads water on the front and the rear surfaces and a cotton wick mesh that is applied on the rear surface and collects the water and spread it down the rear surface itself.
“One issue that this study minimizes is the loss of water through evaporation through the covering of the back surface of the panel with aluminum sheet which is also strategically perforated to allow the flow of air into the inner section of the enclosed area,” the academics explained. “This approach does not totally prevent the loss of water but minimizes its loss especially at the rear section of the panel.”
The water is provided by a tank that is placed at a height higher than the PV panel allowing the free flow of water to the module using gravity. A pump, however, is needed to pump the water back into the tank. The aluminum sheet captures the evaporating water and conveys it to a basin that is fixed beneath the PV panel, and this water is then recycled into the water tank to be reused. “Holes were created in the aluminum sheet in order to allow some level of air exchange in the inner section of the panel and the ambient air,” the Russian group highlighted.
The technique was tested on two panels with a size of 95×45 cm, an output of 30 W, and a tilt angle of 45 degrees each. The thermal imager Testo 875 was used to take infra-red thermal images for both panels during mid-day and a GM 1362-EN-01 temperature thermometer and 14 K-type thermocouples were utilized to measure the panel temperature. The performance of the system was compared to that of a reference system with no cooling system applied.
The measurements showed that the cooled system achieved an average temperature of 35.72 degrees Celsius while the uncooled one reached 59.27 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the cooled panel had an average power and voltage of 18.53 V and 13.03 W compared to 16.71 V and 10.00 W for the uncooled system. “Similarly, the cooled PV module recorded an average efficiency of 14.36% against 12.83% for the uncooled panel. This represents a difference of 1.53% which is an 11.9% improvement in the efficiency of the cooled panel,” the researchers emphasized.
“The system was tested in a real environment but we haven't evaluated the economics of the cooling mechanism,” researcher Ephraim Bonah Agyekum told pv magazine. Looking forward, the research team wants to add sieves to the basin beneath the panel to filter out dirt and to consider the effect of flow rate on the performance of the module.
The system is described in the study “Effect of dual surface cooling of solar photovoltaic panel on the efficiency of the module: experimental investigation,” which was recently published in Heliyon.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/10/pv-magazine-spotlight-a-pv-mounting-systems-for-bigger-format-solar-modules/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",pv magazine Spotlight: A PV mounting systems for bigger format solar modules,"Due to the increasing demand for more powerful PV modules, which ideally should not be more expensive, the dimensions are currently changing very quickly. This is because more power usually means a larger module area or the use of high-performance modules, which would make systems in the commercial sector much more expensive. Accordingly, increasingly large modules are being used, especially in the commercial segment. This is why we have designed our new IBC AeroFix G3 mounting system in such a way that there is considerably more leeway when it comes to module lengths and widths, and larger modules can also be installed. To achieve this, we have now equipped each support with a sophisticated tilt joint. This ensures mechanically stress-free support of the modules. In addition, we have also enlarged the supports, as the installation angle should not change despite the increasingly wide modules. More information on the tilt joint and its function can be found in the pv magazine Spotlight on September 23.
In the upcoming pv magazine Spotlight on September 23, Johannes Cayé, Product Manager for the IBC AeroFix G3, will walk through the development of IBC Solar’s mounting system and the features which make it adaptable to modules with lengths from 1,500 to 2,100 mm and widths from 980 to 1,150 mm. Register for free
Of course, a module's durability depends primarily on the module itself. For example, it depends on how rigid the frame and the glass of the module are. There are quite serious differences in the market. To enable consistent flexibility of the module and not to bend the frame over a rigid support edge, the aforementioned tilt joint comes into play. Thanks to this, the module rests on the mounting rail without tension. This in turn minimizes the risk of cell damage and associated power losses.
The various design options of the AeroFix G3 also facilitate an increase in the maximum possible module load. However, this varies between module types. That’s why we test the maximum approvable load for each module and design variant individually by means of our in-house tests in the SUNLAB test laboratory. The customer can rest assured that IBC Solar modules and brackets are perfectly suitable for each other and that together they deliver maximum performance and service life.
Yes, for example, we have optimized the cable installation. The wide base rails have integrated cable ducts that can accommodate up to 28 6 mm² cables. The top supports are equipped with an extra shelf to attach a small cable duct or cable clips.
The wide and more affordable narrow eco base rails can also be combined as required for the first time. However, the roof construction and the maximum possible surface loads on the covered roof area must be suitable for this purpose. If this is the case, the combination of the profiles achieves even higher construction cost efficiency.
Detailed tests in the wind tunnel are not a requirement. Although there is the Eurocode DIN EN 1991-1-4:2010-12 which regulates the effects on structures, PV systems are not taken into account. As a quality provider and guarantor, IBC Solar is not prepared to be content with this. Therefore, dedicated tests in the wind tunnel are part of the standard procedure when we develop new products. This is the only way to determine realistic wind loads acting on the product. With these findings, we are able to design the AeroFix G3 as efficiently and economically as possible. This enables us, for example, to calculate the required ballast as low as possible and to design an aerodynamic system that usually does not require any screws or drilling and therefore does not penetrate or damage the roof cladding.
In addition, the system also meets the latest requirements of the Wind Technology Society.
In general, the aerodynamic systems segment is still very young. However, the knowledge base has increased over the past few years and the requirements for the tests are becoming increasingly precise. For example, there has been a change in the definition of roof zones. Previously, there were only three defined roof zones, on which the wind acted in varying degrees. Today, up to nine zones can be defined on the roof.
The capacity of a module is initially of secondary importance for the mounting and there is no difference in the assembly time per module. However, if the module becomes too long and too wide, you may have to install additional base rails and supports. This, of course, costs time and money. In addition, it must be noted that large modules can no longer be carried by a single installer due to their weight.
The regulations in Germany differ considerably compared to other European countries. While modules with a surface area of more than 2 m² may not be installed on roofs in Germany, for example, these modules are popular and permitted in other European countries.
In Sweden, black modules with a surface area of 2.2 m² are already being installed in the domestic sector. Next year, we expect an increase to approx. 540 Wp (2.5 m²). The reason for this is that in Sweden, the regulations stipulate that two people must work with one module on the roof. Therefore, it is more efficient if these modules are as large as possible.
Similar trends can also be seen in Spain and Poland. It is estimated that mainly modules with a capacity of 450 or 540 Wp will be used in the commercial sector next year. Depending on the manufacturer, this corresponds to an area of 2.2 m² or 2.5 m².
Overall, we expect that these large modules will make up 30-40% of the roof-mounted sector in the foreseeable future.
Every roof is different. If, for example, the roof has a lot of disturbing objects such as continuous roof lights, ventilation, or similar, it may be advisable to use smaller modules. In such cases, these allow better use of the area and it may even be the case that one module more per row fits on the roof. This means that the system may have the desired higher nominal output despite using smaller modules.

It all started when the international movement of goods met the Covid-19 pandemic. First, individual plants came to a standstill, preventing urgently needed goods from entering circulation. Container ships could not be utilized to capacity, and deliveries were delayed. By the time production resumed, at least in China, the virus had already reached the shipment hubs. Freight forwarders, ports and customs authorities could only operate at a much-diminished capacity, if at all. Employees were absent due to illness, seamen and dockworkers often had to go into quarantine, and the movement of goods could not flow freely. There were times when important overseas ports had to be closed and cordoned off for days on end. Due to these uncertainties, existing capacities at the shipping companies were reduced so as not to leave shippers with unused capacities and spiraling costs.
Demand comeback
Once uncertainty about the course of the pandemic had somewhat subsided in early 2021, the chaos in the global flow of goods really kicked in. As a result of lockdowns and working from home, there was a growing need to make home improvements and pursue a more sustainable lifestyle. After a lull of several months, consumption suddenly went crazy, at least in industrialized countries, and the solar industry was no exception.
Many stakeholders in Germany report a lucrative first half of the year. But shipping companies and freight forwarders had scaled back their capacities and were not prepared for a rapid increase in the volume of goods. In addition, many service providers and government agencies were still not operating at normal capacity. Within a short period, demand for transport far outstripped supply. Cargo ships were backed up outside ports, and as a result, turnaround times in the international flow of goods also increased by 20% to 30% compared to pre-pandemic levels.
The bottom line is that too many goods are waiting on too few ships worldwide, and logistics chains are not functioning as they should. As a result, freight rates have exploded since last fall. Whereas a container of sea freight from China to Rotterdam cost roughly $1,500 to $2,000 before the pandemic, prices have now skyrocketed to $15,000 to $18,000. In terms of module capacity, the freight component has increased tenfold from the previous level of around €0.004-€0.006/W, up to €0.05-€0.06/W. Transport costs thus no longer account for just 2% of the total price, but up to 20%.
Chinese manufacturers were quick to realize that such expensive products no longer sell well in Europe. In some cases, delivery quantities are being dialed back, and in others deadlines are being delayed until an affordable carrier can be found. The latest trick, however, is the attempt to pass on the freight risk for future deliveries to the buyer. Goods are no longer offered with the standard CIF/FCA Rotterdam or DDP Incoterms, delivery-inclusive to the building site or warehouse, but instead EXW or FOB – that is, ex-works or to the containership. This means that price increases for transport are fully borne by the customer, making it difficult or impossible to calculate the purchase price reliably or set a binding delivery date.
The concern is that few end customers will accept this uncertainty. For this reason, I strongly advise against accepting such contractual terms, at least as long as the freight traffic situation is so unpredictable. High transport costs permeate the entire value chain. Steadily rising prices for raw materials and semifinished goods are eroding the margins of manufacturers and retailers. When these costs are passed on to consumers, they fuel inflation. This is a vicious cycle that we can probably only break by increasing local value creation and reducing international freight traffic.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/10/australian-startup-sets-25-54-efficiency-record-for-silicon-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",Australian startup sets 25.54% efficiency record for silicon cell,"Sydney-based solar technology startup SunDrive has rocked the status quo, developing a silver-free solar PV cell and at the same time elevating the world efficiency record for a commercial-size silicon solar cell to 25.54%.
SunDrive said on Thursday night that it has received official word from Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) confirming it has set a world record for the efficiency at which its solar cells convert sunlight to electricity.
“SunDrive has officially set a new world record for a commercial size silicon solar cell,” the company posted on social media. “A proud milestone for the team that worked incredibly hard to achieve this.”

The result is a major shake-up for the industry, with China-based solar cell manufacturers topping the efficiency records in recent years. Manufacturing giant Longi Solar held the previous top mark for a commercial-size monocrystalline heterojunction (HJT) solar cell, achieving 25.26% during testing at ISFH earlier this year.
While SunDrive celebrated the world record, the company’s technology – which replaces the expensive silver used in conventional solar cells with cheaper and more abundant copper – could have greater ramifications, potentially lowering the manufacturing cost of solar PV panels.
Silver is a core component in today’s solar panels. It is estimated that solar panel manufacturing accounts for about 20% of the world’s annual consumption of the precious metal, with the volume expected to rise steeply as the next generation of high-efficiency cells currently being developed require up to three times more silver than their antecedents.
SunDrive’s solution, developed by Chief Executive Vince Allen during his PhD at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, has been to replace the precious metal with copper. Copper doesn’t have the same highly conductive properties as silver and does not adhere well to the surface of the solar cell, but Allen – who founded SunDrive in 2015 along with former flatmate David Hu – has found a solution. And a much more affordable one.
“The thing about copper is that it’s very abundant and usually about 100 times cheaper than silver,” Allen explained.
He said that finding more affordable and more abundant materials shapes as a stumbling block for the solar industry if it is to grow as predicted.
“We’re only at the very early stages of where the industry can be with only 3% of the world’s electricity currently coming from solar,” he said. “If we want to get to 50, 60, 70% and beyond, we’re going to need a lot more solar cells and that’s a massive challenge.”
Allen has previously said that SunDrive’s aim is to produce the cells locally. He is optimistic that they can compete with large solar manufacturers in Asia, while still protecting their intellectual property.
“The industry today is at a point where the land and labour costs are becoming less and less significant in the total cost of manufacturing … obviously it does mean that we need to at least match that similar level of automation and throughput, but we do see opportunity to do it in Australia,” he said.
Hu has said the company’s initial focus would be the rooftop sector, as he believes it is the ideal place for SunDrive’s technology to enter into the market. The limited space allows the most efficient solar cells to shine the brightest, producing more energy for every square foot, he explained.
The company has already attracted support from the industry, with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency providing AUD 3 million ($2.2 million) in funding to help scale its manufacturing process. Mike Cannon-Brookes, one of Australia’s wealthiest people, has backed the startup through Grok Ventures. Venture capitalist fund Blackbird has also provided support, while former Suntech CEO Shi Zhengrong was SunDrive’s first angel investor.

Clean Energy Associates (CEA), in an attempt to answer one of its most commonly asked questions, has released a new case study that compares the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of bifacial and mono PERC solar panels and outlines scenarios where each makes the most sense.
CEA said the crux of the issue is that bifacial modules promise an energy yield that is 6% to 10% greater than traditional mono PERC modules. But they also come with higher dollar-per-watt module costs, as well as higher expenses for balance of system (BOS) and installation. So when do the benefits outweigh the costs?
The answer can change depending on project location, size, and the other hardware used, especially trackers. Capturing bifacial’s value and its impact on a project’s bottom line over a 25-year to 30-year life cycle begins with the basic LCOE formula, (life-cycle cost of the project divided by lifetime energy production) but a litany of factors can change the values in both cost and production.
To make a base evaluation, CEA used PVsyst to model optimized layouts for the modules and locations they analyzed. After that, they priced all equipment, labor, design and engineering, permitting, overhead and margin, and other costs – except for the modules.
Their formula also inputs the estimated annual kilowatt-hours generated, the power purchase agreement (PPA) price, the investment tax credit, and operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Variables in the equation include the longer life cycles of bifacial panels – 25 to 30 years – and their higher BOS and installation costs. For the sake of simplicity, degradation and O&M were set at about 0.5% per year.
Once the full gauntlet of factors was accounted for, a “hurdle price” – a price below which a bifacial panel provides additional value, based on the LCOE of a sample single-face system – can be established. The hurdle price is then used to back-calculate the price-per-watt module value for one or more bifacial panels.
CEA prepared a hypothetical comparison between monofacial Module A, and two bifacials, Module B and Module C, for projects in Massachusetts and Mexico. For this hypothetical scenario, the goal was to see whether purchasing a large supply of one of the selected bifacial panels would make financial sense for the two locations.
Even with the very large differences in production and base LCOE related to location, Bifacial Module C delivered higher and comparable module value.
To wrap up the case study, CEA said that the model still has room for improvement, as it does not yet incorporate comparisons for the increasingly popular large-format modules that have hit the market. Larger modules require wider row spacing, which in turn could mean longer wire lengths and a resulting voltage drop. An LCOE module comparison can reveal the positive or negative value of these trade-offs.
