Tata Power Solar has commissioned India’s largest floating solar power project in Kayamkulam, Kerala.
The 101.6 MWp project was installed on a 350-acre body of water in Kerala. It is India’s first floating solar plant to benefit from a power purchase agreement. It will supply the power to Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB).
“This installation was completed within the scheduled timeline, despite the arduous challenges of variable water depths, high sea tides, and severe water salinity concerns faced throughout the project’s construction duration,” Tata Power said.
The plant includes a 5 MW inverter on a floating platform. The system is anchored with 134 cast pile foundations, bored to a depth of 20 meters underwater. 
The array had to be towed for 3 km on a sea-linked national waterway, which was 15 meters deep. The company then synchronized the 33/220 kV air-insulated substation with the existing 220 kV gas-insulated substation.
Separately, NTPC recently commissioned its 92 MW Kayamkulam floating solar project in Kerala. The array spans a number of reservoirs owned by NTPC’s Rajiv Gandhi Gas-based Power Station. NTPC switched on the initial 22 MW phase in March and the second 35 MW phase in May.

It said the half-cell modules offer power outputs ranging from 400 W to 410 W.
“The module has a weight of only 20 kg and can be handled and installed by one person easily,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “It is primarily suitable for residential and C&I rooftop installations.”
It is offering four versions of the product, with power conversion efficiencies ranging from 20.14% to 21.2%. They can be used with maximum system voltages of either 1,000 V or 1,500 V. Their open-circuit voltage ranges from 36.97 V to 37.45 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.41 A and 13.77 A.
The 54-cell M10 single-glass panels measure 1,708 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh in at 20 kg. They are built with 2.8 mm tempered anti-reflective glass and aluminum alloy frames. They may also feature IP67 or an IP 68 enclosures. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.33% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The single-glass version of the panel comes with 25-year linear power output guarantees and 12-year product guarantees. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.0% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.8% of the nominal output power. The double-glass version has a 30-year power output guarantee and the end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 85%.
DMEGC Solar said the panels can withstand snow loads of 5,400 Pa and wind loads of up 2,400 Pa.
The PV unit of the Chinese industrial group has around 2,200 employees and an annual module production capacity of 5 GW, plus 10 GW of cell capacity and 1.2 GW of wafer production lines. “Full black technology and small spacing technology are DMEGC Solar’s two unique innovations, which make the module has a completely black and consistent appearance, also improving the conversion efficiency of modules,” the spokesperson said.

Researchers at France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – a division of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – have developed new flexible perovskite solar modules.
They have a surface area of 11.6 square centimeters, with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.95% and a stabilized efficiency of more than 18.5%. INES said the performance is a world record for a flexible perovskite device larger than 10 square centimeters.
Currently, the power conversion efficiencies of solar devices based on perovskites indeed exceed 25% for single junctions and 29% in tandem structures with silicon. However, these results are obtained on small surfaces, of the order of 1 square centimeters.
To obtain this yield on larger surfaces, INES developed the flexible perovskite solar modules at low temperature on low-cost substrates made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). They used a very simple structure featuring five layers, including the electrodes.
The performance is obtained after encapsulation and the stability of the devices has been tested under damp heat conditions at 85 C, according to the standards used for silicon-based technologies. A stability of several hundred hours has been obtained – between 400 and 800 hours, depending on encapsulation – based on a standard objective of 1,000 hours.
To achieve this result, the CEA optimized the stacking of the layers of the cell to implement a three-step laser process for the production of the module. It also developed a flexible encapsulation process that is fully compatible with high gas barrier materials, with no initial loss.

The CEA's devices will be integrated into a demonstrator for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications by Flexbrick (Es), a member of the European consortium. The modules will be interconnected to obtain high voltages and will be tested according to building standards. In addition, stability tests in real conditions are currently being carried out.
The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) in Germany, a project partner, is testing the panels for indoor applications. The tests have already shown power conversion efficiencies of up to 24.5% at very low light (500 lux).
For some applications, the use of flexible substrates could be of interest for single-junction perovskite technology, because it could open the way to high-speed and low-temperature printing processes. It therefore becomes possible to use low-cost substrates unlike flexible inorganic technologies, such as CIGS, which require higher temperature processes and more expensive substrates.
Many teams around the world are trying to meet the challenges of making larger devices with sufficient stability for real-world applications. This is one of the tasks set by the partners of the European APOLO project.

In late spring, Slovakia-based solar data provider Solargis analyzed its monthly difference maps and discovered an alarming drop in solar irradiation in Spain due to bad weather. There was a 50% decrease in solar irradiation in March – the largest decline in 28 years and the most extreme since the start of satellite records in 1994.
By contrast, Germany and the Balkans recorded solar irradiation levels that were 45% higher in the month of March than the average of the last 28 years for the same month.
“Solar generation is 100% dependent on incident irradiation,” a Solargis spokesperson told pv magazine. “With 50% less irradiation, solar power generation will drop by 50%.”
Asier Ukar, managing director of PI Berlin SL, said that the drop in irradiation implies a decline in the efficiency of modules.
“The data sheet efficiency of solar modules is always calculated at nominal conditions, that is, 1,000 W/m2, at 25 C cell temperature and an AM of 1.5,” he said. “Therefore, in the simulations that are made for a project, in addition to wiring, dirt, and other factors, low irradiation is included, since it is one of the circumstances that imply that the performance ratio goes down.”
Spain is one of the sunniest countries in Europe and Germany plans to triple its solar capacity to 215 GW, so these significant deviations from average values are a challenge for project developers and investors. But they are also a problem for Europe's energy independence, as the continent's grid interconnections cannot accommodate the growth in renewables needed to meet climate goals.
“Controlling the climate is beyond our capabilities, however, by looking at Europe as an interconnected energy grid, rather than a specific country, there is potential to balance the market,” said Solargis CEO Marcel Suri. “Through the SERENDI-PV European project, we are working to improve the short-term forecast of added photovoltaic power, the evaluation and forecast of energy in the presence of snow, dust and extreme weather conditions, the improvement of simulations, the reduction of uncertainty to support the creation of an effective and modern digitized network.”

They looked at devices integrating PV and lithium-ion, zinc-ion, lithium-sulfur, lithium-iodine, zinc-iodine, lithium-oxygen, zinc-oxygen, and lithium-carbon dioxide storage systems.
“Despite the respective significant progress in rechargeable batteries and photovoltaic techniques in the past decades, integrating different rechargeable batteries with solar energy in an effective and low-cost way remains a great challenge,” they said.
They divided the battery technologies into two categories: closed-type photo-enhanced rechargeable metal batteries and open-type photo-enhanced rechargeable metal batteries. They analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each kind of battery.
As a general rule, photon-enhanced batteries with PV can provide better performance for low charge voltage and high energy density, which makes them suitable for smart electronics and optoelectronics. However, stability and safety should be improved to help such devices to reach commercial viability.
“For example, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which we are all familiar with because they are used in many modern electronic devices, including laptops, phones, and electric vehicles, are efficient, but would be difficult to scale for solar energy use because of their complicated structure,” they said.
The scientists noted the importance of standardizing experimental conditions and developing effective thermal management systems for stable operation.
“Standard experimental conditions conducive to the comparison of overall performance in different systems need to be established. For photo-enhanced rechargeable batteries, light illumination is indispensable,” they explained.
Thy introduced the battery technology in “Photo-enhanced rechargeable high-energy-density metal batteries for solar energy conversion and storage,” which was recently published in Nano Energy.
“It is necessary to explore more suitable electrode materials and optimize the device structure of the batteries,” said researcher Hairong Xue. “By addressing some critical challenges involving working mechanism, electrode materials, and battery structure design, the goal is to demonstrate viable uses of photo-enhanced rechargeable batteries in electronic and optoelectronic devices.”

The development of large-scale PV plants was particularly strong in the 2009-14 period, when generous feed-in tariffs were awarded under the so-called Conto Energia incentive programs, on top of favorable rules for approval processes and environmental permits were in place. 
Following this turbulent, dynamic phase – which saw the region host more than 2.5 GW of installed solar power in just a few years – social acceptance of solar parks began to decrease. The local authorities started to introduce more restrictions. In particular, the regional authorities approved a plan for the protection of the landscape (Piano Paesaggistico Territoriale Regionale – PPTR), which affects the potential to install PV plants in agricultural areas.
We discuss solutions for rapid implementation with State Secretary Oliver Krischer from the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Iberdrola, Meyer Burger and Solar Power Europe.

Over the course of two days, 60-plus speakers will participate in 10 sessions. They will discuss the most relevant topics for project developers, investors, and manufacturers along the solar value chain.
As a consequence, securing approvals in the region for solar parks became a real challenge, if not impossible. Investors started to look at other regions such as Sicily or Sardinia that recently introduced more flexible legislation for PV.
But not everything is lost for Apulia. A recent ruling from its Regional Administrative Court has shown that municipal and regional authorities must perform case-by-case reviews of projects and cannot deny them just because they are in agricultural areas.
“Many projects have been rejected just because they were in agricultural areas and, according to the plan for the protection of the PPTR, this may affect the agricultural landscape,” said Emilio Sani of law firm Sani Zangrando. “The court stressed that being in agricultural areas cannot be an obstacle in itself and in the evaluation of the project have to be considered its actual and specific features and in particular if it may combine agricultural activity and production of energy.”
The court accepted the claims of Italian developer X-Elio Italia 5 S.r.l. that the province of Taranto, the Italian Ministry for Cultural Assets and Environments, and the regional environmental agency ARPA had all contributed to denying the environmental impact assessment for a 68.4 MW solar park in the municipality of Ginosa.  
“This ruling is important for the ongoing procedures,” Sani said. “If the region will apply the principles of the court decision, the authorities in charge of the environmental assessment should perform a more in-depth analysis of the projects and grant a particular consideration to the projects combining agriculture and production of electrical energy.”
The court said the decision to deny the environmental approval depended on the agricultural nature of the site. However, according to the regional court, the authorities are not allowed to deny a priori authorizations for PV plants in agricultural areas.
“They can modulate, restrict or limit a project,” the court said. “They can introduce qualitative and quantitative limits, but they cannot prohibit.” 
The court did not make any references to national standards for agrivoltaics.
“For the purpose of the authorization, what has to be evaluated is just the possibility to continue or to restart the agricultural activities,” Sani explained. “The specific rules that are under development for agrivoltaic plants should not be relevant, as these are intended at specifying what is entitled to receive the incentives awarded through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR).”
The solar plant was to be built with PV panels at a height of 2 meters. It included long distances between the panel rows, with 95% of the available surface left for agricultural activities. Olive trees, tomatoes, melons, and peppers were to be grown at the facility.

This is due to the amount of paperwork that must be completed and the various authorities that are involved in such proceedings, usually with conflicting views.
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Marie Buchet, head of solar power at Syndicat des Énergies Renouvelables (SER), presented four different cases in which utility-scale solar plants faced major permitting delays due to issues regarding the modification of local urban plans.
“For all of these cases, we identify a common pattern: long and difficult processes due to the number of interlocutors with a sometimes diverging view,” she said.

In the course of two days, 60-plus speakers will discuss in 10 sessions the most relevant topics for project developers, investors, manufacturers and others along the solar value chain.
One of the projects is a solar facility that will be located on a former waste landfill site owned by a public institution for the EPCI, an inter-municipal cooperation agency in the French department of Vendée. The Department for Land and Coastal Management has asked the developer to change the project's zoning in the local urban plan, but the local association of municipalities oppose the change. 
“This project is currently halted and its developer seems to struggle against two opposing forces,” Buchet said.
Another example is a solar carport that will be built at an amusement park in Allier, a department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. The project was eligible to compete in the tenders of France's energy regulator, the Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie (CRE), but it was unable to participate because the local municipality took more than two years to convert the project site.
“This may not be the general rule in France, but it is definitely a quite frequent problem,” Buchet said.
The third case involves a solar project for a former landfill site in Gironde, Nouvelle-Aquitaine.
“Bordeaux Métropole had to change some rules in the Local Urban Plan which prevented any construction on the landfill. In order to make this plan compatible with the project, a simplified procedure was supposed to be launched, and would have allowed unifying the public consultations on the project,” Buchet explained. “The proceedings for public consultations are very long and the fact that the developers had to deal with a big municipality such as that of Bordeaux, made this simplified procedure inapplicable. The impact on the project was a one-year delay.”
The fourth case relates to a 60 MW solar plant designed to host sheep grazing. The project is located on a completely isolated site, relatively close to a connection point, but with no agricultural activity since 2017.
“Contact has been made with the town hall and they are in favor of setting up such a project,” Buchet said.
The developer is now waiting for deliberation from the municipal council in order to launch a declaration that would make the local urban plan compatible with the installation of a ground-mounted solar power plant.
“These proceedings take a lot of time, greatly delaying the project and whose procedures are not necessarily linked to the plant's building permit,” said Buchet.
The SER is currently calling for a one-stop shop to examine town planning and environmental authorizations.
“This would help to have a simultaneous review of all authorization proceedings, which would in turn simplify and accelerate the procedures for issuing authorizations,” Buchet said. “This proposal is in line with proposal 11.2.6 of the French Citizen's Climate Convention, which aims to set up a one-stop shop bringing together all the technical and administrative formalities necessary for the installation of renewable energy production projects It is also consistent with the legislative changes proposed by the European Commission in its REPowerEU plan: the commission proposes to set up a one-stop shop for granting authorizations.”

Everything is theoretically in place: the political will to expand solar energy, available land, and profitability.
However, the planning processes are unnecessarily complex, time-consuming, and slow. And this endangers the possibility of a rapid energy transition. The two parties in our example asked a local planning office to make a proposal.
“That's where it starts,” a spokesperson from the project developer told pv magazine, on the condition that we only identify him by the assumed name “Peter Cetin.”
“State planning requirements are general, but have nothing to do with the reality on site,” said Cetin.
In Schleswig-Holstein, for example, many large areas have been excluded by state spatial planning. Entire communities have been excluded, and individual cases are usually not considered. This is unfortunate because the area has thus far mostly been used for intensive agriculture.
“I don't understand how the deployment of a PV installation can be considered negative at all for nature compared to intensive agricultural use,” Cetin said.
We discuss solutions for rapid implementation with State Secretary Oliver Krischer from the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Iberdrola, Meyer Burger and Solar Power Europe.

In the course of two days, 60-plus speakers will discuss in 10 sessions the most relevant topics for project developers, investors, manufacturers and others along the solar value chain.
Boundary conditions are a key limitation in Schleswig-Holstein. The planning office has distributed 100 MW of capacity across around 80 hectares of the remaining permitted areas in a jigsaw puzzle. Cetin first discussed this plan with the mayors of the relevant municipalities.
“We're currently having a very positive experience with this,” said Cetin. “Most of them wanted to see such projects implemented in their communities and become part of the energy transition – with the economic benefits for the community as well. That's bad for the communities that are excluded from it due to state spatial planning.”
But this is not the end of this part of the planning phase. In some cases, for systems larger than 5 hectares, community-wide area concepts have to be drawn up.
“Of course, this often only happens in small communities only then when there is a project proposal,” said Cetin. “The municipality then has to commission a planner for this and often it can't find one because the resources in the planning offices are fully exhausted.”
One challenge is also, that public entities often give assignments on the basis of tender proceedings.
“But the planning offices are more than busy and have no time or interest in bidding,” Cetin said. “Once the initial hurdle land use planning process has been overcome, there are nature conservation aspects to deal with. It usually takes one year and the result often depends on the willingness of the local nature conservation authority to cooperate.”
Once a municipal council makes a decision, it could still reject a project after about two to three years of planning, without providing reasons. However, Cetin said that this rarely happens.
Normally, the entire process lasts two to three years. If the German government wants to build 150 GW of additional PV by 2030, planning procedures for 75 GW would have to be initiated by 2027 at the latest. How can this be done? This will be one of the topics of the opening session of the pv magazine Roundtables Europe 2022 on June 28 at 10:00 am.

The GEA-BEAC launched the auction in January. It had previously pre-selected 24 bidders for the procurement exercise's final phase. Overall, it allocated 1,966.4 MW of renewables in the procurement exercise. About 119.1 MW of the total was hydropower, 1.490.3 GW was large-scale solar, 374 MW was wind power, and 3.4 MW was biomass.
The main winner of the auction is Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corp. (SPNEC), which secured three PV projects with capacities of 200 MW, 280 MW, and 450 MW, in the Luzon region. It also won a 300 MW solar project in the Visayas region and a 200 MW scheme on the island of Mindanao. 
In the Luzon region, Pavi Green Renewable Energy secured a 40.4 MW PC project and Greenergy Solutions won a 99.9 MW project. However, the agency has yet to reveal the final prices in the auction.
“The winning bidders were ranked based on their offers from the lowest to the highest bid price and stacked corresponding to the respective renewable energy technology per grid,” it said, without providing additional details.
The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has set a cap price for PV technology at PHP 3.628 ($0.066)/kWh for the exercise. The cap for wind power is PHP 5.2887.
The government of the Philippines announced plans to introduce the Green Energy Tariff Program auction in February 2020.
