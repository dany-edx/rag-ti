The 49.7 kilowatt-hour thermal (kWhth) system is based on thermal storage in “packed beds” – where a heat storage medium is sealed in an insulated container. It includes heat transfer mechanisms within the system itself.
“Packed-bed sensible TESs store thermal energy by heating and cooling solid particles by means of a heat transfer fluid (HTF) that flows through the beds,” the scientists explained. “Previous studies have shown that packed-bed TESs can offer several advantages: cheap storing material; wide working temperature range; direct heat transfer between the HTF and the storing material; elevated chemical stability with limited degradation and corrosion.”
The system uses piping with four butterfly valves that enable consecutive thermal cycles, and an electrical heater and a mass flow controller to control charge and discharge. The heater relies on four individual heating units with a capacity of 15 KW per unit and can be operated independently depending on the air mass flow rate, target outlet temperature, and heating power.
“A pressure relief valve is installed upstream of the electric heater ensuring a maximum over-pressure in the piping system and TES of 0.3 bar, limiting the risks associated with the experimental setup,” the group specified, noting that the inlet air temperature and air mass flow rate are the main operational variables influencing the thermodynamic behavior of the system. “Since the TES often acts as a buffer, the air mass flow rate is likely to vary during the operations.”
A mass flow controller acts on a dedicated compressor, which in turn enables to define the air mass flow rate.

The prototype was designed to operate with an air mass flow rate of 28.7 g/s, an inlet air temperature equal to 600 C during charge and 25 C during discharge, and ambient pressure. During operation, a 2-hour charge process is followed by 20 min dwell and a 2-hour discharge phase.
The thermodynamic performance of the system was assessed considering various dynamic mass flow rate profiles during the charge phase. “The air mass flow rate has been controlled during the discharge phase in order to provide constant thermal power output for extended time periods,” the group said. “Finally, short operational cycles have been performed and assessed against base case working conditions.”
The system achieved an overall thermal efficiency of approximately 70%. During consecutive short thermal cycles, the charge efficiency decreased by around 18% and the discharge efficiency raised by 35%. The test also showed that the variable air mass flow rates during the charge process negatively affect the TES performance and that air mass flow control strategies may reduce the overall performance of the system by up to 7%.
The system is described in the paper Experimental evaluation of a high-temperature radial-flow packed bed thermal energy storage under dynamic mass flow rate, published in the Journal of Energy Storage. “Future work will assess the influence of combined dynamic charge and discharge profiles, while implementing specific improvements of the TES prototype to limit the non-uniformity of the porosity distribution within the TES, minimizing its negative impact and maximizing the TES performance,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/14/solar-power-costs-continued-to-fall-in-2021-despite-rising-panel-prices/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,INDIA,JAPAN,SPAIN,TURKEY,UKRAINE,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JULY 14, 2022","Solar power costs continued to fall in 2021, despite rising panel prices","The global average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from solar power fell 13% last year, despite the significant rise in materials costs and panel prices.
That was partly because so many of the world's large-scale solar projects have a long lead in times and contractual clauses limiting cost increases, according to a new report published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) this week. The result was a global solar electricity cost of $0.048/kWh, according to the IRENA study. China once again posted the lowest solar LCOE at $0.034/kWh in 2021, but there were notable reductions in Australia, where solar was 21% cheaper than in 2020, at $0.042/kWh. Japan, meanwhile, recorded a 17% year-on-year decline to $0.086/kWh.
India offered the world's second cheapest solar power, at $0.035/kWh, in part thanks to the world's lowest PV project costs which, at $590 per kilowatt of generation capacity installed, were 6% lower than Chinese solar farm prices. Most of the world's biggest markets saw their solar plant investment costs fall in 2021, but policy uncertainty in pre-invasion Ukraine drove up project expenses by 17%, year on year, resulting in a solar LCOE of $1.117/kWh.
Spain also saw project costs rise by 3%. That reflected the hyper-competitive, unsubsidized plants that came online in 2020, but did not appear on the same scale last year, when developments cost an average $916 per kilowatt and the LCOE was $0.048/kWh. Vietnam posted a solar LCOE of $0.046/kWh last year, with solar electricity costing $0.055 per unit of power in the United States, and $0.064 in Turkey.
The report's authors suggest the solar price rises bottled up last year are likely to feed into the market this year in the shape of 3% to 5% project cost increases – of $20 to $60 per kilowatt installed – in the world's 10 biggest solar markets. That would translate into a 2% to 4% rise worldwide for utility-scale solar and a 2% global rise in the cost of solar electricity.
The document pointed out, however, the soaring price of fossil fuels this year, in particular gas, means the solar capacity added last year – and accumulated to date – has brought huge savings. The report stated: “It remains remarkable that more effort has not been made to accelerate renewable power generation deployment in 2022, over the past nine months.”
IRENA estimated the solar capacity added last year reduced power generation costs by around $11.3 billion, compared with today's fossil fuel costs, including a $1.3 billion saving in non-OECD countries. The solar added in such nations from 2010 to last year is saving around $2.7 billion per year at today's fossil fuel prices, the report added.
For its headline figure, IRENA said almost two-thirds of the clean power generation capacity added in 2021 (some 163 GW) was installed at a lower cost than the cheapest fossil fuel-based alternative.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/14/novel-way-to-turn-solar-parks-into-agrivoltaic-facilities/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 14, 2022",Novel method to turn existing solar parks into agrivoltaic facilities,"An international research team has developed a new approach to improve land use at ground-mounted solar plants, which they claim could be used to add important wildlife habitats or even agricultural activity to land already in use by a conventional PV system.
“We initially developed our approach for existing solar plants installed in the region of Apulia in southern Italy, but it could be utilized in other regions or countries with different vegetation,” Teodoro Semeraro, an environmental scientist at Italy's University of Salento who led the research, told pv magazine.”It could also be used for new projects that include agricultural use or rooftop installations combining green roofs with solar power generation, where the agricultural aspect would have less importance.”
The approach would see new vegetated land cover cultivated below and around solar installations, as potential habitat for pollinating insects or for agricultural activities including beekeeping and medicinal herb production. This approach would provide a series of additional advantages such as reduction of maintenance costs of green areas in solar parks, fire risk reduction, potential development of small-scale agricultural activities, and positive media coverage, among others.
The scientists pointed out that the selected vegetation to be grown at the solar parks should be able to adapt to the ground's environmental conditions, water scarcity, and nutritional deficiency. “Our approach may also consider non-indigenous species, but from the point of view of the landscape and the protection of local biodiversity, the use of indigenous vegetation is desirable,” Semeraro stated. “Moreover, the local species are adapted to the climate and the lack of water, which is chronic in Apulia, so they could respond better. But, having said that, the use of non-native species is technically feasible at conditions that respond to specific project needs.”
According to the research, Beekeeping at these sites would not require invasive structures and hives could be laid on the ground during the blooming time. “The biodiversity and ecosystem services could persist over time even after ground-mounted PV systems are dismantled and continuing to support population welfare at both local and larger scale, guaranteeing sustainability,” they further explained, noting that beekeeping may help overcome the issue of monoculture, which is typical of the Apulia region.
The research listed a range of ecosystem services which solar parks could provide without additional human input, on the basis of the intrinsic value of the vegetation in sustaining ecosystem services. This would turn the solar parks into semi-natural areas, or Agro-Ecological Photovoltaic Gardens, which would host melliferous species blooming in different periods to be harvested and marketed as medicinal herbs. Furthermore, the solar panels may reduce the water stress for the vegetation, while improving soil quality thanks to their shading function.
When asked about what exactly defines agrivoltaics and make it differ from conventional ground-mounted solar facilities, Semeraro said that the crucial element is the presence of an agricultural enterprise in a project. “We cannot speak of agrivoltaics if a stakeholder in the agricultural field is not involved in the project or if there is no farm interested in the cultivation or use of the soil,” he stated. “There is a risk that a plant will be created without there being someone who cultivates it.”
The scientists introduced their approach in the study “An innovative approach to combine solar photovoltaic gardens with agricultural production and ecosystem services,” published in Ecosystem Services.
The group includes scientists from the University of Salento and the Institute of Science of Food Production C.N.R. Unit of Lecce, in Italy, as well as from the Glasgow Caledonian University in the United Kingdom.
“A transdisciplinary approach is important to share knowledge across the different stakeholders and bridge the information gaps typical of a sectoral perspective, creating a holistic vision of the involved professional skills and experiences,” the paper reads. “Its proper implementation requires the joint effort of all economic stakeholders together with technical and scientific experts to promote multifunctional land-use in ground-mounted solar farms.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/14/eco-friendly-solvent-for-a-16-7-perovskite-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 14, 2022",Eco-friendly solvent for a 16.7% perovskite solar cell,"Since their manufacture requires considerably less energy than crystalline silicon solar products, perovskite solar cells are already seen by many as part of a much greener future for the solar industry. However, The use of toxic materials in solvents is one source of environmental concerns as perovskites move closer to commercial production.
The precursor materials for the perovskite solar cell have to be dissolved in a solvent to be evenly applied to a substrate. These solvents most often contain dimethylformamide (DMF), which is toxic to humans and the environment. In production, its safe treatment and disposal would lead to increased costs for the solar cells in the end.
Scientists led by Germany’s Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden Württemberg (ZSW) searched for a material with rare of properties of being both non-toxic and suitable as an industrial solvent, settling on dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which has already been used in conjunction with other solvents in perovskite cell production, but is more challenging to use by itself.
“DMSO actually looks to be unsuitable for this coating process. It is a solvent with high surface tension and viscosity, which leaves an uneven layer deposited on the solar cell,” the group explained. “DMSO also makes it difficult to control the crystallization process, which often results in small perovskite crystals and a cell that generates less solar energy.”
The group’s experiments with DMSO are detailed in the paper One-Step Blade Coating of Inverted Double-Cation Perovskite Solar Cells from a Green Precursor Solvent, published in Applied Energy Materials.
By modifying the film formation and drying processes they were able to overcome these problems, “We used a surfactant made of silicon oxide nanoparticles to coat the perovskite solar cell and adapted the drying process,” said ZSW scientist Jan-Philipp Becker. “With these two improvements, the process now produces uniform layers with large crystallites.”
Using a blade coating process to apply the dissolved cell material to a glass substrate, the group achieved 16.7% efficiency, a strong result compared to the 16.9% it achieved using DMF as a solvent. The cells produced in this study measured 0.24 cm².
The group’s next challenge will be to demonstrate larger devices produced through the same process, and it is now targeting mini modules measuring 30 cm x 30 cm. “These new research findings are an important milestone on the path to industrial production,” said Becker. “Now we will further optimize the manufacturing process and produce larger modules.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/14/greece-to-launch-1-gw-renewables-tender-in-september/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JULY 14, 2022",Greece to launch 1 GW renewables tender in September,"It’s getting hot in Greece. The country’s energy regulator, RAE, is preparing to hold a new joint power tender on Sept. 5 for PV and wind power.
It aims to contract 1 GW of solar capacity, with a focus on systems larger than 1 MW, as well as wind projects above 60 kW in size. Energy communities will also be able to participate in the auction, said the regulator.
Stakeholders need to submit their electronic applications by Aug. 8 and hard copies of their applications by Aug. 10. By Aug. 25, the applicants will be told whether they comply with the auction criteria and are eligible to participate in the tender.
RAE has set the tender’s subscription rule at 80%. This is applicable to each technology separately, which means that for the tender to award 100 MW of PV capacity, 180 MW of solar capacity should compete for selection, for example. The 80% subscription rule ensures the competitiveness of the auction, according to RAE.
The regulator said that each technology needs to secure at least 30% of the awarded capacity. This is a new rule that probably stems from the fact that Greece’s last joint tender in May 2021 was swept by solar projects, leaving wind investors empty-handed.
Bidding will start at €54 ($55)/MWh and €63/MWh for PV and wind power systems, respectively. Winning solar projects need to link to the grid within 30 months after the auction date, while winning wind farms will need to be finished within 36 months.
Perhaps most crucially, project developers eligible to compete in the tender should have generation licenses, grid-connection agreementsm and a number of guarantee letters from Greek or foreign financial institutions, to ensure creditworthiness. Typically, such guarantee letters are issued to the RAE, but also to the grid operators when applying to connect projects. Participation in the tenders requires proof of such guarantee letters.
More tenders
Meanwhile, Greece’s Ministry of Environment and Energy (Ypen) has published a list of auctions that RAE should hold by 2024. The auctions are in line with Ypen’s previous policy mandates, as reported by pv magazine.
Apart from the upcoming tender in September, Greece also plans to hold another four competitive tenders in the last quarter of this year. They will focus on both solar and wind systems of various sizes, as well as energy storage facilities. Given that Greece’s tenders do not come with any local content requirements, the auctions will be a great investment opportunity for foreign investors active in all segments of the PV supply chain.
Ypen has listed the following tenders for the fourth quarter of this year:
In 2023, Greece will hold two joint solar and wind power tenders for 600 MW of capacity each, as well as two 100 MW tenders for small PV and wind power systems. In addition, the government will hold a tender for EEA projects for which the capacity amounts have yet to be specified. In 2024, there will be tenders for at least 500 MW of PV and wind capacity, but details about the 2024 auction will become clearer next year.
New law
The Greek parliament recently approved a new law, marking the second attempt by the government of Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to revamp the renewable energy sector. The first attempt, two years ago, involved Greece's first attempt to speed up the licensing process for renewables. This time, the government claims its new law goes further by reducing the average time needed to license large-scale renewable energy projects, from about five years down to just 14 months.
This is possible due to a number of new requirements. One of them is that the new law requires investors who apply for network connections to submit guarantee letters together with the application. In addition, developers must build their projects within three years of signing connection agreements. In practice, this means that the new law makes it impossible for undecided investors to hold onto connection agreements and other licenses forever, which blocks other projects and investors who are ready to move ahead.
The same rationale applies throughout the new law, which sets specific deadlines for the implementation of projects. It focuses on every stage of the licencing process and project development. Investors who do not comply with the set deadlines will be given hefty penalties or they will be eliminated from the process altogether.
Ypen has also introduced a new digital portal that brings all licenses together under a so-called “one-stop shop” that electronically links Ypen and investors to all Greek institutions. Greece’s new law is a complete revamp of the energy sector, including a new framework for the licensing of energy storage facilities and a special provision allowing the development of 10 floating PV pilots under a fast-track licensing process that excludes floating projects from participating in competitive tenders.

The researchers said the results represent a world record for tandem PV devices. They attributed the improvements to the performance of the perovskite top cell.
They built the 1-square-centimeter perovskite device using a transparent conductive made of indium tin oxide (ITO), which was deposited via sputtering and without thermally evaporated Molybdenum oxides ( MoOx).
“By eliminating the use of the MoOx buffer layer, we were able to develop semi-transparent PVK cells with higher durability and transmittance,” the scientists said.
The cell achieved a maximum efficiency of 19.5% and a certified efficiency of 19.3%.
“The effect of ion bombardment during ITO sputtering on widely used spiro-OMeTAD was not detrimental to the device performance, whereas it improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) owing to the better band alignment caused by oxidation of the HTL,” the researchers explained.
The four-terminal tandem cell, which could be used for rooftop and BIPV applications, was built with a bottom cell CIGS cell that the scientists had previously developed, with an initial overall efficiency of 26.2%.
The Japanese group described the cell in “Semi-transparent Perovskite Solar Cells for Four-Terminal Perovskite/CIGS Tandem Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.
“By developing this work and continuing research on further improvement of conversion efficiency, it is possible to realize lightweight flexible solar cells exceeding 30%,” they said.
InJune, researchers from Wuhan University in China revealed that they had developed a four-junction tandem solar cell based on perovskite and CIGS with a conversion efficiency of 25.5%.

“The inauguration ceremony marks the start of the two-year test period, which will run until 2024,” the companies said in a joint statement. “Hydrogen gas and its storage are central to our transition.”
The SEK 200 million ($18.8 million) Hybrit pilot facility is owned in three equal parts by the three companies. It is expected to start storing green hydrogen later this year.
The 100-cubic-meter lined rock cavern (LRC) was built approximately 30 meters below ground via the so-called lined rock cavern (LRC) approach. Under LRC methods, the walls of caverns are covered with a sealing layer.
“At a later stage, a full-scale hydrogen gas storage facility measuring 100,000 to 120,000 cubic meters may be required, in which case it will be able to store up to 100 GWh of electricity converted to hydrogen gas, which is sufficient to supply a full-sized sponge iron factory for three to four days,” the companies said.

“In four years, Hybrit technology will be used on a large scale in the first demonstration plant in Gällivare, and the plan is to then build more sponge iron factories,” said Lars Ydreskog, senior vice president of strategic projects for LKAB.
A recent study by the Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-3) showed that salt caverns offer a flexible, efficient option for hydrogen storage. The research group estimates that Europe has the technical potential to store 84.8 PWh of hydrogen in bedded salt deposits and salt domes.
The IEK-3 researchers said the proximity of the caverns to the Swedish coast will be helpful, as brine disposal remains economical up to 50 km from the sea.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/14/shipping-costs-remain-key-challenge-for-solar-sector/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 14, 2022",Shipping costs remain key challenge for solar sector,"New figures from Dutch financial services provider Rabobank shows that ocean container shipping costs have fallen from a record-breaking high in September 2021. However, they are still up to five times higher than in 2019 and the banking group has warned that it does not see a return to pre-pandemic lows on the horizon.
Driven by pandemic-related disruptions, international container freight rates have increased dramatically since January 2019, reaching a record price of nearly $10,400 in September 2021. In June 2022, the global freight rate index stood at almost $7,100.
The higher freight costs and supply-chain disruptions are affecting all industries, but solar PV is one of the most effected due to the high concentration of solar panel manufacturing in China. The elevated freight costs and shipping constraints are also affecting other system components like trackers, inverters, and batteries.
Rabobank says in its “Global Ocean Freight Outlook” that container freight prices will continue to gradually decline over the next 12 months from the “irrational” highs reached late last year. However, it said it does not expect them to return to pre-pandemic lows.
Viet Nguyen, a RaboResearch global supply chain analyst, said that shipping container prices were “never” expected to return to the low pre-pandemic rates of approximately $3,000 per container. However, Nguyen predicted they would decline from the current level of $7,000 to $78,000 per container mark in the year ahead.
Nguyen said several global “macro drivers” are influencing shipping dynamics. While heightened inflation and all-time low global consumer confidence levels are exerting downward pressure on ocean rates, Nguyen said rates are being supported at higher levels by imbalanced global trade flows, which hinder a cost-effective repositioning of empty containers.
“Added to this, geographical uncertainties are adding risks and there are also growing operational costs for the sector from higher energy costs and sustainability regulations,” he said.
While shipping rates are forecast to soften, Rabobank expects schedule reliability for containers to also recover, albeit slowly. Port congestion, a major contributor to the continuing supply disruptions, is forecast to remain at key ports until the first half of next year.

Energy Toolbase has launched a new partnership with Sustainable Capital Finance, giving it the ability to instantly generate power purchase agreement (PPA) financing quotes for commercial, industrial, and non-profit solar projects.
The PPA generator tool joins the company’s ETB Developer platform and is designed for projects above 100 kW in size. The modeling platform allows developers to create accurate and transparent models of the avoided cost of solar and energy storage projects. Users can configure any type of project financing solution, including cash purchases, PPAs, leases, or loans. 
Alongside ETB Developer’s financing integration feature, developers can generate complete financing quotes that integrate avoided costs and project cash flows. The tool brings the workflow of generating an indicative quote to one platform, avoiding the burden of jumping from platform to platform.
Sustainable Capital Finance is a third-party financier that works directly with solar developers and end users to provide PPAs for commercial, non-profit, and municipal projects. The company also develops projects in more than 18 states and has partnerships with over 200 engineering, procurement, and construction companies.
“To provide a financing option within the platform that serves a sector that has previously had very few financing options will be a game-changer for our userbase,” said Matt Cimo, manager of platform sales at Energy Toolbase.
Joel Binstock, manager of origination and partnerships at Sustainable Capital Finance, added that the collaboration will standardize financing for solar and storage.
Binstock and Cimo will host a webinar for the new tool on Aug. 10 at 3:00 p.m. (EST). A 14-day free trial through the ETB Developer tool is available now.
