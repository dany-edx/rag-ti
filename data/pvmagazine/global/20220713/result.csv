Iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest’s private company, Squadron Energy, has started building the AUD 3 billion ($2.03 billion) Clarke Creek renewable energy precinct.
It launched the project with a ground-breaking ceremony at the site, which has been described as Australia’s largest grid-connected renewable energy project. The Clarke Creek project comprises an 800 MW wind farm and up to 400 MW of solar installations. It will also include a battery energy storage facility of unspecified size, although there have been reports that Squadron is looking at installing up to 2 GWh of battery storage at the site.
The project, which is being developed across 76,300 hectares about 150 kilometers northwest of Rockhampton in central Queensland, will be delivered in two stages. Stage one, which is now under construction, will comprise 450 MW of wind capacity by 2025.
Squadron has already signed a supply deal with Queensland government-owned energy generator Stanwell Corp. for most of the output of the first stage of the project. Stanwell has inked a 346.5MW Power Purchase Agreement as part of a 15-year commitment to the project.
Stage two of the Clarke Creek project will include the remainder of the wind generation capacity and an expected 400 MW solar farm teamed with a grid-scale battery energy storage system. Squadron said the precinct could produce enough wind, solar and battery energy to power more than 660,000 homes equivalent to approximately 40% of Queensland households and will export lower cost electricity directly into the National Electricity Market (NEM).
The start of construction on the project comes just days after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) outlined its vision for the next 30 years of the NEM. Its plans include the massive investment required to transition from fossil fuels to firmed renewables.

The results, confirmed by the State Key Laboratory of PV Science and Technology in China, represents a world record for this cell type, according to the company. In August 2021, the cell still had an efficiency of 23.5%, which means that it has gained one percentage point in less than 12 months.
The company said the increase in efficiency could be attributed to the development of advanced technologies such as multilayer anti-reflection, ultra-fine metallization fingers and super multi-busbar (MBB).
“PERC is a very mature industrial technology with the lowest cost,” said Yifeng Chen, head of Trina Solar's high efficiency cell and module r&d center.
In March, Trina also set a new world record efficiency of 25.5% for its 210 mm × 210 mm monocrystalline n-type i-TOPCon solar cell. The result was certified by the National Institute of Metrology of China.

The Rise project, backed by REC's Singapore and French divisions and the French government, is one of 17 clean tech plans that will share €1.8 billion ($1.8 billion) of European public money via the EU Innovation Fund.
REC Solar, which was acquired by Indian energy company Reliance Industries last year, has previously claimed the 2 GW per year of HJT modules to be made in the fab will boast a conversion efficiency of more than 22.5%, rising to 26% by 2030. Details of the grant application for EU funding stated that the panels would have 90% bifaciality, feature G12 wafers, and be compatible with future HJT-perovskite tandem technology.
The modules can generate electricity 5% to 10% cheaper than current mainstream mono Perc technology and will be made in a renewables-powered factory using thinner silicon and wafers, according to REC. The products will also feature recycled silicon sludge material created during wafer cutting, known as kerf.
The grant decision did not specify where in France the gigafactory will be built and the EU announcement of the awards, made this week, did not specify how much individual applicants had secured. The Rise project, supported by the French government's nuclear and alternative energy department – the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives – can expect funding to be paid after projects nail down their grant details in the final three months of the year.
The Innovation Fund is financed by income from the EU's emissions trading system for industrial carbon allowances. Awards were also made to battery storage projects in France and Poland.
Swedish battery company Northvolt won backing for production lines for its Voltainer product, to be manufactured in Gdansk and Tczew, in Poland.
The Voltainer will contain a higher nickel content in its nickel, manganese, and cobalt (NMC) chemistry and will be 16.9% to 18.8% cheaper per kilowatt-hour of storage capacity than current short-term storage devices, according to Northvolt.
The battery company said more than 90% “of the value of” the product's components and equipment would come from the “European supply chain,” with the company's Stockholm facilities also involved. Back in France, miner and metallurgical business Eramat SA has secured EU support for what it described as a “first-of-the-kind black mass recycling unit” at a battery cluster at Dunkirk.
The proposed plant would be able to recover the black mass raw material – a powder made from crushing the electrode-containing parts of dead batteries – from 50,000 tons of scrap per year, according to Eramat.
Announcing the awards from the Innovation Fund's second call for projects, the EU said “up to 20” other projects not yet mature enough to qualify for grants would be pre-selected for help from EU lender the European Investment Bank with developing their plans.
Projects which applied unsuccessfully for grants in the most recent call can reapply, with a €3 billion or so third call for projects due in the “autumn,” the EU added.

During the 45-minute session, Samira Jama Aden, Architect Design Research at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin’s BAIP consultancy for BIPV, and Teodosio del Caño, CTO at Onyx Solar, joined us for a panel discussion on building solar cities and structures; while Jan Mastny, Head of Sales at Studer Cables held a presentation on the five myths of PV projects.
Alexander Telje, Chief Commercial Officer at Ocean Sun; Philipp Sinn, CEO of Sinn Power; Nathanaël Kasriel, Chief of staff to the CEO at France Agrivoltaïsme; and Andrea Viaro, Head of Sales EMEA Renewable Energy at Stäubli Electrical Connectors also contributed to the discussions.
Themes addressed during the Solar Everywhere session were:
As session 7 of the Roundtables demonstrated, it is an exciting time in PV cell and module manufacturing, as the switch to high performance n-type technologies gathers pace.
In addition to looking at silicon PV manufacturing trends in 2022, high Efficiency HJT at scale, a panel of four experts – Nicolas Chouleur Partner at Everoze; Roberto Murgioni, Head of Technical Service & Product Management at JinkoSolar Europe; George Touloupas, Senior Director of Technology and Quality for Solar and Storage at Clean Energy Associates (CEA); and Edurne Zoco, Executive Director at IHS Markit – discussed why now is the time for n-type to go big.
Molly Morgan, Research Analyst at Exawatt and Po-Chuan Yang, General Manager, HJT BU at Risen Energy also contributed to the discussions.
Themes discussed were:
Buyers of PV modules must decide between different design options in addition to evaluating other product specifications. At the beginning of session 8, Longi Solar shared its argument on module sizes. Where there is an optimum size, the manufacturer saysthe best is not the largest option available, as disadvantages prevail when modules exceed a certain size.
The panel then went on to discuss how to best assess and select modules, and manufacturer design choices in times of supply chain restrictions. Djaber Berrian, PV Innovation and Design Engineer at EPC Belectric explained how they deal with the uncertainties resulting from the PAN-file data, which are needed for yield prognosis, and how the evaluation can depend on the choice of key performance indicators such as LCOE, ROI or net present value. He was joined by Jason Yan from Longi Solar along with the engineers and consultants from the Austrian Institute of Technology and PI Berlin.
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are capable of unlocking huge swathes of development and providing a big push to Europe’s decarbonization. However, with the risk of ‘revenue cannibalization’ set to increase as more and more solar energy is generated at the same time, and curtailment already an issue in mature markets, how can these unsubsidized power purchase agreements adapt and evolve to meet the market’s renewable energy appetite?
Session 9 of the pv magazine Roundtables Europe zeroed in on the shape that offtake contracts and trading will take, how risks will be shared in the future and what it means for development.
Our panelists – Helen Dewhurst, Sustainability Analyst at BloombergNEF, Simone Rodolfi, Head of Origination & Business Development at Axpo Italia, Marc Oman, Principal, Energy & Infrastructure at Google, and Andy Sommer, Head of Fundamental Analysis & Modelling at Axpo Solutions – discussed their views of emerging trends in mature PPA markets, particularly the growing appetite for risk in solar investment and the reasons behind it.
The final session of day 2 focused on the determining conditions for solar-plus-storage and solar-plus-hydrogen business models, which will be realized in the next decade, are developing now.
Which business models for solar hydrogen production will work? And how will the political decisions made in the last year, particularly in the EU, and the cost forecast for electrolysers affect solar-plus-electrolyzer-and industrial decarbonization projects? Find out below:
The experts were: Giovanni Buogo, Western Europe Sales Director at Solis, Alena Fargere, Principal at Swen Capital Partners, Wilhelm Löwenhielm, Director ESS Business Area at Northvolt, Christian Pho Duc, CTO & Managing Director H2 Projects at Smartenergy, James Quinn CEO of Faradion, Max Reid, Research Analyst at Wood Mackenzie, and Paulo Rocha, Director Innovation and Sustainability at CIMPOR.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/13/new-method-to-evaluate-performance-lcoe-of-elevated-agrivoltaics/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 13, 2022","New method to evaluate performance, LCOE of elevated agrivoltaics","Researchers from the Electrical Energy Systems and Applications (ELECTA) division of KU Leuven in Belgium have developed a geospatial methodology to estimate the optimal ground coverage ratio (GCR) of elevated agrivoltaic systems on arable land in the European Union.
The GCR describes the ratio of the PV system area to the overall area of the array and arable land. This currently stands at around 28% of Europe, and is defined as all land in which there are temporary field crops and pastures.
The proposed method involves four different steps. First, it uses environmental, climate and agricultural parameters to segment a given area into small sections and then it defines the PV system and crop type. In the third step, it provides the dimensioning of the PV system based on the local climatic parameters and desired crop light level. Lastly, it estimates key performance indicators such as energy yield, levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and the benefits in comparison with separated production.
The scientists applied this methodology to three different crop types – shade-tolerant crops like potatoes and sugar beets and shade-intolerant crops like maize.
“The GCR significantly changes related to the chosen shade tolerance of the crop,” the scientists explained, noting that a higher shade tolerance and higher GCR results in a higher energy production rate per unit of land. “Consequently, caution should be taken in the field crop rotation system: a fixed agrivoltaic system (with fixed GCR) will need every year a crop with similar light requirements.”
The researchers said low light requirements and high PV density will result in a higher LCOE.
“Agrivoltaic installations are financially more attractive and competitive for shade-loving crops (like leafy vegetables), leading to a risk that farmers will shift their production system and less shade-intolerant crops will be cultivated,” they explained.
The scientists singled out potato cultivation, which currently covers around 1% of Europe's available agricultural area, mostly in countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland and Romania. They said potatoes could be a potential driver for agrivoltaic growth, with the potential for around 1,290 GW of PV capacity. They said that elevated systems with larger coverage ratios may be more suitable for southern European countries, due to high solar radiation levels.
The also warned policymakers to establish guidelines on the maximum PV ground coverage ratio before implementing agrivoltaic support schemes.
“The absolute technical potential (MWp) is many times higher and mainly impacted by the existing cultivated area of a specific crop type where permanent grassland and cereals have the largest share,” they said. “Nevertheless, important challenges remain to be addressed in terms of research on crop growth (modeling) and clear policy implementation guidelines.”
The researchers described their geospatial methodology in “Geospatial assessment of elevated agrivoltaics on arable land in Europe to highlight the implications on design, land use and economic level” which was recently published in Energy Reports.

The scientists said their “market potential method” can be used to simultaneously analyze multiple energy storage systems. “We show that current cost metrics can be misleading for technology design decisions,” they said. “A narrow cost focus on designing energy storage is not enough.”
The researchers stressed the importance of discovering the “hidden values” of storage technologies. They said network or peak plant deferral, or reduced solar and wind power plant curtailments, are hidden variables that are often neglected in storage cost analysis.
They apply their method in two phases. It initially focuses on a market potential indicator (MPI) and then defines market potential criteria to support design decisions.
“The MPI is not a new metric,” the scientists said. “It is a result of energy system models that analyze scenarios in future energy systems and describes the total quantity of a particular storage technology in a cost minimized electricity system.”
The scientists used the new approach to look at how different hydrogen storage technologies could be adopted across several European markets. They found that technologies with high or low levelized costs of storage (LCOS) could have good market potential.
“Not always a technology with the lowest investment or LCOS is most valuable,” they said. “It can also be the more expensive technology that can lead to a cheaper future electricity system.”
They described their findings in “Beyond cost reduction: improving the value of energy storage in electricity systems,” which was recently published in Carbon Neutrality. The research group includes scientists from the University of Edinburgh, Technische Universität Berlin, and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).
The team said the “market potential method” could help to identify potential growth markets, assess future cost reductions, and reduce the structural uncertainty of linear programming energy system models.
“The results suggest looking beyond the pure cost reduction paradigm and focus on developing technologies with suitable value approaches that can lead to cheaper electricity systems in future,” they said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/13/indias-emmvee-eyes-early-mover-advantage-with-wafer-to-module-production/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 13, 2022",India’s Emmvee eyes wafer-to-module production,"From pv magazine India
pv magazine: Has the imposition of the basic customs duty (BCD) been successful in boosting demand for India-made solar cells and modules?
Suhas Donthi: We are yet to benefit from this initiative. There has been no significant increase in the demand for domestic modules in the last three months. The duty-free period of nine months in the last fiscal year has allowed the EPC and project developers to procure the modules in advance to fulfill their ongoing project needs. New requirements will flow in only after developers clear their existing stock.
India had an installed PV module production capacity of around 12 GW in fiscal 2021-22. Module imports during the fiscal year exceeded 25 GW, out of which the nation imported a major junk of around 10 GW in the last quarter (January-March).
India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme will promote backward-integrated solar manufacturing in India. How do you see the market for manufacturers with or without cell capacity?  
It is too early to comment on the likely impact of the PLI scheme. As far as Emmvee is concerned, we plan to set up 1.5 GW of wafer-to-module capacity within the next 18 months. Setting up such a capacity requires a significant investment. Also, various parameters must be met, such as water requirements, technology adoption, upgradability to future technology, environmental conditions, skilled workforce, and extensive support from the government. 
Emmvee is a three-decade-old solar company. We believe our experience is going to give us that additional advantage. We plan to invest in equipment that are upgradable for future technology and larger wafer size.
An early mover advantage will also help in cost and technology competition. 
Overall, we see it as a positive trend. Indian players depend on imports for every stage of backward integrated solar manufacturing. Wafer-to-module manufacturing will enhance the sector and reduce this dependency. There will be more such players entering this model. Eventually, we hope to see a truly self-reliant India (atmanirbhar Bharat) with the entire supply chain being locally established to reach our energy goals.
India will have a considerable cell capacity of nearly 10 GW in the next two years. This will be a major contributor to domestic module manufacturing. It will help largely in restructuring the module market and pricing structures. The market will remain favorable to the module manufacturers with or without cell capacity at least for a decade. 
Module cost will largely reduce when going for wafer-to-module production. Manufacturers in this space will gain the early entrant advantage compared to polysilicon-to-module manufacturers under the PLI scheme. Down the line, many cell and module manufacturers will also try to adopt newer technology as it matures.
Shortages of raw materials, as well as supply chain disruptions, continue to affect module manufacturers. Do you see things settling down this year?
The situation since 2020 has not been favorable to the industry with respect to the supply chain. The pandemic, geopolitical issues, inflation, and other macroeconomic issues have time and again disrupted the market, which is unprecedented and unpredictable. 
We hope to see things settling down for the betterment. Foresight and stable policies aiming to localize the supply chain are essential to curb such issues. We must look into creating manufacturing hubs that can not only cater to the Indian market but also make India an export hub for solar.
What are the module trends in the Indian market regarding consumer demand? How are manufacturers responding to that?
Mono PERC is currently the workhorse of the global solar industry. The achievable module efficiency can be as high as 23%. Focusing more on the mono PERC-based higher watt-peak products has become the new industry trend. 
The demand in the Indian market is very well aligned with the global technology trends. There is a strong demand for both monofacial and bifacial modules based on their suitability for the intended application.
Given the trend toward HJT and TopCon, how long will mono PERC continue to be the mainstay for Indian manufacturers? 
Mono PERC is a matured technology and will continue to be the industry’s workhorse. 
The majority of the global manufacturing lines are based on mono PERC technology. Adapting to TOPCon technology is cheaper and easier as it requires only a few additional equipment and process steps.
So, following PERC, TOPCon will be the major technology in India as PERC-based manufacturing plants can be upgraded to TOPCon. Thus, TOPCon offers lifecycle extensions for PERC production lines. 
Most of the new plants coming up in India are based on PERC with upgradability for TOPCon due to its low setup cost per gigawatt plant.  HJT technology offers higher achievable efficiency, but it needs capex and opex optimization before it can compete with TOPCon. On the other hand, TOPCon requires technology (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition) and opex cost fine-tuning for mass adaptability by the market.
HJT is currently at a disadvantage compared to TOPCon technology as adaptability to HJT from the current mono PERC requires a significant investment in the equipment (especially the front-end). Also, opex on HJT is quite higher than for TOPCon. And the efficiency difference between TOPCon and HJT is not high enough to offset the additional cost of investment and opex.
Moreover, the new emerging technology of TOPCon Rear Emitter (TOPCoRE) offers an efficiency comparable to HJT. It is also upgradable from the TOPCon technology.
The Indian solar industry itself is 15 years old on an average. The industry saw a boom only after 2011. More than 70% of the plants in India are less than ten years old. PERC technology is widely adopted across India. The last few years have not been great for the Indian module manufacturers. And most of the manufacturing plants in India are not utilized to their total capacity. 
So, mono PERC will continue to be the leading solar technology in India at least for the next three to five years before new technologies like TOPCon and HJT are adopted. At Emmvee, we have module lines upgradeable to TOPCon. 
Almost all players in India are coming up with 500 W-plus modules. What are your plans? 
Today, as Emmvee celebrates 30 years of presence in the solar industry, we are proud to house 1.25 GW of a high-quality manufacturing facility in Karnataka. The facility is equipped to produce up to 680 Wp mono-facial and bifacial modules with cell sizes of up to 220 mm.  
We have already signed an agreement with the state government of Karnataka to invest INR 1,000 crore into setting up new facilities at Dobaspet, Karnataka. These facilities will increase our module capacity to 3 GW and produce 1.5 GW of cells. We expect to create at least 1,000 direct jobs through this investment.

For hydrogen production, they considered a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and an alkaline electrolyzer, with installed capacities of 100 MW each. A large-scale heat pump and a heat exchanger were added to the system to integrate the waste heat into the DH network. The system simultaneously provides cooling to the electrolyzer stack, thus reducing the operational costs of the electrolyzer. 
“The results showed that 203 060 MWhth can be extracted from the PEM electrolyzer with a waste heat temperature of 79 C, while 171 770 MWhth can be integrated on the DH network annually,” the scientists explained.
The overall system efficiency of PEM- and alkaline-connected systems is 94.7% and 88.4%, respectively.
“The alkaline connected system primarily encounters higher losses in terms of heat than a PEM connected system which is why the efficiency is lower,” researcher Andrea Miljanovic told pv magazine. “For the alkaline connected system, this means that 88.4 % of the total input energy to the system is useful.”
The levelized cost of heat (LCOH) is SEK 0.218 ($0.021)/kWhth and SEK 0.23/kWhth for PEM- and alkaline-connected systems, respectively. For future scenarios with the fourth generation of DH networks, it is predicted that the LCOH can reach SEK 0.018/kWth for a PEM electrolyzer system, and SEK 0.017/kWth for an alkaline electrolyzer.
“Our results can be used as a guidance for other DH operators with different DH temperatures,” Miljanovic explained. “Our sensitivity results indicate that the LCOH is reduced when supply temperatures in the DH network are lower than the current ones in Luleå. This means that lower supply temperatures imply lower LCOH.”
Miljanovic said that lower supply temperatures mean that a smaller heat pump could be used.
“For a fourth generation of DH-network (with supply temperatures below 80 C) a heat pump would in fact not be required at all which reduces the LCOH significantly.” 
She said that the LCOH of the produced heat is site-specific, as the experiment has been adapted to the DH network temperatures in Luleå.
“Our results can still be used as a guidance for other DH operators regardless of their DH-temperatures,” said Miljanovic.
The researchers described their findings in “Utilization of waste heat from hydrogen production: A case study on the Botnia Link H2 Project in Luleå, Sweden.” The study was conducted in cooperation with ABB Sweden and Luleå Energi for the Botnia Link H2 project.

Norwegian oil giant Equinor has signed an agreement to buy East Point Energy LLC, a privately owned storage provider based in Charlottesville, Virginia. East Point Energy currently has a 4.1 GW pipeline of early- to mid-stage battery storage projects.
“The acquisition of East Point Energy represents Equinor’s entry into the US power market through flexible assets. It will enable Equinor to further unlock the potential we see in the renewables space in the US, capturing value from volatility in the power markets and providing reliable services to the grid,” said Olav Kolbeinstveit, senior vice president for power and markets within renewables at Equinor.
Battery storage is key to Equinor’s strategy of supporting its portfolio of offshore wind, upstream oil and gas, as well as future opportunities in the hydrogen and renewables space. In 2021, Equinor invested in Noriker Power Ltd., a battery storage developer in the United Kingdom. Equinor sees these acquisitions as key to “lifting the return on our renewable portfolio while at the same time lowering the portfolio risk.”
East Point Energy will become a subsidiary of Equinor with its team will continue to develop the business, as well as adding capabilities to own and operate energy storage projects in the near future.
“We look forward to working together with East Point Energy to build a portfolio of battery storage assets in the US. This strengthens and diversifies our existing renewable energy offerings in the US, which includes substantial offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind,” said Siri Espedal Kindem, senior vice president for Equinor Renewables US.

They usually promise to retain 80% to 90% of their initial performance by the end of this period.
However, there are still mechanisms and interactions at work between tiny particles within a PV module. And understanding them will be key to developing cells that can generate more electricity for an even longer period. Scientists led by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) looked at the role of UV light in some of these mechanisms, and found that in many of the latest cell designs, UV could be to blame for significant performance losses.
“Historically, the harmful effects of UV radiation have largely been associated with the aging of module packaging materials and have led to encapsulant discoloration, delamination, and backsheet cracking,” the group said. “Solar cell performance is also adversely affected by UV radiation through the generation of surface defects.”
Within a silicon solar cell, the UV light can cause damage to the passivation layers, to the silicon beneath, and at the interface between the two. The researchers tested a range of silicon cell designs under long-term exposure to UV light, to better understand damage that they could suffer in the field.
“Understanding the damaging effects of UV radiation in emerging silicon solar cell technologies will enable the identification of the underlying mechanisms that may affect both the power output and durability of modules,” they said.
They described their findings in “UV-induced degradation of high-efficiency silicon PV modules with different cell architectures,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. Testing p-type PERC, n-type PERT, heterojunction and interdigitated back-contact cells, the group calculated average and maximum degradation rates of 0.12% per year and 0.73% per year, respectively, based on a module containing a UV-transmitting encapsulant. They also found that with bifacial cells, the rear side was more susceptible to UV induced damage.
The group noted several different mechanisms triggered by the UV that can cause damage to cells. The problem is largely related to the breakdown of hydrogen bonds that reduced the quality of the passivation layer.
They suggested a range of strategies to reduce such damage. Additives to the module encapsulant material could block UV wavelengths from reaching the cell, and low- cost materials are available to do this. However, the group warns that this could involve some discoloration of the encapsulant, resulting in initial performance losses.
Glass coatings are another way to block UV light from reaching the cell, but they require the design of a multifunctional coating material with anti-reflective and anti-soiling properties. Coatings on the front of the cell itself could also reduce UV damage.
With an average 11% power loss after 2,000 hours of UV exposure, heterojunction cells appeared to be the most vulnerable to UV damage. But the group said that more work would be needed to draw this conclusion.
“The most durable among high-efficiency cell technologies (HJ, IBC, PERC, or PERT) remains to be proven for a wide variety of makes and models of cells,” they said.

The new net billing system replaced the net metering scheme that was in force since 2016. Net metering has been the main market driver for the segment over the past five years.
Under the old net metering rules, owners of PV systems with capacities up to 10 kW could inject up to 80% of their power into the grid, while PV systems ranging in size from 10 kW to 50 kW were allowed to feed up to 70% of their electricity into the grid.
But under the new net billing rules, prosumers have to prepare a bill that includes the energy they generated. The price is then calculated according to a special model related to the price of a kilowatt-hour during so-called “day-ahead trading.” However, the net-billing model will be in a transitional stage until 2024.
The new net billing provisions also state that PV system owners who submitted correct grid-connection applications by March 31 will be given access to the country's rebate scheme, Mój Prąd (My Electricity) scheme launched in July 2019, for the next 15 years.
“The move away from net-metering at the end of March, coupled with changes to subsidy program Mój Prąd, resulted in a significant drop in residential micro-installations,” Marcin Ślęzak, chief commercial officer for Menlo Electric, told pv magazine. “The slowdown in this segment exceeded even the most conservative estimates – the decrease in new sales between March and April was as high as 70% for some installers.”
He said that because of the new rules, several important players in the Polish PV sector currently face significant financial losses. However, this situation is only temporary, as higher energy prices may jolt the residential segment into life, he said.
“A new type of player is poised to benefit the most from this upcoming growth wave – PV installers that had been acquired by major energy groups prior to the scheme change,” he said, in reference to several recent M&A transactions. “Their new affiliation allows them to broaden their offering, coupling PV installation with multi-year guaranteed-price energy contracts and pioneering solar-as-a-service model.”
Ślęzak said that the Polish market will experience an increase in demand for PV panels in the second half of the year. He predicted that module prices will converge to West European benchmarks and panel availability may face disruption.
Researchers recently described the the risk of a market slowdown under the new net billing regime in “The importance and potential of photovoltaics in the context of low-carbon development in Poland,” which was recently published in Energy Storage and Saving.
“It should be noticed that the main threats that may hinder the current dynamic development of photovoltaics in Poland are changes in the law and the reduction of financial support,” the report said, in reference to the rooftop PV segment. “The main legal problem pointed out by experts was the change in the method of settling unused electricity by the prosumer, with the simultaneous lack of solutions supporting investments in home energy storage.”
The researchers claimed that incentives for residential storage systems could also support solar demand in the residential and commercial segments.
“Based on the available energy storage technologies, the photovoltaic installation can be retrofitted with a set of batteries, which will enable increased self-consumption of energy at the place of its generation without the need to burden the power grid,” they said.

The Desert to Power G5 Sahel grouping of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger have secured a $300 million commitment by the publicly funded Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) to back their participation in the 10 GW plan. Announcing the development last week, however, project backer the African Development Bank (AfDB) indicated that the PIDG pledge was indicative and non-binding.
The Desert to Power initiative was announced by the AfDB in 2018. It aims to install 10 GW of solar power capacity plus energy storage across 11 nations in the Sahel, also including Eritrea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan, Djibouti, and Senegal.
The project organizers have stressed the need to attract private-sector backing for the plan, having secured initial pledges from the G-7 group of leading industrialized nations and with a further $150 million promised by the UN's Green Climate Fund in October. The latest funding promise came on the margins of the Africa Energy Forum in Brussels in June.
However, PIDG is funded by International Finance Corp.p – the private-sector arm of the World Bank – and the governments of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia, Sweden, and Germany.
PIDG's financial commitment is specifically for a funding facility that aims to help the G5 Sahel nations develop 500 MW of new solar and offer electricity to around 4 million people. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimated the G5 Sahel countries had 278 MW of grid solar capacity between them at the end of 2021, but Mali was the only one to add new capacity during the year.
